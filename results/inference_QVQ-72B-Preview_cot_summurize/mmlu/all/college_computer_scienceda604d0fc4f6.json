                    "text": "So I have this problem here. Bob writes down a number between 1 and 1,000, and Mary has to figure out what that number is by asking Bob yes-or-no questions. The key points are:\n\n- Bob always tells the truth.\n\n- Mary uses an optimal strategy.\n\n- We need to find out how many questions she will definitely need in the worst-case scenario to identify the number.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what an \"optimal strategy\" means in this context. In terms of yes-or-no questions, the optimal strategy is usually binary search or some form of divide-and-conquer approach. That is, each question should ideally split the remaining possibilities in half.\n\nSo, if Mary can halve the possible range of numbers with each question, then the maximum number of questions she would need is the smallest integer n such that 2^n >= 1,000.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nWe know that:\n\n2^10 = 1,024\n\n2^9 = 512\n\nSo, 2^9 = 512 is less than 1,000, and 2^10 = 1,024 is greater than 1,000.\n\nTherefore, Mary would need 10 questions to cover all numbers from 1 to 1,000.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure this makes sense.\n\nIf she asks 10 questions, she can distinguish between up to 1,024 different numbers, which covers 1,000 numbers perfectly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about how binary search would work here.\n\nSuppose Bob picks a number between 1 and 1,000.\n\nMary's first question could be: \"Is the number less than or equal to 500?\"\n\nIf Bob says \"yes,\" then the number is between 1 and 500.\n\nIf \"no,\" then it's between 501 and 1,000.\n\nNow, in either case, the range is reduced to 500 numbers.\n\nBut wait, 500 is not a power of 2. The closest power of 2 is 512, which is 2^9.\n\nBut in binary search, we try to split as evenly as possible.\n\nSo, in the first question, instead of asking \"is it less than or equal to 500,\" maybe it's better to ask \"is it less than or equal to 500?\" since 500 is the midpoint of 1,000.\n\nWait, 500 is exactly half of 1,000, so it's perfect.\n\nAfter the first question, the range is reduced to 500 numbers.\n\nThen, the second question would be: \"Is the number less than or equal to 250?\" if the first answer was \"yes,\" or \"is it less than or equal to 750?\" if the first answer was \"no.\"\n\nWait, no. Actually, if the first answer is \"yes,\" meaning the number is between 1 and 500, then the second question would be \"is the number less than or equal to 250?\" to split the 500 numbers into 250 and 250.\n\nSimilarly, if the first answer is \"no,\" meaning the number is between 501 and 1,000, then the second question would be \"is the number less than or equal to 750?\" but that wouldn't help because 750 is outside the range.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nActually, in binary search, after the first question, if the number is between 1 and 500, then the next question should be \"is the number less than or equal to 250?\" to split the range into 250 and 250.\n\nSimilarly, if the number is between 501 and 1,000, then the next question should be \"is the number less than or equal to 750?\" which would split the range into 250 (501-750) and 250 (751-1,000).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 750 is not the midpoint of 501 and 1,000.\n\nThe midpoint of 501 and 1,000 is 750.5, but since we're dealing with integers, it would be 750.\n\nSo, in that case, if the first answer is \"no,\" meaning the number is between 501 and 1,000, then the second question should be \"is the number less than or equal to 750?\" which would split the range into 250 numbers (501-750) and 250 numbers (751-1,000).\n\nThen, after two questions, the range is down to 250 numbers.\n\nContinuing this way, each question would halve the remaining possibilities.\n\nSo, starting with 1,000 possibilities:\n\n- After 1 question: 500 possibilities\n\n- After 2 questions: 250 possibilities\n\n- After 3 questions: 125 possibilities\n\n- After 4 questions: 62.5, but since we can't have half, it's 62 or 63\n\n- After 5 questions: approximately 31 possibilities\n\n- After 6 questions: approximately 15 possibilities\n\n- After 7 questions: approximately 7 possibilities\n\n- After 8 questions: approximately 3 possibilities\n\n- After 9 questions: approximately 1 or 2 possibilities\n\n- After 10 questions: the number is identified.\n\nSo, in the worst case, Mary would need 10 questions to identify the number.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nWe know that in the binary search approach, each question reduces the search space by about half.\n\nGiven that 2^10 = 1,024, which is greater than 1,000, it makes sense that 10 questions are sufficient.\n\nBut is it possible to do it in fewer questions?\n\nWell, 9 questions would allow distinguishing up to 2^9 = 512 possibilities, which is less than 1,000.\n\nSo, with 9 questions, Mary can't guarantee to identify the number, because there are 1,000 possible numbers, and 512 questions can only distinguish between 512 possibilities.\n\nTherefore, 10 questions are necessary and sufficient.\n\nSo, the answer should be 10.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1,000\n\nB. 999\n\nC. 500\n\nD. 10\n\nSo, D. 10 is the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other strategy that could potentially do better than binary search.\n\nFor example, if Mary uses some other questioning strategy that isn't binary search, could she do it in fewer than 10 questions?\n\nProbably not, because binary search is the optimal strategy for minimizing the number of questions in the worst case when dealing with yes-or-no questions.\n\nAny other strategy would either be less efficient or not cover all possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 10 questions in the worst case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
