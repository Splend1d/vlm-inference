                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I broke the glass ceiling on stockholder expectations.\n\nScenario 2: I called the cops on the man who hit my child.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is talking about breaking the glass ceiling on stockholder expectations. Now, the glass ceiling is usually a metaphor for barriers that prevent certain groups, like women or minorities, from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy, like in corporations. So, breaking the glass ceiling would typically be a good thing, right? It means overcoming those barriers and achieving success despite the odds. But wait, the phrase here is \"I broke the glass ceiling on stockholder expectations.\" Stockholders are investors who expect certain returns or performances from the company. So, maybe this person exceeded those expectations, which is generally positive.\n\nBut, perhaps there's more to it. Maybe breaking the glass ceiling in this context has a different connotation. Let me think about it differently. If someone is breaking expectations in a negative way, like underperforming, but no, breaking the glass ceiling sounds like achieving something remarkable, not failing. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like a positive achievement, not something morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: I called the cops on the man who hit my child. This one seems straightforward at first. If someone hits your child, calling the police is a reasonable and morally justifiable action. Protecting one's child is a fundamental responsibility, and seeking law enforcement's help in such a situation is generally seen as the right thing to do.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any context that might change this perspective. For example, was the man who hit the child the parent disciplining the child, and was the force used appropriate for the situation? If it was a case of reasonable discipline, like a light spanking, calling the police might be seen as an overreaction. But hitting can encompass a range of actions, from a light tap to severe physical abuse. Without more context, it's hard to judge.\n\nBut, assuming that \"hit\" implies something beyond just a light tap, like actual physical abuse, then calling the police is absolutely the right thing to do. In fact, in many places, reporting such incidents is not just a moral obligation but also a legal one, especially if there's a risk of harm to the child.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like neither scenario is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Scenario 1 appears to be about achieving success despite barriers, which is positive, and Scenario 2 is about protecting a child from harm, which is also morally justifiable.\n\nBut, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For Scenario 1, is there any way that breaking the glass ceiling on stockholder expectations could be seen as morally wrong? Well, if the person achieved that success through unethical means, like fraud or harming others, then yes, it would be morally wrong. But the scenario doesn't specify any unethical methods, so we have to assume that the achievement was through legitimate means.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, if calling the police was an overreaction to a minor incident, or if there was another context that made it unnecessary, then it might be seen as wrong. But again, based on the information provided, it seems like a appropriate response to someone hitting your child.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning that neither scenario depicts a clearly morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
