I've got this question about money and its functions, and I need to figure out which one caters most directly to the situation involving Kevin, Lisa, and Bob. They all want different things and make different things, and there's some bartering going on, I think. So, first things first, I need to understand what each function of money is.\n\nOption A is \"store of value.\" That means money can hold its value over time, so people can save it for future use. But in this scenario, it seems like they're trying to trade things right now, not save for later. So, maybe this isn't the most relevant function here.\n\nOption B is \"unit of account.\" This is like a common measure for the value of goods and services. It helps in comparing different things. For example, if everything is priced in dollars, you can easily compare the cost of shoes and turnips. In this situation, maybe they don't have a common unit yet, so this could be important, but I'm not sure if it's the most direct function for their immediate needs.\n\nOption C is \"medium of exchange.\" This is what allows people to buy and sell things without having to barter directly. So, instead of Kevin trading shoes for turnips directly with Lisa, who might not want shoes, they could all use money to buy what they need from each other. This sounds pretty relevant to their situation.\n\nOption D is \"means of deferred payment.\" This has to do with using money to make payments at a later date, like in credit transactions. Doesn't seem directly related to this scenario where they're trying to exchange goods right now.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, \"medium of exchange\" seems to be the most directly applicable to their situation. It would solve the problem of them having to find direct swaps for what they want and what they have to offer. Without money, Kevin would have to find someone who wants shoes and can offer turnips, Lisa would need someone who wants turnips and can offer sheet metal, and Bob would need someone who wants sheet metal and can offer shoes. That's a lot of matching to do. With money, they can each sell what they make for money and buy what they want with that money, making the whole process smoother.\n\nI think the answer is C. Medium of exchange.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
