                    "text": "So I have this question here about Neandertals being hunters. It's asking for evidence that supports the idea that Neandertals were hunters, and there are four options provided. I need to pick the correct one(s). Let's go through each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that Neandertal canine teeth showed that they relied only on meat for their subsistence. Hmm, that seems a bit extreme. I don't think any society relies only on meat. Even hunter-gatherers typically supplement their diet with plants, nuts, and other food sources. So, this seems a bit too absolute. Maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nOption B mentions that animal bones were found showing stone tool cut marks and no animal teeth marks. This sounds interesting. If there are cut marks from stone tools on animal bones, that suggests that Neandertals were processing the animals, possibly after hunting them. The fact that there are no animal teeth marks might indicate that the animals weren't scavenged from kills made by other predators. This seems like strong evidence for hunting.\n\nOption C states that bones of large animals, such as elephant and horse, were found in caves. While it's true that finding animal bones in caves could suggest that Neandertals hunted and brought them there, it's also possible that the animals were scavenged or that they naturally ended up in the caves. So, this seems a bit ambiguous. It's evidence, but not as strong as option B.\n\nOption D says both A and C. Well, if A is incorrect, as I suspect, then this wouldn't be the right choice.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option B seems to be the most straightforward and convincing evidence that Neandertals were hunters. The presence of stone tool cut marks on animal bones without any animal teeth marks strongly suggests that Neandertals were the ones processing the animals, likely after hunting them.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about this again. If animals were scavenged from other predators' kills, we might expect to see signs of scavenging, like animal teeth marks or other indications that the kill was made by another predator. Since option B specifies that there are no animal teeth marks, it reinforces the idea that Neandertals were the primary agents in killing and processing the animals.\n\nAdditionally, option C, while indicative, is less specific. Finding large animal bones in caves could be due to hunting, but it could also be due to natural causes or scavenging. So, it's not as direct evidence as option B.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the best answer is option B: animal bones were found showing stone tool cut marks and no animal teeth marks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
