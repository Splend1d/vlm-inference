                    "text": "So I've got this question here about supervision in school psychology, and it's referring to a position statement by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). I need to figure out which option is the most accurate based on that statement. Since I don't have the exact statement in front of me, I'll have to rely on my knowledge of standard supervision practices in school psychology and what I can recall about NASP's guidelines.\n\nOption A says that school psychologists need to provide supervision only to those who aren't fully certified or licensed and to interns. Hmm, that seems a bit limited. I remember that supervision is important for ensuring competent practice, and it's typically required for those who are still in training or not fully certified. But I also think that even fully certified school psychologists might benefit from supervision or mentoring, especially if they're new to the field or to a particular school district. So, maybe this option is a bit too narrow.\n\nOption B states that they should provide professional but not administrative supervision. This is interesting. In many settings, supervision can be both professional and administrative. Professional supervision focuses on the developmental and clinical aspects of practice, like case discussions, decision-making, and professional growth. Administrative supervision, on the other hand, is more about overseeing tasks, evaluating performance, and ensuring that policies and procedures are followed. NASP might advocate for supervision that is primarily professional in nature, emphasizing the developmental aspects of being a school psychologist. So, this could be a plausible answer.\n\nOption C suggests that supervisors are eligible after one year of experience as a school psychologist. That seems pretty short to me. I would have thought that more experience would be necessary to supervise others effectively. Supervision requires a deep understanding of the field, strong clinical skills, and the ability to guide and mentor others. One year might not be sufficient to develop those capabilities. Maybe NASP has specific reasons for setting such a timeframe, but based on general supervision standards, this seems a bit brief.\n\nOption D says that supervisors should hold the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential. This makes sense because having a recognized credential ensures that the supervisor has met certain standards of education, training, and experience. The Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP) credential is a mark of professional achievement and commitment to ethical and effective practice. Similarly, holding a state credential indicates that the individual meets the licensing or certification requirements of their state. So, this seems like a solid requirement for a supervisor.\n\nNow, I need to choose the most accurate statement based on NASP's position. Since I don't have the exact text in front of me, I'll go with what I know about supervision in school psychology.\n\nLet me think about this again. The question is about supervision in school psychology according to NASP's position statement. I need to select the option that aligns best with that position.\n\nOption A seems too restrictive because I don't think supervision is only for non-certified or intern school psychologists. While those groups certainly require supervision, fully certified school psychologists might also benefit from supervision in certain contexts, such as when they're new to a district or working in a specialized area.\n\nOption B suggests that supervision should be professional but not administrative. This could be in line with NASP's focus on the professional development and ethical practice of school psychologists. They might emphasize the importance of professional supervision to ensure that school psychologists are receiving guidance on their practice rather than just administrative oversight.\n\nOption C proposes that supervisors are eligible after one year of experience. This seems insufficient based on general supervision standards. Typically, supervisors are expected to have several years of experience, if not more, to provide adequate mentorship and guidance.\n\nOption D requires supervisors to hold the NCSP credential or a state school psychologist credential. This seems reasonable as it ensures a baseline of knowledge and competence.\n\nBetween options B and D, both seem plausible, but I think option D is more directly related to the qualifications of the supervisor, which is a crucial aspect of supervision. Option B pertains to the type of supervision provided, whereas option D addresses who is qualified to provide that supervision.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both B and D are important aspects of the position statement. However, the question asks for the most accurate statement, implying that one of these options is more accurate than the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the position statement prioritizes certain aspects over others. For instance, it might emphasize the importance of supervisors having the necessary credentials and experience to ensure quality supervision.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is the most accurate because it specifies the credentials required for supervisors, which is a fundamental aspect of ensuring qualified supervision.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nI recall that NASP does emphasize the importance of supervision in school psychology, both for interns and for practicing school psychologists. They likely advocate for supervisors who are well-qualified and experienced.\n\nOption A might be partially true, but it's too limiting. Supervision isn't only for non-certified or intern school psychologists.\n\nOption B suggests that supervision should be professional but not administrative. While professional supervision is important, I wonder if NASP completely excludes administrative supervision. It's possible that in some settings, administrative supervision is also necessary, but perhaps NASP emphasizes professional supervision as the primary form.\n\nOption C's one-year experience seems too brief for supervisor eligibility. Most professional standards require several years of experience before one can supervise others.\n\nOption D aligns with standard practices by requiring supervisors to hold recognized credentials in school psychology.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most accurate statement is option D: They should hold the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential.\n\nI'll go with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
