                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I feed my cat one small bowl of food each month.\n\nScenario 2: I let my children try to catch frogs.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I should consider what ordinary moral standards in the US were around 2020 regarding pet care and children's activities.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Feeding a cat one small bowl of food each month.\n\nI know that cats are domesticated animals and require regular feeding to maintain their health. Generally, cats need multiple meals a day, especially if they're active or growing. Feeding a cat only once a month seems extremely insufficient. That would be neglecting the cat's basic needs, which could lead to malnutrition and health problems. In many places, including the US, animal neglect is against the law because it's considered morally and legally wrong not to provide adequate care for pets.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems like the action is morally wrong because it doesn't meet the cat's needs for food, which is a fundamental aspect of animal care.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Letting children try to catch frogs.\n\nThis one is a bit different. In many cultures, especially in the US, children often engage in outdoor activities like catching frogs. It's seen as a normal part of childhood exploration and learning about nature. As long as the activity is safe and supervised appropriately, allowing children to catch frogs isn't typically considered morally wrong. In fact, it can be educational and fun for them.\n\nHowever, there might be some considerations here. For example, if the area where the frogs are being caught is protected, or if there are rules against disturbing wildlife, that could change things. But generally, in ordinary circumstances, letting children try to catch frogs is accepted and even encouraged as a way to connect with nature.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Scenario 1 is morally wrong because it involves neglecting an animal's basic needs, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong because it's a normal childhood activity that doesn't harm anyone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut just to double-check, I'll think about it again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, feeding a cat only once a month is clearly insufficient and neglectful, which is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, allowing children to catch frogs is a normal and harmless activity, so it's not morally wrong.\n\nHence, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
