                    "text": "So I have this question here about research methods. It says: \"Which type of research methods are designed to elicit responses to predetermined, standardized questions from many respondents?\" And the options are A. Quantitative, B. Qualitative, C. Non-probability, and D. Probability.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these best fits the description. Let's start by understanding what each option entails.\n\nFirst, quantitative research. I remember that quantitative research involves collecting numerical data that can be statistically analyzed. It's often about measuring things and finding patterns or relationships between variables. So, it usually involves predetermined questions or surveys with standardized responses to make sure the data is comparable across many respondents. That sounds like it could fit the description.\n\nNow, qualitative research. This type is more about understanding people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors through in-depth insights rather than numbers. It often involves open-ended questions, interviews, focus groups, or observations. The questions aren't necessarily standardized; they can be more flexible to explore topics in depth. So, it doesn't seem to fit the description of predetermined, standardized questions for many respondents.\n\nNext, non-probability sampling. This is a method used in research where not every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. It's often used when it's not feasible to do probability sampling or when you need to target specific groups. However, this seems more related to how the sample is chosen rather than the type of data collected or the way questions are asked. So, it probably isn't the right choice here.\n\nLastly, probability sampling. This is when every member of the population has a known, equal chance of being selected for the sample. It's used to ensure that the sample is representative of the population, which is crucial for generalizing the results. Like non-probability sampling, this also relates to how the sample is selected rather than the type of data collection method or the structure of the questions.\n\nGiven these considerations, quantitative research seems to be the most appropriate choice. It involves collecting data through predetermined, standardized questions from a large number of respondents, which aligns perfectly with the description provided in the question.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider an example. Suppose a researcher wants to survey 1,000 people about their shopping habits. They use a questionnaire with fixed-choice questions, where each respondent answers the same set of questions in the same way. This approach allows for easy data analysis and comparison since the questions are standardized and the responses are consistent in format.\n\nThis is clearly a quantitative research method because it relies on numerical data collected from many respondents using a standardized instrument. Qualitative research, on the other hand, might involve deeper interviews with fewer people, using open-ended questions that can vary based on the conversation flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Quantitative.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Quantitative.}} \\]"
