And there are some multiple-choice options: A. 1:03, B. 1:04, C. 1:06, D. 1:09.\n\nAlright, I need to find the ratio of pears to apples. So, pears are 3 and apples are 9. Ratio means comparing the two quantities, right? So, it's 3 to 9.\n\nBut ratios are usually simplified, like fractions. So, 3/9 simplifies to 1/3. So, it should be 1:3.\n\nLooking at the options, A. 1:03 seems to match. But why is it written as 1:03 instead of just 1:3? The extra \"0\" seems unnecessary, but maybe it's just a formatting thing.\n\nOption B is 1:04, which would be equivalent to 3:12, but that's not the same as 3:9. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is 1:06, which is 1:6, and that would be 3:18, which is different from 3:9. So, that's not it.\n\nOption D is 1:09, which is 1:9, and that would be 3:27, which is not 3:9.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the correct answer, even though the extra \"0\" is a bit confusing. Maybe it's just a typo or a specific way of writing it.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the \"0\" is there to indicate that it's a single digit, like in time measurements. But in ratios, it's unusual. Maybe it's just a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is being expressed differently. Let me think again.\n\nThe ratio of pears to apples is 3 to 9. That can be written as 3:9. But ratios are often reduced to their simplest form, which would be 1:3.\n\nLooking back at the options, only option A shows 1:03, which is essentially the same as 1:3, just with an extra zero.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A. 1:03, which effectively means 1:3.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this. The other options don't match the ratio of 3:9.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 1:03.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1:03} \\]"
