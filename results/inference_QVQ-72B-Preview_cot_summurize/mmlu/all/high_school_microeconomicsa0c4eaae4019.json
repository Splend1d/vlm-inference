                    "text": "So I have this question about oligopoly, and I need to identify which of the given options are characteristic of an oligopoly. The options are:\n\nI. Formidable barriers to entry.\n\nII. Price (P) = Marginal Revenue (MR).\n\nIII. Relatively few sellers.\n\nAnd the possible answers are:\n\nA. I only.\n\nB. II only.\n\nC. III only.\n\nD. I and III only.\n\nAlright, let's recall what an oligopoly is. An oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of firms dominate the market. These firms can influence the market price because they have some market power. Now, let's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option I: formidable barriers to entry. In an oligopoly, there are significant barriers to entry that prevent new firms from easily entering the market. These barriers can include things like economies of scale, patents, brand loyalty, or control over resources. So, this seems to be a characteristic of oligopoly.\n\nMoving on to option II: price (P) equals marginal revenue (MR). In perfect competition, P equals MR because firms are price takers and have horizontal demand curves. However, in oligopoly, firms have some market power and face downward-sloping demand curves. As a result, P is greater than MR. So, P equals MR is not a characteristic of oligopoly; it's more applicable to perfect competition.\n\nNow, option III: relatively few sellers. This is the definition of oligopoly\u2014few firms dominating the market. So, this is definitely a characteristic of oligopoly.\n\nSo, from the above analysis, options I and III are correct, while option II is not.\n\nLooking back at the possible answers:\n\nA. I only.\n\nB. II only.\n\nC. III only.\n\nD. I and III only.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. I and III only.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any chance that option II could be considered correct in some contexts. In oligopoly, especially in certain pricing scenarios like collusive behavior or price leadership, firms might set price equal to marginal revenue as part of their strategy, but generally speaking, in the standard model of oligopoly, P equals MR is not a characteristic.\n\nMoreover, in monopolistic competition, firms also face downward-sloping demand curves, and P > MR, similar to oligopoly. So, P equals MR is more distinctive of perfect competition.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. I and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
