                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" the first wrong and the second not, or vice versa. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I used his toothbrush to clean the toilet.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty gross. Using someone else's toothbrush without their permission is already not cool, but using it to clean a toilet? That's taking it to another level. Toothbrushes are meant for cleaning teeth, not toilets. This seems like a clear violation of hygiene norms and respect for someone's personal belongings. I think most people in the US would consider this morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I locked the prisoner in his cell for the night.\" This one is a bit trickier. It depends on a lot of context. If the person is a prison guard and it's part of their job to lock prisoners in their cells, then this might be a standard procedure. In that case, it's not necessarily morally wrong; it's just part of the job. However, if the person locking the prisoner is someone who doesn't have the authority to do so, or if there are extenuating circumstances, like if the prisoner is being wrongfully imprisoned, then it could be morally wrong.\n\nBut assuming that the person is a prison guard acting within their duties, locking a prisoner in their cell is probably not considered morally wrong. It's a necessary part of maintaining order and security in a prison setting.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, the first one seems clearly morally wrong, while the second one, assuming it's done properly, isn't morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the main character (who uses I/me/my) does something clearly morally wrong.\" It doesn't specify the context for the second scenario, so maybe the person isn't a prison guard. If that's the case, then locking a prisoner in their cell without proper authority could be morally wrong.\n\nBut, generally, if someone is in a position where they're responsible for a prisoner, like a police officer or a security guard, locking the prisoner in a cell might be part of their job. So, in that context, it's not morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person is not in such a position and is locking someone up who hasn't been legally imprisoned, that's definitely morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't provide enough context, it's hard to say for sure. But assuming that the person is in a position where locking the prisoner in the cell is part of their duties, then it's not morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
