                    "text": "Let's see. I have this statement: \"The minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent.\" And it's about determining the validity of a certain type of argument. The options are categorical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism, hypothetical syllogism, and Toulmin model. Hmm, I need to figure out which one this applies to.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each type of argument is. Starting with categorical syllogisms: those are arguments that consist of two premises and a conclusion, where the premises and conclusion are categorical propositions. Like, \"All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.\" That's a classic categorical syllogism. But the statement about affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent sounds more related to conditional statements, not categorical ones. So, maybe categorical syllogisms aren't the right fit here.\n\nNext, disjunctive syllogisms. These involve disjunctions, right? Like, \"Either it's raining, or it's not raining. It's not raining. Therefore, it's not raining.\" Wait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Maybe I should think of another example. \"Either I go to the party, or I stay home. I didn't go to the party. Therefore, I stayed home.\" That makes sense. But again, this seems different from the idea of affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent, which sounds more like dealing with if-then statements. So, perhaps disjunctive syllogisms aren't the best fit either.\n\nNow, hypothetical syllogisms. These involve conditional statements, which are of the form \"If P, then Q.\" The standard form is modus ponens, which is \"If P, then Q. P. Therefore, Q.\" And modus tollens is \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" These are both valid forms of argument. The statement in question mentions affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent, which aligns with modus ponens and modus tollens. In modus ponens, you affirm the antecedent (P) and conclude the consequent (Q). In modus tollens, you deny the consequent (not Q) and conclude the negation of the antecedent (not P). So, this seems like a good match.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything about the Toulmin model that might relate to this? The Toulmin model is more of a pragmatic approach to argumentation, involving claims, data, warrants, backing, qualifiers, and rebuttals. It's quite different from the formal logical structures of syllogisms. So, I don't think the Toulmin model is the correct choice here.\n\nLet me double-check. The statement is about the minor premise affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent. In hypothetical syllogisms, the minor premise is typically one part of the conditional statement, and the major premise is the other. But more accurately, in a standard hypothetical syllogism, you have two premises: one conditional and one asserting either the antecedent or the negation of the consequent.\n\nFor example:\n\nMajor premise: If P, then Q.\n\nMinor premise: P.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, Q. (modus ponens)\n\nOr:\n\nMajor premise: If P, then Q.\n\nMinor premise: Not Q.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, not P. (modus tollens)\n\nSo, in both cases, the minor premise either affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent, leading to a valid conclusion.\n\nIn contrast, categorical syllogisms deal with categories and don't involve conditional statements, and disjunctive syllogisms involve alternatives (\"either/or\"), not conditionals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Hypothetical syllogism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
