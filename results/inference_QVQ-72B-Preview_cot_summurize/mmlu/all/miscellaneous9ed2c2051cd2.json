Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm pretty sure I know the answer, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not mistaken.\n\nFirst off, I know that Antonio Banderas is a famous actor who has been in many movies. He's originally from Spain, right? I think he was born in M\u00e1laga, which is in Andalusia, Spain. If that's the case, then his native language should be Spanish. But just because someone is from a particular country doesn't necessarily mean they speak that country's primary language, but in this case, I think it does.\n\nLet me think about his films. I remember he's been in a lot of English-language movies, like \"The Mask of Zorro,\" \"Desperado,\" and \"Shrek,\" where he voices Puss in Boots. But he also speaks Spanish in some films, like \"Pedro Almod\u00f3var's\" movies, such as \"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!\" and \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.\" So, that seems consistent with him being a Spanish speaker.\n\nWait a minute, could he possibly speak another language natively? Maybe his family is from somewhere else, or perhaps he has multiple native languages. I don't think that's the case here. I believe his parents were both from Spain, and Spanish is the primary language spoken in his hometown.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there's any possibility he might have learned another language from a young age. For example, maybe his parents were immigrants in Spain, but I don't recall that being the case. No, I think he's fully Spanish in terms of his background.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that sometimes actors learn new languages fluently, but that doesn't make them native speakers. For instance, I know that Antonio Banderas speaks English very well, but that's something he learned later in life, not his native tongue.\n\nSo, based on all this, I'm fairly confident that his native language is Spanish. Let me just quickly check if there's any information that might contradict that. Maybe I should look up his biography or something, but since this is a text-based conversation, I can't browse the internet. I'll have to rely on my knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the correct answer is A. Spanish.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Spanish}} \\]"
