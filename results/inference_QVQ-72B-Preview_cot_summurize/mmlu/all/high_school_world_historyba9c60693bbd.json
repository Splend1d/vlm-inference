The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . .

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Martin Luther's letter, \"Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation.\" It says that in this letter, Luther avoided speaking about one of these topics: the wealth of the church, the power of the clergy, the sale of indulgences, or the political nature of the church. I need to figure out which one he didn't talk about in this specific letter.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what this letter is about. The title suggests that it's directed at the nobility in Germany, and it's about the reformation of the Christian estate. So, it's likely that Luther is addressing issues within the church and suggesting changes, particularly in the German context.\n\nThe excerpt provided mentions that Luther is concerned about the \"distress and misery\"\u538b\u8feb all Christian estates, especially in Germany, and that he's criticizing the Romanists (probably the Roman Catholic Church) for protecting themselves with three walls: the idea that temporal power has no jurisdiction over spirituality, that only the pope can interpret the scriptures, and that only the pope can call a council.\n\nSo, from this, it seems like Luther is critiquing the power structure of the church, particularly the pope's authority. He mentions that the pope lives in worldly pomp and that cardinals are used to seize wealth from convents and prelacies.\n\nGiven this background, let's look at each option:\n\nA. The wealth of the church: The excerpt mentions that the pope lives in pomp that no king or emperor can equal, and that cardinals are used to take over rich convents and prelacies. This suggests that Luther is indeed talking about the church's wealth and how it's being misused.\n\nB. The power of the clergy: Luther discusses the pope's authority, the role of cardinals, and the idea that only the pope can interpret the scriptures or call a council. This seems directly related to the power and authority of the clergy.\n\nC. The sale of indulgences: This isn't directly mentioned in the excerpt provided. Indulgences were certificates sold by the church that supposedly reduced the punishment for sins. Luther was famously critical of this practice, but in this excerpt, it's not explicitly brought up.\n\nD. The political nature of the church: Luther talks about the temporal power having no jurisdiction over spirituality, and he criticizes the pope's worldly pomp and the use of cardinals to amass wealth. This implies that he sees the church as having become too entangled in worldly politics and affairs.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that the sale of indulgences isn't directly addressed in the excerpt provided. While Luther was known for his Ninety-Five Theses, which heavily criticized indulgences, this particular letter seems to be more focused on the structure of church authority and its accumulation of wealth and power, rather than the specific practice of selling indulgences.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. The sale of indulgences.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think again. Perhaps the letter does touch on indulgences indirectly. After all, the accumulation of wealth could be related to the sale of indulgences, which was a major way the church accumulated wealth. However, the excerpt doesn't specifically mention indulgences or their sale.\n\nLet me check again. The passage says: \"It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called 'cardinals'? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\"\n\nHere, Luther is criticizing the lifestyle of the pope and the role of cardinals in amassing wealth, but he doesn't specifically mention indulgences. Maybe he assumes that the nobility already knows about indulgences and focuses instead on other aspects of church reform.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letter does imply criticism of indulgences, but it's not explicitly stated in this excerpt. However, since the question specifies that this is an excerpt from the letter, it's possible that the full letter does discuss indulgences, but the excerpt doesn't include that part.\n\nBut the question says, \"in his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?\" and provides this excerpt as a reference. It seems that based on this excerpt, he doesn't directly address the sale of indulgences.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. The sale of indulgences.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
