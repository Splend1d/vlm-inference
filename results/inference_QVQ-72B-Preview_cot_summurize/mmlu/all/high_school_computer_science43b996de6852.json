                    "text": "So I have this question here about Python 3. It's asking which function checks in a string that all characters are in uppercase. The options are A. isupper(), B. join(seq), C. len(string), and D. ljust(width[, fillchar]). Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to find out which of these functions can tell me whether all the characters in a string are uppercase letters. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A is isupper(). I remember that strings in Python have a method called isupper() that checks if all the characters in the string are uppercase. If they are, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. So, for example, if I have the string \"HELLO\", isupper() would return True because all the letters are uppercase. If I have \"Hello\", it would return False because the first 'h' is lowercase.\n\nOption B is join(seq). I think join is used to concatenate elements of a sequence into a single string. For example, if I have a list of strings like ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'], and I want to join them into one string, I can use the join method. Something like ''.join(['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']) would give me \"Helloworld\". So, this doesn't seem to check for uppercase characters. It's more about combining strings.\n\nOption C is len(string). Len is a function that returns the length of a string. So, if I have the string \"Python\", len(\"Python\") would give me 6 because there are six characters in it. This doesn't check for uppercase either; it just tells me how many characters there are in total.\n\nOption D is ljust(width[, fillchar]). This sounds familiar; I think it's used to left-justify a string to a certain width. For example, if I have \"Hi\" and I want to left-justify it to a width of 5, it might look like \"Hi\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" where the spaces are fill characters. The optional fillchar parameter can be used to specify what character to use for filling the extra spaces. So, this is more about formatting strings rather than checking their case.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the options, it seems that isupper() is the method that checks whether all characters in a string are uppercase. Therefore, the correct choice should be A. isupper().\n\nJust to make sure, let me think of an example. Suppose I have a string \"ALGORITHM\". If I call isupper() on it, it should return True because all the letters are uppercase. On the other hand, if I have \"Algorithm\", it should return False because the 'a' is lowercase.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, the answer is A. isupper().\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ isupper()}} \\]"
