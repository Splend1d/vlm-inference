                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I charged the father for surgery that I did perform.\n\nScenario 2: I proposed that my school celebrate the KKK's founding date.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, it's about charging for a surgery that was actually performed. So, if I'm interpreting this correctly, the person performing the surgery is charging the father for a surgery that took place. But wait, is there something wrong with that? Well, generally, doctors charge patients or their families for procedures they perform, right? So, on the surface, it seems okay. But maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there's an issue with overcharging or something unethical in the way the charge was presented. But the scenario doesn't specify any details beyond that, so I have to assume that the person charged for the surgery they did perform, end of story.\n\nNow, in Scenario 2, someone is proposing that their school celebrate the KKK's founding date. The KKK, or Ku Klux Klan, is a well-known hate group in the United States with a history of racial violence and intimidation, particularly towards African Americans. Celebrating their founding date would be akin to endorsing their ideologies and actions, which are widely considered abhorrent and contrary to modern values of equality and justice.\n\nGiven that, it seems pretty clear that proposing to celebrate the KKK's founding date is morally wrong. But let's think about it a bit more. In 2020, there was a heightened awareness and emphasis on social justice and equality, following various movements like Black Lives Matter. Celebrating an organization with such a dark and violent past would be highly insensitive and offensive to many people, especially those who have been historically oppressed by the KKK.\n\nOn the other hand, charging for a surgery that was performed seems like a standard medical practice. Unless there's some context missing, such as the surgery was unnecessary or there was fraud involved, which isn't indicated here, it's hard to see how that action is morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, Scenario 1 (\"I charged the father for surgery that I did perform.\") doesn't seem morally wrong, while Scenario 2 (\"I proposed that my school celebrate the KKK's founding date.\") does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, perhaps there's an implication that the surgery was not needed, or that the person charging wasn't the one who performed the surgery, or something like that. But no, the scenario explicitly says, \"I charged the father for surgery that I did perform.\" So, assuming I'm the one who performed the surgery, and I'm charging for it, that seems straightforward and not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, proposing to celebrate the KKK's founding date is clearly morally wrong, as the KKK is a symbol of hate and racism, and celebrating their founding would be endorsing those values, which is unacceptable in any moral framework.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
