                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about the equation of exchange. It says that if V and Q are constant, then what? And the options are about changes in the price level and the money supply. Hmm, I need to recall the equation of exchange first.\n\nOh, right! The equation of exchange is MV = PQ. Where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the quantity of output. So, if V and Q are constant, I need to see what happens when M changes, and how that affects P.\n\nOption A says that changes in the price level must be proportional to changes in the money supply. So, if V and Q are constant, and M increases, does P have to increase proportionally?\n\nLet me think about this. If V and Q are constant, then MV = PQ becomes M * (constant) = P * (constant). So, M * k = P * k, where k is the constant V and Q.\n\nWait, no. V and Q are constants, so V*Q is a constant, say C. So, MV = PQ becomes M*C = P*C, which simplifies to M = P. Wait, that can't be right. Did I mess up somewhere?\n\nOh, no, V and Q are constants, but they are multiplied, so V*Q is a constant, say C. So, MV = PQ becomes M*C = P*C, which simplifies to M = P. But that doesn't make sense because in reality, M and P are different things. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider percentages. If M changes by a certain percentage, and V and Q are constant, what happens to P?\n\nLet's take the natural logarithm of both sides of MV = PQ. So, ln(M) + ln(V) = ln(P) + ln(Q). But since V and Q are constants, their logarithms are also constants.\n\nSo, ln(M) + constant = ln(P) + constant. That means ln(M) is proportional to ln(P).\n\nWait, maybe I should take differentials. If MV = PQ, and V and Q are constant, then M is proportional to P, but that seems off because M and P are different magnitudes.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of percentage changes. If MV = PQ, and V and Q are constant, then a percentage change in M would lead to the same percentage change in P, assuming everything else stays the same.\n\nSo, if M increases by, say, 5%, and V and Q are constant, then P would also have to increase by 5% to maintain the equality MV = PQ.\n\nDoes that mean that changes in the price level are proportional to changes in the money supply when V and Q are constant? That sounds like option A.\n\nBut wait, is there more to it? Option B says changes in the money supply have no effect on the price level. That contradicts what I just thought.\n\nOption C says changes in the price level have no effect on the money supply. Well, if V and Q are constant, and M is changing, then P has to change proportionally, right? So, changes in P are determined by changes in M, given V and Q are constant.\n\nOption D says the equation is invalid, which doesn't make much sense because the equation of exchange is a standard economic identity.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, it seems like A is the correct one. Changes in the price level must be proportional to changes in the money supply when V and Q are constant.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose V and Q are constant, and M increases. According to MV = PQ, if M increases and V and Q are constant, then P must increase proportionally to maintain the equality.\n\nSimilarly, if M decreases, P should decrease proportionally.\n\nTherefore, changes in P are directly proportional to changes in M, assuming V and Q are constant.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nWait, but option C says changes in the price level have no effect on the money supply. Well, if V and Q are constant, and we have MV = PQ, then M is determined by P, given V and Q.\n\nBut in reality, the money supply is determined by the central bank, not by P. So, changes in P don't cause changes in M; rather, changes in M cause changes in P, assuming V and Q are constant.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect because changes in P do affect M only in the sense that M must adjust to keep MV = PQ, but in reality, M is controlled by the central bank.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: changes in the price level must be proportional to changes in the money supply.\n\nWait, no. Actually, it's the other way around. Changes in the money supply must be proportional to changes in the price level, given V and Q are constant.\n\nBut according to the equation MV = PQ, if V and Q are constant, then M and P must be proportional to each other.\n\nSo, if M changes by a certain percentage, P must change by the same percentage, to maintain the equality.\n\nTherefore, changes in P are proportional to changes in M, which is option A.\n\nYes, I think option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
