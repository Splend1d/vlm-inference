The 16-year-old was developmentally disabled and his mannerisms were a magnet for malicious bullies. One day the boy stole his father's licensed handgun and shot one of the bullies dead. The district attorney announced prosecution of the teen as an adult and asked for the death penalty due to aggravating circumstances. The trial court certified the boy over to adult criminal court. The boy was convicted and sentenced to death. An appeal was taken on his behalf all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on the merits. Will the Court affirm the sentence of death?\n\nA. Yes, children aged 14 and older are treated as adults and, as adults, they are subject to the same capital punishment penalty as other adults.\nB. No, a minor under 16 cannot be tried in adult court because the Eighth Amendment clause against cruel and unusual punishment forbids it, and the whole prosecution was unconstitutional.\nC. Yes, when a crime is committed by malice aforethought, the age of the perpetrator doesn't matter because the same criminal intent requires the same punishment.\nD. No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this case to think about. It's pretty heavy stuff, involving a 16-year-old boy who was bullied and ended up killing one of his bullies with his father's gun. Now, he's been sentenced to death, and it's gone all the way to the Supreme Court. I need to figure out if the Court will affirm that sentence.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the background. The boy is 16, which is considered a minor, but he was tried as an adult and sentenced to death. The appeal is questioning whether that's constitutional, especially in light of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nI remember that the Eighth Amendment protects people from excessive punishments, and there have been several cases where the Supreme Court has limited the use of the death penalty, especially for juveniles.\n\nLet me recall some landmark cases on this topic. I think there was a case called Roper v. Simmons (2005), where the Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on offenders who were under the age of 18 at the time of their crime. The Court found that there is a national consensus against executing juveniles and that their age and immaturity make them less culpable than adults.\n\nAnother case that comes to mind is Thompson v. Oklahoma (1988), where the Court held that executing offenders who were under the age of 16 at the time of their crime violates the Eighth Amendment.\n\nSo, based on these cases, it seems that there is a trend toward protecting juveniles from the death penalty, especially those under 18.\n\nIn this particular case, the boy is 16, which would fall under the age protected by Thompson v. Oklahoma, and more recently, Roper v. Simmons extended the protection up to age 18.\n\nBut wait, Roper v. Simmons was in 2005. When did this case occur? The question doesn't specify the year, but if it's recent enough, Roper should apply.\n\nOption A says yes, children aged 14 and older are treated as adults and subject to the same capital punishment as adults. But that contradicts Roper v. Simmons, which set the age at 18.\n\nOption B says no, a minor under 16 cannot be tried in adult court because the Eighth Amendment forbids it, and the whole prosecution was unconstitutional. This seems to align with Thompson v. Oklahoma.\n\nOption C says yes, when a crime is committed with malice aforethought, the age doesn't matter because the same criminal intent requires the same punishment. But that seems to go against the Supreme Court's recognition of diminished culpability in juveniles.\n\nOption D says no, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between adolescents and adults. This aligns with Roper v. Simmons.\n\nGiven that Roper v. Simmons established that juveniles under 18 cannot be sentenced to death, and Thompson v. Oklahoma specifically prohibited the execution of those under 16, it seems that the correct answer should be D: No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.\n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe there are other considerations here. For instance, the fact that the boy was developmentally disabled and was being bullied might factor into the sentencing, but the core issue here is whether a 16-year-old can be sentenced to death under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any exceptions or subsequent cases that might have changed the standard set by Roper v. Simmons. I don't think that's the case; Roper is still the leading precedent on this issue.\n\nSo, based on that, I believe the Supreme Court would not affirm the death sentence for this 16-year-old boy, and the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
