                    "text": "So I need to find the least perfect square that has exactly three different prime factors. Let's see, a perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer, like 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. And prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.\n\nSo, for a number to be a perfect square and have exactly three different prime factors, it must be the square of a number that itself has three different prime factors.\n\nWait, no. Actually, that might not be entirely accurate. Because if I have a number that's the product of three different primes, say p, q, and r, then that number is p*q*r, and it's not a perfect square unless one of the primes is squared to make the exponents even.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. So, if I have three different prime factors, say p, q, and r, then the smallest perfect square with these primes would have each prime raised to the power of 2, so p^2 * q^2 * r^2.\n\nBut wait, that would be a perfect sixth power, which is much larger. That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can have a perfect square with three different prime factors if each prime is squared. But that seems too big for the smallest possible.\n\nLet me consider the options given: 300, 9, 900, and 666.\n\nFirst, let's factorize each of these numbers and see which one is a perfect square with exactly three different prime factors.\n\nStarting with 9: 9 = 3^2. That's a perfect square, but it only has one prime factor, which is 3. So, it doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nNext, 300: Let's factorize 300. 300 = 2^2 * 3 * 5^2. So, it has prime factors 2, 3, and 5. Now, is 300 a perfect square? Let's see: 2^2 * 3 * 5^2 = 4 * 3 * 25 = 12 * 25 = 300. So, it's 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^2. For it to be a perfect square, all exponents should be even. Here, the exponent of 3 is 1, which is odd. So, 300 is not a perfect square.\n\nNow, 900: Let's factorize 900. 900 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2. So, it has prime factors 2, 3, and 5. Now, in this case, all the exponents are even. So, yes, 900 is a perfect square. Specifically, it's (2*3*5)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\n\nFinally, 666: Let's factorize 666. 666 = 2 * 3^2 * 37. So, it has prime factors 2, 3, and 37. Now, the exponents are 1 for 2, 2 for 3, and 1 for 37. For it to be a perfect square, all exponents should be even. Here, the exponents of 2 and 37 are odd. So, 666 is not a perfect square.\n\nSo, among the given options, only 900 is both a perfect square and has exactly three different prime factors.\n\nBut wait, is there a smaller perfect square with three different prime factors that's not listed in the options? Let's check.\n\nLet me try to find the smallest perfect square with three different prime factors.\n\nThe smallest three distinct primes are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nIf I take 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = (2*3*5)^2 = 30^2 = 900.\n\nSo, 900 is indeed the smallest perfect square with three different prime factors.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a smaller number that fits the criteria?\n\nLet me consider if there's a smaller perfect square with three different prime factors.\n\nWait, what about 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 900, as I just calculated.\n\nIs there a smaller perfect square with three different prime factors?\n\nLet me check 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^2 = (2*3*7)^2 = 42^2 = 1764, which is larger than 900.\n\nSimilarly, 2^2 * 3^2 * 11^2 = (2*3*11)^2 = 66^2 = 4356, which is larger than 900.\n\nSo, indeed, 900 is the smallest perfect square with three different prime factors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
