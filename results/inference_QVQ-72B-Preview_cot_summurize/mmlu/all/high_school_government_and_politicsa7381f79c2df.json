                    "text": "So I have this question about congressional redistricting. Let me see what it's asking. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that the responsibility for redrawing congressional districts belongs to congressional committees. Hmm, I thought that redistricting was typically handled at the state level, not by Congress itself. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about this. Redistricting is the process of drawing the boundaries for congressional districts, which are based on population changes from the census. I recall that after each census, states are responsible for redrawing their district lines to account for population shifts. So, it's usually state legislatures or independent redistricting commissions that handle this, not congressional committees. Maybe this option is incorrect.\n\nOption B says that it's a noncontroversial process because it has few political ramifications. Wait a minute, that doesn't sound right. Redistricting is actually highly political and often very controversial. It can have significant impacts on which party controls certain districts and, by extension, the House of Representatives. Gerrymandering, which is the practice of drawing district lines to favor one party or group, is a big issue in redistricting. So, to say it's noncontroversial is probably false.\n\nOption C states that it occurs every 10 years to reflect changes in population according to the census. That sounds familiar. The U.S. census is conducted every 10 years, and based on the population data collected, congressional districts are redrawn to ensure equal representation. Each district should have approximately the same number of people. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D claims that the Supreme Court has ruled that legislators may not consider racial demographics when redrawing districts. I remember there have been several Supreme Court cases related to redistricting and race. The Court has ruled that race can be considered as one factor in drawing district lines, but it shouldn't be the predominant factor. There's a concept called \"racial gerrymandering\" where districts are drawn primarily based on race, which has been deemed unconstitutional. However, it's not that race can't be considered at all; it's just that it can't be the primary consideration. So, this option seems overly broad and probably incorrect.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C seems to be the correct answer. Redistricting does occur every 10 years to reflect population changes from the census.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
