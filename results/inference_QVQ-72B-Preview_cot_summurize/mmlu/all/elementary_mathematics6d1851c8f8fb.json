                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the Hiking Club. It says that the members hiked for 2.4 hours, and they covered 2.5 miles each hour. I need to figure out how far they hiked in total. The options are A. 4.9 miles, B. 5.8 miles, C. 6.0 miles, and D. 6.3 miles.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, if they're hiking at a speed of 2.5 miles per hour for 2.4 hours, I should just multiply those two numbers together to get the total distance.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 2.5 miles/hour \u00d7 2.4 hours\n\nOkay, now I need to calculate 2.5 times 2.4. I can break this down to make it easier. I know that 2.5 is the same as 2 and a half, and 2.4 is the same as 2 and 4 tenths. Maybe it's easier to think of it as 2.5 times 2 plus 2.5 times 0.4.\n\nFirst, 2.5 times 2 is 5 miles.\n\nThen, 2.5 times 0.4. Well, 2.5 times 0.4 is 1 mile.\n\nSo, adding those together, 5 plus 1 equals 6 miles.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 6.0 miles seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I should try another way to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that 2.5 times 2.4 is the same as 2.5 times 2.4. Let me just multiply those directly.\n\n2.5 \u00d7 2.4. I can think of 2.5 as 25 tenths, and 2.4 as 24 tenths. But that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 2.5 times 2 is 5, and 2.5 times 0.4 is 1, and adding them up gives 6 again.\n\nOr, I could convert everything to tenths. Since 2.5 is 2 and a half, which is 5/2, and 2.4 is 2 and 4 tenths, which is 12/5. So, distance would be (5/2) times (12/5), which is 60/10, which is 6 miles.\n\nHmm, all these different ways point to 6 miles. So, I think the answer is 6.0 miles, which is option C.\n\nWait a minute, why is option D. 6.3 miles? Is there any possibility that I missed something? Maybe the question is trying to trick me by having a close number, like 6.3, to see if I round incorrectly.\n\nBut no, I think I'm confident with my calculation. The correct answer should be C. 6.0 miles.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. Speed is in miles per hour, and time is in hours, so multiplying them should indeed give miles. So, 2.5 miles/hour times 2.4 hours equals 6 miles, as I calculated.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor to consider here, like changing speeds or different hiking rates, so I believe 6 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 6.0 \\ \\text{miles}} \\]"
