                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about light entering a glass window from the air, and it's asking what changes: frequency, wavelength, speed, or some combination of these. The options are A. frequency and wavelength; B. frequency and speed; C. speed and wavelength; D. speed only.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what happens to light when it passes from one medium to another, like from air to glass. I remember that when light crosses a boundary between two different media, its speed changes because the refractive index changes. Air has a refractive index very close to 1, and glass has a higher refractive index, maybe around 1.5 or so, depending on the type of glass.\n\nNow, the question specifies that it's a monochromatic beam of light, which means it has a single wavelength (or frequency). That should be important.\n\nLet me think about the relationships between frequency, wavelength, and speed. There's a basic equation that connects them:\n\n\\[ v = f \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of light in the medium,\n\n- \\( f \\) is the frequency,\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength.\n\nThis equation tells me that the speed of light in a medium is equal to the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.\n\nNow, when light goes from air to glass, its speed changes because the refractive index changes. The refractive index \\( n \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{c}{v} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light in vacuum,\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of light in the medium.\n\nSo, if the refractive index increases (as it does when going from air to glass), the speed \\( v \\) decreases.\n\nBut what happens to the frequency and the wavelength?\n\nI recall that the frequency of the light doesn't change when it enters a different medium. The number of waves passing a point per second should remain the same, because the light's frequency is set by the source, and that shouldn't change just because it's entering a different material.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. Suppose I have a light source emitting, say, yellow light with a frequency of 500 terahertz. When this light enters glass, does its frequency change? I don't think so. The light waves continue oscillating at the same rate, right?\n\nLet me consider it differently. If the frequency did change, that would imply some kind of energy change, because the energy of a photon is given by \\( E = h f \\), where \\( h \\) is Planck's constant. So, if the frequency changed, the energy of each photon would change, which doesn't make much sense, because the light is just passing through a different medium without any interaction that would absorb or emit energy to change the frequency.\n\nTherefore, the frequency remains constant when light passes from air to glass.\n\nIf frequency doesn't change, and speed does change, then the wavelength must change as well, according to the equation \\( v = f \\lambda \\). Specifically, since speed decreases in glass, and frequency stays the same, the wavelength must decrease proportionally.\n\nSo, in this scenario, speed and wavelength change, but frequency stays the same.\n\nWait a minute, is there any exception to this? I think in some cases, like when light enters a medium where the refractive index depends on frequency (dispersive media), things might get more complicated, but for now, assuming it's monochromatic light, I think the frequency remains constant.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Consider the behavior of light as it enters glass. It bends, right? This is refraction, and it's due to the change in speed as it enters the glass. But again, that seems consistent with the speed changing, not necessarily the frequency.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in different media, the wavelength can change, but the frequency remains constant. For example, when light enters water, its wavelength decreases because the speed decreases, but the frequency stays the same.\n\nLet me try to plug in some numbers to see this more clearly. Let's say the speed of light in air is approximately 300,000,000 m/s, and in glass, it's about 200,000,000 m/s (assuming a refractive index of 1.5).\n\nIf the frequency is, say, 500 THz (500 x 10^12 Hz), then in air:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_{\\text{air}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}}{500 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{Hz}} = 6 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m} = 600 \\, \\text{nm} \\]\n\nIn glass:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}}{500 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{Hz}} = 4 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m} = 400 \\, \\text{nm} \\]\n\nSo, the wavelength decreases from 600 nm in air to 400 nm in glass, while the frequency remains at 500 THz.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I thought earlier: speed and wavelength change, but frequency remains constant.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any reason for the frequency to change. I can't think of any physical mechanism that would change the frequency of light just by passing it through a different medium. Unless there's some kind of scattering or absorption and re-emission process, which isn't mentioned here, the frequency should stay the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that speed and wavelength change, but frequency remains constant.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. frequency and wavelength\n\nB. frequency and speed\n\nC. speed and wavelength\n\nD. speed only\n\nBased on my reasoning, option C seems to be the correct one: speed and wavelength change.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that frequency could change. Suppose the glass window is moving relative to the light source; would that cause a Doppler shift, changing the frequency? But the problem states that the light is entering a stationary glass window pane, so no, that shouldn't be a factor.\n\nWhat if the glass absorbs some of the light, changing its frequency? But that would require some interaction that isn't specified in the problem, and generally, glass is transparent to visible light, so it shouldn't absorb or change the frequency significantly.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the frequency remains constant, and only speed and wavelength change.\n\nWait, but the question says \"a change in\", and it's asking which of these experience a change. So, speed and wavelength do change, as we've seen, while frequency stays the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. speed and wavelength.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about another example. Suppose light goes from water to glass. Water has a refractive index of about 1.33, and glass about 1.5. Again, speed decreases, wavelength decreases, frequency stays the same.\n\nSimilarly, if light goes from glass back to air, speed increases, wavelength increases, frequency stays the same.\n\nSo, in all these cases, frequency remains constant, while speed and wavelength adjust based on the refractive index of the medium.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. speed and wavelength.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
