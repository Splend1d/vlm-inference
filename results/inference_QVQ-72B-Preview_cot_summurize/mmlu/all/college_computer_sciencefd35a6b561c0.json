                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about disk tracks and bit strings. It says that a particular disk unit uses a bit string to record whether its tracks are occupied or vacant. A '0' means vacant and a '1' means occupied. They've given me a 32-bit segment of this string in hexadecimal form, which is D4FE2003. My task is to find out what percentage of these 32 tracks are occupied, and round it to the nearest percent. The options are 12%, 25%, 38%, and 44%.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a hexadecimal value is and how it relates to a 32-bit binary string. Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, and each hexadecimal digit represents four bits. So, a hexadecimal number can be directly converted into its binary equivalent.\n\nThe given hexadecimal value is D4FE2003. Let's see how many bits this represents. Each hex digit is 4 bits, so let's count the number of hex digits:\n\nD4 is two digits, FE is two digits, 20 is two digits, and 03 is two digits. So, that's a total of 8 digits, which means 32 bits (8 times 4 bits).\n\nWait a minute, but 8 digits times 4 bits is 32 bits, which matches the problem statement. Good.\n\nNow, I need to convert this hexadecimal value into its binary equivalent to count the number of '1's, which represent occupied tracks.\n\nLet's convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit binary representation:\n\nD in hexadecimal is 1101 in binary.\n\n4 is 0100.\n\nF is 1111.\n\nE is 1110.\n\n2 is 0010.\n\n0 is 0000.\n\n0 is 0000.\n\n3 is 0011.\n\nSo, the binary representation should be:\n\nD4 FE 20 03\n\n1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011\n\nNow, let's concatenate these bits together to form the 32-bit segment:\n\n1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011\n\nLet me write that out in full:\n\n1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\nNow, I need to count how many '1's are in this binary string.\n\nLet's count them one by one:\n\nPositions 1 to 32:\n\n1: 1\n\n2: 1\n\n3: 0\n\n4: 1\n\n5: 0\n\n6: 1\n\n7: 0\n\n8: 0\n\n9: 1\n\n10: 1\n\n11: 1\n\n12: 1\n\n13: 1\n\n14: 1\n\n15: 0\n\n16: 0\n\n17: 1\n\n18: 0\n\n19: 0\n\n20: 0\n\n21: 0\n\n22: 0\n\n23: 0\n\n24: 0\n\n25: 0\n\n26: 0\n\n27: 0\n\n28: 0\n\n29: 0\n\n30: 0\n\n31: 1\n\n32: 1\n\nNow, let's tally the '1's:\n\nPositions 1,2,4,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,17,31,32.\n\nThat's 13 '1's in total.\n\nWait, let me count again to make sure:\n\n1,2,4,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,17,31,32.\n\nYes, that's 13 '1's.\n\nSo, out of 32 bits, 13 are '1's, which represent occupied tracks.\n\nTo find the percentage, I need to calculate (13 / 32) * 100%.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 13 divided by 32.\n\nWell, 32 times 0.4 is 12.8, which is less than 13.\n\n32 times 0.40625 is approximately 13.\n\nSo, 13 / 32 \u2248 0.40625\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.40625 * 100 = 40.625%\n\nRounding to the nearest percent, that's 41%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 41% isn't listed. The closest options are 38% and 44%.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of '1's.\n\nLet me recount the '1's in the binary string:\n\n1:1,2:1,3:0,4:1,5:0,6:1,7:0,8:0,9:1,10:1,11:1,12:1,13:1,14:1,15:0,16:0,17:1,18:0,19:0,20:0,21:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0,26:0,27:0,28:0,29:0,30:0,31:1,32:1.\n\nThat's indeed 13 '1's.\n\nWait, but 13 out of 32 is 40.625%, and rounding to the nearest percent should be 41%, but since 41% isn't an option, perhaps I need to consider that the binary string might have been misinterpreted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexadecimal value is being interpreted incorrectly.\n\nLet me double-check the binary conversion from hexadecimal.\n\nGiven hexadecimal D4 FE 20 03.\n\nD4 is 1101 0100\n\nFE is 1111 1110\n\n20 is 0010 0000\n\n03 is 0000 0011\n\nSo, concatenated: 11010100111111100010000000000011\n\nNow, counting '1's again:\n\nPositions 1 to 32:\n\n1:1,2:1,3:0,4:1,5:0,6:1,7:0,8:0,9:1,10:1,11:1,12:1,13:1,14:1,15:0,16:0,17:1,18:0,19:0,20:0,21:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0,26:0,27:0,28:0,29:0,30:0,31:1,32:1.\n\nAgain, 13 '1's.\n\nSo, 13 out of 32 is indeed 40.625%, which rounds to 41%. But since 41% isn't an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexadecimal value is misread or miswritten. Let's assume that the hexadecimal value is D4 FE 20 03, which seems correctly interpreted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the hexadecimal value is in a different byte order, like little-endian or big-endian, but in this case, since it's just a string of hexadecimal digits without any specific byte ordering context, I think it's safe to assume the digits are in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the percentage to be rounded differently. For example, if the percentage is 40.625%, and rounding to the nearest whole number gives 41%, but since 41% isn't an option, perhaps they want to round down to 40%, which is closest to option D, 44%, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the binary string has a different number of '1's. Let's see, if I miscounted and there are only 12 '1's, then 12 out of 32 is 37.5%, which rounds to 38%, which is option C.\n\nLet me check if there are indeed 12 '1's.\n\nLooking back:\n\nPositions 1,2,4,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,17,31,32.\n\nThat's 12 positions, not 13.\n\nWait, no, that's 12 positions: 1,2,4,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,17,31,32.\n\nWait, that's 13 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the binary string.\n\nLet me write down the binary string again:\n\nFrom D4: 1101 0100\n\nFE: 1111 1110\n\n20: 0010 0000\n\n03: 0000 0011\n\nConcatenated: 1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011\n\nNow, counting '1's:\n\nPositions:\n\n1:1,2:1,3:0,4:1,5:0,6:1,7:0,8:0,9:1,10:1,11:1,12:1,13:1,14:1,15:0,16:0,17:1,18:0,19:0,20:0,21:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0,26:0,27:0,28:0,29:0,30:0,31:1,32:1.\n\nThat's indeed 13 '1's.\n\nSo, 13 out of 32 is 40.625%, which rounds to 41%.\n\nBut since 41% isn't an option, and the closest options are 38% and 44%, perhaps there's an error in the problem or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different interpretation, such as considering that the hexadecimal value represents a different number of bits or a different encoding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hexadecimal value is being misread. Maybe it's not D4 FE 20 03, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to consider that the binary string might have leading zeros, but in this case, since it's a 32-bit segment, it should be exactly 32 bits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the conversion from hexadecimal to binary.\n\nLet me try converting D4 FE 20 03 to binary again.\n\nD4 is 1101 0100\n\nFE is 1111 1110\n\n20 is 0010 0000\n\n03 is 0000 0011\n\nConcatenated: 11010100111111100010000000000011\n\nNow, counting '1's:\n\n1,2,4,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,17,31,32.\n\nThat's 13 '1's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the binary string is read in a different way, such as in groups of 8 bits instead of 4 bits per hex digit.\n\nWait, no, since each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits, and there are 8 hex digits, it should be 32 bits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to interpret the hexadecimal value as a number and then calculate the percentage based on that, but that seems unlikely given the context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the closest answer is 44%, which is option D, but that doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to consider that some bits are not relevant, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to calculating the percentage of occupied tracks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to consider that the disk tracks are organized in a specific way, but without additional information, that's hard to determine.\n\nGiven all that, I think the most straightforward interpretation is correct: 13 out of 32 '1's correspond to 40.625%, which rounds to 41%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest answer is 44%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{44\\%} \\]"
