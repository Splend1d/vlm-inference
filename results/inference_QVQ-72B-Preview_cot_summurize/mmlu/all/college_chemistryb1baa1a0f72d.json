                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following is an n-type semiconductor? A. Silicon B. Diamond C. Silicon carbide D. Arsenic-doped silicon.\" Okay, I need to figure out which one of these is an n-type semiconductor. Let me start by recalling what an n-type semiconductor is.\n\nI remember that in semiconductor physics, there are two main types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type. The \"n\" in n-type stands for \"negative,\" and it refers to the fact that the charge carriers in this type of semiconductor are electrons, which are negatively charged. So, in an n-type semiconductor, electrons are the majority charge carriers.\n\nNow, pure semiconductors like silicon or germanium have a very specific number of valence electrons that allow them to form covalent bonds with each other, creating a crystal lattice. In the case of silicon, each atom has four valence electrons, and it forms four covalent bonds with its neighboring silicon atoms. This results in a stable structure with no free charge carriers, which is why pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor and is actually an insulator at absolute zero temperature.\n\nBut in reality, semiconductors are often doped with impurity atoms to modify their electrical properties. Dopants are atoms that are added in small concentrations to the semiconductor material to introduce additional charge carriers. There are two types of dopants: donors and acceptors. Donor dopants have five valence electrons, and when they are added to the semiconductor, they provide extra electrons that can participate in electrical conduction. Acceptor dopants have three valence electrons and can accept electrons from the semiconductor's bonds, creating holes that act as positive charge carriers.\n\nSo, if I dope silicon with an element that has five valence electrons, like arsenic, which is a group 15 element, it will act as a donor and create an n-type semiconductor. On the other hand, if I dope it with an element that has three valence electrons, like boron (group 13), it will act as an acceptor and create a p-type semiconductor.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. Silicon: This is pure silicon, which is an intrinsic semiconductor. It doesn't have any dopants, so it's not specifically n-type or p-type. It can be made into n-type or p-type by doping, but in its pure form, it's not n-type.\n\nB. Diamond: Diamond is made of carbon atoms, each with four valence electrons, similar to silicon. Diamond is also an intrinsic semiconductor, but at room temperature, it's actually a very good insulator because it has a wide band gap. So, without doping, it's not an n-type semiconductor.\n\nC. Silicon carbide: This is a compound of silicon and carbon, with the formula SiC. It's also a semiconductor with a wide band gap, known for its hardness and high-temperature capabilities. It can be doped to create n-type or p-type versions, but in its undoped form, it's not n-type.\n\nD. Arsenic-doped silicon: This seems straightforward. Arsenic is a group 15 element, which means it has five valence electrons. If it's doped into silicon, which has four valence electrons, the arsenic atoms will donate their extra electrons to the semiconductor, making it n-type.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that arsenic is indeed a common dopant for silicon and that it behaves as a donor in silicon. I think it is; arsenic is commonly used to dope silicon to make n-type material. Another common n-type dopant for silicon is phosphorus, also from group 15.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that arsenic could act as an acceptor in silicon. No, that doesn't make sense because arsenic has more valence electrons than silicon, so it should donate electrons, not accept them.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that the other options aren't n-type semiconductors. For example, could diamond be n-type under certain conditions? Well, diamond can be doped with nitrogen to create n-type conductivity, but in its natural state, it's an insulator, and without doping, it's not n-type.\n\nSimilarly, silicon carbide can be doped to be n-type or p-type, but in its intrinsic form, it's not n-type.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be D. Arsenic-doped silicon, because arsenic acts as a donor in silicon, providing extra electrons and making it an n-type semiconductor.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about the electronic structure a bit more. When arsenic is substituted for a silicon atom in the crystal lattice, its five valence electrons interact with the surrounding silicon atoms. Four of them form covalent bonds with the neighboring silicon atoms, and the fifth electron is loosely bound and can be easily excited into the conduction band, becoming a free electron that can move through the material under the influence of an electric field.\n\nThis excess of electrons makes the semiconductor n-type. So, yes, arsenic-doped silicon is indeed an n-type semiconductor.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems pretty straightforward. The question is testing basic knowledge of semiconductor doping and the concept of n-type and p-type materials.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Arsenic-doped silicon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
