                    "text": "So I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure out with what confidence I can assert that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days. The problem gives me a few pieces of information:\n\n- The variance of the building times is 386.\n\n- A sample of 40 new homes has an average building time of 83 days.\n\nAnd the question is asking for the confidence level that the true average building time is between 80 and 90 days.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some basic concepts of confidence intervals. A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated mean in this case. The confidence level indicates the probability that the interval contains the true mean.\n\nSo, the formula for a confidence interval for the population mean is:\n\n\\[\\bar{x} \\pm z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean\n\n- \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation\n\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size\n\nWait a minute, here I have the variance, which is 386, so the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) would be the square root of that, right? Let me calculate that.\n\n\\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{386} \\approx 19.65 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nOkay, so \\(\\sigma \\approx 19.65\\) days.\n\nNext, the sample size is 40 homes, so \\(n = 40\\).\n\nThe sample mean is 83 days, so \\(\\bar{x} = 83\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the confidence that the true mean is between 80 and 90 days. So, I need to find the confidence level where the interval (80, 90) captures the true mean.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as finding the probability that the true mean is between 80 and 90 days, given the sample information.\n\nThis sounds like I need to calculate the confidence level associated with the interval from 80 to 90 days.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the z-scores for 80 and 90 days and then find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, I need to find the standard error of the mean, which is:\n\n\\[\\text{SE} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{19.65}{\\sqrt{40}} \\approx \\frac{19.65}{6.3246} \\approx 3.10 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nWait, actually, \\(\\sqrt{40}\\) is approximately 6.3246, so dividing 19.65 by 6.3246 gives roughly 3.10 days. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to find how many standard errors 80 and 90 are away from the sample mean of 83 days.\n\nSo, for 80 days:\n\n\\[z_{80} = \\frac{80 - 83}{3.10} \\approx \\frac{-3}{3.10} \\approx -0.9677\\]\n\nFor 90 days:\n\n\\[z_{90} = \\frac{90 - 83}{3.10} \\approx \\frac{7}{3.10} \\approx 2.2581\\]\n\nSo, the z-scores are approximately -0.97 and 2.26.\n\nNow, to find the probability that the true mean falls between these z-scores, I can look up the areas in the standard normal table.\n\nThe probability that Z is between -0.97 and 2.26 is equal to the area to the right of -0.97 minus the area to the left of 2.26.\n\nAlternatively, since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, I can add the area from -0.97 to 0 and from 0 to 2.26.\n\nBut more straightforwardly, I can use the fact that:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = P(Z < 2.26) - P(Z < -0.97)\\]\n\nAnd since \\(P(Z < -0.97) = 1 - P(Z < 0.97)\\), then:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = P(Z < 2.26) - (1 - P(Z < 0.97)) = P(Z < 2.26) + P(Z < 0.97) - 1\\]\n\nNow, looking up the standard normal table:\n\n- \\(P(Z < 2.26) \\approx 0.9884\\)\n\n- \\(P(Z < 0.97) \\approx 0.8340\\)\n\nSo plugging these in:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) \\approx 0.9884 + 0.8340 - 1 = 0.8224\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nActually, I think I messed up the formula. The correct formula should be:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = P(Z < 2.26) - P(Z < -0.97)\\]\n\nAnd since \\(P(Z < -0.97) = 1 - P(Z < 0.97)\\), then:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = P(Z < 2.26) - (1 - P(Z < 0.97)) = P(Z < 2.26) + P(Z < 0.97) - 1\\]\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because if I plug in the values:\n\n\\[0.9884 + 0.8340 - 1 = 0.8224\\]\n\nBut the area between -0.97 and 2.26 should be higher than that. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I should just subtract the area in the tails from 1.\n\nThe total area under the standard normal curve is 1. The area to the left of -0.97 is approximately 0.1760 (since \\(P(Z < -0.97) = 1 - P(Z < 0.97) = 1 - 0.8340 = 0.1760\\)), and the area to the right of 2.26 is approximately \\(1 - 0.9884 = 0.0116\\).\n\nSo, the area in the two tails is \\(0.1760 + 0.0116 = 0.1876\\), and therefore the area in the middle is \\(1 - 0.1876 = 0.8124\\), or 81.24%.\n\nBut looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. 15.4%\n\nB. 17.8%\n\nC. 20.0%\n\nD. 82.1%\n\nSo 81.24% is closest to option D, 82.1%.\n\nBut I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the t-distribution since the sample size is 40, which is reasonably large, but for simplicity, and since the population standard deviation is known, maybe the z-distribution is acceptable.\n\nBut to be precise, let's use the t-distribution just to be safe.\n\nFirst, degrees of freedom \\(df = n - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39\\).\n\nThen, I need to find the t-scores corresponding to 80 and 90 days.\n\nWait, actually, to use the t-distribution, I'd need to find the t-interval, but since the problem states that the variance is known, perhaps using the z-distribution is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the population standard deviation is known, so z-distribution is appropriate.\n\nBut to cross-verify, perhaps I can look up the t-table for df=39 and see if it significantly differs from the z-values.\n\nLooking up t-tables, for df=39, the t-values are pretty close to the z-values, especially for larger degrees of freedom.\n\nFor example, t(39, 0.975) is approximately 2.021, while z(0.975) is 1.96.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial z-distribution approach is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the confidence interval and see what confidence level corresponds to the interval (80, 90).\n\nSo, the margin of error for a confidence interval is:\n\n\\[m = z \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\n\nAnd the confidence interval is:\n\n\\[\\bar{x} - m \\text{ to } \\bar{x} + m\\]\n\nGiven that the interval is from 80 to 90, we have:\n\n\\[\\bar{x} - m = 80 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{x} + m = 90\\]\n\nSo, solving for m:\n\n\\[83 - m = 80 \\implies m = 3\\]\n\n\\[83 + m = 90 \\implies m = 7\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. There's inconsistency here.\n\nWait, no, both equations should give the same m.\n\nWait, 83 - m = 80 \u21d2 m = 3\n\n83 + m = 90 \u21d2 m = 7\n\nThat's inconsistent. There must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nAh, perhaps I need to consider that the interval (80, 90) is not centered around the sample mean if it doesn't capture the sample mean.\n\nWait, but the sample mean is 83 days, and the interval is from 80 to 90, which does include the sample mean.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the z-score that corresponds to a margin of error of (90 - 83) = 7 days.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nThe margin of error m is:\n\n\\[m = z \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\n\nAnd we have m = 7 days (since 83 + 7 = 90).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[7 = z \\times \\frac{19.65}{\\sqrt{40}}\\]\n\n\\[7 = z \\times \\frac{19.65}{6.3246}\\]\n\n\\[7 = z \\times 3.10\\]\n\n\\[z = \\frac{7}{3.10} \\approx 2.258\\]\n\nSo, z \u2248 2.258.\n\nNow, I need to find the confidence level that corresponds to z = 2.258.\n\nLooking up the standard normal table, z = 2.25 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.9878.\n\nSo, the area to the left of z = 2.25 is 0.9878, meaning that the confidence level is approximately 98.78% for a one-sided test.\n\nBut since it's a two-sided interval, I need to consider both tails.\n\nSo, the confidence level would be:\n\n\\[2 \\times (1 - 0.9878) = 2 \\times 0.0122 = 0.0244\\]\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, for a two-sided interval, the confidence level is:\n\n\\[1 - 2 \\times \\text{tail probability}\\]\n\nSo, if the z-score is 2.258, then the tail probability is approximately 0.0122, so:\n\n\\[1 - 2 \\times 0.0122 = 0.9756\\]\n\nWhich is approximately 97.56%.\n\nBut earlier, using the z-scores for -0.97 and 2.26, I got around 81.24%.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here, which suggests I might be making a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nI have a sample mean \\(\\bar{x} = 83\\) days, population standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 19.65\\) days, and sample size \\(n = 40\\).\n\nI want to find the confidence level that the true mean \\(\\mu\\) is between 80 and 90 days.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as finding the confidence level for which the confidence interval includes the interval from 80 to 90 days.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the standard error and the margin of error.\n\nThe margin of error for a confidence interval is:\n\n\\[m = z \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\n\nAnd the confidence interval is:\n\n\\[\\bar{x} \\pm m\\]\n\nGiven that, if the interval from 80 to 90 days is supposed to capture the true mean, then:\n\n\\[\\bar{x} - m = 80 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{x} + m = 90\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[m = 90 - 83 = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m = 83 - 80 = 3\\]\n\nWait, again, inconsistency.\n\nWait, no, the margin of error m should be the same for both sides.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to find m such that both 80 and 90 are included in the interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the z-score for the interval half-width.\n\nThe half-width of the interval is:\n\n\\[\\frac{90 - 80}{2} = 5 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nWait, but the sample mean is 83, so the interval is symmetric around 83.\n\nWait, no, 83 is the midpoint of 80 and 90, since (80 + 90)/2 = 85, which is close to 83.\n\nWait, no, (80 + 90)/2 = 85, but the sample mean is 83, which is within the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to standardize the interval from 80 to 90 relative to the sample mean.\n\nSo, the lower bound is 80, which is 3 days below the sample mean (83 - 80 = 3), and the upper bound is 90, which is 7 days above the sample mean (90 - 83 = 7).\n\nSo, the interval is not symmetric around the sample mean.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to find the probability that the true mean is within 3 days below and 7 days above the sample mean.\n\nIn other words, find \\(P(80 < \\mu < 90)\\), given the sample information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the standard error and find the z-scores for both ends.\n\nEarlier, I calculated z-scores for 80 and 90 as -0.97 and 2.26, respectively.\n\nThen, the probability that Z is between -0.97 and 2.26 is what I need.\n\nLooking back, I had:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = P(Z < 2.26) - P(Z < -0.97)\\]\n\nAnd since \\(P(Z < -0.97) = 1 - P(Z < 0.97)\\), then:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = P(Z < 2.26) - (1 - P(Z < 0.97)) = P(Z < 2.26) + P(Z < 0.97) - 1\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[P(Z < 2.26) \\approx 0.9884\\]\n\n\\[P(Z < 0.97) \\approx 0.8340\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) \\approx 0.9884 + 0.8340 - 1 = 0.8224\\]\n\nWait, but earlier I thought this was incorrect because it seemed too low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate it as:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = P(Z < 2.26) - P(Z < -0.97)\\]\n\nAnd since \\(P(Z < -0.97) = 1 - P(Z < 0.97)\\), then:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = 0.9884 - (1 - 0.8340) = 0.9884 - 0.1660 = 0.8224\\]\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the symmetry of the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe area from Z = -0.97 to Z = 0 is equal to the area from Z = 0 to Z = 0.97.\n\nLooking up the standard normal table, P(Z < 0.97) \u2248 0.8340, which means P(0 < Z < 0.97) \u2248 0.8340 - 0.5 = 0.3340.\n\nSimilarly, P(-0.97 < Z < 0) \u2248 0.3340.\n\nThen, from Z = 0 to Z = 2.26, P(0 < Z < 2.26) \u2248 0.4884.\n\nTherefore, the total area from Z = -0.97 to Z = 2.26 is:\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.26) = P(-0.97 < Z < 0) + P(0 < Z < 2.26) + P(Z = 0)\\]\n\nBut since Z is continuous, P(Z = 0) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[P(-0.97 < Z < 2.2"
