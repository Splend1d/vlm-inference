                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand why Dworkin supports liberal egalitarianism. The options are:\n\nA. Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\n\nB. Because liberty is more important than equality.\n\nC. Because a market economy is just.\n\nD. Because the state is the best arbiter of equality between individuals.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what liberal egalitarianism is. From what I remember, liberal egalitarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes both individual liberty and equality, but with a focus on ensuring that inequalities are justifiable and benefit the least advantaged in society.\n\nDworkin is a prominent philosopher known for his work in this area. He argues that society should be arranged so that everyone has equal basic liberties and that economic inequalities should be permissible only if they arise from choices people make rather than from arbitrary social advantages or disadvantages.\n\nLooking at option A: \"Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\" This seems relevant because Dworkin believes that people should be held responsible for their choices but not for circumstances beyond their control, like their birth into a particular family or with certain natural talents. So, giving effect to personal choice over individual luck aligns with his views.\n\nOption B: \"Because liberty is more important than equality.\" While Dworkin values liberty, his approach in liberal egalitarianism suggests that liberty and equality are both important and need to be balanced. He doesn't seem to prioritize one over the other in a way that would make this option accurate.\n\nOption C: \"Because a market economy is just.\" Dworkin is critical of unregulated market economies, arguing that they can lead to unjust distributions of wealth and resources. He advocates for a system where market outcomes are adjusted through taxation and redistribution to ensure a more equal distribution. So, this option doesn't seem to align with his views.\n\nOption D: \"Because the state is the best arbiter of equality between individuals.\" Dworkin does believe in a strong role for the state in ensuring equality, but I don't think he goes so far as to say that the state is the best arbiter of equality between individuals. His focus is more on the principles of equality and fairness that should guide the distribution of resources, rather than attributing this role solely to the state.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the most accurate reflection of why Dworkin supports liberal egalitarianism. He emphasizes the importance of personal choice over factors beyond an individual's control, which is a central tenet of his theory.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think about it differently. Dworkin's theory involves the idea of \"equality of resources,\" where each person should have an equal claim to the basic resources necessary to pursue their chosen life plan. This approach tries to correct for advantages and disadvantages that are due to brute luck, like being born into wealth or poverty, rather than choices people make.\n\nSo, again, this points back to option A, emphasizing personal choice over individual luck.\n\nAdditionally, Dworkin uses the concept of an \"imaginary auction\" or \"original position\" to determine what a just distribution of resources would look like. In this thought experiment, people choose their entitlements to resources without knowing their place in society, to ensure that the distribution is fair and doesn't favor any particular group based on arbitrary characteristics.\n\nThis further reinforces the idea that Dworkin wants to minimize the impact of individual luck on people's life chances, again aligning with option A.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is A: Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
