                    "text": "Let's tackle this tax question. So, Smith has an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $120,000, but that doesn't include $40,000 of losses from rental real estate activities. He actively participates in these rentals, which is key. I need to find out how much of those rental losses he can deduct from his taxable income.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules for deducting rental real estate losses, especially for active participants. I think there's a specific IRS rule about this. Let me see... Oh, right! It's IRC Section 469, which deals with passive activity losses. But since he's an active participant, there might be some exception or special rule that allows him to deduct a certain amount of rental losses against his AGI.\n\nI remember there's something called the $25,000 active participation exception. Is that right? Let me verify that. Yes, for active participants in rental real estate activities, there's a $25,000 exception that allows them to deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against their AGI, even if the activity is considered passive.\n\nBut, there are phase-out rules for higher income levels. The $25,000 deduction is gradually reduced for taxpayers with AGI above a certain threshold. I think the phase-out starts at $100,000 AGI and is completely phased out at $150,000 AGI.\n\nWait, let me double-check those numbers. According to IRS Publication 925, the $25,000 deduction begins to phase out when modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $100,000, and it's completely phased out at $150,000 MAGI.\n\nIn this case, Smith has an AGI of $120,000. But wait, the losses are $40,000, which haven't been considered yet. To calculate MAGI for this purpose, do I need to adjust AGI by anything before applying the phase-out?\n\nI think MAGI for this phase-out is AGI plus certain deductions, like the deduction for one-half of self-employment taxes, Keogh retirement plan contributions, SEPP distributions, health savings account deductions, and some others. But in this problem, there's no mention of such deductions, so probably MAGI is the same as AGI.\n\nSo, if AGI is $120,000, and the phase-out starts at $100,000, the deduction is reduced by $0.50 for every dollar over $100,000, up to the $25,000 deduction being completely phased out at $150,000.\n\nLet me calculate the phase-out amount for Smith:\n\nMAGI is $120,000, which is $20,000 over the $100,000 threshold.\n\nThe phase-out is $0.50 for every dollar over $100,000, so $20,000 times $0.50 is $10,000.\n\nSo, the $25,000 deduction is reduced by $10,000, resulting in a $15,000 deductible amount.\n\nWait, but the losses are $40,000. So, can he deduct $15,000 of that, or is it limited to $15,000?\n\nI think the rule is that up to $25,000 (or less if phased out) can be deducted against AGI, and any excess loss is carried forward to future years.\n\nSo, in this case, Smith can deduct $15,000 of his $40,000 rental losses against his AGI, and the remaining $25,000 would be carried forward to next year.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $0\n\nB. $15,000\n\nC. $20,000\n\nD. $40,000\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. $15,000.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any other rule or limitation that would affect this deduction?\n\nFor example, the passive activity loss rules generally disallow deducting losses from passive activities against ordinary income, but the $25,000 exception allows some deduction for active participants, subject to income limits.\n\nAlso, the deduction can't create or increase a net operating loss. But in this case, Smith's AGI is $120,000, and deducting $15,000 would reduce his taxable income to $105,000, which is still positive, so no issue there.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the rental activities are considered material participation activities under the passive loss rules. Since the problem states that Smith actively participates in the rental real estate activities, I think the $25,000 exception applies.\n\nI don't think the answer is A. $0, because that would only be if his MAGI were $150,000 or more, which it's not.\n\nOption D. $40,000 seems too high, as that would imply he can deduct all his rental losses without any limitations, which isn't the case given his income level.\n\nOption C. $20,000 doesn't seem to align with the phase-out calculations I did earlier.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. $15,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
