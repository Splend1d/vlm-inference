                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a car gets 24 miles per gallon of gasoline, and I need to figure out how many gallons it would need to travel 144 miles. The options are 6.5, 6, 5.5, and 5 gallons. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that the car gets 24 miles for every gallon of gasoline. So, if it's traveling 144 miles, I need to find out how many times 24 goes into 144. That should give me the number of gallons needed.\n\nLet me try dividing 144 by 24. Let's do that step by step. 24 times 6 is 144. Yeah, that's right. So, 144 divided by 24 equals 6. Therefore, the car would need 6 gallons to travel 144 miles.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using units or something else to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIf the car gets 24 miles per gallon, that means for every gallon of gas, it can go 24 miles. So, to go 144 miles, I need to find out how many \"24s\" are in 144. Again, that's just dividing 144 by 24, which gives 6 gallons. Same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up a proportion. If 24 miles corresponds to 1 gallon, then 144 miles corresponds to X gallons. So, I can set up the equation: 24/1 = 144/X.\n\nCross-multiplying gives 24X = 144. Then, solving for X, X = 144 / 24, which is again 6 gallons. So, that confirms the previous result.\n\nLet me consider the units to make sure I'm not confusing anything. The car's fuel efficiency is in miles per gallon (mi/gal), which is distance per unit volume of fuel. So, to find the gallons needed for a certain distance, I should divide the distance by the miles per gallon.\n\nSo, gallons = miles / (mi/gal) = miles * (gal/mi). That makes sense because it's like converting miles to gallons using the efficiency rate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of consumption rate. The car consumes 1 gallon for every 24 miles. So, for 144 miles, the number of gallons needed is 144 divided by 24, which is 6.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation.\n\nSuppose there are multiple cars with different efficiencies or if there's any variation in mileage based on driving conditions. But in this problem, it's assumed that the car consistently gets 24 miles per gallon, so I don't think those factors apply here.\n\nAlso, maybe thinking about the units in terms of liters or kilometers, but since the problem uses miles and gallons, and the efficiency is given in mi/gal, it's best to stick with those units.\n\nWait, just to be extra sure, maybe I can use dimensional analysis. Starting with 144 miles, multiplied by the conversion factor of 1 gallon per 24 miles. So, 144 mi * (1 gal / 24 mi) = 6 gallons. Perfect, that matches all the previous calculations.\n\nPerhaps I can also consider smaller numbers to see if the logic holds. For example, if the car travels 24 miles, it needs 1 gallon. If it travels 48 miles, it needs 2 gallons, and so on. So, 144 divided by 24 is indeed 6, confirming that pattern.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and each time I arrive at the same answer: 6 gallons. Looking back at the options provided, that would be option B.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly check what the other options would correspond to:\n\n- 6.5 gallons: That would be more than what's needed, which doesn't make sense for this problem.\n\n- 5.5 gallons: That would be less than what's needed, which also doesn't make sense.\n\n- 5 gallons: That's even less, which definitely wouldn't be enough to cover 144 miles.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 6 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 6 \\text{ gallons}} \\]"
