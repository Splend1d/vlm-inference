                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the peak population of the ancient city of Teotihuac\u00e1n. The options are 50,000, 200,000, 500,000, or 1,000,000 people. I'm not super familiar with Teotihuac\u00e1n, but I think it was an ancient Mesoamerican city, right? Like, it's in Mexico, near Mexico City or something like that.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what Teotihuac\u00e1n is known for. I think it's famous for its massive pyramids, especially the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. These structures suggest that it was a significant cultural and religious center. If it was that important, it might have had a substantial population.\n\nLet me consider the context. Mesoamerican civilizations, like the Aztecs and the Mayans, had large populations in their cities. For example, Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, is estimated to have had around 200,000 to 300,000 inhabitants. But Teotihuac\u00e1n was earlier than the Aztecs, I believe. It flourished between the 1st and 7th centuries CE, whereas the Aztecs were more prominent in the 14th to 16th centuries.\n\nSo, if Teotihuac\u00e1n was a major city in Mesoamerica, it likely had a substantial population, but maybe not as big as Tenochtitlan. Maybe around 200,000 people? But I'm not sure. Maybe it was larger.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the size of the city. If it was a large urban center, it could support a bigger population. I recall that Teotihuac\u00e1n covered a pretty big area, maybe around 20 square kilometers or something like that. If I remember correctly, population density in ancient cities wasn't as high as today's cities, so maybe around 10,000 people per square kilometer? That would make the population around 200,000, which matches one of the options.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact density. In ancient times, cities were more spread out, and not everyone lived in multi-story buildings like we do today. So, maybe that estimate is too high. Perhaps it was more like 5,000 people per square kilometer, which would bring the population to around 100,000. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at other ancient cities and see what their populations were. For example, ancient Rome at its peak had about a million people, but that's a different time and place. In Mesoamerica, besides Teotihuac\u00e1n, there were other large cities like Tikal and Calakmul in the Maya civilization, but I think those were smaller.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the agricultural base. In ancient times, cities relied on agriculture to feed their populations. Teotihuac\u00e1n was known for its advanced agricultural techniques, like raised fields and irrigation systems, which would have increased food production. More food means more people can be supported.\n\nAlso, Teotihuac\u00e1n was a major trade center, so there might have been a lot of commerce and economic activity that could support a larger population.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is multiple-choice, and the options are 50k, 200k, 500k, and 1,000k. I need to pick one of these.\n\nI think 50,000 seems too small for a major ancient city like Teotihuac\u00e1n. That feels more like a medium-sized city today, not a capital of an empire.\n\n1,000,000 seems too high. While ancient Rome and a few other cities might have reached that number, I don't think Teotihuac\u00e1n was that large.\n\n500,000 also seems a bit high, but maybe possible. However, I have a vague memory of reading somewhere that Teotihuac\u00e1n had around 200,000 inhabitants at its peak.\n\nMaybe I should go with 200,000. It seems like a reasonable estimate based on the size of the city, its importance, and comparisons to other ancient cities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the population in terms of the carrying capacity of the land. If the city covered 20 square kilometers and each person needed a certain amount of land for housing and agriculture, maybe I can estimate the population.\n\nBut that seems too complicated for this moment. I think sticking with 200,000 is a safe bet.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps I should consider the population density of other ancient Mesoamerican cities. For example, Tikal in Guatemala is estimated to have had around 90,000 to 120,000 inhabitants at its peak, spread over a larger area than Teotihuac\u00e1n.\n\nIf Tikal had around 100,000 people, and Teotihuac\u00e1n was larger and more densely populated, maybe it could have had 200,000 to 250,000 people.\n\nBut again, that's just speculation. Maybe I should just go with my initial gut feeling and choose 200,000.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes, population estimates can vary based on the methods used by archaeologists and historians. They might look at things like the number of houses, the size of the city, or the amount of agricultural land available.\n\nGiven that, maybe different sources give different estimates, and 200,000 is a commonly accepted figure.\n\nI think I'll go with option B: 200,000 people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
