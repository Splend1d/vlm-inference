The options are:\n\nA. separation-individuation.\n\nB. projective identification.\n\nC. pseudomutuality.\n\nD. assimilation-accommodation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Margaret Mahler is and what her main contributions to psychology are. I remember that she was a psychoanalyst who focused on child development, particularly on how children develop a sense of self separate from their parents.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: separation-individuation. This sounds familiar. I think Mahler is known for her theory of separation-individuation, which describes the process by which infants develop a sense of their own identity separate from their caregivers. This process is thought to occur in several stages as the child grows and becomes more independent.\n\nOption B: projective identification. I believe this was a concept developed by Melanie Klein, another psychoanalyst. It involves a defense mechanism where a person projects undesirable feelings or thoughts onto another person and then behaves in ways that make the other person adopt those feelings or thoughts. While Klein was a contemporary of Mahler and also worked on object relations theory, I don't recall projective identification being a central part of Mahler's work.\n\nOption C: pseudomutuality. This term isn't as familiar to me. A quick search in my notes shows that it's a concept related to relationships where there's a superficial appearance of mutual understanding or connection, but underlying tensions or conflicts are being avoided or denied. It seems more related to adult relationships rather than child development, but I might be wrong.\n\nOption D: assimilation-accommodation. This sounds like a concept from Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Piaget used these terms to describe how children learn and adapt to their environment through processes of assimilating new information into existing schemas and accommodating their schemas to fit new information. While Piaget's work was influential in child psychology, it's more focused on cognitive development rather than the development of self-identity.\n\nGiven that the question is about Margaret Mahler and the development of a sense of self, option A, separation-individuation, seems the most directly relevant. Mahler is well-known for her work on this process, which describes how children move from a state of symbiosis with their primary caregiver to developing a separate sense of self.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that in Mahler's theory, the separation-individuation process occurs in infancy and early childhood and involves several subphases, such as the normal autistic phase, the symbiotic phase, and the separation-individuation phase itself, which is further divided into early, middle, and late subphases.\n\nProjective identification, while an important concept in psychoanalysis, was not a central part of Mahler's theory on self-development. Pseudomutuality seems more relevant to adult relationship dynamics, and assimilation-accommodation is clearly Piaget's contribution to cognitive development.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. separation-individuation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any connection between Mahler and the other options. I don't think so. Mahler's work was primarily on object relations and the mother-infant relationship, leading to the development of the self. So, separation-individuation fits perfectly with her theoretical contributions.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that A is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
