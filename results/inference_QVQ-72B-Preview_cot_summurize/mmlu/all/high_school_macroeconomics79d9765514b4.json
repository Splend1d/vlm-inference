                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about a private closed economy. So, first things first, I need to recall what a private closed economy is. I think a closed economy means there's no international trade or anything like that, right? So, no imports or exports. And private probably means we're excluding the government sector, so it's just households and firms.\n\nOkay, so in that case, the national income identity simplifies. I remember that in a full model with government and international sectors, the national income identity is something like Y = C + I + G + (X - M). But since this is a private closed economy, there's no government and no international trade, so it should just be Y = C + I.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. If it's private and closed, does that mean there's no government? Because sometimes \"private\" can refer to the absence of foreign sectors, but I think in macroeconomics, we usually have Y = C + I + G + NX, where NX is net exports. If it's closed, NX is zero. If it's private, maybe G is zero too. So, perhaps Y = C + I.\n\nAssuming that, then let's look at the options.\n\nOption A says household saving can never be negative. Hmm, in reality, saving can be negative if households are dissaving, meaning they're spending more than their income, perhaps by borrowing or drawing down their savings. So, I think this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nOption B says investment is always greater than savings. In equilibrium, in a closed economy without government, Y = C + I, and saving S = Y - C. So, S = I in equilibrium. So, investment equals saving, not greater than. So, this statement is not true.\n\nOption C says the economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving. Wait, from the identity Y = C + I, and S = Y - C, in equilibrium, S = I. So, if C = S, that would imply C = Y - C, which simplifies to 2C = Y, which doesn't necessarily equal I. So, this doesn't seem right for equilibrium.\n\nOption D says saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income. Disposable income is Y - T, but in this private closed economy, maybe there are no taxes, so Y = Y - T. But assuming there are no government sectors, Y = C + I, and S = Y - C. If C = Y, then S = 0. So, yes, if consumption equals income (disposable income), then saving is zero.\n\nWait, but the option says \"when consumption equals disposable income.\" In this economy, if there's no government, disposable income is equal to national income, right? So, if C = Y, then S = Y - C = 0. So, this seems to be correct.\n\nLet me double-check. In a private closed economy:\n\n- Y = C + I\n\n- S = Y - C\n\n- In equilibrium, S = I\n\nSo, if C = Y, then S = 0, and I = S = 0. So, investment is also zero. That makes sense.\n\nSo, option D seems to be true.\n\nOption A is false because saving can be negative.\n\nOption B is false because in equilibrium, S = I, not I > S.\n\nOption C is false because equilibrium is when S = I, not C = S.\n\nOption D is true because if C = Y, then S = Y - C = 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
