                    "text": "Let's tackle this budgeting problem for Star Co., the contemporary furniture retailer. I need to find out how much they should budget for cash disbursements for June purchases. The options are $260,000, $280,000, $320,000, or $340,000. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some accounting terms, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what cash disbursements for June purchases mean. I think it refers to the cash paid out during June to buy merchandise. So, it's about the money spent on inventory during that month.\n\nLooking at the information given:\n\n- Sales: $540,000\n\n- Cost of goods sold (COGS): $300,000\n\n- Merchandise inventory on June 1: $150,000\n\n- Merchandise inventory on June 30: $180,000\n\n- Accounts payable for purchases on June 1: $85,000\n\n- Accounts payable for purchases on June 30: $75,000\n\nI recall that the cost of goods sold is the direct cost associated with producing the goods sold during a period. It includes the beginning inventory plus purchases minus the ending inventory.\n\nSo, the formula for COGS is:\n\nCOGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the known values:\n\n$300,000 = $150,000 + Purchases - $180,000\n\nLet me solve for Purchases:\n\nPurchases = $300,000 - $150,000 + $180,000 = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000\n\nSo, total purchases for June are $330,000. But wait, the question is about cash disbursements for June purchases, not just total purchases. There must be more to it since accounts payable are involved.\n\nAccounts payable are amounts owed to suppliers for goods received but not yet paid for. The beginning accounts payable on June 1 is $85,000, and the ending accounts payable on June 30 is $75,000.\n\nI think the cash disbursements for purchases would be the total purchases minus any new accounts payable added during the month plus any payments made to reduce existing payables.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula to calculate cash disbursements for purchases:\n\nCash disbursements = Purchases + Beginning accounts payable - Ending accounts payable\n\nLet me see if that makes sense.\n\nGiven that, plug in the values:\n\nCash disbursements = $330,000 + $85,000 - $75,000 = $330,000 + $85,000 = $415,000 - $75,000 = $340,000\n\nWait a minute, $340,000 is one of the options. But I should double-check if this is the correct approach.\n\nLet me think about the cycle of purchasing and paying. At the beginning of June, they owe $85,000 from previous purchases. During June, they make new purchases of $330,000. They pay some of these new purchases and perhaps some of the old payables, and at the end of June, they still owe $75,000.\n\nSo, the cash they disburse for purchases would be the new purchases plus paying down some of the old payables.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is:\n\nCash paid for purchases = Purchases - Increase in accounts payable\n\nFrom June 1 to June 30, accounts payable decreased by $10,000 ($85,000 - $75,000), which means they paid $10,000 more than they purchased on credit during June.\n\nWait, no. If accounts payable decreased by $10,000, that means they paid $10,000 more than the new purchases on credit.\n\nBut let's think carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n- Beginning accounts payable: $85,000\n\n- Ending accounts payable: $75,000\n\n- Purchases: $330,000\n\nCash paid = Purchases - Increase in accounts payable\n\nBut accounts payable decreased by $10,000, which means they paid $10,000 more than the purchases.\n\nWait, no. If accounts payable decreased by $10,000, it means they paid $10,000 more than they purchased on credit.\n\nSo, cash paid = purchases - increase in accounts payable\n\nBut in this case, accounts payable decreased by $10,000, which is effectively a negative increase (or decrease).\n\nSo, cash paid = $330,000 - (-$10,000) = $330,000 + $10,000 = $340,000\n\nThat matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nCash disbursements = purchases + beginning accounts payable - ending accounts payable\n\n= $330,000 + $85,000 - $75,000 = $340,000\n\nSo, both methods give the same result.\n\nBut wait, let's verify if this makes sense in terms of cash flow.\n\nStarting with accounts payable of $85,000, meaning they owe $85,000 from previous purchases.\n\nThey make new purchases of $330,000, so total amount due would be $85,000 + $330,000 = $415,000.\n\nBut at the end of June, accounts payable are $75,000, meaning they paid $415,000 - $75,000 = $340,000.\n\nYes, that matches the calculation.\n\nSo, the cash disbursements for June purchases should be $340,000.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nConsidering the inventory levels:\n\nBeginning inventory: $150,000\n\nPurchases: $330,000\n\nEnding inventory: $180,000\n\nCOGS: $300,000\n\nEverything checks out with the formula:\n\n$150,000 + $330,000 - $180,000 = $300,000 COGS.\n\nAnd cash disbursements are $340,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that could affect cash disbursements.\n\nAre there any other accounts or transactions that might impact cash payments related to purchases?\n\nFor example, did they receive any payments for prior purchases in this period? Wait, accounts payable already accounts for that.\n\nAlternatively, were there any returns or discounts that might affect the payment amounts? The problem doesn't specify any of that, so I assume standard purchase and payment transactions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be $340,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $260,000\n\nB. $280,000\n\nC. $320,000\n\nD. $340,000\n\nSo, option D is $340,000.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{340000} \\]"
