                    "text": "So I've got this question about audit ethics, specifically about situations that wouldn't impair objectivity, integrity, or independence with respect to an audit client. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that doesn't pose an ethical issue. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, option A: An auditor takes the client\u2019s audit committee to Las Vegas for the weekend. Hmm, that sounds fishy. Taking clients on a trip to a place like Las Vegas could be seen as a bribe or at least an attempt to influence them in some way. It could definitely impair independence and objectivity. So, I think this is a no-go.\n\nOption B: An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant. Now, this seems more common and perhaps acceptable. But I need to think carefully. Is accepting a dinner from a client acceptable under audit ethics? I recall that generally, auditors should avoid accepting gifts or hospitality from clients that could influence their judgment. A dinner at a renowned restaurant might be considered a significant enough favor that it could influence the auditors' objectivity. So, maybe this isn't okay either.\n\nOption C: An auditor provides client management with box seats for the season at a major league baseball franchise. This sounds like the auditor is giving something valuable to the client. Providing box seats for an entire season is a substantial benefit. It could create a sense of obligation in the client or could be perceived as a way to curry favor. This seems like it would impair independence.\n\nOption D: A client takes the audit engagement team on a two-day ski trip after the audit team worked for two consecutive weekends. This seems similar to option A but perhaps more elaborate. A two-day ski trip is a significant perk, and accepting such a trip could compromise the auditors' independence. It might make them feel indebted to the client or less likely to report unfavorable findings.\n\nSo, after considering all these options, none of them seem entirely innocent in terms of audit ethics. But the question is asking for the situation that would NOT impair objectivity, integrity, or independence. That means I need to find the option that is acceptable under professional audit standards.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe option B isn't as bad as the others. A dinner at a local restaurant might be considered a normal part of business hospitality, especially if it's an out-of-town client. However, even then, there are guidelines about accepting gifts or hospitality from clients. Perhaps it's acceptable if it's occasional and not excessive, but I'm still unsure.\n\nComparatively, options A, C, and D involve more substantial favors or trips, which are more likely to influence the auditors' objectivity. So, between these, option B seems less problematic, but I need to make sure.\n\nI should consider the Auditing Standard No. 5, which discusses independence requirements for auditors. It states that auditors must be independent in both fact and appearance. So, even if the auditor doesn't feel their objectivity is impaired, if it appears to others that their objectivity might be impaired, that's still a problem.\n\nGiven that, even a dinner from the client could be seen as a gift that might influence the auditor's judgment. Therefore, option B might still be considered unethical.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a difference between the client taking the audit team out to dinner and the auditor providing box seats or taking the client on a trip.\n\nLet me see. In option B, it's the client who is taking the audit team out to dinner, whereas in option C, it's the auditor who is providing box seats to the client. So, there's a difference in who is offering the favor.\n\nGenerally, auditors should avoid accepting gifts or hospitality from clients that could compromise their independence. So, accepting a dinner from the client might be problematic, but perhaps a modest dinner could be acceptable under certain circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, providing box seats to the client is the auditor giving something to the client, which could be seen as an attempt to influence the client's actions or decisions. This could also impair independence, as the auditor might expect some favor in return.\n\nSo, both receiving and giving substantial favors could be issues. But maybe there's a difference in degree.\n\nOption B involves a single dinner, while options A and D involve multi-day trips, and option C involves a season of box seats. The latter three seem more substantial and thus more likely to impair independence.\n\nTherefore, perhaps option B is the least problematic among the choices, even if it's still not entirely acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of these options are acceptable, and the question is designed to make me realize that all of them impair objectivity, integrity, or independence.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, \"which of the following situations would NOT impair objectivity, integrity, or independence,\" suggests that one of them is acceptable.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the context more carefully. Let's look back at option B: An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant.\n\nIf the dinner is modest and infrequent, and if it's seen as a normal part of business travel and hospitality, it might not be considered an impairment to independence. However, if the dinner is lavish or part of a pattern of gift-giving, it could be problematic.\n\nThe key here is the nature and value of the hospitality. A modest dinner might be acceptable, but a renowned restaurant could imply a more expensive or lavish meal.\n\nGiven that, I'm still unsure. Maybe I should look up specific guidance on accepting hospitality from clients.\n\nAccording to the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, auditors should not accept any gift or hospitality from a client if it could reasonably be perceived as compromising their independence or objectivity.\n\nSo, in option B, if the dinner is considered a normal business expense and is not excessive, it might be acceptable. However, if it's at a renowned restaurant, it might be seen as more than just a business meal.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is option B, assuming that a single dinner at a renowned restaurant is not excessive enough to impair independence.\n\nBut I have to admit, I'm still a bit uncertain. Maybe I should choose option B, but with some caution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is none of the above, but since the question asks to pick one that does not impair objectivity, integrity, or independence, and option B seems the least problematic, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
