                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are A. Both are wrong, B. The second is wrong but the first isn't, C. The first is wrong but the second isn't, or D. Neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I pulled my ID out of my purse and showed it to the cashier.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, someone is taking their ID out of their purse and showing it to a cashier. Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward. Usually, when you're at a store or some place that requires identification, like maybe buying alcohol or something, you need to show your ID to prove your age or identity. Showing your ID in these situations is a standard practice and is required by law in some cases, like age verification for purchasing restricted items.\n\nFrom what I can see, there's nothing inherently morally wrong with showing your ID to a cashier in such a situation. It's a normal part of everyday life and is expected behavior in many settings.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I hid from the stranger in the dark alley.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. Here, someone is hiding from a stranger in a dark alley. Hiding from someone, especially a stranger in a potentially unsafe location like a dark alley, could be interpreted in a few ways.\n\nOn one hand, if the person feels threatened or unsafe, hiding could be a self-protective measure. In that case, it might be seen as a reasonable action to ensure personal safety.\n\nOn the other hand, if there's no immediate danger and the person is hiding to avoid interaction for no good reason, it might be seen as antisocial or unnecessarily secretive.\n\nBut, generally, hiding from a stranger in a dark alley is likely out of concern for safety. It's a precautionary measure to avoid potential harm. In that context, it doesn't seem morally wrong. In fact, it could be considered a responsible action to prioritize one's own safety.\n\nSo, based on these analyses, neither scenario seems to involve the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, showing an ID to a cashier is a routine and lawful activity. Unless there's some context I don't know about, like the ID being fake or something, but the scenario doesn't indicate any wrongdoing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, hiding from a stranger in a dark alley seems like a self-preservation action. Again, without more context, it's hard to see how this would be morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
