I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think through each one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Japan has a rich natural resource base.\" Hmm, I thought Japan was pretty limited in natural resources. I remember learning that they import a lot of their materials, like oil and metals, from other countries. So, maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption B: \"China lacks natural resources but has a massive labor force.\" Well, China is a big country with a lot of people, so having a massive labor force makes sense. But I've also heard that China has plenty of natural resources, like coal and rare earth metals. So, maybe this isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption C: \"China is industrializing rapidly.\" This seems to ring true. I've heard a lot about China's rapid industrial growth over the past few decades. They've become a major manufacturing hub for the world, producing everything from electronics to machinery. So, this might be the correct answer.\n\nOption D: \"Taiwan lacks industrial enterprise and an educated workforce.\" I don't know much about Taiwan, but I think they have a pretty advanced economy. They're known for producing high-tech products like semiconductors, which suggests they have a skilled workforce and industrial capabilities. So, this probably isn't accurate.\n\nBased on my knowledge, option C seems to be the correct statement. China is indeed industrializing rapidly, which has been evident from its economic growth and increased presence in global markets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
