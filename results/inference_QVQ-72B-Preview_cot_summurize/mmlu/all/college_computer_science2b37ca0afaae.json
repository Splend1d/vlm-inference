                    "text": "So I have this problem about common divisors of two integers. It says that an integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c divides both x and y. And the question is asking which of the given sets could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a common divisor is. If x and y are two integers, their common divisors are all the integers that divide both x and y without leaving a remainder. The greatest of these common divisors is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. {-6, -2, -1, 1, 2, 6}\n\nB. {-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6}\n\nC. {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}\n\nD. {-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6}\n\nI need to determine which of these sets can represent all common divisors of some integers x and y.\n\nLet me think about the properties of common divisors:\n\n1. If c is a common divisor of x and y, then -c is also a common divisor because if c divides x and y, then (-c) divides x and y as well.\n\n2. The set of common divisors should include both positive and negative versions of each divisor, except possibly zero.\n\n3. Zero cannot be a divisor because it doesn't divide any integer except itself, which is not useful in this context.\n\n4. The common divisors should include 1 and -1 since every integer is divisible by 1 and -1.\n\n5. The set should be symmetric with respect to zero, meaning if c is in the set, then -c should also be in the set.\n\nLooking at option B, it includes 0, which shouldn't be there because zero cannot be a divisor. So, option B is invalid.\n\nOption D also includes 0, so it's also invalid.\n\nNow, between options A and C, I need to see which one could be the set of common divisors.\n\nOption A: {-6, -2, -1, 1, 2, 6}\n\nOption C: {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}\n\nLet me consider what the GCD would be in each case.\n\nIn option A, the positive divisors are 1, 2, and 6. So, the GCD of x and y would be 6, since 6 is the largest number in the set.\n\nSimilarly, in option C, the positive divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. So, the GCD would be 6.\n\nBut wait, if the GCD is 6, does that mean there are integers x and y such that their common divisors are exactly these sets?\n\nLet me try to find x and y for option A.\n\nSuppose x = 6 and y = 6. Their common divisors are {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}, which matches option C, not option A.\n\nWait, but option A is missing -3 and 3. So, if I take x = 6 and y = 6, their common divisors include -3 and 3, which are not in option A.\n\nTherefore, option A cannot be the set of all common divisors of x and y = 6 and y = 6.\n\nLet me try another pair. Suppose x = 6 and y = -6. Their common divisors are the same as above, which again includes -3 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, if I take x = 6 and y = 12, their common divisors are {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}, which is still option C.\n\nWait, but option A is missing -3 and 3, so it seems that option A is incomplete for any pair of x and y with GCD 6.\n\nTherefore, option A is not possible.\n\nNow, let's consider option C: {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}\n\nIf I take x = 6 and y = 6, their common divisors are exactly this set.\n\nSimilarly, x = 6 and y = -6 would have the same common divisors.\n\nIs there any pair of x and y where the common divisors are exactly this set without including any additional divisors?\n\nLet me see. If I take x = 6 and y = 6, their common divisors are {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}.\n\nIs there a pair where the common divisors are exactly this set?\n\nSuppose x = 6 and y = 6. Their common divisors are as above.\n\nIf I take x = 6 and y = 12, their common divisors are the same.\n\nIf I take x = 6 and y = 18, their common divisors are {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}, same as before.\n\nWait, but 18 has 9 as a divisor, but since 9 doesn't divide 6, it's not a common divisor.\n\nSo, in this case, the common divisors remain {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}.\n\nSimilarly, if I take x = 6 and y = 6, their common divisors are exactly this set.\n\nTherefore, option C can be the set of all common divisors of x = 6 and y = 6.\n\nNow, is there any other set among the options that could also be a set of common divisors?\n\nOption A is missing -3 and 3, so it's incomplete.\n\nOption B includes 0, which is invalid.\n\nOption D includes 0, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid option is C.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there are other possibilities.\n\nSuppose I take x = 6 and y = 6, their common divisors are {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}.\n\nSimilarly, if I take x = 6 and y = -6, same set.\n\nIf I take x = 12 and y = 18, their GCD is 6, and their common divisors are the same set.\n\nSo, it seems that option C is a possible set of common divisors.\n\nIs there a pair where the common divisors are exactly option A?\n\nAs we saw earlier, no, because option A is missing -3 and 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nSuppose I have x = 6 and y = 6.\n\nTheir divisors are:\n\nDivisors of 6: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16\n\nCommon divisors: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nOption A is missing \u00b13, so it's incomplete.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct.\n\nWait, but the question says \"which of the following sets of integers could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers?\"\n\nGiven that, and considering that option C matches the common divisors of x = 6 and y = 6, it seems that option C is a valid set.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
