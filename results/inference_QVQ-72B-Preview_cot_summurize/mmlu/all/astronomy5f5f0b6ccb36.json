                    "text": "Let's see. I need to calculate the ratio of solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface at perihelion and aphelion. The options are 4:1, 1:2, 6:5, and 9:4. Hmm, I remember that solar radiation decreases with distance from the sun, following the inverse square law. So, if I know the distances at perihelion and aphelion, I can probably find the ratio of the fluxes.\n\nFirst, let's recall what perihelion and aphelion mean. Perihelion is the point in Mercury's orbit when it's closest to the Sun, and aphelion is when it's farthest. The distances are given as 0.304 AU at perihelion and 0.456 AU at aphelion. AU stands for astronomical units, which is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, about 150 million kilometers.\n\nOkay, so the solar radiation flux, F, at a certain distance, r, from the Sun is given by the formula F \u221d 1/r\u00b2. That means flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.\n\nSo, if I have two fluxes, F_peri and F_aph, their ratio would be (F_peri / F_aph) = (r_aph / r_peri)\u00b2.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nF_peri / F_aph = (0.456 / 0.304)\u00b2.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, divide 0.456 by 0.304.\n\n0.456 \u00f7 0.304 = ?\n\nWell, 0.304 times 1.5 would be 0.456, because 0.304 \u00d7 1.5 = 0.456.\n\nSo, 0.456 / 0.304 = 1.5.\n\nNow, square that: 1.5\u00b2 = 2.25.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right because 2.25 is greater than 1, which would imply that the flux at perihelion is more than at aphelion, which makes sense because it's closer. But let's see what 2.25 corresponds to in the options.\n\nThe options are 4:1, 1:2, 6:5, and 9:4.\n\n2.25 is equal to 9/4, because 9 divided by 4 is 2.25.\n\nSo, 9:4 seems to be the ratio.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nWait, I might have misapplied the formula.\n\nLet me recall that F \u221d 1/r\u00b2, so F = k/r\u00b2, where k is a constant.\n\nTherefore, F_peri / F_aph = (r_aph / r_peri)\u00b2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nF_peri / F_aph = (0.456 / 0.304)\u00b2 = (1.5)\u00b2 = 2.25 = 9/4.\n\nSo, the ratio of flux at perihelion to flux at aphelion is 9:4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 9:4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the units.\n\nFlux is typically in watts per square meter (W/m\u00b2), and it decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun.\n\nSo, if Mercury is closer to the Sun at perihelion, it receives more flux, and at aphelion, less flux.\n\nSo, the ratio should indeed be the inverse square of the distance ratio.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 9:4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
