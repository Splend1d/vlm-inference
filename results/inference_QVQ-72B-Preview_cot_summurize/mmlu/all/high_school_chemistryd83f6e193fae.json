                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about gas effusion rates. It says that helium effuses through a pinhole 5.33 times faster than an unknown gas, and I need to figure out what that unknown gas is from the given options: CO2, CH4, C5H12, or C8H18.\n\nFirst off, I remember that gas effusion is related to how fast gas molecules can flow through a small opening, like a pinhole. There's a law called Graham's law of effusion that relates the effusion rates of two different gases to their molar masses. The law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.\n\nSo, if I have two gases, let's call them Gas A and Gas B, the ratio of their effusion rates is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{rate of A}}{\\text{rate of B}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{molar mass of B}}{\\text{molar mass of A}}}\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, Gas A is helium (He), and Gas B is the unknown gas. I know that helium effuses 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{rate of He}}{\\text{rate of B}} = 5.33\n\\]\n\nAnd according to Graham's law:\n\n\\[\n5.33 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{molar mass of B}}{\\text{molar mass of He}}}\n\\]\n\nI know the molar mass of helium is approximately 4 g/mol. So, I can plug that in and solve for the molar mass of the unknown gas.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[\n5.33 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{molar mass of B}}{4}}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for the molar mass of B, I can square both sides:\n\n\\[\n(5.33)^2 = \\frac{\\text{molar mass of B}}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n28.4089 = \\frac{\\text{molar mass of B}}{4}\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\text{molar mass of B} = 28.4089 \\times 4 = 113.6356 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nSo, the molar mass of the unknown gas is approximately 113.6 g/mol.\n\nNow, I need to look at the options and see which one has a molar mass close to this value.\n\nLet's calculate the molar masses of each option:\n\nA. CO2 (carbon dioxide):\n\nCarbon has an atomic mass of approximately 12 g/mol, and oxygen is approximately 16 g/mol. So, CO2 has a molar mass of:\n\n\\[\n12 + (2 \\times 16) = 12 + 32 = 44 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nThat's much lower than 113.6 g/mol.\n\nB. CH4 (methane):\n\nCarbon is 12 g/mol, and hydrogen is approximately 1 g/mol each. So, CH4 has a molar mass of:\n\n\\[\n12 + (4 \\times 1) = 12 + 4 = 16 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nThat's also much lower than 113.6 g/mol.\n\nC. C5H12 (pentane):\n\nCarbon is 12 g/mol, and hydrogen is 1 g/mol. So, C5H12 has a molar mass of:\n\n\\[\n(5 \\times 12) + (12 \\times 1) = 60 + 12 = 72 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nStill lower than 113.6 g/mol.\n\nD. C8H18 (octane):\n\nCarbon is 12 g/mol, and hydrogen is 1 g/mol. So, C8H18 has a molar mass of:\n\n\\[\n(8 \\times 12) + (18 \\times 1) = 96 + 18 = 114 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nThis is very close to our calculated molar mass of 113.6 g/mol.\n\nSo, based on the molar masses, the unknown gas is most likely C8H18, which is octane.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming Graham's law:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{rate of He}}{\\text{rate of B}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{molar mass of B}}{\\text{molar mass of He}}}\n\\]\n\nGiven rate of He / rate of B = 5.33, and molar mass of He = 4 g/mol.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n5.33 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{molar mass of B}}{4}}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n28.4089 = \\frac{\\text{molar mass of B}}{4}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\text{molar mass of B} = 28.4089 \\times 4 = 113.6356 \\text{ g/mol}\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, double-checking the molar masses of the options:\n\nA. CO2: 12 + 32 = 44 g/mol\n\nB. CH4: 12 + 4 = 16 g/mol\n\nC. C5H12: 60 + 12 = 72 g/mol\n\nD. C8H18: 96 + 18 = 114 g/mol\n\nYes, C8H18 has a molar mass of 114 g/mol, which matches our calculated value of 113.6 g/mol very closely. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding errors in the calculations.\n\nTherefore, the unknown gas is most likely C8H18, which is octane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. } \\text{C}_8\\text{H}_{18}} \\]"
