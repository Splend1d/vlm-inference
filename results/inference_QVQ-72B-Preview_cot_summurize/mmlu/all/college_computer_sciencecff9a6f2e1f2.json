                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two computers communicating over a local area network. They're sending data packets, each 1,000 bytes in size, and the network can carry 1,000 packets per second. There's also CPU time involved in executing the network protocol for each packet, which is 10 milliseconds per packet. The question is asking for the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another, and it gives me four options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's limiting the data transfer rate here. There are two main factors at play: the network capacity and the CPU processing time for each packet.\n\nThe network can carry 1,000 packets per second, and each packet is 1,000 bytes. So, if there were no CPU limitations, the maximum data transfer rate would be 1,000 packets/second * 1,000 bytes/packet = 1,000,000 bytes per second. But that's not considering the CPU time required to process each packet.\n\nNow, the CPU time needed to execute the network protocol for each packet is 10 milliseconds. Since there are 1,000 milliseconds in a second, the CPU can process 1,000 / 10 = 100 packets per second, assuming that's the only thing the CPU is doing.\n\nBut wait, the network can handle 1,000 packets per second, but the CPU can only process 100 packets per second. So, the CPU is the bottleneck here because it can't keep up with the network's capacity.\n\nTherefore, the maximum rate at which data can be sent is limited by the CPU's processing capacity, which is 100 packets per second.\n\nNow, each packet is 1,000 bytes, so the data transfer rate would be 100 packets/second * 1,000 bytes/packet = 100,000 bytes per second.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10,000 bytes/second\n\nB. 25,000 bytes/ second\n\nC. 100,000 bytes/ second\n\nD. 500,000 bytes/ second\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nThe network can handle 1,000 packets per second, but the CPU can only process 100 packets per second. So, yes, the CPU is the limiting factor here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the network has a bandwidth of 1,000 packets per second, but the processing rate is 100 packets per second. The actual data transfer rate can't exceed the lesser of these two values, which is 100 packets per second, translating to 100,000 bytes per second.\n\nI don't think there's more to it. It seems straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the CPU time includes both sending and receiving processing. But the problem specifies that it's the time to execute the network protocol to send one packet, so I assume it's only for sending.\n\nAlso, perhaps there's some overhead or something else to consider, but the problem doesn't mention any additional factors.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 100,000 bytes per second, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
