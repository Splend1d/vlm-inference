                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question: \"Which of these rocks will float in water? A. granite, B. limestone, C. shale, D. pumice.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these rocks is lightweight enough to float on water.\n\nFirst, I know that for an object to float in water, its density has to be less than or equal to the density of water. Water has a density of about 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm\u00b3). So, if a rock has a density less than 1 g/cm\u00b3, it should float.\n\nLet me recall the densities of these rocks:\n\nStarting with granite: I think granite is pretty dense. It's used for countertops and stuff, right? I think its density is around 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, which is more than water's 1 g/cm\u00b3. So, that means it wouldn't float.\n\nNext, limestone: I know limestone is commonly used in buildings and monuments. It's heavier than water, I believe. Let me think, the density of limestone varies a bit, but I think it's around 2.7 g/cm\u00b3 too, similar to granite. So, that probably wouldn't float either.\n\nThen there's shale: Shale is a type of sedimentary rock, and it's made up of fine-grained particles. I think it's relatively dense, maybe around 2.0 to 2.7 g/cm\u00b3. Still higher than water's density, so it likely wouldn't float.\n\nFinally, pumice: Now, pumice is interesting. I've heard that pumice can float in water. It's a volcanic rock, and I remember that it's very lightweight because it has lots of air pockets. Its density can be as low as 0.5 g/cm\u00b3, which is less than water's density, so it should float.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Is pumice really less dense than water? Let me think about it. Yeah, because of its porous nature, it's less dense than water. That's why it can float.\n\nSo, among these options, pumice is the one that will float in water.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm the densities:\n\n- Granite: approximately 2.7 g/cm\u00b3\n\n- Limestone: approximately 2.7 g/cm\u00b3\n\n- Shale: approximately 2.0 to 2.7 g/cm\u00b3\n\n- Pumice: approximately 0.5 to 1.0 g/cm\u00b3\n\nSince water is 1 g/cm\u00b3, only pumice has a density that can be less than water's, especially at 0.5 g/cm\u00b3, which is below water's density.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. pumice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. pumice}} \\]"
