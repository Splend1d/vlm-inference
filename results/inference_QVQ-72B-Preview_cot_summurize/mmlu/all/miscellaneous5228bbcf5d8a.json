                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about contracts. It says that if one party is forced to sign a contract, then that contract is defined as... and the options are enforceable, executory, unilateral, or voidable. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what it means for someone to be \"forced\" to sign a contract. That probably means that there was some kind of pressure or coercion involved, right? Like, maybe threats or something that made the person sign against their will. That doesn't sound right, does it? I think in law, contracts are supposed to be agreements between parties who are freely consenting.\n\nOkay, so let's recall what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with \"enforceable.\" I think an enforceable contract is one that is valid and can be upheld by law. So, if a contract is enforceable, it means that both parties have to stick to the terms, and if one doesn't, the other can go to court to enforce it. But in the case where one party was forced to sign, would that still be enforceable? It seems like there might be some issue there because one party wasn't consenting voluntarily.\n\nNext is \"executory.\" I'm not as familiar with this term in contract law. Let me think... I think an executory contract is one where the obligations haven't been fully performed yet. So, it's a contract that still has promises that need to be carried out by the parties involved. But again, in the context of one party being forced to sign, I'm not sure if that changes the nature of the contract being executory.\n\nThen there's \"unilateral.\" I believe a unilateral contract is one where only one party makes a promise or performs an act, and in return, the other party is obligated to do something. For example, if someone offers a reward for finding a lost item, that's a unilateral contract because the finder only has to return the item, and the offeror has to pay the reward. But again, this doesn't seem directly related to whether one party was forced to sign.\n\nLastly, \"voidable.\" This term rings a bell. I think a voidable contract is one that can be canceled or not enforced by one of the parties. Usually, it's because there was some issue with the agreement, like misrepresentation, duress, or unconscionability. So, if one party was forced to sign, that sounds a lot like duress, which is a ground for making a contract voidable.\n\nWait a minute, duress is when someone is subjected to physical or emotional pressure that compels them to do something they wouldn't otherwise do, like signing a contract. So, if someone was forced to sign a contract under duress, that contract would likely be voidable at the option of the person who was coerced.\n\nLet me double-check that. In contract law, duress can invalidate a contract, making it voidable. The person who was under duress can choose to either affirm the contract or rescind it. So, in such a case, the contract is voidable.\n\nNow, just to make sure, let's consider if there's any way that the contract could still be enforceable even if one party was forced to sign. Well, generally, contracts require voluntary consent from both parties. If consent was not voluntary due to duress, then the contract is defective, and the coerced party can seek to have it set aside.\n\nThere might be some exceptions, like if the coerced party affirms the contract after the duress ends, but generally, a contract signed under duress is voidable.\n\nWhat about executory and unilateral contracts? Do they relate to the voluntariness of consent? Not directly. Executory refers to the performance status of the contract, and unilateral refers to the nature of the obligations. Neither of these terms directly addresses the validity of the contract based on the consent of the parties.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be D. voidable.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another perspective. Suppose that the person who was forced to sign decides not to challenge the contract. Would the contract then be enforceable? Well, yes, in practice, if the coerced party doesn't take any action to rescind the contract, the other party could try to enforce it. But that doesn't change the legal nature of the contract being voidable.\n\nSimilarly, if the contract is already fully performed by both parties, maybe it becomes executory, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the question is about the definition of such a contract, not about what happens after the fact.\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice. The answer is D. voidable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
