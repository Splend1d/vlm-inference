                    "text": "So I need to figure out in which year Berners-Lee effectively invented the web. The options are 1980, 1989, 1991, and 1993. I'm not super familiar with the history of the web, but I think I can recall some milestones.\n\nFirst off, I know that Tim Berners-Lee is credited with inventing the World Wide Web. I think he was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, around that time. Let me see if I can remember when he proposed or implemented the first web server and browser.\n\nI think in 1989, he submitted a proposal for an information management system that would become the web. Was that the year he actually invented it, or was that just the proposal?\n\nWait, maybe the proposal was in 1989, and the first web server and browser were created in 1990. If that's the case, then 1989 would be when the idea was proposed, but the actual invention might have happened later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the web was conceptualized in 1980, but that seems too early. Let me think about what was happening in 1980. Personal computers were just starting to become popular, but the internet was mostly used by academics and researchers. I don't think the web existed back then.\n\nMaybe 1991 is the correct year because I recall that in 1991, CERN put the web software into the public domain, allowing it to spread more widely. But again, that might be after the initial invention.\n\nWhat about 1993? That's when the Mosaic web browser was released, which was one of the first popular web browsers. But that's probably after the invention of the web itself.\n\nLet me try to recall the sequence of events:\n\n1. Tim Berners-Lee proposes the World Wide Web at CERN in 1989.\n\n2. He writes the first web server and browser in 1990.\n\n3. In 1991, CERN makes the web software available to the public.\n\n4. By 1993, the web is gaining popularity with browsers like Mosaic.\n\nSo, if the web was proposed in 1989 and implemented in 1990, perhaps the actual invention happened in 1989, even if the implementation took a year or two.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Maybe the invention is considered to be the proposal in 1989, or perhaps it's when the first web server was set up.\n\nI should probably look this up to get accurate information, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to make an educated guess based on what I remember.\n\nI think the web was invented in 1989, but it was implemented and went live in 1991. So, between 1989 and 1991, the web was being developed and then launched.\n\nGiven that, I would say that the effective invention was in 1989, as that's when the idea was proposed and the foundation was laid.\n\nWait, but sometimes inventions are considered to be the point when they were first implemented or demonstrated. If that's the case, then 1990 might be more accurate, since that's when the first web server and browser were created.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the question is referring to when the web was first proposed, which would be 1989, or when it was first implemented, which might be 1990.\n\nSince the question says \"effectively invented,\" I think it's referring to the year when the concept was first introduced and the foundational ideas were put forward, which is 1989.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with B. 1989 as the year when Berners-Lee effectively invented the web.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 1989} \\]"
