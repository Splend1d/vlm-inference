                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a car accident between a man and a woman. The man suddenly switched lanes without signaling, and the woman couldn't stop in time, resulting in a collision. After the accident, a pedestrian who witnessed it got very upset and yelled at the man for being careless and not using a turn signal. The pedestrian isn't identified and isn't present at the trial. Now, the question is about the admissibility of the pedestrian's statement. Let's see what the options are:\n\nA. Admissible as non-hearsay.\n\nB. Admissible, even though it is hearsay.\n\nC. Admissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is generally defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's typically inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. So, the pedestrian's statement was made outside of court, and it's being offered in court to prove that the man didn't use a turn signal.\n\nLet me think about whether this is hearsay. The pedestrian said, \"You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?\" This seems like a statement about the man's actions\u2014specifically, that he didn't use a turn signal. If the prosecution wants to use this statement to prove that the man didn't use a turn signal, then yes, that's hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nSo, option A says it's admissible as non-hearsay. But based on what I just thought, it seems like it is hearsay, so option A might not be correct.\n\nOption B says it's admissible, even though it is hearsay. Well, generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless there's an exception that applies. So, just saying it's admissible even though it's hearsay doesn't seem right unless there's an exception that makes it admissible.\n\nOption C mentions the excited utterance exception. I remember that the excited utterance exception allows for the admission of certain statements made under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition. The theory is that when someone is excited or under stress immediately after an event, their statement is more likely to be reliable because they're not having time to fabricate or think about what to say.\n\nIn this case, the pedestrian was obviously emotional and upset from having just observed the accident. So, the statement was made in the heat of the moment, right after the accident. That sounds like it could fit under the excited utterance exception.\n\nBut wait, there are some requirements for the excited utterance exception. One of them is that the statement must be made while the declarant is under the stress of excitement caused by the event. From the scenario, it says the pedestrian was \"obviously emotional and upset,\" which suggests they were under stress from witnessing the accident.\n\nAnother requirement is that the statement must be made close in time to the event. Since it was immediately after the accident, that should satisfy the temporal proximity requirement.\n\nHowever, I should consider what the pedestrian was actually saying. They were accusing the man of being careless and not using a turn signal. So, the statement is about the man's action, specifically whether he used a turn signal or not.\n\nNow, for the excited utterance exception to apply, the statement should be a spontaneous reaction to the event, not a reflective or accusatory statement. The pedestrian's statement seems to be accusatory, pointing a finger at the man for his actions. Is that still considered an excited utterance?\n\nMaybe. It depends on how the court interprets the nature of the statement. If it's seen as a spontaneous reaction expressing the pedestrian's observation immediately after the event, it could be admissible under this exception.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement could be seen as more of an accusation based on the pedestrian's observation, which might not be as spontaneous as, say, a cry of pain or an immediate description of what happened.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully. Let me look up the definition of excited utterance to make sure.\n\nAccording to the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 803(2), the excited utterance exception allows for the admission of \"a statement relating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused.\" The key points are that the statement must be about the startling event or condition and made while the declarant is still under the stress of excitement caused by that event.\n\nIn this case, the startling event is the car accident, and the pedestrian's statement was made immediately afterward while they were obviously emotional and upset. So, it seems to meet the timing and emotional state requirements.\n\nHowever, the content of the statement is crucial. If the statement is a factual assertion about what happened, such as \"He didn't use his turn signal,\" it's more likely to be admissible under this exception. If it's more of an accusatory or opinionated remark, it might be less likely to be admitted.\n\nIn this scenario, the pedestrian said, \"You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?\" This combines both a direct accusation of carelessness and a specific assertion that the man didn't use his turn signal.\n\nThe factual part, \"He didn't use his turn signal,\" seems directly relevant to the case and is a statement about what the pedestrian observed. The accusatory language might be seen as coloring the statement with emotion, but the core of the statement is still a factual assertion about the man's actions.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the court would consider this statement admissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\nBut there's another consideration here: the declarant's identity and availability. The pedestrian is not identified and is not present at trial. Normally, for hearsay exceptions, the declarant's availability can be relevant, especially for some exceptions like prior testimony or declarations against interest, where the declarant's unavailability is a requirement.\n\nHowever, for the excited utterance exception, the declarant's availability isn't a requirement. The exception is based on the reliability of the statement due to the excitement of the moment, regardless of whether the declarant is available at trial.\n\nThat being said, the fact that the pedestrian is not identified and not present might make the statement less reliable, as there's no way to cross-examine them or assess their credibility. But legally, the excited utterance exception doesn't require the declarant to be unavailable; it's more about the circumstances under which the statement was made.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the statement could still be admissible under this exception.\n\nBut wait, there's another option: D. Inadmissible because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.\n\nThis touches on the issue of the declarant's identification and availability. As I just thought, while the excited utterance exception doesn't require the declarant to be unavailable, the fact that they are not identified and not present might affect the admissibility of their statement.\n\nOne possible concern is the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right of the accused in a criminal case to be confronted with the witnesses against them. If this is a criminal case, and the pedestrian's statement is being offered against the man, then there might be Confrontation Clause issues because he can't cross-examine the pedestrian.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, excited utterances may be considered non-testimonial statements, which might not trigger the Confrontation Clause requirements. But this is a bit complicated and depends on specific case law.\n\nAssuming that the excited utterance exception applies and the statement is considered reliable enough to be admitted, even without the declarant being present, then option D might not be correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether there are any other exceptions or rules that might apply here.\n\nAnother possible exception could be the present sense impression, under Rule 803(1), which allows for the admission of a statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter. This is similar to the excited utterance but focuses more on the immediacy of the perception.\n\nIn this case, the pedestrian witnessed the accident and made the statement immediately afterward. So, it could also fit under the present sense impression exception.\n\nHowever, the excited utterance exception seems more directly applicable because the pedestrian was obviously emotional and upset, which suggests they were under stress caused by the startling event.\n\nLet me consider whether there are any other factors that might make the statement inadmissible.\n\nOne potential issue is that the pedestrian is not identified and not present at trial. This could affect the weight given to the statement, but it doesn't necessarily make it inadmissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the statement is being offered for a purpose other than proving the truth of the matter asserted. For example, if the prosecution is using the statement to show the pedestrian's state of mind or to demonstrate the man's reputation for careless driving, then it might be admissible for that purpose, regardless of whether it's hearsay.\n\nBut in this scenario, it seems clear that the statement is being offered to prove that the man didn't use his turn signal, which is the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nSo, unless there's another exception or a different rationale, it appears that the statement would be admissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer: admissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A: admissible as non-hearsay. As I thought earlier, the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, so it is hearsay. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: admissible, even though it is hearsay. This seems to acknowledge that it's hearsay but is still admissible. While this could be possible in some cases where hearsay is allowed without specifying the exception, it's not as precise as citing the specific exception that applies.\n\nOption D: inadmissible because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial. As I considered earlier, the declarant's identification and presence aren't requirements for the excited utterance exception. Therefore, this option is likely incorrect.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe that option C is the correct answer: admissible under the excited utterance exception.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
