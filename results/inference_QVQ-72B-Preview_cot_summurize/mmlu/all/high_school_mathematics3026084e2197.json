                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) is a terminating decimal and \\( n \\) contains the digit 9. The options are 32, 64, 4096, and 256.\n\nFirst, I should recall what makes a fraction a terminating decimal. I remember that a fraction terminates in decimal form if and only if its denominator, after simplification, is a product of powers of 2 and powers of 5. So, \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\) for some non-negative integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nGiven that, I need to look at each option and check two things:\n\n1. Does the number contain the digit 9?\n\n2. Is the number of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\)?\n\nLet me start by checking the smallest option, which is 32.\n\n**Option A: 32**\n\n- Does it contain the digit 9? No, it's 32.\n\n- Even if it didn't contain a 9, I'd need to check if it's of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\). 32 is \\( 2^5 \\), so it qualifies.\n\nBut since it doesn't contain the digit 9, it's not the one.\n\n**Option B: 64**\n\n- Does it contain the digit 9? No, it's 64.\n\n- It's \\( 2^6 \\), so it qualifies as a terminating decimal.\n\nAgain, no 9 in the number, so move on.\n\n**Option C: 4096**\n\n- Does it contain the digit 9? Yes, there's a 9 in it.\n\n- Now, is it of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\)? Let's see. 4096 is a power of 2. Let's check:\n\n  - \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\)\n\n  - \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\)\n\n  - \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\)\n\nSo, 4096 is \\( 2^{12} \\), which means it's of the form \\( 2^a \\), which is a subset of \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\). So, it qualifies.\n\nBut is it the smallest such number? Well, among the options, 4096 is larger than 32 and 64, so unless there's another number smaller than 4096 that also contains the digit 9 and is of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\), 4096 seems like a candidate.\n\nWait, but there's option D: 256.\n\n**Option D: 256**\n\n- Does it contain the digit 9? No, it's 256.\n\n- It's \\( 2^8 \\), so it qualifies as a terminating decimal.\n\nBut since it doesn't contain the digit 9, it's not the one.\n\nSo, among the given options, 4096 is the smallest number that contains the digit 9 and is of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\).\n\nBut wait a minute, is there a smaller number outside of these options that also satisfies the conditions? For example, is there a number smaller than 4096 that contains the digit 9 and is a power of 2 (since multiples of 5 would end with 5 or 0, and including 9 would require higher numbers, but let's check).\n\nLet me list out the powers of 2 up to 4096 and see which ones contain the digit 9.\n\n- \\( 2^0 = 1 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^1 = 2 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^4 = 16 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^7 = 128 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^8 = 256 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^9 = 512 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\) \u2192 contains 9\n\nSo, among the powers of 2, 4096 is the smallest that contains the digit 9.\n\nBut wait, what about numbers that are powers of 5? Could there be a smaller number that's a power of 5 and contains the digit 9?\n\nLet's check the powers of 5:\n\n- \\( 5^1 = 5 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 5^2 = 25 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 5^3 = 125 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 5^4 = 625 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 5^5 = 3125 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 5^6 = 15625 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 5^7 = 78125 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n- \\( 5^8 = 390625 \\) \u2192 contains 9\n\nSo, \\( 5^8 = 390625 \\) contains the digit 9. But 390625 is larger than 4096, so it's not smaller.\n\nWhat about numbers that are a product of powers of 2 and 5, other than just pure powers of 2 or 5?\n\nFor example, \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\), where both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are at least 1.\n\nLet me consider such numbers and see if any of them are smaller than 4096 and contain the digit 9.\n\nBut this seems tricky because there are infinitely many combinations of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). However, since we're dealing with small exponents (as 2^10 = 1024 and 5^3 = 125, their product is 1024 * 125 = 128,000, which is larger than 4096), I can check a few small combinations.\n\nLet's try \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\): \\( 2^1 \\times 5^1 = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\): \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\): \\( 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = 1 \\): \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\): \\( 2 \\times 125 = 250 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 1 \\): \\( 16 \\times 5 = 80 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\): \\( 2 \\times 625 = 1250 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 1 \\): \\( 32 \\times 5 = 160 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 5 \\): \\( 2 \\times 3125 = 6250 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 6 \\), \\( b = 1 \\): \\( 64 \\times 5 = 320 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 6 \\): \\( 2 \\times 15625 = 31250 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 7 \\), \\( b = 1 \\): \\( 128 \\times 5 = 640 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 7 \\): \\( 2 \\times 78125 = 156250 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 8 \\), \\( b = 1 \\): \\( 256 \\times 5 = 1280 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 8 \\): \\( 2 \\times 390625 = 781250 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\nIt seems like combining powers of 2 and 5 isn't yielding any numbers smaller than 4096 that contain the digit 9.\n\nWhat about higher exponents for b? For example, \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 2 \\): \\( 1 \\times 25 = 25 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 3 \\): \\( 1 \\times 125 = 125 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 4 \\): \\( 1 \\times 625 = 625 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 5 \\): \\( 1 \\times 3125 = 3125 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 6 \\): \\( 1 \\times 15625 = 15625 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 7 \\): \\( 1 \\times 78125 = 78125 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 8 \\): \\( 1 \\times 390625 = 390625 \\) \u2192 contains 9\n\nBut again, 390625 is larger than 4096.\n\nSimilarly, for higher a and b, the numbers get larger.\n\nTherefore, among all the options and considering the general case, 4096 seems to be the smallest number that satisfies both conditions.\n\nWait, but let's think differently. Maybe there's a smaller number that's a multiple of both powers of 2 and 5 and contains the digit 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a number smaller than 4096 that's a power of 2 multiplied by a power of 5 and contains the digit 9.\n\nLet me consider \\( n = 2^a \\times 5^b \\), and I need \\( n \\) to contain the digit 9, and be as small as possible.\n\nI can think of \\( n \\) as \\( 2^a \\times 5^b = 10^b \\times 2^{a-b} \\), but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the smallest \\( n \\) such that its decimal representation includes the digit 9, and it's of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\).\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, 4096 is the smallest among them that contains the digit 9 and is a power of 2.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any number smaller than 4096 that is a product of powers of 2 and 5 and contains the digit 9.\n\nLet me try to find the smallest number of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\) that contains the digit 9.\n\nI can fix one of the exponents and vary the other.\n\nLet's fix \\( b = 0 \\), so \\( n = 2^a \\), and find the smallest \\( a \\) such that \\( 2^a \\) contains the digit 9.\n\nFrom earlier, \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\) contains 9, and none of the smaller powers do.\n\nWhat if \\( b = 1 \\), so \\( n = 2^a \\times 5 \\).\n\nThen, \\( n = 5 \\times 2^a \\).\n\nI need to find the smallest \\( a \\) such that \\( 5 \\times 2^a \\) contains the digit 9.\n\nLet's try \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 2 \\): \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 3 \\): \\( 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 4 \\): \\( 5 \\times 16 = 80 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 5 \\): \\( 5 \\times 32 = 160 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 6 \\): \\( 5 \\times 64 = 320 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 7 \\): \\( 5 \\times 128 = 640 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 8 \\): \\( 5 \\times 256 = 1280 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 9 \\): \\( 5 \\times 512 = 2560 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 10 \\): \\( 5 \\times 1024 = 5120 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 11 \\): \\( 5 \\times 2048 = 10240 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 12 \\): \\( 5 \\times 4096 = 20480 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\nStill no 9. So, no luck here.\n\nWhat if \\( b = 2 \\), so \\( n = 2^a \\times 25 \\).\n\nThen, \\( n = 25 \\times 2^a \\).\n\nLet's try \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 25 \\times 2 = 50 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 2 \\): \\( 25 \\times 4 = 100 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 3 \\): \\( 25 \\times 8 = 200 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 4 \\): \\( 25 \\times 16 = 400 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 5 \\): \\( 25 \\times 32 = 800 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 6 \\): \\( 25 \\times 64 = 1600 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 7 \\): \\( 25 \\times 128 = 3200 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 8 \\): \\( 25 \\times 256 = 6400 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 9 \\): \\( 25 \\times 512 = 12800 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 10 \\): \\( 25 \\times 1024 = 25600 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 11 \\): \\( 25 \\times 2048 = 51200 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\n\\( a = 12 \\): \\( 25 \\times 4096 = 102400 \\) \u2192 no 9\n\nStill nothing.\n\nContinuing this pattern, it's clear that for higher b, the numbers get even larger, and it's unlikely to find a smaller number than 4096 that contains the digit 9 and is of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest such number among the options is 4096.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4096} \\]"
