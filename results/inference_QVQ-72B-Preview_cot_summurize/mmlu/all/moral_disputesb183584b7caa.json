It's about being self-governing or making your own choices without being controlled by others. But there are different facets to it, and I need to figure out which one Gill emphasizes the most.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The ability to act and choose while free from distress.\n\nThis seems important because if you're under duress or in distress, your choices might not reflect your true will. But is freedom from distress the main part of autonomy's moral value?\n\nB. The ability to choose to end one's own life.\n\nThis is a specific type of choice. Autonomy generally covers a wide range of choices, not just about ending one's life. So, maybe this is too narrow.\n\nC. The ability to make important life decisions based on our deepest values.\n\nThis sounds pretty central to autonomy. Making choices that align with who we are and what we value seems key to being autonomous.\n\nD. The duty to not interfere with the free choices of others.\n\nThis is more about respecting others' autonomy rather than exercising your own. It's an important aspect, but it's not directly about your own autonomy's moral value.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the core of autonomy is about making choices that are true to oneself, reflecting one's values and preferences. So, option C seems to capture that well. It's not just about acting without distress (though that's important), but about ensuring that the choices we make are grounded in our deepest values.\n\nOption A is about being free from distress while choosing, which is related, but it doesn't emphasize the content of the choice\u2014whether it aligns with our values or not.\n\nOption B is too specific, as it focuses only on the choice to end one's life, whereas autonomy encompasses a much broader spectrum of decisions.\n\nOption D is about not interfering with others' autonomy, which is more about our obligations towards others rather than the intrinsic value of our own autonomy.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: the ability to make important life decisions based on our deepest values.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nAutonomy is often associated with free will, rational agency, and self-determination. Making decisions based on our deepest values aligns with self-determination because we're guiding our lives according to what matters most to us.\n\nFreedom from distress is important because it ensures that our choices aren't coerced or made under duress, which could compromise their authenticity. But it's more of a condition that supports autonomous choice rather than the essence of autonomy itself.\n\nThe ability to choose to end one's own life is a contentious issue, and while it involves autonomy, it's just one aspect. Autonomy is much broader and includes everyday decisions as well as life-changing ones.\n\nAnd the duty to not interfere with others' free choices is a principle of respect for autonomy, but it's not defining the moral value of one's own autonomy.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I still think that option C best captures the moral value of autonomy as per Gill.\n\nWait a minute. Maybe I should consider if Gill has any particular emphasis on certain aspects of autonomy. Perhaps Gill focuses more on the intrinsic value of autonomous choices or on the social implications of autonomy.\n\nIf I recall correctly, some philosophers argue that autonomy is valuable because it allows individuals to live in accordance with their own conception of the good life. That sounds a lot like option C, where choices are based on one's deepest values.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that autonomy is valuable because it enables people to act without external coercion, which would lean towards option A.\n\nBut I think that option C is more comprehensive because it combines the idea of free choice with the alignment of those choices with one's values.\n\nMoreover, autonomy isn't just about making choices freely; it's about making choices that are informed and consistent with one's personal objectives and principles.\n\nTherefore, the moral value of autonomy primarily lies in the ability to make important life decisions based on our deepest values.\n\nI'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
