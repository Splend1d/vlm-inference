                    "text": "So I have this question here about buffer solutions. It's asking which pair of substances can be used to make a buffer solution. The options are:\n\nA. NaCl and HCl\n\nB. HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2\n\nC. NaBr and KBr\n\nD. HIO3 and KClO3\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what makes a buffer solution. From my chemistry classes, I recall that a buffer solution resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added to it. This is typically achieved by having a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid, present together in the solution.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to identify if there's a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.\n\nLet's start with option A: NaCl and HCl.\n\nNaCl is sodium chloride, which is a strong electrolyte and completely dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions. HCl is hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid and also completely dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions. So, in this combination, I have Cl- ions and H+ ions, which can combine to form HCl. But since both are strong, I don't think this would form an effective buffer solution. Buffers work best with weak components.\n\nMoving on to option B: HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2.\n\nHC2H3O2 is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. KC2H3O2 is potassium acetate, which provides the acetate ion, C2H3O2-, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So, here I have a weak acid and its conjugate base. This seems like a good candidate for a buffer solution.\n\nOption C: NaBr and KBr.\n\nNaBr is sodium bromide, which is a strong electrolyte, and KBr is potassium bromide, also a strong electrolyte. Both completely dissociate into their respective ions. Bromide ion, Br-, is the conjugate base of hydrobromic acid (HBr), which is a strong acid. However, since there's no weak acid present here, just the conjugate base of a strong acid, this isn't going to form a buffer solution.\n\nOption D: HIO3 and KClO3.\n\nHIO3 is periodic acid, which is a strong acid. KClO3 is potassium chlorate, which is a salt of chlorine acid (HClO3), but HClO3 is also a strong acid. So, similar to option A, both components here are strong acids or their salts. No weak acid or base is present, so this won't form a buffer solution.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option that includes a weak acid and its conjugate base is option B: HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2.\n\nJust to double-check, I remember that acetic acid is indeed a weak acid, and its conjugate base is the acetate ion, which is provided by potassium acetate. This combination is commonly used to make buffer solutions in laboratories and industry due to its effectiveness in maintaining pH stability in the acidic range.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
