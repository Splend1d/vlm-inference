                    "text": "So I need to convert the decimal number 231 into hexadecimal. I have four options: A. 17\u2081\u2086, B. E4\u2081\u2086, C. E7\u2081\u2086, D. F4\u2081\u2086. I'm not very familiar with hexadecimal, but I know it's base 16, and it uses letters for values above 9, like A for 10, B for 11, and so on up to F for 15.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall how to convert a decimal number to hexadecimal. I think the standard way is to divide the number by 16 repeatedly and keep track of the remainders. Then, the hexadecimal number is constructed from the remainders, starting from the last remainder to the first.\n\nLet me try that. So, I'll divide 231 by 16 and see what the remainder is.\n\n231 divided by 16 is 14 with a remainder of 7. So, the last digit in hexadecimal is 7.\n\nNow, I take the quotient, which is 14, and divide that by 16. 14 divided by 16 is 0 with a remainder of 14. In hexadecimal, 14 is represented by the letter E.\n\nSo, the hexadecimal number should be E7\u2081\u2086. That would make option C.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting over:\n\nConvert 231\u2081\u2080 to hexadecimal.\n\nFirst, divide 231 by 16:\n\n16 \u00d7 14 = 224, and 231 - 224 = 7. So, quotient 14, remainder 7.\n\nThen, divide 14 by 16:\n\n14 is less than 16, so quotient 0, remainder 14 (which is E).\n\nSo, reading the remainders from bottom to top, it's E7\u2081\u2086.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to confirm this? Maybe using the place value system for hexadecimal.\n\nIn hexadecimal, each digit represents a power of 16. So, the rightmost digit is 7, which is 7 \u00d7 16\u2070 = 7.\n\nThe next digit to the left is E, which is 14, so 14 \u00d7 16\u00b9 = 224.\n\nSo, adding them up: 224 + 7 = 231, which matches the original decimal number. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could try converting 231 to binary first, since I know binary and hexadecimal are related, but that might be more complicated for this problem.\n\nAnother way is to use repeated subtraction. For example, see how many times 16 goes into 231, then how many times 16 goes into the remainder, and so on.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n16 \u00d7 14 = 224\n\n231 - 224 = 7\n\nSo, again, E (14) and 7.\n\nYes, this reinforces that the correct answer is E7\u2081\u2086.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what the other options would be:\n\nA. 17\u2081\u2086: That would be 1 \u00d7 16 + 7 = 23. That's much smaller than 231.\n\nB. E4\u2081\u2086: E is 14, so 14 \u00d7 16 + 4 = 224 + 4 = 228. That's close to 231, but not quite there.\n\nD. F4\u2081\u2086: F is 15, so 15 \u00d7 16 + 4 = 240 + 4 = 244. That's larger than 231.\n\nSo, none of these match 231 except for E7\u2081\u2086, which sums up to 231.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. E7\u2081\u2086.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
