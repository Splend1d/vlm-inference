As consideration for the loan, the man executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the apartment building. The mortgage was dated January 1, 2008, and was recorded January 2, 2008. Thereafter, on February 1, 2008, the man executed a deed absolute on the apartment building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the man then delivered the deed to an escrow agent in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the man failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1, 2009, the man failed to pay the note when it came due. The next day, the escrow agent delivered the deed to the apartment building to the friend. The friend then properly recorded this deed on January 3. One week later, on January 10, the friend conveyed the apartment building by warranty deed to an investor for the purchase price of $200,000. On January 12, the man tendered the $125,000 balance due to the friend, which he refused to accept. The man now brings an appropriate action against the friend and the investor to set aside the conveyance and to permit the redemption of the property by the man. Which of the following best states the man's legal rights, if any, in his action against the friend and the investor?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what rights the man has in his action against his friend and the investor. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the man owns a four-story apartment building. He borrows $125,000 from his friend to make improvements. As security for this loan, he signs a promissory note for $125,000 payable in one year, and he also secures it with a mortgage on the apartment building. The mortgage is dated January 1, 2008, and recorded on January 2, 2008.\n\nThen, on February 1, 2008, he executes a deed absolute on the apartment building, naming his friend as the grantee. But this deed, although it looks like an outright transfer, was actually intended just as additional security for the debt. So, it's kind of like a security interest, but it's worded as a full transfer of ownership.\n\nTo avoid judicial foreclosure and to eliminate the right to redeem, he puts this deed into escrow with an agent, instructing the agent to deliver the deed to the friend if he fails to pay the promissory note at maturity.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, the man doesn't pay the note when it comes due. The next day, the escrow agent delivers the deed to the friend, who then records it on January 3.\n\nOne week later, on January 10, the friend sells the apartment building to an investor for $200,000 via a warranty deed.\n\nNow, on January 12, the man tries to pay the $125,000 balance to the friend, but the friend refuses to accept it. The man then brings a legal action to set aside the conveyance and to allow him to redeem the property.\n\nI need to determine which of the provided options best states the man's legal rights in this action.\n\nLet me consider the sequence of events and the possible legal implications.\n\nFirst, the man borrowed money from his friend and secured it with a mortgage on the apartment building. That's pretty standard. Then, he executed a deed absolute to the friend, but it was intended as additional security, not as an actual transfer of ownership. This seems like a questionable move because a deed absolute typically transfers all rights in the property to the grantee.\n\nPutting it in escrow with instructions to deliver it if the note isn't paid suggests that the parties intended this deed to function similarly to a power of sale in a mortgage, where the lender can sell the property if the borrower defaults.\n\nHowever, the man defaulted on the note, and the friend received the deed from escrow and recorded it. Then, the friend sold the property to an investor.\n\nThe man later tried to pay the $125,000, but it was after the due date, and the friend refused it. Now, the man wants to set aside the conveyance and redeem the property.\n\nI need to think about whether this deed was a true sale or just additional security. If it was intended as security, then perhaps the man has some rights to redeem the property after paying the debt.\n\nBut the friend recorded the deed, which might give him good title, especially if the investor bought the property in good faith without knowing about the man's intentions or rights.\n\nLet me consider the concept of \"equitable redemption.\" In many jurisdictions, even after a mortgage defaults, the borrower has a right to redeem the property by paying the debt plus any accrued interest and costs before the property is foreclosed or sold.\n\nHowever, in this case, the friend didn't go through a formal foreclosure process; instead, he received the deed through the escrow arrangement and then sold the property.\n\nThe man's argument might be that the deed was intended only as security and not as an actual transfer of ownership, so he should still have the right to pay off the debt and get his property back.\n\nBut the friend might argue that since the man defaulted, and the deed was delivered per the escrow instructions, the transfer is valid, and the man has lost his rights in the property.\n\nMoreover, the friend sold the property to an investor, who likely bought it in good faith, relying on the deed he received from the friend.\n\nSo, the investor might have protected status as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any defects in the title.\n\nIf that's the case, then the investor likely has good title to the property, and the man might not be able to set aside the conveyance to the investor.\n\nHowever, the man might have a claim against the friend for the excess amount received from the sale, since the property was sold for $200,000, which is $75,000 more than the debt ($200,000 - $125,000 = $75,000).\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a secured party sells the collateral and gets more than the debt, the excess should be returned to the debtor.\n\nSo, perhaps the man can't set aside the conveyance to the investor, but he might be able to claim the $75,000 excess from the friend.\n\nBut the question is about setting aside the conveyance and allowing redemption of the property by the man.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The man has no rights against the investor but has an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.\n\nB. The man has no rights against the friend but has an action for redemption against the investor for the value of the property.\n\nC. The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but cannot set aside the conveyance.\n\nD. The man has no rights against either the friend or the investor because he defaulted on the promissory note.\n\nI think option D is too extreme. Just because he defaulted doesn't mean he has no rights at all. There might be rights related to the excess proceeds or other aspects.\n\nOption B suggests he has no rights against the friend but can seek redemption from the investor. That seems unlikely because the investor likely bought the property in good faith and recorded the deed.\n\nOption C says he can seek redemption from either the friend or the investor but can't set aside the conveyance. That might be possible, but I'm not sure about seeking redemption from the friend after the property has been sold to the investor.\n\nOption A seems the most plausible. The man might not have rights against the investor because the investor bought the property in good faith and recorded the deed. However, he might have an action against the friend for the value of the property, possibly seeking to set aside the conveyance to the investor or seeking damages.\n\nBut the question specifies that the man is bringing an action to set aside the conveyance and to permit redemption of the property by the man. So, it's targeting both setting aside the conveyance and allowing redemption.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the investor is an innocent purchaser, it's unlikely that the court would set aside the conveyance to the investor. The investor likely has superior title.\n\nTherefore, the man probably can't set aside the conveyance to the investor, but he might have a claim against the friend for the value of the property or for the excess proceeds from the sale.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is the closest, but it says \"no rights against the investor, but action for redemption against the friend.\" However, redemption typically means paying the debt to get the property back, but in this case, the property has already been sold to the investor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man can seek to have the friend account for the proceeds of the sale, including the excess $75,000.\n\nBut the question is specifically about setting aside the conveyance and permitting redemption by the man.\n\nI think the man might not have the right to set aside the conveyance to the investor, as the investor is a bona fide purchaser. However, he might have some rights against the friend regarding the proceeds of the sale.\n\nTherefore, option A seems the most accurate: he has no rights against the investor but may have an action for redemption against the friend, possibly for the value of the property or for the excess proceeds.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because once the friend sold the property to the investor, and the investor recorded the deed, the investor likely has clear title, and the man's rights are probably against the friend, not the investor.\n\nSo, perhaps the man can't set aside the conveyance to the investor, but he can seek remedies against the friend for the value of the property or the excess proceeds.\n\nTherefore, option A seems the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
