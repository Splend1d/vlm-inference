                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, or first not wrong and second wrong. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: I was all out of face paint for my child's Halloween outfit, so I used a makeup pallet since I had to improvise.\n\nHmm, so someone is making a Halloween costume for their child and runs out of face paint. They decide to use a makeup palette instead to improvise. Now, is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, Halloween is a time when kids dress up and often wear face paint or makeup as part of their costumes. Using makeup instead of face paint might not be ideal, but is it morally wrong? I don't think so. It seems like a harmless act of creativity and problem-solving to make sure the child has a complete costume.\n\nI can't see anything inherently immoral about trying to help your child look the part for Halloween by using what you have on hand. Unless there's some context I'm missing, like the makeup being\u6709\u6bd2 or something, but the scenario doesn't indicate that.\n\nSo, for scenario one, I would say \"not wrong.\"\n\nSecond scenario: I like Bill, and he doesn't know me; I'm planted one on him to see if sparks would fly.\n\nOkay, so someone likes Bill, but he doesn't know them, and they decide to kiss him to see if there's a connection.\n\nThis seems trickier. Kissing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong, especially if the person doesn't know you. It's important to respect people's boundaries and obtain consent before engaging in any physical affection.\n\nIn this case, since Bill doesn't know the person, it's unlikely that he's given consent for them to kiss him. Kissing someone without their knowledge or consent can be seen as invasive and disrespectful of their personal space.\n\nMoreover, this kind of action can make the other person feel uncomfortable, violated, or even threatened. It's not a appropriate way to introduce oneself or to express interest in someone.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, kissing someone without their consent is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, for scenario two, I would say \"wrong.\"\n\nNow, putting it together, the first scenario is \"not wrong,\" and the second is \"wrong.\" So, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn scenario one, using makeup instead of face paint for a Halloween costume seems innocuous and even resourceful. There doesn't seem to be any harm or moral wrongdoing there.\n\nIn scenario two, kissing someone without their consent is a clear violation of personal boundaries and is considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
