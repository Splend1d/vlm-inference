Let's see, oligopoly is a market structure where there are a few large firms that dominate the market, right? So, few firms\u2014that sounds like option D. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, option C says strong barriers to entry. From what I remember, oligopolies have barriers to entry that make it hard for new firms to join the market. So, that should be a characteristic of oligopoly.\n\nOption B is \"price-maker.\" Hmm, in perfect competition, firms are price-takers because there are so many firms that no single firm can influence the price. But in oligopoly, since there are fewer firms, each firm can affect the market price. So, they are price-makers to some extent. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nOption A is P = MC. Wait a minute, in perfect competition, in the long run, firms reach a point where price equals marginal cost (P = MC). But in oligopoly, I don't think that's the case. Let me think about this.\n\nIn oligopoly, firms may set prices based on various factors like collusion, game theory, or following a dominant firm's pricing strategy. So, it's not necessarily that P = MC. Maybe P is greater than MC in oligopoly, similar to monopoly where firms can set prices above marginal cost to maximize profits.\n\nLet me double-check that. In monopoly, the profit-maximizing condition is MR = MC, and since MR < P, then P > MC. I think it's similar in oligopoly, especially if firms are acting like a monopoly or colluding to set prices.\n\nSo, if in oligopoly P is greater than MC, then P = MC would not be a characteristic of oligopoly. That suggests that option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there are some specific types of oligopoly where P = MC holds true. For example, in contestable markets, even with few firms, competition can be so intense that prices are driven down to marginal cost. But I think that's more of an exception rather than the general rule for oligopoly.\n\nIn the standard model of oligopoly, like the Cournot model or the Bertrand model, firms don't necessarily set P = MC. In Cournot competition, firms set quantities, and in Bertrand competition, they set prices. In Bertrand competition, if firms can't collude, they might end up setting prices equal to marginal cost, leading to perfect competition outcomes.\n\nHowever, in real-world oligopolies, collusion or tacit understanding among firms is common, leading to prices being set above marginal cost to maximize collective profits.\n\nGiven that, it seems that P = MC is not a general characteristic of oligopoly. It might hold in some specific cases, but it's not a defining feature.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that option A, P = MC, is not a characteristic of oligopoly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
