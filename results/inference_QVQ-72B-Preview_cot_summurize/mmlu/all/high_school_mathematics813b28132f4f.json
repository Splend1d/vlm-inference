                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"Where, in the first quadrant, does the rose r = sin 3\u03b8 have a vertical tangent? The options are A. nowhere, B. \u03b8 = 0.39, C. \u03b8 = 0.47, D. \u03b8 = 0.52.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a polar equation r = sin 3\u03b8, which is a rose curve with 3 petals because the coefficient of \u03b8 is 3. But wait, sin 3\u03b8 actually gives 3 petals, not 6, because it's sine and not cosine. I think it's 3 petals, but I should double-check that.\n\nActually, for r = sin(n\u03b8), if n is odd, it has n petals, and if n is even, it has 2n petals. So since n=3, it should have 3 petals. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, a vertical tangent in polar coordinates usually occurs where the slope of the tangent line is either positive or negative infinity, which means the derivative dy/dx is undefined. In calculus, we know that dy/dx = (dy/d\u03b8)/(dx/d\u03b8), so a vertical tangent occurs when dx/d\u03b8 = 0 and dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nSo, I need to find \u03b8 in the first quadrant where dx/d\u03b8 = 0 and dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0 for the curve r = sin 3\u03b8.\n\nFirst, I should parametrize the curve in terms of x and y.\n\nGiven r = sin 3\u03b8,\n\nx = r cos \u03b8 = sin 3\u03b8 * cos \u03b8\n\ny = r sin \u03b8 = sin 3\u03b8 * sin \u03b8\n\nNow, find dx/d\u03b8 and dy/d\u03b8.\n\nLet's compute dx/d\u03b8:\n\nx = sin 3\u03b8 * cos \u03b8\n\nUsing the product rule:\n\ndx/d\u03b8 = (d/d\u03b8 sin 3\u03b8) * cos \u03b8 + sin 3\u03b8 * (d/d\u03b8 cos \u03b8)\n\n= (3 cos 3\u03b8) * cos \u03b8 + sin 3\u03b8 * (-sin \u03b8)\n\n= 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\nSimilarly, dy/d\u03b8:\n\ny = sin 3\u03b8 * sin \u03b8\n\ndy/d\u03b8 = (d/d\u03b8 sin 3\u03b8) * sin \u03b8 + sin 3\u03b8 * (d/d\u03b8 sin \u03b8)\n\n= (3 cos 3\u03b8) * sin \u03b8 + sin 3\u03b8 * cos \u03b8\n\n= 3 cos 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 + sin 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nNow, for a vertical tangent, dx/d\u03b8 = 0 and dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nSo, set dx/d\u03b8 = 0:\n\n3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nLet me see if I can simplify this.\n\nMaybe I can factor:\n\ncos 3\u03b8 (3 cos \u03b8) - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe I can use some trigonometric identities here.\n\nI recall that cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b) = cos(a + b), but there's an extra 3 in front of the first cos term. Maybe I can factor differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor out cos 3\u03b8:\n\ncos 3\u03b8 (3 cos \u03b8) - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nNo, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I need to consider combining the terms differently.\n\nLet me see: 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 = sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 (assuming they're not zero):\n\n3 cot \u03b8 = tan 3\u03b8\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express sin 3\u03b8 and cos 3\u03b8 in terms of single angles.\n\nI know that sin 3\u03b8 = 3 sin \u03b8 - 4 sin^3 \u03b8\n\nAnd cos 3\u03b8 = 4 cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 cos \u03b8\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n\n3 (4 cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 cos \u03b8) cos \u03b8 - (3 sin \u03b8 - 4 sin^3 \u03b8) sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n3 (4 cos^4 \u03b8 - 3 cos^2 \u03b8) - (3 sin^2 \u03b8 - 4 sin^4 \u03b8) = 0\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n12 cos^4 \u03b8 - 9 cos^2 \u03b8 - 3 sin^2 \u03b8 + 4 sin^4 \u03b8 = 0\n\nHmm, that seems messy. Maybe I can express everything in terms of cos \u03b8 or sin \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity cos 3\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8 + \u03b8) = cos 2\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 2\u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\nAnd sin 3\u03b8 = sin(2\u03b8 + \u03b8) = sin 2\u03b8 cos \u03b8 + cos 2\u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nMaybe I should try a different approach. Instead of setting dx/d\u03b8 = 0, perhaps I can use the condition for a vertical tangent in polar coordinates.\n\nI recall that a vertical tangent occurs when d\u03b8/dx = 0, which is when d\u03b8/dx = 0 and dr/d\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to be careful here. The condition for a vertical tangent in polar coordinates is when the polar angle \u03b8 of the radius vector is such that the angle between the tangent line and the radius vector is 90 degrees.\n\nBut that seems a bit involved. Maybe I should stick with the parametric approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the slope of the tangent line in polar coordinates. The slope dy/dx is given by (dy/d\u03b8)/(dx/d\u03b8), and a vertical tangent occurs when dx/d\u03b8 = 0 and dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nSo, going back to that, I have:\n\ndx/d\u03b8 = 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nAnd dy/d\u03b8 = 3 cos 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 + sin 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 \u2260 0\n\nI need to solve dx/d\u03b8 = 0 for \u03b8 in the first quadrant (0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2).\n\nLet me try to solve 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nI can factor:\n\ncos 3\u03b8 (3 cos \u03b8) - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe I can use the identity for cos(a + b):\n\ncos a cos b - sin a sin b = cos(a + b)\n\nSo, 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 3 cos(3\u03b8 + \u03b8) = 3 cos 4\u03b8\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the identity applies to cos a cos b - sin a sin b = cos(a + b), but here it's 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8, which doesn't directly fit into that form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider dividing both sides by cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8:\n\n(3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8)/(cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3 cot \u03b8 - tan 3\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo, 3 cot \u03b8 = tan 3\u03b8\n\nNow, tan 3\u03b8 = 3 cot \u03b8\n\nHmm, that seems a bit circular. Maybe I can express everything in terms of tan \u03b8.\n\nRecall that cot \u03b8 = 1/tan \u03b8 and tan 3\u03b8 = (3 tan \u03b8 - tan^3 \u03b8)/(1 - 3 tan^2 \u03b8)\n\nSo, set tan 3\u03b8 = 3 cot \u03b8\n\nWhich is (3 tan \u03b8 - tan^3 \u03b8)/(1 - 3 tan^2 \u03b8) = 3/tan \u03b8\n\nLet me set tan \u03c6 = tan \u03b8, for simplicity.\n\nThen, (3 \u03c6 - \u03c6^3)/(1 - 3 \u03c6^2) = 3/\u03c6\n\nMultiply both sides by \u03c6(1 - 3 \u03c6^2):\n\n3 \u03c6^2 - \u03c6^4 = 3(1 - 3 \u03c6^2)\n\nExpand:\n\n3 \u03c6^2 - \u03c6^4 = 3 - 9 \u03c6^2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n- \u03c6^4 + 3 \u03c6^2 + 9 \u03c6^2 - 3 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n- \u03c6^4 + 12 \u03c6^2 - 3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\u03c6^4 - 12 \u03c6^2 + 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quartic equation in terms of \u03c6^2. Let me set x = \u03c6^2, then:\n\nx^2 - 12 x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [12 \u00b1 sqrt(144 - 12)] / 2 = [12 \u00b1 sqrt(132)] / 2 = [12 \u00b1 2 sqrt(33)] / 2 = 6 \u00b1 sqrt(33)\n\nNow, since x = \u03c6^2 = tan^2 \u03b8, and \u03b8 is in the first quadrant, tan \u03b8 > 0, so we take the positive root.\n\nSo, x = 6 + sqrt(33)\n\nThen, tan \u03b8 = sqrt(x) = sqrt(6 + sqrt(33))\n\nNow, I need to find \u03b8 such that tan \u03b8 = sqrt(6 + sqrt(33))\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I can compute the numerical value.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(33):\n\nsqrt(33) \u2248 5.744\n\nSo, 6 + 5.744 \u2248 11.744\n\nThen, sqrt(11.744) \u2248 3.427\n\nSo, tan \u03b8 \u2248 3.427\n\nNow, \u03b8 = arctan(3.427)\n\nUsing a calculator, arctan(3.427) \u2248 1.29 radians or in degrees, about 74 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for \u03b8 in radians, and the options are given in radians.\n\nNow, 1.29 radians is approximately 0.202 radians more than \u03c0/2, which is 1.57 radians. But that's outside the first quadrant because the first quadrant is from 0 to \u03c0/2 radians.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the first quadrant is from 0 to \u03c0/2, and \u03b8 must be less than \u03c0/2 for tan \u03b8 to be defined in the first quadrant.\n\nBut according to my calculation, \u03b8 \u2248 1.29 radians, which is greater than \u03c0/2 \u2248 1.57 radians. That would place it in the second quadrant, but the problem specifies the first quadrant.\n\nThere must be an error in my approach.\n\nLet me double-check the steps.\n\nFirst, I set up the condition for a vertical tangent: dx/d\u03b8 = 0 and dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nThen, I found dx/d\u03b8 = 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nI tried to solve this equation and ended up with tan \u03b8 = sqrt(6 + sqrt(33)), which led to \u03b8 \u2248 1.29 radians, which is outside the first quadrant.\n\nBut \u03b8 must be less than \u03c0/2 for the first quadrant.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming that tan \u03b8 = sqrt(6 + sqrt(33)) is the correct expression.\n\nLet me revisit the equation:\n\nFrom dx/d\u03b8 = 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nI can write this as:\n\ncos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 = (1/3) sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8:\n\ncot 3\u03b8 = (1/3) tan \u03b8\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for cos(a + b):\n\ncos(a + b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b\n\nSo, 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nWait, that's similar to cos(3\u03b8 + \u03b8) = cos 4\u03b8, but there's a factor of 3 in front of the first term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of single angles using multiple-angle identities.\n\nLet me recall that cos 3\u03b8 = 4 cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 cos \u03b8\n\nAnd sin 3\u03b8 = 3 sin \u03b8 - 4 sin^3 \u03b8\n\nSubstituting these into dx/d\u03b8:\n\n3 (4 cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 cos \u03b8) cos \u03b8 - (3 sin \u03b8 - 4 sin^3 \u03b8) sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n12 cos^4 \u03b8 - 9 cos^2 \u03b8 - 3 sin^2 \u03b8 + 4 sin^4 \u03b8 = 0\n\nThis still looks messy. Maybe I can express everything in terms of cos \u03b8 or sin \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that sin 3\u03b8 = 3 sin \u03b8 cos^2 \u03b8 - sin^3 \u03b8\n\nAnd cos 3\u03b8 = cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 sin^2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nSubstituting these into dx/d\u03b8:\n\n3 (cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 sin^2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8) cos \u03b8 - (3 sin \u03b8 - 4 sin^3 \u03b8) sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n3 cos^4 \u03b8 - 9 sin^2 \u03b8 cos^2 \u03b8 - 3 sin^2 \u03b8 + 4 sin^4 \u03b8 = 0\n\nStill complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the general condition for a vertical tangent in polar coordinates.\n\nI recall that for a polar curve r = f(\u03b8), a vertical tangent occurs where (dr/d\u03b8) sin \u03b8 + r cos \u03b8 = 0\n\nWait, I think that's for a horizontal tangent. Let me check.\n\nActually, the condition for a vertical tangent in polar coordinates is when the derivative of the curve with respect to \u03b8 is such that the tangent line is vertical.\n\nIn parametric form, x = r cos \u03b8 and y = r sin \u03b8, then dy/dx = (dy/d\u03b8)/(dx/d\u03b8)\n\nA vertical tangent occurs when dx/d\u03b8 = 0 and dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nSo, going back to that, dx/d\u03b8 = 0 and dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0.\n\nWe already have dx/d\u03b8 = 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 0\n\nAnd dy/d\u03b8 = 3 cos 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 + sin 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 \u2260 0\n\nNow, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities to simplify dx/d\u03b8 = 0.\n\nRecall that cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b) = cos(a + b)\n\nSo, 3 cos 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8 - sin 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 = 3 cos(3\u03b8 + \u03b8) = 3 cos 4\u03b8 = 0\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 3 cos 4\u03b8 = 0 \u21d2 cos 4\u03b8 = 0\n\nTherefore, 4\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 + k\u03c0, for any integer k.\n\nIn the first quadrant, \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, so 4\u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\nSo, 4\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 or 4\u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2\n\nThus, \u03b8 = \u03c0/8 or \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/8\n\nNow, check if dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0 at these points.\n\nCompute dy/d\u03b8:\n\ndy/d\u03b8 = 3 cos 3\u03b8 sin \u03b8 + sin 3\u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nAt \u03b8 = \u03c0/8:\n\nsin 3*(\u03c0/8) = sin (3\u03c0/8)\n\ncos 3*(\u03c0/8) = cos (3\u03c0/8)\n\nsin(\u03c0/8) and cos(\u03c0/8)\n\nSimilarly at \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/8.\n\nI need to ensure that dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0 at these points.\n\nLet me compute dy/d\u03b8 at \u03b8 = \u03c0/8:\n\ndy/d\u03b8 = 3 cos(3\u03c0/8) sin(\u03c0/8) + sin(3\u03c0/8) cos(\u03c0/8)\n\nUsing the sine addition formula, sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b\n\nSo, dy/d\u03b8 = sin(3\u03c0/8 + \u03c0/8) = sin(4\u03c0/8) = sin(\u03c0/2) = 1 \u2260 0\n\nSimilarly, at \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/8:\n\ndy/d\u03b8 = 3 cos(9\u03c0/8) sin(3\u03c0/8) + sin(9\u03c0/8) cos(3\u03c0/8)\n\nNote that cos(9\u03c0/8) = cos(\u03c0 + \u03c0/8) = -cos(\u03c0/8)\n\nsin(9\u03c0/8) = sin(\u03c0 + \u03c0/8) = -sin(\u03c0/8)\n\nSo, dy/d\u03b8 = 3*(-cos(\u03c0/8))*sin(3\u03c0/8) + (-sin(\u03c0/8))*cos(3\u03c0/8)\n\n= -3 cos(\u03c0/8) sin(3\u03c0/8) - sin(\u03c0/8) cos(3\u03c0/8)\n\n= - [3 cos(\u03c0/8) sin(3\u03c0/8) + sin(\u03c0/8) cos(3\u03c0/8)]\n\n= - sin(3\u03c0/8 + \u03c0/8) = - sin(4\u03c0/8) = - sin(\u03c0/2) = -1 \u2260 0\n\nSo, at both \u03b8 = \u03c0/8 and \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/8, dy/d\u03b8 \u2260 0, which satisfies the condition for a vertical tangent.\n\nNow, convert these \u03b8 values to decimal form to match the options.\n\nFirst, \u03c0/8 radians is approximately 0.3927 radians.\n\n3\u03c0/8 is approximately 1.178 radians, which is still in the first quadrant (since \u03c0/2 \u2248 1.57 radians).\n\nWait a minute, but the"
