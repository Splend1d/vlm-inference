                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to match these concepts with the correct stage in Piaget's theory of cognitive development. I remember that Piaget had four main stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each stage is characterized by specific cognitive abilities that develop as a child grows.\n\nFirst, option A says centration\u2014concrete operational stage. Hmm, centration is when a child focuses on one aspect of a situation and ignores others. I think that's more associated with the preoperational stage, not the concrete operational stage. Let me double-check that.\n\nIn the preoperational stage, children are known for centration because they can't yet consider multiple dimensions simultaneously. For example, they might focus only on the height of a liquid column and not on its width when comparing amounts. So, this seems misplaced; it should be preoperational, not concrete operational.\n\nNext, option B: egocentrism\u2014sensorimotor stage. Egocentrism is the inability to see things from another person's perspective. I recall that this is a characteristic of the preoperational stage, not the sensorimotor stage. In the sensorimotor stage, children are mostly focused on developing motor skills and object permanence. They don't yet have the mental structures to understand other people's points of view. So, this seems incorrect as well.\n\nOption C: hypothetical-deductive reasoning\u2014formal operational stage. This sounds promising. Hypothetical-deductive reasoning is the ability to think abstractly and to consider possibilities that aren't immediately present. I believe this is a key feature of the formal operational stage, which typically begins around adolescence. During this stage, individuals can think about abstract concepts and can formulate and test hypotheses systematically. So, this seems correctly matched.\n\nLastly, option D: object permanence\u2014preoperational stage. Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they're out of sight. While the preoperational stage does involve some progress in understanding objects, I think that object permanence is primarily developed in the sensorimotor stage. In fact, it's one of the major achievements of that stage. So, this pairing is incorrect; it should be sensorimotor stage.\n\nAfter reviewing these, it seems that option C is the correctly matched pair: hypothetical-deductive reasoning and the formal operational stage.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I'm not missing something. In Piaget's theory, the formal operational stage is characterized by the development of abstract thinking, the ability to hypothesize, and the use of deductive logic. So, hypothetical-deductive reasoning fits perfectly with this stage.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly summarize what each stage is about:\n\n1. Sensorimotor stage (birth to approximately 2 years): Focuses on sensory and motor development, including object permanence.\n\n2. Preoperational stage (approximately 2 to 7 years): Children begin to use symbols and language but think in a more egocentric and concrete manner.\n\n3. Concrete operational stage (approximately 7 to 11 years): Logical operations develop, but they are still tied to concrete experiences.\n\n4. Formal operational stage (approximately 11 years and up): Abstract thinking emerges, and individuals can consider hypothetical situations and use deductive reasoning.\n\nGiven this, option C is indeed the correct match. So, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
