                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Delta Burke's character does on the sitcom \"Designing Women.\" Let me think about this. I remember that \"Designing Women\" is a show about a group of women who work together in a design firm in Georgia. The main characters are Suzanne, Julia, Mary Alice, and Bernice. Delta Burke played the character Suzanne Sugarbaker.\n\nNow, the question is asking about Suzanne's specific job on the show. The options are fashion designer, graphic designer, interior designer, or website designer. Hmm, I need to recall what Suzanne did in the series.\n\nI think Suzanne was an interior designer. Yeah, that sounds familiar. She was known for her elaborate and sometimes over-the-top designs. I remember an episode where she redecorated a bathroom in a very extravagant way, and another where she helped design a space for a prominent family in town.\n\nLet me double-check that. In the show, Suzanne Sugarbaker was one of the partners in the design firm, Sugarbaker & Associates, which specialized in interior design. So, that would make her an interior designer, right?\n\nWait a minute, could she have been a fashion designer instead? No, I don't think so. I recall that she had a great sense of style and was very fashionable, but her actual job was interior design.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure. Graphic designer? No, that doesn't ring a bell. Website designer? That seems unlikely, as the show was set in the 1980s and early 1990s, when websites weren't as prevalent.\n\nFashion designer seems plausible, but I'm pretty confident that her role was an interior designer. Maybe I should think about some specific episodes to confirm.\n\nThere was an episode where Suzanne redesigned the mayor's office, turning it into a more modern and elegant space. Another time, she helped a client create a nursery for their new baby, incorporating a lot of personal touches and themes.\n\nAlso, I remember that Suzanne had a flair for dramatic entrances and exits, often showcasing her design choices in grand fashion. That seems more aligned with interior design rather than fashion or graphic design.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there was any mention of her working on fashion designs or graphics. No, I don't recall any instances where she was involved in fashion design or graphic design projects.\n\nWebsite design is definitely out of the question given the time period of the show. So, that leaves interior design as the most logical choice.\n\nMoreover, the title of the show is \"Designing Women,\" which suggests that the women are involved in some form of design profession, most likely interior design, given the context I remember.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Delta Burke's character, Suzanne Sugarbaker, was an interior designer on the sitcom \"Designing Women.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. interior designer}} \\]"
