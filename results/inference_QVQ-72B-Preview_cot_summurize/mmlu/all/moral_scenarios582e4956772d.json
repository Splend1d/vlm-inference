                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: \"I often sell used books online that I found on my bookshelf.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I scratched her wound.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is selling used books they found on their own bookshelf online. And in Scenario 2, someone is scratching another person's wound. I need to determine which of these actions is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me start by considering Scenario 1. Selling used books found on one's own bookshelf online. Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, first, I need to think about ownership. If these books belong to the person selling them, then it seems fine. But what if the books don't belong to them? For example, if someone borrowed a book from a friend and then sold it, that would be wrong because it's not their property to sell. However, the scenario says \"I found on my bookshelf,\" which implies that these are books that are part of their personal collection. So, assuming they own these books, selling them should be okay. It's like selling any other personal possession.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the books were borrowed and never returned, or perhaps they were gifts, or something like that. But the scenario specifies that they found them on their own bookshelf, so presumably, they own them. Unless there's some context missing, it seems reasonable to assume that selling one's own books is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, what about Scenario 2: \"I scratched her wound.\" This seems more straightforward. Scratching someone else's wound could be harmful, and generally, causing harm to others is considered morally wrong. But let's think about the context. Is there any situation where scratching someone's wound could be acceptable?\n\nWell, perhaps if it's part of a medical procedure, like debriding a wound, but in that case, it would be done by a medical professional with consent and for the patient's benefit. But assuming that the person doing the scratching is not a medical professional and doesn't have consent, then yes, it's likely morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's not that straightforward. What if the person with the wound consented to have it scratched, perhaps because it was itching or something? Consensual actions can sometimes be morally acceptable, depending on the circumstances. But even then, scratching a wound could be risky and might cause infection or further injury, so it's still questionable.\n\nGiven that, and without more context, it seems reasonable to conclude that scratching someone else's wound is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Selling used books found on one's own bookshelf online \u2013 Not wrong (assuming they own the books).\n\n- Scenario 2: Scratching her wound \u2013 Wrong (unless there's consent and medical justification, which isn't specified here).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this conclusion.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any possibility that selling one's own books could be morally wrong? Well, perhaps if the books were stolen or if selling them would harm someone else unnecessarily. For example, if someone sold a book that was a gift and the giver finds out and feels offended, but that seems like a personal issue rather than a moral one. Generally, selling one's own possessions is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, is there any way that scratching someone's wound could be morally acceptable without consent or medical justification? It's hard to think of a scenario where intentionally causing pain or potential harm to another person's wound is morally permissible. So, it seems pretty clear that it's wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
