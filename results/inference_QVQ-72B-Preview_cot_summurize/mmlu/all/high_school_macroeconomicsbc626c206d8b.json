                    "text": "So I have this question about business cycles, and I need to pick which statement is correct. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that business cycles occur infrequently in capitalist economies. Hmm, I thought business cycles were pretty regular features of capitalist economies. Maybe not infrequent. But I'm not entirely sure about the frequency.\n\nOption B refers to reusing resources in production. That sounds more like recycling or sustainability practices, not directly related to business cycles. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nOption C says business cycles are predictable ups and downs in economic activity. Predictable? Well, I know that economists can observe patterns in business cycles, but predicting them precisely seems tricky. Maybe they're more cyclical than completely predictable.\n\nOption D states that each business cycle is comprised of a recession and an expansion. That sounds familiar. Business cycles typically involve phases of expansion and contraction, right? So, recession is the contraction phase, and expansion is the growth phase. That seems to make sense.\n\nLet me think again. Business cycles are indeed a characteristic of capitalist economies. They involve fluctuations in economic activity, moving through periods of growth (expansion) and decline (recession). So, option D seems to capture that essence.\n\nOption A suggests they occur infrequently, but from what I recall, business cycles can be quite regular, occurring every few years or so. For example, in the United States, the average length of a business cycle since 1854 is about 5.5 years. So, infrequent might not be the best description.\n\nOption B seems unrelated because it's talking about reusing resources in production, which is more about efficiency or environmental practices, not the fluctuation of economic activity.\n\nOption C mentions that business cycles are predictable. While there are models and indicators that can help forecast business cycles, they aren't entirely predictable. There's always uncertainty in economic forecasting. So, calling them predictable might be a bit of a stretch.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement among the options is D: each business cycle is comprised of a recession and an expansion. That accurately describes the basic structure of a business cycle.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there are any exceptions or special cases. Sometimes, business cycles can have different phases or variations, but the general pattern is expansion followed by recession, and then another expansion, and so on. So, option D still seems correct.\n\nI think I'll go with D as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
