Downward. Hmm, I need to recall what abduction specifically refers to in the context of the foot.\n\nI know that in general anatomy, abduction is the movement of a body part away from the midline of the body. For example, if you abduct your arm, you're moving it away from your side. But the foot is a bit different because it's at the end of the leg, and its movements are relative to the ankle joint.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the foot and ankle. The ankle joint allows movement primarily in two directions: dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, which are moving the foot upwards and downwards, respectively. But abduction and adduction involve lateral movements.\n\nAbduction of the foot typically refers to moving the foot away from the midline of the body, which would be outward. So, if I'm standing facing forward, abducting my foot would mean turning it outward, away from the midline.\n\nAdduction would be the opposite, moving the foot towards the midline, or inward. So, if my foot is pointed outward and I adduct it, I'm bringing it back towards the center line of my body.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is B. Outward. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that in the transverse plane, movements like abduction and adduction occur around the ankle joint. Abduction involves moving the foot laterally, which is outward from the body's midline, and adduction is medially, towards the midline.\n\nSo, in summary, when the foot is abducted, it's moved outward from the midline of the body.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance it could be considered upward or downward? No, upward and downward movements of the foot are more accurately described as dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Outward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
