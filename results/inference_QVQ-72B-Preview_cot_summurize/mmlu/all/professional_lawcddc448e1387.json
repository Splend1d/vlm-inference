                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a traffic accident involving a motorcycle, a car, and a truck. The motorcyclist was injured and sued both the car driver and the truck driver. The jury found that all three parties were negligent, with the motorcyclist being 55% at fault, the car driver 25%, and the truck driver 20%. The total damages were determined to be $100,000. The motorcyclist collected $45,000 from the car driver and now the car driver wants to seek contribution from the truck driver. I need to figure out how much the car driver should recover from the truck driver.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"contribution\" means in this context. Contribution is when one party who has paid more than their share of damages can seek reimbursement from others who are also at fault. So, if the car driver paid more than their 25% share, they can ask the truck driver, who is less at fault, to contribute their fair share.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the motorcyclist was 55% at fault, the car driver 25%, and the truck driver 20%. So, collectively, they are 100% at fault, which makes sense.\n\nThe motorcyclist's total damages are $100,000, and they collected $45,000 from the car driver. Now, the car driver wants to seek contribution from the truck driver.\n\nI need to figure out how much the car driver should recover from the truck driver.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what is the car driver's share of the fault? It's 25% of $100,000, which is $25,000.\n\nBut they paid $45,000, which is more than their 25% share.\n\nSo, the excess they paid is $45,000 minus their $25,000 share, which is $20,000.\n\nNow, should this $20,000 be sought from the truck driver?\n\nWait, but the truck driver was only 20% at fault, which is $20,000.\n\nMaybe the car driver can seek contribution from the truck driver for the amount the truck driver should have paid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the car driver can seek the excess they paid beyond their own fault from the other at-fault parties.\n\nI need to recall how contribution works in cases with comparative negligence.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, when multiple parties are at fault, and one party pays more than their share, they can seek contribution from the others proportionate to their fault.\n\nSo, in this case, the car driver paid $45,000, but their share is $25,000. So, they paid an extra $20,000.\n\nThey should be able to seek that $20,000 from the other at-fault parties, proportionate to their fault.\n\nBut who are the other at-fault parties? The motorcyclist and the truck driver.\n\nWait, but the motorcyclist was injured and collected damages. It's the car driver who is seeking contribution from the truck driver.\n\nI need to consider who is still available to contribute.\n\nThe motorcyclist was 55% at fault, the car driver 25%, and the truck driver 20%.\n\nThe motorcyclist collected $45,000 from the car driver.\n\nNow, the car driver wants to seek contribution from the truck driver.\n\nI need to know if the motorcyclist has also paid their share.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention the motorcyclist paying anything. Maybe the motorcyclist only collected damages and didn't pay anything yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the motorcyclist's claim was satisfied by the $45,000 from the car driver.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to rephrase this.\n\nThe motorcyclist was injured and sued both the car driver and the truck driver.\n\nThe jury found that the motorcyclist was 55% at fault, the car driver 25%, and the truck driver 20%.\n\nTotal damages are $100,000.\n\nSo, in theory, the motorcyclist's damages should be reduced by their own fault.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a plaintiff is more than a certain percentage at fault (often 50% or 51%), they cannot recover anything. But in this case, the motorcyclist was allowed to collect $45,000.\n\nWait, but if the motorcyclist was 55% at fault, and total damages are $100,000, in some jurisdictions, they wouldn't be able to recover anything because they are more at fault than the defendants. But in this problem, they collected $45,000.\n\nSo, maybe this jurisdiction allows recovery even if the plaintiff is more at fault, perhaps using a modified comparative negligence rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the motorcyclist's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault.\n\nIf the motorcyclist is 55% at fault, then their recovery would be reduced by 55%, so $100,000 minus 55% is $45,000, which matches what they collected.\n\nSo, the motorcyclist's net recovery is $45,000.\n\nBut the car driver paid $45,000 to the motorcyclist.\n\nNow, the car driver wants to seek contribution from the truck driver.\n\nI need to figure out how much the car driver should recover from the truck driver.\n\nFirst, let's see what the car driver's share should be.\n\nThe car driver is 25% at fault, so their share of the $100,000 damages is $25,000.\n\nBut they paid $45,000, so they paid $20,000 more than their share.\n\nNow, they can seek contribution from the other at-fault parties for that excess.\n\nThe other at-fault parties are the motorcyclist and the truck driver.\n\nBut the motorcyclist has already been injured and collected damages. It might not be possible to seek contribution from them.\n\nSo, perhaps the car driver can only seek contribution from the truck driver.\n\nBut the truck driver is only 20% at fault, which is $20,000.\n\nWait, the car driver paid $45,000, their share is $25,000, so they paid an extra $20,000.\n\nThe truck driver's share is $20,000.\n\nSo, perhaps the car driver can seek the full $20,000 from the truck driver.\n\nBut option B says recover $27,000, which doesn't make sense because the truck driver's share is $20,000.\n\nOption C says recover $20,000, which matches the truck driver's share.\n\nOption D says recover $15,000, which is less than the truck driver's share.\n\nOption A says recover nothing because the car driver was more at fault than the truck driver.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the car driver paid more than their share and the truck driver is less at fault.\n\nWait, but in some contribution doctrines, if one party is more at fault than another, they might not be able to seek contribution from the less at-fault party.\n\nBut I think in most modern jurisdictions, contribution is allowed between joint tortfeasors, regardless of the degree of fault.\n\nSo, even if the car driver is more at fault than the truck driver, they can still seek contribution from the truck driver for the amount the truck driver should have paid.\n\nSo, in this case, the car driver paid $45,000, their share is $25,000, so they paid $20,000 extra.\n\nThe truck driver's share is $20,000.\n\nTherefore, the car driver should be able to recover the full $20,000 from the truck driver.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. recover $20,000.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that the car driver can recover only part of the $20,000 from the truck driver?\n\nMaybe if there's some proportionality based on fault percentages.\n\nBut in standard contribution scenarios, each party is responsible for their own percentage of fault.\n\nSo, if the car driver paid more than their share, they can seek the difference from the other at-fault parties.\n\nIn this case, since the motorcyclist has already collected $45,000 from the car driver, and presumably, the truck driver hasn't paid anything yet.\n\nSo, the car driver can seek the truck driver's $20,000 share from them.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. recover $20,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
