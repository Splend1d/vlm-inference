                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about bacteria growing in a culture. It says the growth rate is proportional to the number present, which sounds like exponential growth. The initial population is 200, and it triples in 10 hours. I need to find out how many bacteria there will be after one full day, which is 24 hours, and pick the approximate number from the options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand exponential growth. The general formula is:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\times e^{kt}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(P(t)\\) is the population at time t,\n\n- \\(P_0\\) is the initial population,\n\n- \\(k\\) is the growth rate,\n\n- \\(t\\) is time in hours.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the formula for exponential growth when the growth is given in terms of doubling time or in this case, tripling time.\n\nWait, the population triples in 10 hours. So, maybe I can use that to find the growth rate \\(k\\).\n\nLet's set up an equation using the information given.\n\nAt \\(t = 0\\), \\(P(0) = 200\\).\n\nAfter 10 hours, \\(P(10) = 3 \\times 200 = 600\\).\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[600 = 200 \\times e^{10k}\\]\n\nI can solve for \\(k\\).\n\nDivide both sides by 200:\n\n\\[3 = e^{10k}\\]\n\nTake natural log on both sides:\n\n\\[\\ln 3 = 10k\\]\\[k = \\frac{\\ln 3}{10}\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \\(P(24)\\), the population after 24 hours.\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\times e^{24 \\times \\frac{\\ln 3}{10}}\\]\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\times e^{2.4 \\ln 3}\\]\n\nI know that \\(e^{\\ln a^b} = a^b\\), so:\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\times 3^{2.4}\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(3^{2.4}\\). Hmm, how do I do that?\n\nI can use the fact that \\(3^{2.4} = 3^{2 + 0.4} = 3^2 \\times 3^{0.4} = 9 \\times 3^{0.4}\\).\n\nNow, \\(3^{0.4}\\) is the same as \\((3^{1/2.5})\\), but that might not help directly. Maybe I can approximate it.\n\nI know that \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^0.5 = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\\), \\(3^{0.25} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.316\\), but that might not be precise enough.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that \\(3^{0.4} = e^{\\ln(3^{0.4})} = e^{0.4 \\ln 3}\\).\n\nBut I still need a numerical value. Maybe I can use the Taylor series expansion or something, but that might be too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that \\(3^{0.4}\\) is approximately equal to \\(3^{2/5}\\), but I don't know the fifth root of 3 off the top of my head.\n\nWait, maybe I can use logarithms to approximate this.\n\nLet me see, \\(3^{0.4} = 10^{\\log_{10}(3^{0.4})} = 10^{0.4 \\log_{10} 3}\\).\n\nI know that \\(\\log_{10} 3 \\approx 0.4771\\), so:\n\n\\[3^{0.4} \\approx 10^{0.4 \\times 0.4771} = 10^{0.19084}\\]\n\nNow, \\(10^{0.19084}\\) is approximately equal to \\(10^{0.2} \\times 10^{0.09084}\\).\n\n\\(10^{0.2} = \\sqrt[5]{10} \\approx 1.58496\\), and \\(10^{0.09084}\\) is roughly 1.22, so:\n\n\\[3^{0.4} \\approx 1.58496 \\times 1.22 \\approx 1.93\\]\n\nSo, \\(3^{2.4} \\approx 9 \\times 1.93 = 17.37\\)\n\nNow, plug back into the equation:\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\times 17.37 \\approx 3474\\]\n\nBut that's not close to any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in approximating \\(3^{0.4}\\).\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can use the formula for continuous compounding, which is what I did initially, but check my calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, since the population triples every 10 hours, maybe I can express the population in terms of the tripling periods.\n\nIn 24 hours, how many 10-hour periods are there?\n\n24 / 10 = 2.4, so there are 2 full tripling periods and 0.4 of another period.\n\nSo, \\(P(24) = 200 \\times 3^{2.4}\\), which is what I had before.\n\nBut maybe instead of breaking it down into 2 and 0.4, I can think of it as 24 hours is 2.4 times the 10-hour tripling period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the general exponential growth formula again:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\times \\left(3\\right)^{t/10}\\]\n\nBecause every 10 hours, it triples. So, for t hours, it's base 3 raised to the power of t divided by 10.\n\nSo, \\(P(24) = 200 \\times 3^{2.4}\\), which is the same as before.\n\nNow, I need to find an approximate value for \\(3^{2.4}\\). Maybe I can use logarithms in base 10 for better accuracy.\n\nLet me calculate \\(\\log_{10}(3^{2.4}) = 2.4 \\times \\log_{10} 3 \\approx 2.4 \\times 0.4771 = 1.14504\\)\n\nThen, \\(3^{2.4} = 10^{1.14504}\\)\n\nI know that \\(10^{1} = 10\\), \\(10^{0.1} \\approx 1.2589\\), so \\(10^{0.14504} \\approx 1.405\\), so \\(10^{1.14504} \\approx 10 \\times 1.405 = 14.05\\)\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation where I got approximately 17.37.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier approximation.\n\nLet me check the calculation again.\n\nI have \\(\\log_{10}(3^{2.4}) = 2.4 \\times 0.4771 = 1.14504\\)\n\nThen, \\(10^{1.14504}\\) can be approximated as \\(10^{1} \\times 10^{0.14504}\\)\n\nI know that \\(10^{0.1} \\approx 1.2589\\), and \\(10^{0.04504}\\) is roughly 1.11, so \\(10^{0.14504} \\approx 1.2589 \\times 1.11 \\approx 1.40\\)\n\nThus, \\(10^{1.14504} \\approx 10 \\times 1.40 = 14.0\\)\n\nSo, \\(3^{2.4} \\approx 14.0\\)\n\nThen, \\(P(24) = 200 \\times 14.0 = 2800\\)\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1160\n\nB. 1440\n\nC. 2408\n\nD. 2793\n\n2800 is closest to option D. 2793.\n\nBut wait, my earlier approximation gave me 17.37 for \\(3^{2.4}\\), which led to P(24) \u2248 3474, which is way off. But now I have 2800, which is closer to 2793.\n\nMaybe I should trust the second approximation more. It seems more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the exponential growth formula with the growth rate k.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[k = \\frac{\\ln 3}{10}\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\times e^{24 \\times \\frac{\\ln 3}{10}} = 200 \\times e^{2.4 \\ln 3} = 200 \\times 3^{2.4}\\]\n\nWhich again brings me to \\(200 \\times 3^{2.4}\\), and with \\(3^{2.4} \\approx 14.0\\), P(24) \u2248 2800.\n\nThat seems consistent with option D. 2793.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{P(t)}{P_0}\\right)^{t/t_0}\\]\n\nWhere \\(t_0 = 10\\) hours, and \\(P(t_0) = 3 P_0\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\times \\left(\\frac{600}{200}\\right)^{24/10} = 200 \\times 3^{2.4}\\]\n\nAgain, same expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for continuous compounding:\n\n\\[P(t) = P_0 \\times e^{kt}\\]\n\nWhere \\(k = \\frac{\\ln 3}{10}\\), as before.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[P(24) = 200 \\times e^{24 \\times \\frac{\\ln 3}{10}} = 200 \\times e^{2.4 \\ln 3} = 200 \\times 3^{2.4}\\]\n\nSame result.\n\nMaybe I can calculate \\(3^{2.4}\\) more accurately using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll stick with my approximation of 14.0, giving P(24) \u2248 2800, which is closest to option D. 2793.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \\(3^{2.4} = 3^{2 + 0.4} = 3^2 \\times 3^{0.4} = 9 \\times 3^{0.4}\\)\n\nNow, \\(3^{0.4}\\) is the fourth root of 3 cubed, which is \\(3^{3/4}\\), but that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use logarithms to find \\(3^{0.4}\\) more accurately.\n\nLet me try:\n\n\\[\\log_{10}(3^{0.4}) = 0.4 \\times \\log_{10} 3 \\approx 0.4 \\times 0.4771 = 0.19084\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[3^{0.4} = 10^{0.19084}\\]\n\nI know that \\(10^{0.2} = \\sqrt[5]{10^1} = \\sqrt[5]{10} \\approx 1.58489\\), and \\(10^{0.09084}\\) is roughly 1.22, so \\(10^{0.19084} \\approx 1.58489 \\times 1.22 \\approx 1.93\\)\n\nWait, earlier I thought \\(3^{0.4} \\approx 1.93\\), but that would make \\(3^{2.4} = 9 \\times 1.93 = 17.37\\), leading to P(24) = 200 \u00d7 17.37 = 3474, which is way off from the options.\n\nBut according to my second approximation, \\(3^{0.4} \\approx 1.93\\), leading to P(24) \u2248 200 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1.93 = 200 \u00d7 17.37 = 3474, which again doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, \\(3^{2.4} = 3^{2} \\times 3^{0.4} = 9 \\times 1.93 = 17.37\\), and 200 \u00d7 17.37 = 3474, but the options don't have that. Maybe I need to recalculate \\(3^{0.4}\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \\(3^{0.5} = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\\), and \\(3^{0.4}\\) is less than that, maybe around 1.6.\n\nThen, \\(3^{2.4} = 9 \\times 1.6 = 14.4\\), and P(24) = 200 \u00d7 14.4 = 2880, which is closer to option D. 2793.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the exponential series expansion for \\(e^{x}\\), but that might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \\(3^{2.4} = (3^{2.4}) = 3^{2 + 0.4} = 3^2 \\times 3^{0.4} = 9 \\times 3^{0.4}\\), and approximate \\(3^{0.4}\\) differently.\n\nLet me try using logarithms in base 10 again:\n\n\\[\\log_{10}(3^{0.4}) = 0.4 \\times \\log_{10} 3 \\approx 0.4 \\times 0.4771 = 0.19084\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[3^{0.4} = 10^{0.19084}\\]\n\nI know that \\(10^{0.2} = \\sqrt[5]{10} \\approx 1.58489\\), and \\(10^{0.09084}\\) is roughly 1.22, so \\(10^{0.19084} \\approx 1.58489 \\times 1.22 \\approx 1.93\\)\n\nWait, but earlier I thought \\(3^{0.4} \\approx 1.93\\), leading to P(24) = 200 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1.93 = 3474, which is way off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \\(3^{0.4} = e^{\\ln(3^{0.4})} = e^{0.4 \\ln 3}\\)\n\nUsing natural logarithms, \\(\\ln 3 \\approx 1.0986\\), so:\n\n\\[3^{0.4} = e^{0.4 \\times 1.0986} = e^{0.43944}\\]\n\nNow, \\(e^{0.43944}\\) can be approximated using the series expansion:\n\n\\[e^{x} = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\cdots\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[e^{0.43944} \\approx 1 + 0.43944 + \\frac{(0.43944)^2}{2} + \\frac{(0.43944)^3}{6} + \\cdots\\]\n\nCalculating the first few terms:\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: 0.43944\n\nThird term: \\(\\frac{(0.43944)^2}{2} = \\frac{0.1929}{2} = 0.09645\\)\n\nFourth term: \\(\\frac{(0.43944)^3}{6} \\approx \\frac{0.085}{6} \\approx 0.01417\\)\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 0.43944 + 0.09645 + 0.01417 \u2248 1.55006\n\nSo, \\(e^{0.43944} \\approx 1.55006\\), meaning \\(3^{0.4} \\approx 1.55\\)\n\nThen, \\(3^{2.4} = 9 \\times 1.55 = 13.95\\), and P(24) = 200 \u00d7 13.95 \u2248 2790, which is very close to option D. 2793.\n\nThat seems like a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, using more terms in the series:\n\nFifth term: \\(\\frac{(0.43944)^4}{24} \\approx \\frac{0.0085}{24} \\approx 0.000354\\)\n\nAdding to previous sum: 1.55006 + 0.000354 \u2248 1.55041\n\nSo, \\(3^{0.4} \\approx 1.55041\\), then \\(3^{2.4} = 9 \\times 1.55041 \\approx"
