                    "text": "So I've got this problem here that asks me to find which ratios are equal to 4:32. The options are given as pairs of ratios, and I need to match them with 4:32. Let me first make sure I understand what it means for ratios to be equal. Basically, if two ratios are equal, their fractions should be equal too, right? So, 4:32 should be the same as 4/32, and I can simplify that fraction to see what it reduces to.\n\nLet me simplify 4/32. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 4. So, 4 \u00f7 4 is 1, and 32 \u00f7 4 is 8. So, 4:32 simplifies to 1:8. Okay, so any ratio that simplifies to 1:8 should be equal to 4:32.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 2:96 and 2:16\n\nFirst, let's look at 2:96. That's the same as 2/96. I can simplify that by dividing both by 2, which gives me 1/48. So, 2:96 simplifies to 1:48. That's not equal to 1:8.\n\nNext, 2:16. That's 2/16, which simplifies to 1/8 by dividing both by 2. So, 2:16 simplifies to 1:8.\n\nSo, in option A, one ratio is equal to 1:8, but the other isn't. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B: 12:96 and 2:16\n\nFirst, 12:96. That's 12/96. Both numbers can be divided by 12. So, 12 \u00f7 12 is 1, and 96 \u00f7 12 is 8. So, 12:96 simplifies to 1:8.\n\nThen, 2:16 is the same as we did in option A, which also simplifies to 1:8.\n\nSo, both ratios in option B simplify to 1:8, which matches 4:32.\n\nWait, but the question says \"which ratios are equal to 4:32?\" It seems like option B has both ratios equal to 1:8, which matches 4:32.\n\nBut let's check the others to be sure.\n\nOption C: 12:96 and 12:16\n\nWe already know 12:96 simplifies to 1:8.\n\nNow, 12:16. That's 12/16. Both numbers can be divided by 4. So, 12 \u00f7 4 is 3, and 16 \u00f7 4 is 4. So, 12:16 simplifies to 3:4.\n\nSo, in option C, one ratio is 1:8 and the other is 3:4. They are not both equal to 1:8, so this option is out.\n\nOption D: 2:96 and 12:16\n\nFirst, 2:96 simplifies to 1:48, as we saw in option A.\n\nAnd 12:16 simplifies to 3:4, same as in option C.\n\nSo, neither of these ratios is equal to 1:8, so this option is also out.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice seems to be option B, where both ratios are equal to 1:8, which matches 4:32.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"which ratios are equal to 4:32?\" and it's asking for the pair that both ratios match 4:32.\n\nBut in option B, both ratios are 1:8, which does match 4:32 since 4:32 simplifies to 1:8.\n\nHowever, looking back at option A, one of the ratios is 1:8, but the other isn't. So, perhaps the question is asking for both ratios in the pair to match 4:32.\n\nBut in option B, both do match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options have at least one ratio equal to 4:32, or if both need to be equal.\n\nLooking back, the question says \"which ratios are equal to 4:32?\", and it's phrased as a multiple-choice question with options A through D, each containing two ratios.\n\nIt seems like it's asking which of these pairs contains ratios that are both equal to 4:32.\n\nIn that case, option B has both ratios equal to 1:8, which matches 4:32.\n\nOption C has one equal to 1:8 and the other to 3:4, so only one matches.\n\nOption D has neither equal to 1:8.\n\nOption A has one equal to 1:8 and the other to 1:48.\n\nSo, if the question is asking for pairs where both ratios are equal to 4:32, then only option B fits.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for pairs where at least one ratio is equal to 4:32, then options A and B would be candidates, but the wording seems to suggest both ratios should match.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is option B.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret the ratios.\n\nMaybe checking if the ratios are proportional in some other way, but the question specifically says \"equal to 4:32,\" so simplifying each ratio and comparing should suffice.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option B: 12:96 and 2:16, since both simplify to 1:8, which matches 4:32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
