                    "text": "Let's tackle this depreciation problem step by step. It's a bit complex with multiple components, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nFirst, the company bought equipment for $100 million on January 1, Year 1. The equipment has four major components with different costs and useful lives. I need to find the depreciation expense for the first year ended December 31, Year 1, using the straight-line method under IFRS.\n\nOkay, starting with the two components that make up 80% of the total cost and each has a 20-year useful life. So, 80% of $100 million is $80 million. Since these two components have the same cost and same useful life, I can assume each costs $40 million (because $80 million divided by 2 is $40 million per component).\n\nNext, there are two more components, each costing $10 million. One has a useful life of four years, and the other has five years.\n\nNow, the straight-line method of depreciation calculates depreciation expense by dividing the cost of the asset by its useful life. Since we're dealing with different components with different lives, I need to calculate the depreciation for each component separately and then sum them up for the total depreciation expense for the year.\n\nLet's calculate the annual depreciation for each component:\n\n1. For the two components with a 20-year life:\n\n   - Each costs $40 million.\n\n   - Annual depreciation per component: $40 million / 20 years = $2 million per year.\n\n   - Since there are two such components, their combined annual depreciation is: 2 components * $2 million = $4 million.\n\n2. For the component with a four-year life:\n\n   - It costs $10 million.\n\n   - Annual depreciation: $10 million / 4 years = $2.5 million per year.\n\n3. For the component with a five-year life:\n\n   - It also costs $10 million.\n\n   - Annual depreciation: $10 million / 5 years = $2 million per year.\n\nNow, to find the total depreciation expense for the year, I need to add up the depreciation from all four components:\n\n- Two components with 20-year life: $4 million\n\n- Four-year life component: $2.5 million\n\n- Five-year life component: $2 million\n\nTotal depreciation expense = $4 million + $2.5 million + $2 million = $8.5 million\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $4,000,000\n\nB. $5,000,000\n\nC. $8,000,000\n\nD. $8,500,000\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. $8,500,000.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the cost allocation:\n\n- Total cost: $100 million\n\n- Two components account for 80% of $100 million: 0.8 * $100 million = $80 million\n\n- Remaining 20%: 0.2 * $100 million = $20 million, which is the combined cost of the other two components. Each of these costs $10 million, which matches the problem statement.\n\nNext, confirming the useful lives:\n\n- Two components: 20 years each\n\n- One component: 4 years\n\n- One component: 5 years\n\nNow, calculating depreciation:\n\n- For 20-year components: $40 million / 20 years = $2 million each per year\n\n- Combined for both: $4 million per year\n\n- Four-year component: $10 million / 4 years = $2.5 million per year\n\n- Five-year component: $10 million / 5 years = $2 million per year\n\nTotal depreciation: $4 million + $2.5 million + $2 million = $8.5 million\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether the equipment was in use for the full year. The problem states it was purchased on January 1, Year 1, so it was in use for the entire year. Therefore, no need to prorate the depreciation for partial years.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the company applies the cost model to the equipment, which means it's using historical cost less accumulated depreciation, but since we're dealing with the first year, no need to adjust for revaluations.\n\nAdditionally, under IFRS, the straight-line method is acceptable for depreciation, and there's no mention of residual values, so I assume the salvage value is zero.\n\nTherefore, the calculation I've done should be correct.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the two 20-year components together cost $80 million, and each has a 20-year life, but the problem says \"each has a 20-year useful life.\" So, each component is independent in terms of depreciation.\n\nSo, $40 million per component, divided by 20 years, gives $2 million per year per component, totaling $4 million for both.\n\nThe four-year component: $10 million / 4 years = $2.5 million per year.\n\nThe five-year component: $10 million / 5 years = $2 million per year.\n\nAdding them up again gives $8.5 million.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should indeed be D. $8,500,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the depreciation in the first year.\n\nIs there any mention of salvage value? No, the problem doesn't specify any residual value, so we assume it's zero.\n\nAre there any other components or assets to consider? The problem specifies four major components, and that's all.\n\nIs there any group depreciation or apportionment based on usage? No, it's straight-line depreciation based on useful life.\n\nAlright, I feel confident now that $8.5 million is the correct depreciation expense for the first year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 8,500,000} \\]"
