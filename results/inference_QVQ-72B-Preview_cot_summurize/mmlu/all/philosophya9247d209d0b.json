                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about John Stuart Mill's ethical views, and how they relate to Brandt's interpretation. The options are:\n\nA. Act-utilitarianism.\n\nB. A rule-utilitarianism based on the actual rules of society.\n\nC. A rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\n\nD. Kant\u2019s ethics.\n\nFirst off, I know that John Stuart Mill was a prominent utilitarian philosopher. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory that suggests the morality of an action is determined by its outcome\u2014specifically, by the amount of happiness or utility it produces. Mill's version of utilitarianism is often contrasted with that of Jeremy Bentham, who is considered the founder of utilitarianism.\n\nNow, utilitarianism can be divided into two main types: act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism.\n\nAct-utilitarianism evaluates each individual act based on its consequences. So, for each specific action, you consider what the total utility would be if you performed that act, and compare it to the utility of alternative actions.\n\nRule-utilitarianism, on the other hand, involves following general rules that are believed to promote the greatest good in the long run. According to this view, you don't assess each act individually; instead, you follow rules that, if generally adopted, would lead to the best overall outcomes.\n\nGiven this background, the question is asking which of these options best represents Mill's view, as per Brandt's interpretation.\n\nOption A is act-utilitarianism. This seems straightforward\u2014it's the theory that evaluates each act separately based on its consequences.\n\nOption B is \"a rule-utilitarianism based on the actual rules of society.\" This suggests that the rules we should follow are those that are already established in society, and that these rules are the basis for moral decision-making from a utilitarian perspective.\n\nOption C is \"a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\" This seems similar to option B but with a twist\u2014it's not just about the actual rules of society, but about idealized moral rules that, if followed, would lead to the best possible outcomes.\n\nOption D is Kant\u2019s ethics. Kantian ethics is deontological, emphasizing duty and universal moral laws, rather than the consequences of actions. This seems quite different from utilitarianism, which is consequentialist.\n\nGiven that Mill was a utilitarian, it's unlikely that his views would align closely with Kant\u2019s, so option D seems out of place here.\n\nNow, between options A, B, and C, I need to determine which one best reflects Mill's position according to Brandt.\n\nI recall that Mill himself leaned towards rule-utilitarianism. In his work \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill argues that utility is the foundation of ethics, but he also emphasizes the importance of general principles or rules for guiding behavior. He suggests that following certain rules leads to better overall outcomes than trying to calculate the consequences of each individual act.\n\nSo, if Mill was more of a rule-utilitarian, then option A, act-utilitarianism, is probably not the best fit.\n\nNow, between options B and C, there's a difference in whether the rules are based on actual societal rules or ideal moral rules.\n\nIf Brandt is suggesting that Mill's view aligns with rule-utilitarianism based on actual societal rules, that might imply that Mill thought we should follow the rules that are currently in place in society because they contribute to overall utility.\n\nHowever, Mill was also critical of societal norms and emphasized individual liberty, particularly in his work \"On Liberty.\" He argued against the tyranny of the majority and the importance of allowing individuals to pursue their own good in their own way, as long as they don't harm others.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Mill might not fully align with a rule-utilitarianism based solely on actual societal rules, because those rules might not always align with individual liberty or the greatest good.\n\nInstead, Mill might be more aligned with a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules\u2014that is, rules that, if followed, would lead to the optimal distribution of happiness and respect for individual liberties.\n\nThis seems more in line with Mill's overall philosophical stance, which combines utilitarian principles with a strong emphasis on individual freedom and the importance of not interfering with others' lives unnecessarily.\n\nMoreover, in \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill discusses the idea of higher and lower pleasures, suggesting that some forms of happiness are more valuable than others. This refinement to utilitarianism aligns with the idea of ideal moral rules that promote not just quantity of happiness, but also its quality.\n\nTherefore, option C, a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules, appears to be the closest match to Mill's views as interpreted by Brandt.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider Brandt's perspective. R. B. Brandt was a philosopher who wrote extensively on ethics and moral theory, including discussions on utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism.\n\nIn his work, Brandt developed the concept of ideal rule-utilitarianism, where the rules are determined by an idealized process that takes into account all relevant factors, including long-term consequences and the importance of individual rights and liberties.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Brandt viewed Mill's utilitarianism as more aligned with an ideal rule-utilitarianism, rather than act-utilitarianism or a rule-utilitarianism based on actual societal rules.\n\nFurthermore, Mill's emphasis on individual freedom and the harm principle (from \"On Liberty\"), which states that the only reason for interfering with an individual's liberty is to prevent harm to others, fits well within an ideal rule-utilitarian framework.\n\nSuch rules aim to maximize overall happiness while respecting individual autonomy, which aligns with Mill's philosophy.\n\nIn contrast, a rule-utilitarianism based on actual societal rules might not account for instances where societal norms unjustly restrict individual freedoms, which Mill would likely oppose.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any evidence that Mill held views compatible with act-utilitarianism.\n\nAct-utilitarianism requires evaluating each action on its merits, considering its particular consequences. While this approach might seem straightforward, it can lead to difficult practical applications, as it demands a constant assessment of every possible action's impact on utility.\n\nMill, in his writings, acknowledges these difficulties and seems to suggest that following general rules is a more practical and effective way to promote utility. He writes that \"the rules of morality are not the exponents, but the guardians of utility,\" implying that moral rules are meant to protect and promote the general welfare over time, rather than being derived from case-by-case analyses.\n\nThis statement further supports the idea that Mill favored rule-utilitarianism over act-utilitarianism.\n\nAdditionally, Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures suggests that he believed in more than just maximizing pleasure quantity; he also considered the quality and type of pleasure. This nuanced view aligns better with rule-utilitarianism, which can incorporate such distinctions into its ideal moral rules.\n\nOn the other hand, act-utilitarianism might struggle to account for the qualitative differences in pleasures, as it focuses primarily on the quantity of pleasure produced by each act.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, it's clear that Mill's views are closer to rule-utilitarianism, particularly an ideal rule-utilitarianism, which corresponds to option C.\n\nTo sum it up, according to Brandt, John Stuart Mill\u2019s view most closely resembles a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
