                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a newcomer to a small town who's been hired as a city employee. According to the city manual, newcomers have to pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund for their first three years of employment. This person refuses to pay that higher amount and gets terminated as a result. Now, she's considering making an equal protection argument to fight her termination. The question is, can she successfully make such an argument?\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what equal protection means. Equal protection is a principle in the U.S. Constitution that requires states to provide equal protection under the law to all people. Essentially, it means that similar individuals should be treated similarly by the law and government policies.\n\nIn this case, the newcomer is being treated differently from other employees because she's required to pay a higher contribution to the betterment fund for her first three years of employment. She's arguing that this differential treatment violates her equal protection rights.\n\nNow, to make a successful equal protection claim, a plaintiff generally needs to show that she's being treated differently from others who are similarly situated and that there's no rational basis for that difference in treatment. The level of scrutiny applied depends on whether the classification is based on a suspect or quasi-suspect class, such as race, national origin, or gender. If it is, then stricter standards apply.\n\nIn this scenario, the classification is based on being a newcomer versus established employees. Is being a newcomer a suspect or quasi-suspect class? Probably not. Suspect classes are those that have been historically subjected to discrimination and don't include newcomers to a town.\n\nSo, since this isn't a suspect class, the classification would be subject to rational basis review. Under rational basis review, the government action is presumed valid, and the plaintiff has to show that there's no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\n\nThe city likely has a rational basis for requiring newcomers to pay higher contributions to the betterment fund. Perhaps they believe that newcomers haven't yet contributed as much to the community and should make a larger initial financial commitment. Or maybe it's to help offset the costs associated with hiring new employees. As long as there's some reasonable justification, the differential treatment would be upheld under rational basis review.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions options about \"class-of-one.\" I should look into that. The \"class-of-one\" doctrine allows individuals to challenge arbitrary treatment by the government even if they don't belong to a recognized suspect class. This doctrine was established in the case of Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, where the Supreme Court held that a single individual can bring an equal protection claim if they've been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated without a rational basis.\n\nIn this scenario, the newcomer could potentially argue that she's being treated as a class-of-one, meaning she's being singled out for differential treatment without a rational basis. However, the city manual applies to all newcomers, not just her individually. So, it's not so much a class-of-one situation as it is a policy that applies to a specific group: newcomers.\n\nOption A says that no, she cannot make a successful equal protection argument because there cannot be a \"class-of-one\" in the employment law context. But actually, the class-of-one doctrine can be applied in employment contexts. So, this might not be entirely accurate.\n\nOption B says that the request for the contribution was not unreasonable and cannot support an equal protection argument. But whether the contribution is reasonable or not isn't directly relevant to an equal protection analysis. The question is whether the differential treatment has a rational basis.\n\nOption C says yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against. But again, since the policy applies to all newcomers, it's not just her being singled out. So, it's more of a class of newcomers rather than a class-of-one.\n\nOption D says yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she's the only newcomer she knows of at this time. This seems more accurate. Even if she's the only newcomer at the moment, the policy applies to all newcomers, so she can claim to be part of that group.\n\nGiven this, I think the best answer is D. She can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are being treated differently from other employees. Under rational basis review, she would need to show that there's no rational basis for this differential treatment. However, as I thought earlier, the city likely has a rational basis for this policy, so her claim might not succeed. But the question is whether she can make a successful equal protection argument, not whether she will win.\n\nWait, the question is: \"Can she make a successful equal protection argument to fight for her job?\" The options are phrased as \"Yes, she can claim...\" or \"No, she cannot.\" So, it's about whether she can even make the claim, not necessarily whether she'll win.\n\nGiven that, I think D is the most accurate because she can claim to be part of a group of newcomers who are being treated differently, even if she's the only one at the moment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it's referring to a class-of-one, which isn't the case here since the policy applies to all newcomers.\n\nOption A is wrong because class-of-one can be applicable in employment contexts, although in this case, it's more about a group of newcomers.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the reasonableness of the contribution isn't the determining factor in an equal protection argument.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
