                    "text": "So I've got this situation here where a purchaser is suing a seller for breach of contract in a federal diversity action. The seller has responded with an answer that includes a separate defense, claiming that the purchaser had previously brought and lost a similar contract claim against a different seller three years ago. The seller is suggesting that this shows a pattern of the purchaser filing frivolous lawsuits. Now, the purchaser disagrees and believes that the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different from the current one and therefore irrelevant. The question is, what's the purchaser's best response to the seller's answer?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. File a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense.\n\nB. Move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense.\n\nC. Move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits.\n\nD. Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a separate defense is in this context. In civil litigation, a defendant can assert affirmative defenses in their answer to the complaint. These are facts or circumstances that, if true, would excuse the defendant from liability, even if the allegations in the complaint are true. However, the seller here is alleging that the purchaser has a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits based on a previous lost case.\n\nNow, the purchaser believes that the previous lawsuit was factually different and thus irrelevant to the current case. So, the purchaser likely wants to challenge the seller's assertion that the previous case was similar or that it indicates a pattern of frivolous lawsuits.\n\nOption A suggests filing a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense. In federal civil procedure, replies are not typically allowed unless the court orders them. Usually, the plaintiff files a complaint, the defendant answers with defenses and possibly counterclaims, and then the plaintiff can file a reply to the counterclaims, but not necessarily to the defenses. So, I'm not sure if filing a reply to deny the separate defense is procedurally proper.\n\nOption B is to move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense. Sanctions are a pretty serious step and are generally reserved for cases where a party is acting in bad faith or making baseless arguments. The purchaser believes the previous lawsuit was different and therefore irrelevant, but that doesn't necessarily mean the seller is acting frivolously by raising it. Maybe the seller genuinely believes there's a pattern. So, moving for sanctions might be seen as overly aggressive and might not be warranted at this stage.\n\nOption C is to move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits. This seems like an interesting approach. By amending the complaint to highlight the differences, the purchaser could try to preemptively address the seller's defense. However, amending the complaint might not directly address the seller's separate defense and could potentially open the door to more extensive litigation.\n\nOption D is to move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant. This seems straightforward. If the purchaser believes that the previous lawsuit is factually different and therefore irrelevant to the current breach of contract claim, then moving to strike the defense could be an appropriate way to remove it from consideration. A motion to strike is typically used to remove irrelevant, immaterial, redundant, or scandalous matter from pleadings.\n\nGiven the options, I think Option D is the most direct and procedurally sound choice. The purchaser can argue that the seller's assertion about the previous lawsuit is irrelevant to the current breach of contract claim and should be stricken from the answer. This would prevent the seller from using that defense in the case.\n\nBut let me think about this more carefully. Is the previous lawsuit relevant to the current case? The seller is claiming that the purchaser has a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits, which might be an attempt to impeach the purchaser's credibility or to suggest that the current claim is also frivolous. However, in most jurisdictions, merely filing a lawsuit that was unsuccessful doesn't automatically make the current lawsuit frivolous, especially if the facts are different.\n\nMoreover, in federal court, there are rules against pleading prior litigation as a defense unless it's relevant to the current claim. Here, since the purchaser asserts that the previous case is factually different, the seller would need to show how it's relevant to the current breach of contract claim.\n\nPerhaps the seller is trying to argue that the purchaser is a serial litigant or is bringing claims without merit, but that seems like an attack on character rather than a substantive defense to the breach of contract claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the seller is suggesting that the purchaser is likely to have brought this claim without a good faith basis, but again, that seems tenuous unless there's a clear pattern of similar frivolous claims.\n\nI should also consider whether the seller's defense could be considered an affirmative defense. Affirmative defenses include things like statute of limitations, arbitration clauses, or payment. Claiming that the purchaser has brought frivolous lawsuits in the past doesn't fit neatly into any standard affirmative defense.\n\nIt's possible that the seller is trying to set up a defense of unclean hands or some other equitable consideration, but even then, the relevance of a prior unrelated lawsuit would be questionable.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, allowing such a defense could open the door to extensive discovery into the purchaser's litigation history, which might be irrelevant and could be unduly burdensome.\n\nTherefore, I think the purchaser's best course of action is to move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant. This would require the seller to justify why the previous lawsuit is relevant to the current breach of contract claim.\n\nIn summary, the purchaser should choose Option D: Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
