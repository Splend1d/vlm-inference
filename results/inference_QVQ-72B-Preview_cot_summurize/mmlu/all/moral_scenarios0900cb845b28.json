                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are A: both are wrong, B: the first is wrong and the second is not, C: the first is not wrong and the second is wrong, or D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails.\n\nScenario 1: \"I picked up all the trash from the yard after the party.\"\n\nSo, someone had a party, and afterward, there was trash in the yard. The person decided to clean it up. Picking up trash is generally seen as a good thing, right? It helps keep the environment clean and tidy. In most cultures, especially in the US, environmental awareness has been growing, and cleaning up after oneself or even volunteering to clean up public spaces is encouraged.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Was the trash only from the party, or did the person pick up all the trash in the yard, including maybe others' trash? Well, the scenario says \"all the trash from the yard after the party.\" It seems like it's specifically referring to the trash generated from the party. So, cleaning up after one's own event seems responsible.\n\nIs there any way this could be considered morally wrong? Hmm. Maybe if the person was supposed to clean up and didn't, and someone else had to, but in this case, it's the person themselves cleaning up. Or if the way they cleaned up was harmful, like burning the trash and causing pollution, but I think picking up and disposing of it properly is generally positive.\n\nSo, based on that, I don't think Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I tried a shirt on and put it back on the rack.\"\n\nThis is about trying on a shirt in a store and then returning it to the rack. In retail, it's common for customers to try on clothes and decide whether they want to buy them. Stores usually have policies that allow customers to try on items before purchasing.\n\nBut is there anything morally questionable about this? Well, some people might think that if you try something on and decide not to buy it, putting it back is fine, as long as you haven't damaged it or worn it outside of the store. However, there might be concerns about hygiene or spreading germs, especially with clothing that fits tightly against the skin.\n\nBut in general, trying on clothes and putting them back is considered acceptable behavior. It's part of the shopping experience. Unless the person is intentionally damaging the item or using it in a way that's not intended, like wearing it outside and then bringing it back, which is a different scenario known as \"wardrobing\" or \"renting,\" which can be seen as unethical.\n\nHowever, the scenario here seems straightforward: trying on a shirt and putting it back on the rack. No indication of damage or misuse. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this doesn't seem like a morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario appears to be clearly morally wrong. So, the answer should be D: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, cleaning up trash from your own party is responsible and environmentally friendly. It's not harming anyone or anything, so it's not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, trying on a shirt and putting it back is a normal part of shopping. It's not taking anything without paying for it, nor is it damaging store property. So, again, not wrong.\n\nYeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
