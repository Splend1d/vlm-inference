I need to figure out what day of the week January 1st falls on, given that December 25th is a Saturday.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many days are between December 25th and January 1st. From December 25th to December 31st is 6 days, and then January 1st is another day. So in total, that's 7 days.\n\nIf December 25th is a Saturday, then adding 7 days would bring me back to the same day of the week, right? Because 7 days is a week, and the days repeat every week.\n\nLet me double-check that. Starting from Saturday, adding 7 days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So yes, 7 days from Saturday is Saturday.\n\nBut wait, New Year's Day is 7 days after Christmas Day. So if Christmas is on Saturday, New Year's Day should be on Saturday as well.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any leap year or other factor that could affect the day of the week between these dates?\n\nWell, since we're dealing with the same year for both dates, and there are no leap seconds or anything that would affect the day of the week within the same year, I think it's safe to assume that 7 days from Saturday is Saturday.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If December 25th is Saturday, December 26th would be Sunday, December 27th Monday, and so on, up to December 31st, which would be Friday. Then January 1st is Saturday.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier. So New Year's Day would be on Saturday.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is Sunday. Is there any possibility that New Year's Day could be on Sunday if Christmas is on Saturday?\n\nNo, based on my calculations, it should definitely be on Saturday.\n\nLet me think about the calendar. Suppose this year is 2021. Christmas Day is on December 25th, which was a Saturday in 2021. New Year's Day would be on January 1st, 2022. Let me check a calendar for 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn 2021, December 25th was a Saturday. December 26th was Sunday, 27th Monday, 28th Tuesday, 29th Wednesday, 30th Thursday, 31st Friday. Then January 1st, 2022 is Saturday.\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nSo the answer should be Saturday.\n\nWait, but in the options, Saturday is option D, and Sunday is option A. Since I've determined that New Year's Day is on Saturday, the correct choice is D. Saturday.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any variation based on leap years or different years.\n\nSuppose it's a different year where Christmas is on Saturday. For example, in 2026, December 25th is a Saturday. New Year's Day 2027 would be on Saturday as well, according to the same logic.\n\nSimilarly, in 2037, December 25th is Saturday, and January 1st, 2038 is Saturday.\n\nSo it seems consistent across years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Saturday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
