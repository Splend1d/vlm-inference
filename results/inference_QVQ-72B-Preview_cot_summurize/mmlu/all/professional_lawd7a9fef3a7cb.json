His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject.

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out who should win this case between a brother and a sister over some inherited property. Their dad died in 1985 and left the estate to both of them to \"share and share alike as tenants in common.\" That means they both own the property together, right? But the brother has been living there since then, paying the taxes and maintenance, and the sister hasn't been involved much. Now, in 2010, there are disputes, and the brother is claiming the whole property based on adverse possession.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what adverse possession is. It's when someone who doesn't own the land occupies it openly, continuously, and exclusively for a certain period, and after that time, they can claim ownership. In this case, the state has a 20-year adverse possession statute. So, if the brother has been occupying the property for more than 20 years, which is from 1985 to 2005, and it's now 2010, that's 25 years, which is more than the required 20 years.\n\nBut, there's a twist because the property is owned by cotenants. Cotenants are people who own the same property together, like the brother and sister here. I need to know if one cotenant can claim adverse possession against another.\n\nOption A says the daughter wins because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another. Is that true? I think generally, cotenants can't claim adverse possession against each other because they have a right to possess the property anyway. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.\n\nOption B says the daughter wins because there's no evidence that the brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster. Ouster is a term used in cotenancy law. It means one cotenant has excluded the others from possession. So, maybe the brother hasn't completely excluded the sister from the property, even if he's been living there.\n\nOption C says the son wins because the sister's actions indicate she intended to renounce her ownership rights. Renounce means she gave up her rights voluntarily. But the scenario says she cared little about the estate and never pressed her brother about it, but she also hasn't paid any rent or compensation. Does that amount to renouncing her rights?\n\nOption D says the son wins because his occupancy over 25 years satisfies the adverse possession requirements. This seems straightforward, but I need to consider if cotenancy changes that.\n\nI need to think about the nature of a tenancy in common. In a tenancy in common, each cotenant has the right to use and enjoy the property, but they don't have exclusive possession. So, if one cotenant occupies the property exclusively, does that amount to adverse possession against the other cotenant?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, one cotenant cannot claim adverse possession against another because they have a right to the property by virtue of their ownership. It's like you can't possess something against yourself. So, maybe option A is correct.\n\nBut, there are cases where, if one cotenant excludes the others from possession for the required period, they can claim adverse possession. Maybe the brother has been living there exclusively for 25 years, which is way beyond the 20-year period, and the sister hasn't done anything about it.\n\nHowever, the scenario mentions that the sister has been generally aware of her brother occupying the property but hasn't cared much about it. Does her lack of action imply consent or renunciation of her rights?\n\nI need to consider the concept of ouster. For one cotenant to claim adverse possession against another, there needs to be actual ouster\u2014meaning the cotenant has been excluded from possession in a way that is hostile to the other's rights.\n\nIn this case, the brother has been living there exclusively, paying taxes and maintenance, but he hasn't demanded rent from the sister, and she hasn't paid any compensation. Does this amount to ouster?\n\nPerhaps not entirely, because even though he's living there, she still has a right to enter and use the property, theoretically. But in practice, she hasn't done so, and he's been in exclusive possession for 25 years.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the sister has acquiesced to the brother's exclusive possession for so long that she can't now claim her share. But I'm not sure if that's a valid legal argument.\n\nLet me look at it differently. If the brother is claiming adverse possession, he needs to show that his possession was hostile, actual, open, notorious, continuous, and exclusive for the statutory period.\n\n- Hostile: Did he possess the property in a way that was adverse to his sister's interests? Probably, since he was living there exclusively.\n\n- Actual: Yes, he was living there.\n\n- Open and notorious: He put his name on the mailbox and paid the taxes, so it was open and known that he was occupying the property.\n\n- Continuous: He's been there for 25 years without interruption.\n\n- Exclusive: He's been the only one living there.\n\nSo, on the surface, it seems like he meets the requirements for adverse possession.\n\nBut, as cotenants, they both have a right to possession, so maybe the hostility requirement isn't met because they're both owners.\n\nWait, but in some jurisdictions, cotenants can't claim adverse possession against each other precisely because their possession isn't hostile; they're supposed to share the property.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that, saying one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\n\nBut then, why would the brother even bring an action to quiet title if that were the case? Maybe he thinks he has a chance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sister has abandoned her interest in the property by not participating or paying any costs associated with it for 25 years.\n\nAbandonment requires an intention to give up the property, which might be inferred from her actions. But abandonment typically requires some affirmative act or declaration of intent to abandon.\n\nIn this scenario, the sister cared little about the estate and never pressed her brother about the property, but she also hasn't paid rent or compensation. Maybe her inaction could be seen as implied abandonment.\n\nBut, abandonment alone doesn't necessarily transfer title to the other cotenant. The brother would still need to establish adverse possession or some other legal basis to claim sole ownership.\n\nAnother consideration: maybe the brother has a claim based on estoppel, meaning the sister, by her inaction, led him to believe that she had renounced her rights, and he relied on that to his detriment.\n\nBut estoppel isn't directly related to adverse possession, although it could be a related defense.\n\nLet me think about the daughter's position. She inherited a share of the property, but she hasn't done much with it. If the brother is claiming adverse possession, she might argue that her inaction doesn't amount to ouster, and that as cotenants, he can't claim adverse possession against her.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother has been in exclusive possession for over 20 years, paying all the costs, which might be seen as sufficient to establish adverse possession.\n\nI need to consider the law of the state where the property is located. The scenario says it's a Midwestern state that recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and has no applicable legislation on the subject.\n\nSo, it's common law, and generally, under common law, one cotenant cannot acquire the interest of another by adverse possession because their possession is not hostile; they're supposed to share the property.\n\nTherefore, option A might be correct: the daughter wins because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\n\nBut, there are cases where courts have allowed adverse possession between cotenants under certain circumstances, especially if there's clear evidence of ouster and exclusive possession for the required period.\n\nIn this scenario, the brother has been in exclusive possession for 25 years, which is more than the 20-year period required for adverse possession.\n\nHowever, the sister is still a cotenant, and her rights to the property are inherent in her ownership, regardless of whether she exercises them.\n\nUnless there's a specific legal doctrine that allows the brother to claim adverse possession against his sister as a cotenant, I think the daughter should win.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.\n\nWait, but option A says one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another, which seems more comprehensive than option B, which focuses on ouster.\n\nI think option A is stronger because it directly addresses the principle that cotenants cannot claim adverse possession against each other.\n\nOption B seems to suggest that there might be insufficient evidence of ouster, but even if there were evidence of ouster, under common law, adverse possession between cotenants might still not be allowed.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\nSo, judgment should be for the daughter because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
