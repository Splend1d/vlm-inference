                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have this polynomial expression: $(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2 + (px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)$, and we're told that after expanding it, the resulting polynomial has a degree of 2. We need to find the sum $p + q$.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a polynomial to have a degree of 2. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of $x$ in its expanded form. So, if the expanded form has $x^2$ as the highest power, that means the degree is 2.\n\nBut in our expression, both parts seem to have higher degrees. Let's look at each part separately.\n\nStarting with $(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2$. The degree of $x^2 + 5x + 6$ is 2, and when you square it, the highest degree term will be $(x^2)^2 = x^4$. So, $(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2$ will have $x^4$ as its highest degree term.\n\nNext, $(px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)$. The highest degree term here would be $p x \\cdot x^3 = p x^4$ if $p$ is not zero. Otherwise, it would be $q \\cdot x^3 = q x^3$.\n\nBut the problem states that the entire expression, after expansion, has a degree of 2. That means that the resulting polynomial doesn't have any terms with $x^3$, $x^4$, etc., higher than $x^2$.\n\nWait a minute, but we have $x^4$ terms in both parts. So, perhaps those $x^4$ terms cancel each other out.\n\nLet's try to expand both parts separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, expand $(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2$:\n\n$(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2 = x^2 \\cdot x^2 + x^2 \\cdot 5x + x^2 \\cdot 6 + 5x \\cdot x^2 + 5x \\cdot 5x + 5x \\cdot 6 + 6 \\cdot x^2 + 6 \\cdot 5x + 6 \\cdot 6$\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n- $x^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4$\n\n- $x^2 \\cdot 5x = 5x^3$\n\n- $x^2 \\cdot 6 = 6x^2$\n\n- $5x \\cdot x^2 = 5x^3$\n\n- $5x \\cdot 5x = 25x^2$\n\n- $5x \\cdot 6 = 30x$\n\n- $6 \\cdot x^2 = 6x^2$\n\n- $6 \\cdot 5x = 30x$\n\n- $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$\n\nNow, combining like terms:\n\n$x^4 + (5x^3 + 5x^3) + (6x^2 + 25x^2 + 6x^2) + (30x + 30x) + 36$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36$\n\nOkay, so this part gives us $x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36$.\n\nNow, let's expand $(px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)$:\n\n$px \\cdot x^3 + px \\cdot 7x^2 + px \\cdot 3x + q \\cdot x^3 + q \\cdot 7x^2 + q \\cdot 3x$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$p x^4 + 7p x^3 + 3p x^2 + q x^3 + 7q x^2 + 3q x$\n\nNow, combining like terms:\n\n$p x^4 + (7p + q) x^3 + (3p + 7q) x^2 + 3q x$\n\nSo, the entire expression is:\n\n$(x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36) + (p x^4 + (7p + q) x^3 + (3p + 7q) x^2 + 3q x)$\n\nNow, combining like terms again:\n\n$(1 + p) x^4 + (10 + 7p + q) x^3 + (37 + 3p + 7q) x^2 + (60 + 3q) x + 36$\n\nAccording to the problem, the degree of this polynomial is 2. That means that the highest power present is $x^2$, and the coefficients of $x^3$ and $x^4$ must be zero.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$1 + p = 0$ (from $x^4$ coefficient)\n\n$10 + 7p + q = 0$ (from $x^3$ coefficient)\n\nAnd the $x^2$ coefficient is $37 + 3p + 7q$, which should be non-zero since the degree is 2.\n\nAlso, the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term can be anything, as they don't affect the degree.\n\nSo, from the first equation:\n\n$1 + p = 0 \\implies p = -1$\n\nPlugging $p = -1$ into the second equation:\n\n$10 + 7(-1) + q = 0$\n\n$10 - 7 + q = 0$\n\n$3 + q = 0 \\implies q = -3$\n\nNow, let's check if the $x^2$ coefficient is non-zero with these values:\n\n$37 + 3(-1) + 7(-3) = 37 - 3 - 21 = 37 - 24 = 13 \\neq 0$\n\nSo, it's non-zero, which is good.\n\nTherefore, $p + q = -1 + (-3) = -4$\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -2\n\nB. -4\n\nC. -1\n\nD. 1\n\nSo, the answer should be B. -4.\n\nBut wait a second, let's double-check everything to be sure.\n\nFirst, expanding $(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2$:\n\n$(x^2)^2 = x^4$\n\n$(x^2)(5x) = 5x^3$\n\n$(x^2)(6) = 6x^2$\n\n$(5x)(x^2) = 5x^3$\n\n$(5x)(5x) = 25x^2$\n\n$(5x)(6) = 30x$\n\n$(6)(x^2) = 6x^2$\n\n$(6)(5x) = 30x$\n\n$(6)(6) = 36$\n\nAdding them up: $x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36$\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, expanding $(px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)$:\n\n$px \\cdot x^3 = p x^4$\n\n$px \\cdot 7x^2 = 7p x^3$\n\n$px \\cdot 3x = 3p x^2$\n\n$q \\cdot x^3 = q x^3$\n\n$q \\cdot 7x^2 = 7q x^2$\n\n$q \\cdot 3x = 3q x$\n\nCombining like terms: $p x^4 + (7p + q) x^3 + (3p + 7q) x^2 + 3q x$\n\nAdding to the first part:\n\n$(1 + p) x^4 + (10 + 7p + q) x^3 + (37 + 3p + 7q) x^2 + (60 + 3q) x + 36$\n\nSetting the coefficients of $x^4$ and $x^3$ to zero:\n\n$1 + p = 0 \\implies p = -1$\n\n$10 + 7(-1) + q = 0 \\implies 10 - 7 + q = 0 \\implies 3 + q = 0 \\implies q = -3$\n\nThen, $p + q = -1 - 3 = -4$\n\nSeems solid. But just to be thorough, let's check if the $x^2$ coefficient is indeed non-zero:\n\n$37 + 3(-1) + 7(-3) = 37 - 3 - 21 = 13 \\neq 0$\n\nGood.\n\nSo, the answer is B. -4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. -4} \\]"
