Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I know that different animals have specific collective nouns. For example, a group of wolves is called a pack, and a group of cows is called a herd. So, similarly, fish must have their own collective noun.\n\nLet me think about this. I've heard the term \"school\" being used to describe a group of fish. Like, \"a school of fish.\" That sounds familiar. I think it's a common way to refer to them, especially in movies or documentaries about ocean life.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe there are other terms as well. Let's see what the other options are.\n\nOption A is \"knot.\" I don't think a knot refers to a group of fish. Maybe a knot is related to something else, like a knot in wood or a knot in fabric. But I'm not sure. Perhaps I should check.\n\nOption B is \"drape.\" That sounds odd for a group of fish. I can't recall ever hearing \"a drape of fish.\" Maybe \"drape\" is used for something else, like fabric or curtains. But again, I'm not certain.\n\nOption D is \"gaggle.\" I think a gaggle refers to a group of geese. You know, like a gaggle of geese. So, that probably doesn't apply to fish.\n\nSo, based on what I know, \"school\" seems to be the correct term for a group of fish. Let me just double-check if there are any other common terms.\n\nI remember that in some contexts, a group of fish can also be called a \"shoal.\" But that's not one of the options here. So, maybe \"shoal\" isn't as commonly used as \"school.\"\n\nAlso, in certain species, they might have different terms, but generally, \"school\" is the one I've heard the most.\n\nLet me consider if there's any difference between \"school\" and \"shoal.\" I think a shoal is a type of school, or perhaps it's a regional difference. But since \"shoal\" isn't an option, I don't need to worry about it right now.\n\nSo, to sum it up, among the given options\u2014knot, drape, school, and gaggle\u2014the correct term to describe a group of fish is \"school.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. School}} \\]"
