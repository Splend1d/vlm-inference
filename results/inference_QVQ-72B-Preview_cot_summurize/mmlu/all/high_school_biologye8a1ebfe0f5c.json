                    "text": "So I have this question about gel electrophoresis, and I need to find out which statement is incorrect. Let me see, gel electrophoresis is a method used to separate DNA fragments based on their size, right? It's like separating pieces of DNA by how big they are.\n\nOption A says that DNA migrates from positive charge to negative charge. Hmm, I thought DNA was negatively charged because of its phosphate groups. So, in an electric field, shouldn't it move towards the positive charge? Wait, no, it should move towards the positive electrode, which is the anode. But actually, in electrophoresis, the DNA moves from the negative electrode towards the positive electrode because it's negatively charged. So, if the negative electrode is on one side and positive on the other, DNA should move from negative to positive. So, option A seems correct.\n\nOption B says smaller DNA travels faster. Yeah, that makes sense. Smaller DNA fragments can move through the gel matrix more easily and quickly than larger ones. So, smaller pieces go farther in the same amount of time. So, this should be correct.\n\nOption C says the DNA migrates only when the current is running. Well, without an electric current, there's no force driving the DNA through the gel. So, DNA won't move if there's no current. Therefore, this seems correct as well.\n\nOption D says the longer the current is running, the farther the DNA will travel. This also sounds right. The longer you apply the electric field, the more time the DNA has to move through the gel, so they should travel farther. But wait, is there a limit to this?\n\nI think there might be a trick here. Maybe if the current runs too long, the DNA could over-run and start to diffuse, making the bands wider and less distinct. But generally, the farther the DNA travels, the better the separation, up to a point. So, perhaps this statement is generally correct, but there might be exceptions or limits.\n\nBut based on the options, it seems like all of them are correct except maybe one, and I need to find which one is incorrect. Wait, maybe option A is incorrect because DNA migrates from negative to positive, not positive to negative. Let me double-check.\n\nIn gel electrophoresis, the gel is placed in a chamber with buffers, and electrodes are connected to the ends. The negative electrode is usually at one end, and the positive at the other. When the current is turned on, the negatively charged DNA moves towards the positive electrode. So, it's migrating from negative to positive, not positive to negative. Therefore, option A seems incorrect.\n\nWait, but the question says \"DNA migrates from positive charge to negative charge.\" Is that possible? No, that doesn't make sense because DNA is negatively charged, so it should move towards the positive charge. Maybe the statement is just phrased incorrectly.\n\nLet me read it again: \"DNA migrates from positive charge to negative charge.\" If DNA is negatively charged, it should move towards the positive charge, meaning from the negative pole to the positive pole. So, the direction is from negative to positive, not positive to negative.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect as stated. It should say DNA migrates from negative to positive, not from positive to negative.\n\nSo, the incorrect statement is option A.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. If DNA is negatively charged, it moves towards the positive electrode. So, it's migrating from the negative side to the positive side. Therefore, the statement \"from positive charge to negative charge\" is incorrect because that would mean moving towards the negative electrode, which is the cathode.\n\nHence, the correct answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
