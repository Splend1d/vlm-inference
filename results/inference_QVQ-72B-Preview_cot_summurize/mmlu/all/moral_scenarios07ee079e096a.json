                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario separately and then determine if they're morally wrong or not.\n\nScenario 1: \"While driving through a terrible storm, I paid attention to my phone.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is driving in bad weather conditions and is looking at their phone. Now, driving in a storm is already risky because of the weather, right? Add to that distraction from a phone, and it sounds even more dangerous. I've heard a lot about distracted driving being a major cause of accidents. In fact, it's against the law in many places to use a phone while driving. So, according to that, it's not just morally wrong but also legally wrong.\n\nBut the question is about moral standards, not legal ones. Although often, laws reflect moral consensus in society. So, in this case, paying attention to a phone while driving through a storm seems reckless and dangerous, not only to the driver but also to others on the road. It shows a lack of responsibility and consideration for safety.\n\nWait, but maybe there are circumstances where checking a phone while driving could be considered necessary or urgent. For example, if the person is lost and needs directions, or if they're receiving an emergency call. But even then, the general advice is to pull over safely before using the phone.\n\nGiven that, I think in most ordinary circumstances, using a phone while driving, especially in bad weather, is considered morally wrong because it endangers oneself and others.\n\nScenario 2: \"I'm young, so I went grocery shopping in the evening.\"\n\nThis one seems different. It's about going grocery shopping in the evening while being young. Hmm, what's the issue here? Is there an implication that because the person is young, they shouldn't be shopping during certain hours?\n\nI recall that during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there were recommendations for older adults and vulnerable populations to shop during specific early morning hours to minimize their risk of exposure to the virus. So, perhaps the scenario is suggesting that by shopping in the evening, the young person is not adhering to those recommendations, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the statement is \"I'm young, so I went grocery shopping in the evening.\" It seems like the person is indicating that their youth is the reason they chose to shop in the evening. Maybe they thought it was safer for them to shop later when stores might be less crowded, reducing any risk to others.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, especially during the pandemic, there wasn't a specific restriction on when young people could shop, as long as they followed general health guidelines like wearing masks and maintaining social distance.\n\nUnless, perhaps, there was a specific recommendation for young people to shop at certain times to avoid peak hours when vulnerable people might be shopping. But I don't recall that being a widespread policy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scenario is implying that by shopping in the evening, the young person is not giving priority to vulnerable groups who might need earlier shopping times. But again, I'm not sure if that aligns with general moral standards at the time.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the scenario is suggesting that the young person is selfish for shopping at a time when it might be busier, increasing the risk of spreading disease. But that seems like a stretch.\n\nOverall, I think that shopping in the evening as a young person doesn't necessarily constitute a morally wrong action, provided that the person is following health and safety guidelines.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Using a phone while driving through a storm is likely considered morally wrong due to the risks it poses to safety.\n\n- Scenario 2: Shopping in the evening while being young isn't clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait, but the options are presented as:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, selecting B. Wrong, Not wrong would correspond to Scenario 1 being wrong and Scenario 2 being not wrong, which matches my analysis.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another perspective.\n\nPerhaps someone could argue that shopping in the evening as a young person is morally wrong because it could potentially increase the risk of spreading disease, especially if the store is crowded. However, without additional context, it's hard to make that leap. After all, people need to shop for essentials regardless of their age, and as long as they're taking precautions, the timing shouldn't be a moral issue.\n\nAlso, considering that during the pandemic, stores often had specific hours for vulnerable populations, but didn't necessarily restrict other groups from shopping at certain times.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
