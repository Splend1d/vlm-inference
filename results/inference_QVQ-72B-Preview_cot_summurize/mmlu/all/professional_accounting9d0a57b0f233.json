                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Smith Legal Services is offering to represent a plaintiff in a lawsuit. They want a retainer of $20,000 plus 40% of any award over $20,000. They also expect to incur out-of-pocket expenditures of $15,000 in litigating the suit. The possible court awards and their probabilities are $100,000 with a probability of 0.7 and $0 with a probability of 0.3. We need to find the expected value to Smith of the lawsuit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the expected value means in this context. In probability, the expected value is the long-run average of a random variable, considering its probabilities. So, I need to calculate the expected payoff for Smith from this lawsuit.\n\nLet's consider the two possible outcomes:\n\n1. The court awards $100,000 with a probability of 0.7.\n\n2. The court awards $0 with a probability of 0.3.\n\nNow, for each scenario, I need to calculate how much Smith would get after accounting for the retainer and the percentage of the award.\n\nStarting with the $100,000 award:\n\n- Smith gets a retainer of $20,000 plus 40% of any award over $20,000.\n\n- The award is $100,000, so the amount over $20,000 is $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000.\n\n- 40% of $80,000 is 0.40 * $80,000 = $32,000.\n\n- So, Smith's total income from this award would be $20,000 (retainer) + $32,000 (40% of $80,000) = $52,000.\n\n- However, Smith also incurs $15,000 in out-of-pocket expenditures.\n\n- Therefore, the net income for Smith in this scenario is $52,000 - $15,000 = $37,000.\n\nNow, for the scenario where the court awards $0:\n\n- Smith still gets the retainer of $20,000.\n\n- Since there is no award, there's no additional 40% to be taken.\n\n- But they still have to pay the $15,000 in out-of-pocket expenditures.\n\n- So, net income in this scenario is $20,000 - $15,000 = $5,000.\n\nNow, to find the expected value, I need to take the weighted average of these outcomes, using their probabilities.\n\n- For the $100,000 award: $37,000 with probability 0.7.\n\n- For the $0 award: $5,000 with probability 0.3.\n\nSo, expected value = (0.7 * $37,000) + (0.3 * $5,000).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n= (0.7 * 37,000) + (0.3 * 5,000)\n\n= (25,900) + (1,500)\n\n= $27,400\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, in the $100,000 award scenario:\n\n- Retainer: $20,000\n\n- 40% of ($100,000 - $20,000) = 40% of $80,000 = $32,000\n\n- Total income: $20,000 + $32,000 = $52,000\n\n- Subtract expenditures: $52,000 - $15,000 = $37,000\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIn the $0 award scenario:\n\n- Retainer: $20,000\n\n- No additional amount from the award\n\n- Subtract expenditures: $20,000 - $15,000 = $5,000\n\nThat also seems right.\n\nNow, calculating the expected value:\n\n- 0.7 * $37,000 = $25,900\n\n- 0.3 * $5,000 = $1,500\n\n- Sum: $25,900 + $1,500 = $27,400\n\nSo, the expected value to Smith of the lawsuit is $27,400.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $25,900\n\nB. $27,400\n\nC. $33,000\n\nD. $37,000\n\nIt seems like the correct answer is B. $27,400.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the retainer or the percentage of the award.\n\nThe retainer is $20,000 plus 40% of any award over $20,000. So, it's not 40% of the entire award, but only of the amount above $20,000. So, in the $100,000 award scenario, it's correctly calculated as $20,000 + 40% of ($100,000 - $20,000) = $20,000 + $32,000 = $52,000.\n\nIn the $0 award scenario, there's no additional amount from the award, so only the retainer is received, minus the expenditures.\n\nTherefore, the expected value calculation seems accurate.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might calculate it differently, but in this case, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. $27,400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 27400} \\]"
