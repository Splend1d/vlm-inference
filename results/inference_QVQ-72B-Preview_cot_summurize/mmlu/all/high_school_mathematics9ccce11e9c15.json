                    "text": "Let's see what we've got here. So, Rowena can paint a room in 14 hours, and Ruby can paint it in 6 hours. That means Rowena's painting rate is 1/14 of the room per hour, and Ruby's is 1/6 per hour. Now, there are two scenarios given:\n\n1. If Rowena paints for x hours and Ruby for y hours, they finish half the room.\n\n2. If Rowena paints for y hours and Ruby for x hours, they finish the whole room.\n\nAnd we need to find the ordered pair (x, y).\n\nAlright, let's translate these into equations.\n\nFor the first scenario, the combined work done is half the room:\n\nRowena's contribution: (1/14) * x\n\nRuby's contribution: (1/6) * y\n\nTogether, that's (1/14)x + (1/6)y = 1/2\n\nFor the second scenario, the combined work is the whole room:\n\nRowena's contribution: (1/14) * y\n\nRuby's contribution: (1/6) * x\n\nTogether, that's (1/14)y + (1/6)x = 1\n\nSo, our system of equations is:\n\n(1/14)x + (1/6)y = 1/2\n\n(1/14)y + (1/6)x = 1\n\nHmm, that looks a bit messy with all the fractions. Maybe I can eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator or multiplying both sides by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.\n\nThe denominators are 14 and 6. The LCM of 14 and 6 is 42.\n\nLet's multiply both equations by 42 to eliminate the fractions.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n42 * [(1/14)x + (1/6)y] = 42 * (1/2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3x + 7y = 21\n\nSecond equation:\n\n42 * [(1/14)y + (1/6)x] = 42 * 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3y + 7x = 42\n\nOkay, now we have:\n\n3x + 7y = 21\n\n7x + 3y = 42\n\nThis is a system of linear equations, and I need to solve for x and y.\n\nLet me see, I can use either substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be easier here.\n\nLet me align the equations properly:\n\n3x + 7y = 21  ...(1)\n\n7x + 3y = 42  ...(2)\n\nMaybe I can multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 7 to make the coefficients of y the same.\n\nEquation (1) * 3:\n\n9x + 21y = 63  ...(1a)\n\nEquation (2) * 7:\n\n49x + 21y = 294  ...(2a)\n\nNow, if I subtract equation (1a) from equation (2a):\n\n(49x + 21y) - (9x + 21y) = 294 - 63\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n40x = 231\n\nSo, x = 231/40\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit messy. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nx = 231/40, which is approximately 5.775 hours.\n\nNow, I need to find y. Let's plug x back into one of the equations.\n\nLet's use equation (1):\n\n3x + 7y = 21\n\nSubstitute x = 231/40:\n\n3*(231/40) + 7y = 21\n\nMultiply 3 and 231, then divide by 40:\n\n(693/40) + 7y = 21\n\nNow, subtract 693/40 from both sides:\n\n7y = 21 - 693/40\n\nConvert 21 to a fraction with denominator 40:\n\n21 = 840/40\n\nSo, 840/40 - 693/40 = 147/40\n\nTherefore, 7y = 147/40\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\ny = (147/40)/7 = 147/280 = 21/40\n\nSo, y = 21/40\n\nNow, let's check if this satisfies the second equation:\n\n7x + 3y = 42\n\nPlug in x = 231/40 and y = 21/40:\n\n7*(231/40) + 3*(21/40) =?\n\nCalculate 7*231 = 1617\n\n1617/40 + 63/40 = (1617 + 63)/40 = 1680/40 = 42\n\nYes, that matches the second equation.\n\nSo, the solution is x = 231/40 and y = 21/40.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (11/10, 11/10)\n\nB. (231/20, 21/20)\n\nC. (231/40, 21/40)\n\nD. (1,1)\n\nSo, option C matches our solution.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's just double-check if there's another way to approach this, maybe to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet's consider the rates again.\n\nRowena's rate: 1/14 per hour\n\nRuby's rate: 1/6 per hour\n\nIn the first scenario:\n\nRowena paints for x hours: work done = (1/14)x\n\nRuby paints for y hours: work done = (1/6)y\n\nTotal work: (1/14)x + (1/6)y = 1/2\n\nIn the second scenario:\n\nRowena paints for y hours: work done = (1/14)y\n\nRuby paints for x hours: work done = (1/6)x\n\nTotal work: (1/14)y + (1/6)x = 1\n\nSo, same equations as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express y in terms of x from one equation and substitute into the other.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n3x + 7y = 21\n\nLet's solve for y:\n\n7y = 21 - 3x\n\ny = (21 - 3x)/7 = 3(7 - x)/7 = 3 - (3x)/7\n\nNow, plug this into equation (2):\n\n7x + 3y = 42\n\nSubstitute y:\n\n7x + 3[3 - (3x)/7] = 42\n\nSimplify:\n\n7x + 9 - (9x)/7 = 42\n\nMultiply everything by 7 to eliminate fractions:\n\n49x + 63 - 9x = 294\n\n40x + 63 = 294\n\nSubtract 63 from both sides:\n\n40x = 231\n\nx = 231/40\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, it confirms x = 231/40.\n\nThen, y = 3 - (3*(231/40))/7 = 3 - (693)/(280) = 3 - 2.475 = 0.525\n\nWhich is 21/40, as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. (231/40, 21/40)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
