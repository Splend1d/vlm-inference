                    "text": "So I have this trivia question here: \"What character did Woody replace on the TV show 'Cheers'?\" and the options are A. Coach, B. Diane, C. Norm, D. Frasier. Hmm, I need to think about this. I'm pretty sure Woody Harrelson joined the cast of Cheers at some point, but I don't remember exactly who he replaced.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall the main characters of Cheers. There's Sam Malone, the bartender and former Red Sox pitcher, played by Ted Danson. Then there's Diane Chambers, the snobby waitress played by Shelley Long. Norm Peterson, the beer-guzzling regular played by George Wendt, and Frasier Crane, the stuffy\u5fc3\u7406\u5206\u6790\u5e08 played by Kelsey Grammer. There's also Cliff Clavin, the know-it-all postal worker played by John Ratzenberger, and Carla Tortelli, the wisecracking waitress played by Rhea Perlman.\n\nNow, Woody Harrelson joined the show later in its run. I think he played Woody Boyd, a young bartender who came to Boston from small-town Ohio. So, if he's playing a bartender, that means he's working alongside Sam Malone, right? But Sam is the main bartender and owner of the bar.\n\nWait a minute, maybe he replaced someone who left the show. Let me think about the timing. Cheers started in 1982 and ran until 1993. Woody Harrelson joined in the fourth season, I think. So, who was on the show before him?\n\nLooking back at the characters, Coach was another bartender played by Nicholas Colasanto. Wait, was Coach replaced by Woody? Let me check that.\n\nCoach was a regular character in the first three seasons, and he was known for his slow speech and simple-mindedness. He was a beloved character, but Nicholas Colasanto passed away during the third season, which led to Coach's absence from the show.\n\nAfter Coach's departure, the show introduced Woody Boyd in the fourth season as a new bartender. So, did Woody replace Coach? In a way, yes, because he took over some of Coach's bartending duties and became a part of the regular cast.\n\nBut, Sam Malone was still there, so it's not like Woody replaced Sam. Maybe it's more accurate to say that Woody was brought in to fill the void left by Coach's departure.\n\nLet me consider the other options. Diane left the show during the fifth season when Shelley Long left, and she was eventually replaced by Rebecca Howe, played by Kirstie Alley. So, that's not Woody.\n\nNorm was a regular customer throughout the entire series, so he wasn't replaced.\n\nFrasier was introduced in the fifth season and stayed until the end, spinning off into his own show, Frasier. But he wasn't replaced by Woody.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Woody replaced Coach, since Coach was a bartender and Woody came in as another bartender after Coach's departure.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"what character did Woody replace on the TV show 'Cheers'?\" and the options are given as A. Coach, B. Diane, C. Norm, D. Frasier. So, among these options, Coach seems to be the most logical choice.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other character that Woody directly replaced. For example, did Woody take over any specific storylines or roles that another character had before him?\n\nI recall that after Coach died, there was a episode where they tried to introduce a new character named Bob, played by Bill Erwin, but that didn't pan out. Then, Woody was introduced as a new bartender, so perhaps he was the official replacement for Coach.\n\nAdditionally, Woody and Coach share some similarities in that they are both bartenders and have a naive, wholesome quality, though Woody is more energetic and optimistic compared to Coach's slower pace.\n\nI should also consider the timing. If Woody joined in the fourth season and Coach had passed away at the end of the third season, then it makes sense that Woody was brought in to fill that spot in the cast.\n\nLet me double-check this information to be sure. I found that Nicholas Colasanto passed away in February 1985, during the third season, and Woody Harrelson first appeared in the fourth season, which started in September 1985. So, the timing lines up perfectly.\n\nMoreover, in the episode where Woody is introduced, \"Birth, Death, Love and Rice,\" there's a reference to him taking over some of Coach's responsibilities at the bar.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Woody replaced Coach on the show.\n\nWait, but the question says \"what character did Woody replace,\" and the option is A. Coach. So, according to my reasoning, that seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any trick to this question. Maybe there's another way to interpret it.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps Woody didn't directly replace Coach in terms of character development, but was added as a new character alongside the existing ones.\n\nBut, given that a bartender position was vacated by Coach's death, and Woody was brought in as another bartender, it's still plausible to say that Woody replaced Coach in that capacity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the show was looking to maintain a certain dynamic at the bar and needed another bartender to fill that role.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is A. Coach.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's quickly consider why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. Diane: Diane left the show in the fifth season, after Woody had already been on the show for a year. Plus, Diane was a waitress, not a bartender, so her role was different from Woody's.\n\nC. Norm: Norm was a customer and never left the show, so Woody didn't replace him.\n\nD. Frasier: Frasier was introduced in the fifth season and stayed until the end, so Woody didn't replace him either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Coach.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Coach}} \\]"
