                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many half-lives it will take to reduce 10.0 kilograms of a radioactive substance down to 1.0 microgram of that substance. The options are 8, 13, 29, or 34 half-lives. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay pattern, and the concept of a half-life is central to understanding how the mass of a substance decreases over time. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay, so after one half-life, you're left with half of the original amount; after two half-lives, you have a quarter, and so on.\n\nMathematically, I can use the formula that relates the remaining mass to the initial mass and the number of half-lives:\n\n\\[ \\text{remaining mass} = \\text{initial mass} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n \\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of half-lives.\n\nIn this problem, the initial mass is 10.0 kg, and the remaining mass is 1.0 microgram. I need to solve for \\(n\\).\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the units are consistent. 10.0 kg is 10,000 grams, and 1.0 microgram is 0.000001 grams. So, let's convert everything to grams to make it easier:\n\nInitial mass = 10,000 grams\n\nRemaining mass = 0.000001 grams\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ 0.000001 = 10000 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(n\\). Let's see:\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 10,000:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n = \\frac{0.000001}{10000} = 0.000000000001 \\]\n\nWow, that's a small number. So, \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n = 10^{-12} \\).\n\nNow, to solve for \\(n\\), I can take the logarithm of both sides. Maybe using natural logs or base 10 logs. I think base 2 is more straightforward here, but I don't have a base 2 log function handy. Alternatively, I can use the change of base formula.\n\nThe change of base formula is:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\log(0.000000000001)}{\\log(0.5)} \\]\n\nI can calculate this using a calculator.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\log(0.000000000001)\\):\n\nThat's \\(\\log(10^{-12}) = -12\\)\n\nAnd \\(\\log(0.5) = \\log(2^{-1}) = -\\log(2)\\)\n\nSo, \\(n = \\frac{-12}{-\\log(2)} = \\frac{12}{\\log(2)}\\)\n\nI know that \\(\\log(2) \\approx 0.3010\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(n = \\frac{12}{0.3010} \\approx 39.87\\)\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 8, 13, 29, or 34. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n = 10^{-12} \\]\n\nTaking log of both sides:\n\n\\[ n \\times \\log(0.5) = \\log(10^{-12}) \\]\n\n\\[ n \\times (-\\log(2)) = -12 \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{12}{\\log(2)} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. But \\(\\log(2)\\) is approximately 0.3010, so \\(n \\approx 39.87\\), which is not among the options. Maybe I need to consider the units again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting the units. Let's see:\n\n1 kilogram = 1,000 grams\n\nSo, 10 kg = 10,000 grams\n\n1 microgram = 0.000001 grams\n\nSo, 1.0 microgram = 0.000001 grams\n\nSo, initial mass is 10,000 grams, remaining mass is 0.000001 grams.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.000001}{10000} = 10^{-12} \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the number of half-lives needed to reduce the mass by a factor of 10,000,000,000 (since 10 kg to 1 microgram is a reduction by that factor).\n\nWait, 10 kg to 1 microgram is a reduction by a factor of 10,000,000,000, which is \\(10^{10}\\), not \\(10^{-12}\\). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me recast this.\n\nThe initial mass is 10 kg, which is \\(10^4\\) grams.\n\nThe final mass is 1 microgram, which is \\(10^{-6}\\) grams.\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10^{-6}}{10^4} = 10^{-10} \\]\n\nSo, the remaining mass is \\(10^{-10}\\) of the initial mass.\n\nNow, for each half-life, the mass is multiplied by 0.5.\n\nSo, after \\(n\\) half-lives, the mass is:\n\n\\[ \\text{remaining mass} = \\text{initial mass} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n \\]\n\nSet this equal to \\(10^{-10}\\) times the initial mass:\n\n\\[ 10^{-10} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(n\\):\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(10^{-10}) = n \\ln(0.5) \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-10 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(0.5)} \\]\n\nI know that \\(\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026\\) and \\(\\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(2) \\approx -0.6931\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-10 \\times 2.3026}{-0.6931} = \\frac{-23.026}{-0.6931} \\approx 33.2 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 33.2 half-lives are needed.\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest one is 34.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 34.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"approximately how many half-lives\", and 33.2 is closer to 33 than to 34. But 33 isn't an option, and 34 is the next closest. Maybe due to rounding, 34 is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider using base 2 logarithms directly.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n = 10^{-10} \\]\n\nTaking log base 2:\n\n\\[ n = \\log_2(10^{-10}) = -10 \\log_2(10) \\]\n\nI know that \\(\\log_2(10) = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{2.3026}{0.6931} \\approx 3.3219\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ n = -10 \\times 3.3219 = -33.219 \\]\n\nSince the number of half-lives can't be negative, we take the absolute value, which is approximately 33.2.\n\nSo, rounding up to the nearest whole number gives 34 half-lives.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 34.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
