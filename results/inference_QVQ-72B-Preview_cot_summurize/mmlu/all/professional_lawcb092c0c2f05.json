                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out who's right in this situation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a landowner who owns a farm in fee simple. That means the landowner has complete ownership of the farm, right? Then, this landowner conveys the property by warranty deed to an investor. A warranty deed typically guarantees that the title is clear and free of defects, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.\n\nNext, the investor takes out a mortgage on the farm to secure a loan from a farmer. The amount is $50,000, and the mortgage is recorded immediately. Recording the mortgage is important because it makes it part of the public record, giving notice to everyone that the farmer has a claim against the property.\n\nTwo years later, the investor conveys the farm to his friend by quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property without any warranty of that interest. So, if the investor still owns the farm, the friend gets whatever interest the investor has, but there are no guarantees about the title.\n\nAccording to the deed instrument, the friend \"assumed the mortgage.\" Assuming the mortgage probably means that the friend agreed to take over the payments on the existing mortgage from the investor to the farmer.\n\nThen, the investor defaults on the mortgage. I assume that means the investor stops making the mortgage payments, even though the friend supposedly took over the mortgage.\n\nNow, the farmer brings an in personam action against the friend to recover the amount due on the mortgage. In personam means the action is against the person, not just the property, so the farmer is trying to collect the money from the friend personally.\n\nThe question is: will the farmer prevail in this action?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Prevail, because the friend acquired title by quitclaim deed.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about this one. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has, but it doesn't create any new obligations or assume existing debts unless specified. So, just because the friend got the title via quitclaim deed doesn't necessarily mean they are personally liable for the mortgage.\n\nB. Prevail, because the farmer was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend.\n\nA third-party beneficiary is someone who has the right to enforce a contract even though they are not a party to it. In this case, the conveyance was between the investor and the friend, and the farmer was the original lender to the investor. If the friend assumed the mortgage, that might make the farmer a beneficiary of that assumption, meaning the farmer can enforce the friend's promise to pay the mortgage.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the conveyance between the investor and the friend did not effectuate a delegation of duties.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. A delegation of duties usually refers to one party transferring their obligations under a contract to another party. In this case, if the investor assigned the mortgage to the friend, that would be a delegation. But assuming the mortgage might be different. Assuming the mortgage probably means the friend agreed to make the mortgage payments, which could be seen as taking on the investor's duty to pay the mortgage.\n\nD. Not prevail, unless the land was subject to the mortgage.\n\nWell, the land was mortgaged by the investor to secure the loan from the farmer. So, the land is indeed subject to the mortgage. But the farmer is bringing an in personam action against the friend, not just a claim against the land.\n\nI think the key here is understanding what it means for the friend to \"assume the mortgage.\" If the friend assumed the mortgage, that means they agreed to take over the payments on the mortgage from the investor. So, the friend is now responsible for paying the mortgage to the farmer.\n\nIf the investor defaults on the mortgage, and the friend has assumed the mortgage, then the farmer can likely hold the friend responsible for the payments.\n\nBut wait, the investor conveyed the farm to the friend by quitclaim deed, which doesn't necessarily transfer the mortgage obligation unless specifically stated. So, did the friend actually agree to pay the mortgage?\n\nAssuming the mortgage probably means that the friend agreed to make the mortgage payments, which would make them personally liable for those payments.\n\nSo, if the investor defaults, and the friend has assumed the mortgage, the farmer can probably sue the friend for the amount due.\n\nOption B suggests that the farmer prevails because they are a third-party beneficiary. That might be the case, as the farmer is the one who benefits from the friend assuming the mortgage.\n\nOption C says the farmer won't prevail unless there was a proper delegation of duties. If the friend assumed the mortgage, that might be considered a delegation, where the investor is delegating their duty to pay the mortgage to the friend.\n\nBut in most cases, assuming a mortgage involves the assumption of the debt, meaning the friend agrees to pay the mortgage payments.\n\nOption D says the farmer won't prevail unless the land was subject to the mortgage, which it is, since the mortgage was recorded.\n\nBut the action is in personam, meaning it's against the friend personally, not just against the land.\n\nSo, if the friend assumed the mortgage, they are personally liable for the payments, and the farmer can sue them personally for any defaults.\n\nGiven that, I think the farmer will prevail because the friend assumed the mortgage, making them personally liable for the payments.\n\nBetween the options, B seems to be the closest, as the farmer is a third-party beneficiary of the assumption agreement between the investor and the friend.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because assuming the mortgage might create a direct contract between the friend and the farmer, making the farmer a creditor of the friend.\n\nWait, in property law, when someone assumes a mortgage, they are typically agreeing to pay the mortgage to the lender, which would make the lender a creditor of the assumer.\n\nSo, in this case, the friend assumed the mortgage, meaning they agreed to pay the mortgage to the farmer.\n\nTherefore, if the investor defaults, and the friend has assumed the mortgage, the farmer can hold the friend responsible for the payments.\n\nSo, the farmer should prevail in this action against the friend.\n\nOption A says prevail because of the quitclaim deed, but I don't think that's the main reason. Quitclaim deeds don't automatically transfer mortgage obligations; it's the assumption that's key here.\n\nOption C says not prevail unless there was a delegation of duties, but assuming the mortgage is likely a form of delegation.\n\nOption D says not prevail unless the land was subject to the mortgage, which it is, but again, the action is in personam against the friend, not just against the land.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B: prevail, because the farmer was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I should look up what it means to assume a mortgage.\n\nUpon a quick search, assuming a mortgage generally means that the new owner (the friend in this case) agrees to take over the existing mortgage payments. This often requires the lender's consent, but assuming that consent was given, the friend would be personally liable for the mortgage payments.\n\nSo, if the investor defaults, and the friend has assumed the mortgage, the farmer can seek remedy from the friend personally.\n\nTherefore, the farmer should prevail in this action.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Prevail, because the farmer was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
