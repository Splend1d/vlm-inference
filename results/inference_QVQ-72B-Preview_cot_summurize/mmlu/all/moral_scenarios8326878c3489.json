                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems like there might be some confusion with the way the options are phrased, but I'll try to make sense of it.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"A debater that I like wanted to win, so I assigned her judges that are sympathetic to her arguments.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, there's a debater that the person likes, and they wanted to help her win by assigning judges who are sympathetic to her arguments. Now, in debating competitions, it's important to have impartial judges to ensure fairness. If someone is assigning judges based on their likelihood to favor a particular debater, that seems unethical because it gives an unfair advantage to that debater. It's like rigging the system in her favor.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, this would be considered a conflict of interest or bias, which are generally seen as wrong. In academic and competitive settings, maintaining fairness and objectivity is crucial. So, according to ordinary moral standards, I think this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I turned the radio louder so I could keep up my neighbor.\"\n\nWait a minute, this sentence seems a bit unclear. It says, \"I turned the radio louder so I could keep up my neighbor.\" I'm not entirely sure what \"keep up my neighbor\" means in this context. Maybe it's a typo or something got messed up in the phrasing. Let me see if I can interpret this correctly.\n\nPerhaps it means, \"I turned the radio louder so I could hear it over my neighbor's noise.\" Or maybe, \"I turned the radio louder so my neighbor could hear it too.\" Without clear context, it's hard to be sure. But let's assume a few possible interpretations and see which one might involve a moral wrongdoing.\n\nOption A: The person turned the radio louder to annoy their neighbor.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's intentionally causing discomfort or disturbance to someone else, which is generally considered wrong. Harassing or annoying neighbors on purpose is morally unacceptable.\n\nOption B: The person turned the radio louder because their neighbor was making a lot of noise, and they wanted to drown it out.\n\nIn this case, it's more of a self-serving action, possibly showing a lack of consideration for others, but not necessarily intentionally harmful. It might still be seen as inconsiderate or selfish, but not clearly morally wrong.\n\nOption C: The person turned the radio louder so that their neighbor could hear it and enjoy it too.\n\nThis seems more altruistic. Sharing music with a neighbor might be seen as a kind gesture, depending on the context. If the neighbor enjoys the music and it's mutually agreeable, then it's not morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the exact meaning isn't clear, I need to make an educated guess based on the phrasing. \"Keep up my neighbor\" could imply continuing to engage with the neighbor in some way, perhaps in a conversation or shared activity. But turning up the radio louder to do that seems a bit odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about maintaining a certain atmosphere or ensuring that the neighbor can hear the radio. But again, without clearer context, it's tough to say.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong because it involves favoritism and potential cheating in a debate competition, which violates principles of fairness and integrity.\n\nScenario 2 is more ambiguous. Depending on the interpretation, it could be seen as wrong (if it's intended to annoy the neighbor) or not wrong (if it's a harmless or even considerate action).\n\nGiven the uncertainty in Scenario 2, I need to choose between \"Wrong, Not wrong\" and \"Wrong, Wrong.\" Since I'm not sure about the exact meaning of Scenario 2, I might lean towards \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" assuming that Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nBut considering that the options might be presented in a specific order, perhaps the first \"Wrong\" corresponds to Scenario 1 and the second to Scenario 2. If that's the case, then selecting \"Wrong, Not wrong\" would mean that Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong, which aligns with my initial thoughts.\n\nAlternatively, if the options are meant to cover both scenarios in one choice, then \"Wrong, Wrong\" would imply both scenarios are wrong, which doesn't fit my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are formatted as pairs, like the first term applies to Scenario 1 and the second to Scenario 2. So, \"Wrong, Wrong\" means both are wrong, \"Wrong, Not wrong\" means Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong, and so on.\n\nGiven that, and considering that Scenario 1 is clearly wrong and Scenario 2 is unclear, but leaning towards not wrong, then \"Wrong, Not wrong\" seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, if Scenario 2 is interpreted as intentionally annoying the neighbor, then it could be considered wrong as well. But without clear context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nTo make an informed decision, perhaps I should consider the most likely interpretation. If \"keep up my neighbor\" means to continue engaging with the neighbor in a positive way, then turning up the radio louder might be seen as a way to share music or maintain a connection, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's about keeping up with the neighbor in a competitive sense, like matching their noise levels, it might be seen as escalating a noise issue, which could be considered wrong.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll stick with my initial thought that Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, and Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong, at least not to the same extent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
