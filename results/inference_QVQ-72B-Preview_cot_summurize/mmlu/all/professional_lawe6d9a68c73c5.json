                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about a local ordinance in Breezytown that lets the mayor decide who gets a permit to speak in the city park. The ordinance is pretty broad; it just says the mayor can use his discretion in granting permits. So, if someone gives a political speech in the park without a permit and gets arrested and convicted, is that constitutional?\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what the First Amendment says about free speech, especially in public forums like parks. I recall that the First Amendment protects free speech, and parks are considered traditional public forums where people have a right to speak and assemble.\n\nNow, the ordinance allows the mayor to decide who gets a permit to speak. But it's very broad, just saying the mayor has discretion. There are no clear standards or guidelines for how the mayor should make that decision. That seems problematic because it could lead to arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.\n\nIf someone speaks without a permit and gets arrested, their conviction would be based on violating this ordinance. But if the ordinance itself is unconstitutional, then the conviction might not hold up.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the ordinance controls.\n\nWell, just because an ordinance exists doesn't mean it's constitutional. If the ordinance violates someone's constitutional rights, like free speech, then it shouldn't be enforced.\n\nB. Yes, because he didn't have a permit.\n\nBut again, if the requirement for a permit is unconstitutional, then punishing someone for not having one is also unconstitutional.\n\nC. No, the ordinance is void on its face.\n\n\"Void on its face\" means that the law is invalid in all its applications because it's too vague or overbroad. In this case, the ordinance gives the mayor unfettered discretion to grant or deny permits without any clear criteria. That could be considered a violation of due process or free speech because it doesn't provide fair notice of what's prohibited and could be used to suppress speech based on content.\n\nD. No, because it is a public park.\n\nThis seems a bit simplistic. While it's true that public parks are traditional public forums where free speech is strongly protected, the fact that it's a public park doesn't automatically make the ordinance unconstitutional. However, it does mean that any regulation of speech in the park must meet certain constitutional standards.\n\nI think the key here is that the ordinance is overly broad and gives the mayor too much unguided discretion. In First Amendment law, regulations that affect speech must be narrowly tailored and content-neutral unless there's a compelling government interest.\n\nMoreover, ordinances that give unlimited discretion to a government official to grant or deny permits based on subjective judgments are often struck down as unconstitutional because they can be used to suppress speech based on the speaker's viewpoint or the content of the speech.\n\nSo, if someone is arrested and convicted for speaking without a permit under this ordinance, their conviction could be challenged on the grounds that the ordinance is unconstitutional.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking whether the conviction would be constitutional. So, if the ordinance is unconstitutional, then the conviction based on that ordinance would also be unconstitutional.\n\nBut let's make sure. Suppose the ordinance is facially invalid because it's too vague or overbroad, then any conviction relying on it would be invalid as well.\n\nAlternatively, if the ordinance is constitutional on its face but is applied in an unconstitutional manner, that's a different issue. But in this scenario, it seems like the ordinance itself is the problem due to its lack of clear standards.\n\nSo, between the options, it seems like C or D could be correct, but C seems more precise because it directly refers to the ordinance being void on its face.\n\nOption D says \"No, because it is a public park.\" That's a bit too simplistic because just because it's a public park doesn't mean all regulations are invalid. There can be valid time, place, and manner restrictions on speech in public parks, as long as they're content-neutral and narrowly tailored.\n\nBut in this case, the ordinance isn't just about time, place, and manner; it's about giving the mayor unfettered discretion to decide who can speak, which could be based on content or other impermissible factors.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: No, the ordinance is void on its face.\n\nThis is because the ordinance gives the mayor unguided discretion, which is likely unconstitutional, making any conviction based on it invalid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
