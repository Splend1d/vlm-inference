                    "text": "So I've got this inequality: |n| < |n - 3| < 9, and I need to find the sum of all integer solutions. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this inequality is saying. It's saying that the absolute value of n is less than the absolute value of (n minus 3), and both of those are less than 9.\n\nLet me think about the absolute value expressions. |n| is the distance of n from 0 on the number line, and |n - 3| is the distance of n from 3 on the number line.\n\nSo, the inequality |n| < |n - 3| means that n is closer to 0 than to 3. That makes sense because |n - 3| is larger than |n| only when n is closer to 0 than to 3.\n\nNow, the second part is |n - 3| < 9, which means that n is within 9 units of 3. So, n can be anywhere from 3 - 9 = -6 to 3 + 9 = 12, but not including -6 and 12 because it's less than 9, not less than or equal to 9.\n\nWait, actually, no. |n - 3| < 9 means that n is between 3 - 9 = -6 and 3 + 9 = 12, but not including -6 and 12 because it's strictly less than 9.\n\nBut I need to consider both inequalities together: |n| < |n - 3| and |n - 3| < 9.\n\nMaybe it would help to solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions.\n\nLet's start with |n - 3| < 9.\n\nThis inequality means that n is within 9 units of 3, so:\n\n-6 < n < 12\n\nSo, n can be any real number between -6 and 12, not including -6 and 12.\n\nNow, for the first inequality |n| < |n - 3|.\n\nThis inequality is saying that the distance of n from 0 is less than the distance of n from 3.\n\nI recall that the general formula for |a| < |b| is equivalent to a^2 < b^2, because absolute value is the square root of the square, and squares are always non-negative.\n\nSo, |n| < |n - 3| \u21d2 n^2 < (n - 3)^2\n\nLet's expand (n - 3)^2:\n\n(n - 3)^2 = n^2 - 6n + 9\n\nSo, n^2 < n^2 - 6n + 9\n\nSubtract n^2 from both sides:\n\n0 < -6n + 9\n\nNow, subtract 9 from both sides:\n\n-9 < -6n\n\nDivide both sides by -6, remembering to reverse the inequality sign because we're dividing by a negative number:\n\n-9/-6 > n \u21d2 1.5 > n \u21d2 n < 1.5\n\nSo, |n| < |n - 3| is true when n < 1.5\n\nNow, combining this with the earlier inequality |n - 3| < 9, which is -6 < n < 12\n\nBut since n < 1.5, the intersection of n < 1.5 and -6 < n < 12 is just -6 < n < 1.5\n\nSo, the solution to both inequalities is n \u2208 (-6, 1.5)\n\nNow, I need to find all integer solutions in this interval and sum them up.\n\nFirst, list the integers between -6 and 1.5: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1\n\nSo, the integer solutions are n = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1\n\nNow, sum these up:\n\n-5 + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1\n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n-5 + (-4) = -9\n\n-9 + (-3) = -12\n\n-12 + (-2) = -14\n\n-14 + (-1) = -15\n\n-15 + 0 = -15\n\n-15 + 1 = -14\n\nSo, the sum is -14\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -9\n\nB. -14\n\nC. 14\n\nD. 9\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. -14\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, confirm the solution interval: -6 < n < 1.5\n\nYes, n < 1.5 from |n| < |n - 3|, and n > -6 from |n - 3| < 9\n\nIntegers in this range are indeed -5 to 1 inclusive.\n\nSumming them up: -5 to 1.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nThe series is: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1\n\nNumber of terms: 7\n\nSum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nSum = 7/2 * (-5 + 1) = 7/2 * (-4) = -14\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is -14, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-14} \\]"
