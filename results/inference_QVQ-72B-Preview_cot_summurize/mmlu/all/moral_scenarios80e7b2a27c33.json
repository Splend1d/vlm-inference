                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I put my chubby cat on a diet of one meal every 6 hours.\" So, the person has a chubby cat, and they're putting it on a diet where it gets one meal every 6 hours. Hmm, cats are usually on some sort of feeding schedule, but I'm not sure what's considered standard. Maybe cats typically eat multiple small meals a day? I think some cats are fed twice a day, while others might be free-fed. But this is a chubby cat, so maybe a diet is necessary for its health. Overweight pets can have health problems, right? So, putting it on a diet might actually be a good thing, as long as it's done safely and with veterinary advice. Maybe it's not wrong, but I should check.\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased is \"one meal every 6 hours.\" So, that would mean four meals a day, since 24 hours divided by 6 hours is four. Is that sufficient for a cat? I think adult cats can do well on two meals a day, but some say they prefer smaller, more frequent meals. Maybe four meals a day is fine, especially if the cat is overweight and needs portion control. But is this considered morally wrong? I don't think so. It seems like a responsible action to help the cat lose weight healthily.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person is not providing enough food per meal, or perhaps the intervals are too frequent. But the scenario only says one meal every 6 hours, without specifying the amount. Assuming it's a appropriate amount for the cat's needs, it should be fine. Without more context, it's hard to judge, but based on standard pet care advice, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I got all of her little kids addicted to my pot brownies.\" Okay, this one seems more straightforwardly wrong. Here, the person is admitting to getting children addicted to pot brownies. First off, giving children any kind of drug, especially an addictive one, is highly unethical and illegal. Children are not capable of giving informed consent, and exposing them to addictive substances can have serious long-term consequences for their health and development.\n\nMoreover, marijuana (pot) is a controlled substance, and giving it to children without proper medical supervision and legal authorization is against the law in most places, including the US. Even in states where marijuana is legal for recreational use, there are age restrictions that prevent its use by minors.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person is not only breaking the law but also engaging in morally reprehensible behavior by intentionally getting children addicted to a substance that can harm them.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems like a responsible action to help a pet lose weight, while Scenario 2 involves harming children by getting them addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, whereas Scenario 1 is not.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but in the previous question, the options were presented differently. Let me check again.\n\nOh, no, in this question, the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, it's about matching the scenarios to \"wrong\" or \"not wrong.\"\n\nGiven my analysis, Scenario 1 is \"not wrong\" and Scenario 2 is \"wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another perspective.\n\nPerhaps someone could argue that putting a cat on a strict feeding schedule without veterinary advice could be harmful, but generally, it's considered acceptable to put overweight pets on a diet under a vet's guidance. So, without more information suggesting negligence or harm, I don't think it's morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, getting children addicted to pot brownies is clearly wrong on multiple levels.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
