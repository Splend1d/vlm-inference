                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about particle decay, and I need to figure out how far the particle will travel in the lab frame before it decays. The particle decays in its rest frame in 2.0 milliseconds, and it's moving at 0.60 times the speed of light in the lab frame. I have to choose from four options: 150 m, 288 m, 360 m, or 450 m.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some concepts from special relativity because time dilation is definitely going to play a role here. In the particle's rest frame, time passes normally, but from the lab frame's perspective, time is dilated for the moving particle. So, the decay time in the lab frame should be longer than in the particle's rest frame.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n\n\\[ t = \\gamma t_0 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( t \\) is the dilated time in the lab frame,\n\n- \\( t_0 \\) is the proper time in the particle's rest frame,\n\n- \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( v = 0.60c \\), I can plug in the values to find \\( \\gamma \\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\]\n\nSo, the time in the lab frame is:\n\n\\[ t = \\gamma t_0 = 1.25 \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{ms} = 2.5 \\, \\text{ms} \\]\n\nNow, to find the distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[ d = v \\times t \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( d \\) is the distance,\n\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity,\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time.\n\nGiven that \\( v = 0.60c \\) and \\( c \\) is the speed of light, approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\) m/s, then:\n\n\\[ v = 0.60 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 = 1.8 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nAnd \\( t = 2.5 \\) ms, which is \\( 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\) seconds.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ d = 1.8 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} = 4.5 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{m} = 450 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSo, the distance should be 450 meters.\n\nWait a minute, that's one of the options, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, the time in the lab frame:\n\n\\[ t = \\gamma t_0 = 1.25 \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{ms} = 2.5 \\, \\text{ms} \\]\n\nLooks good.\n\nNow, the distance:\n\n\\[ d = v \\times t = 0.60c \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{ms} \\]\n\nConvert time to seconds:\n\n\\[ 2.5 \\, \\text{ms} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nSpeed:\n\n\\[ v = 0.60 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} = 1.8 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ d = 1.8 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} = 4.5 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{m} = 450 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the space-time relationship using the invariant interval in special relativity, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider that the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is dilated, as I already calculated, and then use the velocity to find the distance.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be 450 m, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450\\ \\text{m}} \\]"
