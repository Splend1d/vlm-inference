                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about afterimages. It says that Curtis stares at an image of a yellow star for a full minute, and then he moves his gaze to a blank piece of white paper. The question is, what color is he likely to see in the afterimage? The options are green, yellow, red, or blue.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an afterimage is. I think it's when you see a lingering image after you've stopped looking at the original source. Like, if you look at a bright light and then close your eyes, you might still see a bright spot. But this question is specifically about the color of the afterimage after looking at a yellow star.\n\nLet me think about color theory. Yellow is a primary color in light, right? It's made up of red and green in equal parts in the RGB color model. Maybe that has something to do with it.\n\nWait, but the question is about the afterimage, which might involve something called complementary colors. I remember that in art class, complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel. So, if you look at a strong color and then look away, your eyes might adjust by showing you the complementary color.\n\nLet me check that. In the context of visual perception, there's something called negative afterimage or color afterimage, where you see the complementary color after staring at a particular color.\n\nSo, if yellow is one color, what's its complementary color? In the traditional color wheel, yellow is opposite to purple, but purple isn't one of the options here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of subtractive colors or something else. Perhaps I should consider the opponent process theory of color vision, which suggests that colors are processed in opposing pairs: red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white.\n\nAccording to this theory, if you stare at a yellow color, which is a combination of red and green, your eyes might overstimulate the receptors for those colors, leading to a temporary suppression of them in the afterimage, thus showing the opposing colors, which would be blue and... well, not sure about that.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look up what the complementary color of yellow is in the context of afterimages.\n\nAfter a quick search in my mind, I recall that the complementary color of yellow is indeed purple. But purple isn't one of the options here. The options are green, yellow, red, or blue.\n\nHmm, maybe the afterimage isn't necessarily the exact complementary color but could be influenced by other factors.\n\nLet me consider the process again. Curtis stares at a yellow star for a full minute. Staring at any bright color for an extended period can cause fatigue in the color receptors responsible for that color.\n\nSo, yellow is a combination of red and green. If his eyes get tired from processing red and green, perhaps in the afterimage, his eyes try to balance that by showing the opposite colors.\n\nWait, but red and green are opponent colors, so their opposites would be each other. Maybe that's why purple is the complementary color of yellow, combining blue and some red.\n\nBut since purple isn't an option, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the afterimage is the same color as the original image, which would be yellow in this case. But that doesn't seem to align with what I know about afterimages.\n\nLet me try another approach. I know that when you look at a bright color and then look away, your eyes might show you the negative version of that color, kind of like a photographic negative.\n\nSo, if yellow is a bright color, its negative might be a darker color, but that doesn't directly help me here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the RGB color model. Yellow is a combination of red and green. If I subtract red and green from white, what color would I get? That would be blue, since blue is the complementary color to yellow in the RGB model.\n\nYes, in the RGB color system, yellow and blue are complementary colors. So, if Curtis stares at yellow, his eyes might produce a blue afterimage.\n\nBut looking back at the options, blue is one of them. So, according to this logic, the answer should be blue.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought that yellow's complementary color is purple, but in the RGB model, it's blue.\n\nMaybe I need to clarify this. In the context of art, yellow is opposite to purple on the color wheel, but in the context of light and RGB colors, yellow is opposite to blue.\n\nPerhaps the answer depends on the model being used. But since the question is about vision, the RGB model might be more applicable.\n\nAdditionally, considering the opponent process theory, blue and yellow are opponent colors, meaning they are processed as a pair.\n\nTherefore, after staring at yellow, the visual system might produce a temporary dominance of blue in the afterimage.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the likely afterimage Curtis will see on the white paper after staring at the yellow star is blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\text{ blue}} \\]"
