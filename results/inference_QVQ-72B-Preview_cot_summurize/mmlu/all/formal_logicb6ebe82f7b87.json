                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here with some premises and I need to figure out which proposition is an immediate consequence of these premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:\n\n1. E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. ~F \u2283 G\n\n3. ~G\n\nAnd the options are:\n\na. E \u2283 F\n\nb. F \u2283 G\n\nc. G \u2283 E\n\nd. ~~F\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what an \"immediate consequence\" means in this context. In propositional logic, an immediate consequence typically refers to an inference that can be directly derived from one or more of the premises in a single step, using one of the standard rules of inference.\n\nFirst, let's list out the premises again for clarity:\n\n1. E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. ~F \u2283 G\n\n3. ~G\n\nI need to see which of the given options can be directly inferred from these premises using the rules of inference in PL.\n\nLet's recall some basic rules of inference in propositional logic:\n\n- Modus Ponens: If P \u2283 Q and P, then Q\n\n- Modus Tollens: If P \u2283 Q and ~Q, then ~P\n\n- Hypothetical Syllogism: If P \u2283 Q and Q \u2283 R, then P \u2283 R\n\n- Disjunctive Syllogism: If P \u2228 Q and ~P, then Q\n\n- Simplification: If P \u2227 Q, then P\n\n- Conjunction: If P and Q, then P \u2227 Q\n\n- Addition: If P, then P \u2228 Q\n\n- Negation Introduction: If P \u2283 Q and P \u2283 ~Q, then ~P\n\n- Double Negation: ~~P is equivalent to P\n\n- Contradiction: If P and ~P, then any Q (ex contradictione quodlibet)\n\nNow, let's consider each option one by one and see if it can be directly inferred from the premises.\n\nOption A: E \u2283 F\n\nCan we derive E \u2283 F directly from the premises?\n\nLooking at the premises:\n\n1. E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. ~F \u2283 G\n\n3. ~G\n\nIf I apply Modus Tollens to premise 2 and premise 3:\n\nPremise 2: ~F \u2283 G\n\nPremise 3: ~G\n\nBy Modus Tollens, from these two, I can infer ~(~F), which is F.\n\nSo, from premises 2 and 3, I can get F.\n\nNow, I have F from premises 2 and 3.\n\nLooking back at premise 1: E \u2283 ~F\n\nIf I have F, can I get anything from that?\n\nWell, from F and premise 1, which is E \u2283 ~F, if I had E, then by Modus Tollens, I could get ~(~F), which is F, but I already have F.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Hypothetical Syllogism.\n\nLooking at premises 1 and 2:\n\nPremise 1: E \u2283 ~F\n\nPremise 2: ~F \u2283 G\n\nBy Hypothetical Syllogism, E \u2283 G\n\nBut is that helpful right now?\n\nNot directly for E \u2283 F.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use Contraposition on premise 1.\n\nPremise 1: E \u2283 ~F\n\nThe contrapositive of this is ~~F \u2283 ~E, which is F \u2283 ~E\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLet me recall: the contrapositive of P \u2283 Q is ~Q \u2283 ~P.\n\nSo, for E \u2283 ~F, the contrapositive would be ~~F \u2283 ~E, which simplifies to F \u2283 ~E.\n\nSo, from premise 1, I can infer F \u2283 ~E.\n\nNow, from premises 2 and 3, I have F (by Modus Tollens on ~F \u2283 G and ~G).\n\nSo, if F is true, and F \u2283 ~E, then ~E.\n\nBut I don't have E in the premises, so I'm not sure if I can directly derive E \u2283 F from this.\n\nMaybe this isn't the right path for option A.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose I assume E, and see what follows.\n\nFrom E, using premise 1: E \u2283 ~F, so ~F.\n\nFrom ~F, using premise 2: ~F \u2283 G, so G.\n\nBut we have premise 3: ~G.\n\nSo, from E, I can derive both G and ~G, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, E must be false.\n\nTherefore, ~E.\n\nBut wait, in propositional logic, if assuming E leads to a contradiction, then indeed ~E can be inferred.\n\nBut is that a direct inference?\n\nMaybe not in one step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that from ~G and ~F \u2283 G, I can infer F, as I did earlier.\n\nThen, from F and E \u2283 ~F, I can infer ~E, as above.\n\nBut again, that seems like more than one step.\n\nMaybe option A isn't an immediate consequence.\n\nLet me check option B: F \u2283 G\n\nCan F \u2283 G be directly inferred from the premises?\n\nLooking at the premises:\n\n1. E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. ~F \u2283 G\n\n3. ~G\n\nIf I have F, what can I infer?\n\nFrom premise 1: E \u2283 ~F\n\nIf I had E, then ~F, but I have F.\n\nWait, if I have F, then premise 1 says nothing about F unless E is true.\n\nAlternatively, from premise 2: ~F \u2283 G\n\nBut I have F, so ~(~F), which is F, which contradicts ~F needed for premise 2.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that from premises 2 and 3, I have F, as earlier.\n\nSo, F is true.\n\nNow, from premise 2: ~F \u2283 G\n\nBut since F is true, ~F is false, so ~F \u2283 G is true (since anything follows from a false premise).\n\nBut does that help me get F \u2283 G?\n\nNot directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that since F is true and ~G is true, and from premise 2, ~F \u2283 G, which is true because ~F is false.\n\nBut I don't see a direct way to infer F \u2283 G from the premises.\n\nMaybe option B isn't an immediate consequence either.\n\nLet's try option C: G \u2283 E\n\nCan G \u2283 E be directly inferred from the premises?\n\nLooking at the premises:\n\n1. E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. ~F \u2283 G\n\n3. ~G\n\nIf I assume G, what can I infer?\n\nFrom premise 2: ~F \u2283 G\n\nIf G is true, then ~F must be true, because if ~F were false, i.e., F is true, then ~F \u2283 G would be true (since F \u2283 anything is true if F is false).\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that from premises 2 and 3, I have F, as earlier.\n\nSo, F is true.\n\nFrom premise 1: E \u2283 ~F\n\nBut ~F is false since F is true.\n\nSo, E \u2283 false.\n\nWhich means ~E or E is false.\n\nSo, ~E.\n\nBut again, this seems like more than one step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that if G were true, then from premise 2, ~F must be true, which means F is false.\n\nBut from earlier, I have F is true.\n\nSo, if G were true, that would lead to F being both true and false, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, G must be false.\n\nBut premise 3 already says ~G, so G is false.\n\nThis doesn't directly help me get G \u2283 E.\n\nMaybe option C isn't an immediate consequence.\n\nFinally, option D: ~~F\n\nWhich is equivalent to F, since ~~F \u2261 F.\n\nSo, is F an immediate consequence of the premises?\n\nFrom earlier, I think I established that from premises 2 and 3, using Modus Tollens on ~F \u2283 G and ~G, I can infer F.\n\nIs that a direct inference?\n\nModus Tollens is a fundamental rule of inference, so yes, that's a one-step inference.\n\nTherefore, from premises 2 and 3, I can directly infer F, which is equivalent to ~~F.\n\nSo, option D seems to be an immediate consequence of the premises.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nPremise 2: ~F \u2283 G\n\nPremise 3: ~G\n\nModus Tollens: From ~F \u2283 G and ~G, infer ~(~F), which is F.\n\nTherefore, F is an immediate consequence.\n\nHence, ~~F is also an immediate consequence, since ~~F \u2261 F.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct.\n\nNow, just to make sure, let's see if any of the other options could also be immediate consequences.\n\nOption A: E \u2283 F\n\nFrom earlier attempts, it seems that deriving E \u2283 F requires assuming E and seeing what follows, which leads to a contradiction, implying ~E.\n\nBut that's more than one step.\n\nOption B: F \u2283 G\n\nFrom earlier, it's not clear how to derive this directly from the premises.\n\nOption C: G \u2283 E\n\nSimilarly, it's not straightforward to derive this directly from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the only immediate consequence seems to be option D: ~~F.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
