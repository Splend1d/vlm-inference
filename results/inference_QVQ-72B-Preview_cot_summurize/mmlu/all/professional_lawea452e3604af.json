                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a divorced couple and their son, and there's some legal trouble involving the husband taking their son to another state. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife were married for 17 years and have a 10-year-old son. They divorced, and the wife got custody of the son, while the husband had weekend visitation rights. After the divorce, the husband moved to a neighboring state for a new job. Before relocating, he consulted a lawyer about getting full custody of his son. The lawyer told him that his new state doesn't give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings from his former state, meaning he could take the son and live with him without breaking the law. But it turns out that this advice was wrong; the new state actually does honor other states' divorce decrees.\n\nSo, during his next scheduled visitation, the husband picks up his son from his ex-wife's house but doesn't return him. Instead, he takes the son to live with him in the new state. Because of this, he's arrested and charged with kidnapping. The definition of kidnapping in this context is \"knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband should be found guilty of kidnapping based on the given options.\n\nOption A says yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, violating the divorce decree.\n\nOption B says yes, because mistake of law is no defense.\n\nOption C says no, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\n\nOption D says no, because he received erroneous legal advice.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the husband was supposed to return his son after visitation but didn't. He took the son to live with him in another state, which goes against the divorce decree that gave custody to the wife.\n\nSo, on the surface, it seems like he's violating the custody agreement by not returning the son and taking him out of state.\n\nNow, the lawyer told him that he could do this without breaking the law, but that advice was incorrect. The new state does honor the divorce decree from the former state.\n\nSo, the husband acted based on incorrect legal advice.\n\nNow, in law, is receiving incorrect legal advice a defense for breaking the law?\n\nI think generally, no. Mistake of law is not a defense in criminal law. The principle is that \"ignorance of the law is no excuse.\" So, even if someone doesn't know the law or is mistakenly advised about the law, they can still be held responsible for breaking it.\n\nBut in this case, it's not just ignorance; it's relying on professional legal advice that turned out to be wrong. Does that make a difference?\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe in some jurisdictions, relying on legal advice could be a mitigating factor, but I don't think it's a complete defense, especially if the advice was negligent or incorrect.\n\nSo, if the husband relied on the lawyer's advice, does that mean he didn't have the intent to break the law? Or did he knowingly break the law?\n\nWell, he thought he was acting lawfully because of the lawyer's advice, but in reality, he was breaking the law by not returning the son and taking him out of state.\n\nSo, he had the intent to take the son and keep him with him, but he mistakenly believed that this was legal.\n\nNow, for kidnapping, which is a specific intent crime, does the specific intent require knowledge that the act is unlawful, or just the intent to abduct and move the person?\n\nThe definition here is \"knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location.\"\n\n\"Knowingly\" suggests that the person is aware of what they're doing and intends to do it, but it doesn't necessarily mean they know it's illegal.\n\nSo, the husband knowingly took the son and moved him to another state, even if he believed it was legal.\n\nBut option C says no, because he lacked the requisite state of mind. So, maybe there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps the required state of mind for kidnapping involves knowing that you're acting against the person's will or against the law.\n\nBut in this case, the husband might have believed that he had the right to take the son, based on the lawyer's advice.\n\nSo, maybe he didn't have the requisite intent to act unlawfully.\n\nBut, again, mistake of law is generally not a defense.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me look at the options again.\n\nOption A: Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, violating the divorce decree.\n\nThis seems straightforward. He broke the law by not returning the son and taking him out of state, so he's guilty.\n\nOption B: Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.\n\nThis aligns with the idea that even if he was mistakenly advised by the lawyer, he's still responsible for knowing the law.\n\nOption C: No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\n\nThis suggests that since he believed his actions were legal, he didn't have the intent to act unlawfully.\n\nOption D: No, because he received erroneous legal advice.\n\nThis implies that relying on legal advice, even if incorrect, should exonerate him.\n\nNow, in legal terms, mistake of law is generally not a defense to criminal liability. So, options A and B seem plausible.\n\nHowever, in some cases, if a person reasonably relies on official legal advice, there might be exceptions or mitigating circumstances.\n\nBut in this scenario, the question is whether he should be found guilty based on the given options.\n\nI think option A is the most straightforward answer. He violated the divorce decree by not returning the son and taking him to another state, which is unlawful.\n\nOption B is also strong, emphasizing that mistake of law doesn't excuse criminal responsibility.\n\nOption C seems less convincing because even if he believed his actions were legal, he still knowingly took the son and moved him to another state, which fits the definition of kidnapping.\n\nOption D suggests that erroneous legal advice should absolve him, but that's generally not the case in law.\n\nSo, between options A and B, I think A is more precise because it directly refers to the violation of the divorce decree, which is a specific legal document that he was aware of.\n\nOption B is more about the general principle that mistake of law is no defense, which is also true, but option A ties directly to the facts of the case.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option A: Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
