                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about Brill Co. and their expenditures on Product X. There are a few different costs listed, and I need to figure out how much of these should be expensed as research and development, or R&D, costs. The options are $40,000, $100,000, $140,000, or $145,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes R&D costs. Generally, R&D costs are expenses incurred in creating new products or improving existing ones. These costs are typically expensed as incurred because they don't have a future economic benefit that can be reliably measured, so they aren't capitalized as assets.\n\nNow, looking at the expenditures listed:\n\n1. Labor and material costs incurred in producing a prototype: $100,000.\n\n2. Cost of testing the prototype: $40,000.\n\n3. Legal costs to file a patent: $5,000.\n\n4. Production of Product X commenced when the patent was granted.\n\nI need to determine which of these costs are R&D costs and should be expensed immediately.\n\nLet's consider each item:\n\na) Labor and material costs for the prototype: These are likely R&D costs because they are incurred during the development phase of the product. Prototyping is typically part of the research and development process to test and refine the product before full-scale production.\n\nb) Cost of testing the prototype: Similar to the prototype costs, testing is also part of the R&D process to ensure the product meets the required specifications and standards. So, this should also be considered an R&D cost.\n\nc) Legal costs to file a patent: Patent costs are often capitalized as intangible assets because they provide future economic benefits by giving the company exclusive rights to the invention. Therefore, these costs are not typically expensed as R&D costs but rather capitalized and amortized over their useful life.\n\nSo, from the above, the labor and material costs for the prototype ($100,000) and the cost of testing the prototype ($40,000) should be expensed as R&D costs. The legal costs for the patent ($5,000) should be capitalized.\n\nTherefore, the total R&D costs to be expensed are $100,000 + $40,000 = $140,000.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is $145,000, which seems to include the patent costs as well. But according to my understanding, patent costs shouldn't be included in R&D expenses; they should be capitalized.\n\nLet me double-check this. In accounting standards, research and development costs are indeed expensed as incurred, and patent costs are capitalized as intangible assets. So, the $5,000 legal costs for the patent should not be included in R&D expenses.\n\nTherefore, the correct amount to be expensed as R&D costs is $140,000.\n\nBut looking back at the options, $140,000 is one of them, so that seems right. However, I should make sure that there isn't any other consideration I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the patent costs should be expensed immediately rather than capitalized? No, generally, patent costs are capitalized because they provide future economic benefits.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a scenario where patent costs could be expensed immediately. For example, if the patent is determined not to have a longer useful life or something like that. But in this problem, it says that production commenced when the patent was granted, which suggests that the patent is being used in the production and sale of the product, so it should have a useful life aligned with the product's life cycle.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to capitalize the patent costs and amortize them over their useful life.\n\nSo, my final answer is $140,000 should be expensed as R&D costs.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other costs that might be considered R&D. For instance, are there any design costs or other preliminary expenses that might not be listed here? Based on the information provided, these are the only expenditures mentioned, so I don't have any other costs to consider.\n\nAlso, is there any portion of the prototype or testing costs that might be capitalized? For example, if the prototype had a future alternative use, perhaps some of the costs could be capitalized. But the problem states that production commenced when the patent was granted, which suggests that the prototype was part of the development phase before production began.\n\nIn that case, the prototype and testing costs would be considered R&D expenses because they were incurred before the product reached technological feasibility, which is typically when production begins.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that $140,000 is the correct amount to be expensed as R&D costs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
