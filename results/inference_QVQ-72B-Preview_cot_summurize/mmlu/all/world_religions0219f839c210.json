Fundamentalism.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not an expert on Christian denominations, but I think I have some basic knowledge about each of these options.\n\nFirst off, let's define what \"speaking in tongues\" means. I believe it's a practice where people speak in a language that's not their native tongue, often during religious services or moments of high emotion. It's also sometimes referred to as glossolalia. Now, I need to match this practice with the correct denomination from the options provided.\n\nStarting with Evangelicalism. I know that Evangelicals are known for their emphasis on personal conversion, evangelism, and the authority of the Bible. They often have lively worship services, but I don't recall speaking in tongues being a central feature of Evangelical churches. Maybe some do practice it, but it's not as commonly associated with Evangelicalism as it is with another option listed here.\n\nNext, Pietism. I'm a bit fuzzier on this one. Pietism is a movement that emphasizes personal piety and practical Christianity. It started within Lutheranism in the 17th century. From what I understand, Pietists focus on individual devotion and living a holy life rather than on charismatic expressions like speaking in tongues. So, again, I don't think this is the primary denomination known for speaking in tongues.\n\nThen there's Pentecostalism. This rings a bell in relation to speaking in tongues. I think Pentecostal churches are known for their charismatic services, where speaking in tongues is a common practice. In fact, I believe that for many Pentecostals, speaking in tongues is considered evidence of being filled with the Holy Spirit. That sounds promising.\n\nLastly, Fundamentalism. I know that Fundamentalists emphasize a literal interpretation of the Bible and hold to core Christian doctrines. They often have a conservative approach to theology and practice. While some Fundamentalist churches might practice speaking in tongues, especially if they have charismatic influences, I don't think it's a defining feature of Fundamentalism as a whole.\n\nComparing all these options, Pentecostalism seems to be the denomination that most prominently features speaking in tongues as a central aspect of its worship and theology.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my understanding. Pentecostalism is a Christian movement that emphasizes the gifts of the Holy Spirit, including speaking in tongues, healing, and prophecy. It originated in the early 20th century and has since grown into a significant global movement. Speaking in tongues is indeed a hallmark of Pentecostal worship, and it's encouraged as a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence and power in the believer's life.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Pentecostalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Pentecostalism}} \\]"
