                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about donations to a food bank in November. There were 100 checks received, with an average donation of $155 and a standard deviation of $32. I need to choose the most appropriate statement from the options given. Let me try to understand what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says: \"This November, the average donation is $155.\" That seems straightforward. It's just stating the average donation amount based on the data collected.\n\nOption B says: \"50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\" Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. In a normal distribution, the median is equal to the mean, and about 50% of the data lies above the mean. But I don't know if the distribution of donations is normal. Maybe I need to consider that.\n\nOption C says: \"We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\" This sounds like it's giving a confidence interval for the average donation. But that seems really wide. Let me check how they're calculating that.\n\nOption D says: \"We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.\" This also seems like a confidence interval, but it's much narrower than option C's interval.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a confidence interval is. A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated mean in this case. The 95% confidence level means that if we were to take many samples and construct intervals in the same way, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population mean.\n\nTo calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CI} = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean ($155)\n\n- \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.96)\n\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation ($32)\n\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size (100)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CI} = 155 \\pm 1.96 \\left( \\frac{32}{\\sqrt{100}} \\right) = 155 \\pm 1.96 \\times 3.2 = 155 \\pm 6.272\n\\]\n\nSo the interval should be approximately $148.728 to $161.272. Rounding to the nearest whole number, that's about $149 to $161.\n\nComparing this to option D, which says $149 to $161, it seems to match my calculation.\n\nOption C suggests a much wider interval of $91 to $219. That doesn't seem right based on my calculation.\n\nOption A is simply stating the average donation is $155, which is true based on the data provided. However, it doesn't provide any measure of variability or confidence in that estimate.\n\nOption B is making a statement about the percentage of donations above the mean. If the distribution of donations is normal, then yes, approximately 50% of the donations would be above the mean. But I don't know if the distribution is normal. Donation amounts might not follow a normal distribution; perhaps they are skewed with some larger donations pulling the mean up.\n\nGiven that, I can't be certain about the percentage of donations above the mean without knowing the shape of the distribution.\n\nTherefore, option B might not be accurate unless I know the distribution is symmetric.\n\nOption A is true but doesn't provide as much information as a confidence interval does.\n\nOption C has a mistake in the interval; according to my calculation, the 95% CI should be approximately $149 to $161, not $91 to $219.\n\nOption D matches my calculation, so it seems to be the correct statement.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the $91 and $219 in option C is a typo or perhaps refers to a different calculation, like the range of individual donations or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option C is referring to the 95% prediction interval for an individual donation, which would be wider than the confidence interval for the mean.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the 95% prediction interval for an individual value:\n\n\\[\n\\text{PI} = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\left( \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nBut actually, for individual predictions, it's more accurate to use:\n\n\\[\n\\text{PI} = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\times \\sigma \\times \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{PI} = 155 \\pm 1.96 \\times 32 \\times \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{100}} = 155 \\pm 1.96 \\times 32 \\times \\sqrt{1.01}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\sqrt{1.01}\\), which is approximately 1.00498.\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n1.96 \\times 32 \\times 1.00498 \\approx 1.96 \\times 32.15936 \\approx 63.12\n\\]\n\nSo the prediction interval would be approximately $155 \\pm $63.12, which is from about $91.88 to $218.12, which rounds to about $91 to $219.\n\nInteresting, so option C matches this prediction interval for an individual donation, not for the mean donation.\n\nBut the question is about the average donation, not an individual donation.\n\nSo perhaps there's confusion in option C, as it seems to be mixing up the confidence interval for the mean with the prediction interval for an individual donation.\n\nGiven that, option D correctly states the 95% confidence interval for the average donation, which is between about $149 and $161.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, is giving the prediction interval for an individual donation, which is a different thing.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate statement should be option D, as it correctly reflects the confidence interval for the average donation.\n\nAlternatively, if the question intended to refer to individual donations, option C might make sense, but based on the context, it seems like the focus is on the average donation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
