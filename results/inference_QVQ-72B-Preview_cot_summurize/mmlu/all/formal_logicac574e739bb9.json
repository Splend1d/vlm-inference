The symbols are:\n\n- Wn \u2228 Wm\n\n- (\u2200x)[Lx \u2283 (Dx \u2283 ~Wx)]\n\n- Ln \u2022 Dn\n\n- / ~(\u2200x)~Wx\n\nAnd the options are A through D. I need to match the logical statements with the correct English interpretation.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each symbol means:\n\n- Wn: Nancy is at work.\n\n- Wm: Marvin is at work.\n\n- Lx: x is a lawyer.\n\n- Dx: x is out to dinner.\n\n- \u2228: or\n\n- \u2283: if...then (implication)\n\n- \u2200: for all\n\n- ~: not\n\n- \u2022: and\n\n- /: therefore\n\nSo, the premises are:\n\n1. Wn \u2228 Wm: Either Nancy or Marvin is at work.\n\n2. (\u2200x)[Lx \u2283 (Dx \u2283 ~Wx)]: For all x, if x is a lawyer, then if x is out to dinner, x is not at work.\n\n3. Ln \u2022 Dn: Nancy is a lawyer and Nancy is out to dinner.\n\nAnd the conclusion is:\n\n~(\u2200x)~Wx: It is not the case that for all x, x is not at work. In other words, there exists at least one x that is at work.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.\n\nB. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.\n\nC. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.\n\nD. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.\n\nFirst, option A says: \"All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner.\" This matches premise 2: if a lawyer is out to dinner, then they are not at work.\n\nOption B says: \"All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work.\" This is different from premise 2. Premise 2 says that if a lawyer is out to dinner, then they are not at work, whereas this option is saying that if a lawyer is not at work, then they are out to dinner. That's the converse of the original statement.\n\nOption C is the same as option B.\n\nOption D says: \"All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner.\" This is the same as premise 2.\n\nSo, options A and D match premise 2, while B and C do not.\n\nNow, the conclusion in all options is \"not everything is not at work,\" which corresponds to ~(\u2200x)~Wx.\n\nBut option C says \"not everything is at work,\" which would be ~(\u2200x)Wx, which is different from the conclusion given.\n\nSo, option C doesn't match the conclusion.\n\nOption A: \"not everything is not at work,\" which matches ~(\u2200x)~Wx.\n\nOption B: same as A.\n\nOption D: same as A.\n\nSo, A, B, and D have the same conclusion.\n\nBut the premises differ in the second statement.\n\nOption A and D have the correct premise 2, while B and C do not.\n\nTherefore, options A and D are potential candidates.\n\nBut let's check which one matches the third premise.\n\nThird premise is \"Ln \u2022 Dn\": Nancy is a lawyer and Nancy is out to dinner.\n\nAll options have this.\n\nNow, the first premise is \"Wn \u2228 Wm\": Either Nancy or Marvin is at work.\n\nAll options have this.\n\nSo, the difference is in the second premise and the conclusion.\n\nOption A and D have the correct second premise.\n\nOption C has a different conclusion.\n\nOption B has an incorrect second premise.\n\nTherefore, options A and D are possible.\n\nBut let's see which one matches the conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion is ~(\u2200x)~Wx: It is not the case that for all x, x is not at work. In other words, at least one x is at work.\n\nOption A says: \"So not everything is not at work.\" Which is the same as the conclusion.\n\nOption D says: \"So not everything is at work.\" Which is different; it would be ~(\u2200x)Wx.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct interpretation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because its conclusion is different from the given logical conclusion.\n\nHence, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
