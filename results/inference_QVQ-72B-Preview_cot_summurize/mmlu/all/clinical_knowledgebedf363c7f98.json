                    "text": "So I have this question about diplopia, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's break it down one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered.\" Hmm, diplopia is double vision, right? So, it's when you see two images of the same object. If one eye is covered, you're only using one eye to see, so logically, you should only see one image. I think this option is probably true.\n\nOption B says, \"The outer image is always the false image.\" I'm not entirely sure about this one. In diplopia, especially in strabismic diplopia, the muscles aren't aligned properly, so each eye sends a different image to the brain. Usually, the brain suppresses one image to prevent confusion, but sometimes both images are perceived, causing double vision. As for which image is \"false,\" I think it depends on the individual and which eye is dominant. It's not necessarily always the outer image that's false. Maybe I need to look this up, but based on my understanding, this seems a bit too absolute.\n\nOption C says, \"A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\" The fourth nerve is the trochlear nerve, which innervates the superior oblique muscle. This muscle helps with inward and downward movement of the eye. If there's a palsy of this nerve, the muscle doesn't function properly, so when the patient looks upwards, there might be torsional issues or problems with alignment. But does it only occur when looking upwards? I think it's more accurate to say that a fourth nerve palsy affects upward gaze, but it can also affect other directions, depending on the extent of the palsy. So, this might not be entirely true.\n\nOption D says, \"A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\" The sixth nerve is the abducens nerve, which innervates the lateral rectus muscle. This muscle abducts the eye, moving it away from the midline. If there's a palsy of this nerve, the lateral rectus doesn't work properly, so the eye can't abduct effectively. This would cause the eye to turn inwards relative to the other eye, which is a convergent squint, not a divergent one. A divergent squint would involve the eye turning outwards. So, based on this, option D seems incorrect.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered. Seems logical because with one eye covered, you're only using one eye, so only one image should be seen.\n\n- B: The outer image is always the false image. Not necessarily, as it depends on the individual's dominant eye and the nature of the misalignment.\n\n- C: A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards. While looking upwards can exacerbate symptoms of fourth nerve palsy, it's not accurate to say it only occurs in that direction.\n\n- D: A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint. Actually, it causes a convergent squint because the eye can't abduct properly.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option A seems to be the correct statement.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check option A. Is it possible to have diplopia with one eye covered? Maybe in some rare cases, but generally, no. Usually, covering one eye prevents diplopia because you're only receiving input from one eye. So, I think A is correct.\n\nOption B, about the outer image always being false\u2014no, that's not accurate. It depends on the person's dominant eye and the specific nature of the misalignment.\n\nOption C, fourth nerve palsy occurring when looking upwards\u2014that's not quite right. It's more about upward gaze being affected, but it's not that it only occurs in that direction.\n\nOption D, sixth nerve palsy causing a divergent squint\u2014that's incorrect because it actually causes a convergent squint.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is option A: Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
