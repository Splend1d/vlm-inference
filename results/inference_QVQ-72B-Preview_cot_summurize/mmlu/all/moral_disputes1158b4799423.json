                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about consequentialist theories, and I need to identify which one explains right action in terms of the net balance of pleasure or lack of pain produced by that action. The options are hedonistic utilitarianism, perfectionist consequentialism, rule consequentialism, and then there's an option that says by definition, consequentialist theories do not mention pain. Hmm, that last one seems a bit off, but I'll come back to that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what consequentialist theories are all about. Consequentialism is a type of ethical theory that judges the rightness or wrongness of an action based on the consequences it produces. So, the idea is that an action is morally right if it leads to good outcomes and wrong if it leads to bad outcomes.\n\nNow, within consequentialism, there are different varieties. Let's think about each option:\n\nA. Hedonistic utilitarianism: I remember that utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism that focuses on maximizing utility, which is often defined in terms of happiness or pleasure. Hedonistic utilitarianism specifically equates utility with pleasure and pain. Jeremy Bentham, one of the founders of utilitarianism, talked about maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. So, in this view, an action is right if it produces more pleasure than pain overall.\n\nB. Perfectionist consequentialism: This sounds a bit different. Perfectionist theories typically emphasize the development of human potential or the realization of certain virtues. So, a perfectionist consequentialist might argue that an action is right if it promotes the attainment of these perfecting goals. It's not directly about pleasure or pain, but more about achieving some higher form of human flourishing.\n\nC. Rule consequentialism: This is another variant of consequentialism. Instead of evaluating each individual action based on its consequences, rule consequentialism suggests that we should follow rules that, if generally adopted, would produce the best overall consequences. Again, the focus isn't necessarily on pleasure or pain directly, but on the overall good that following certain rules would bring about.\n\nD. By definition, consequentialist theories do not mention pain: This seems misleading. While not all consequentialist theories focus on pleasure or pain, some do, like utilitarianism. So, it's not accurate to say that consequentialist theories, by definition, do not mention pain. In fact, utilitarianism, especially in its hedonistic form, explicitly considers pain as something to be minimized.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that option A, hedonistic utilitarianism, is the one that specifically explains right action in terms of the net balance of pleasure or lack of pain produced by that action. The other options either focus on different aspects of consequences or, in the case of option D, make an incorrect statement about consequentialist theories.\n\nSo, my answer would be A. hedonistic utilitarianism.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that perfectionist consequentialism could also be considered to involve pleasure or lack of pain? Well, perhaps in some perfectionist theories, achieving human perfection might bring about pleasure or satisfaction, but that's more of an indirect consequence. The primary focus is on perfection, not directly on pleasure or pain.\n\nSimilarly, rule consequentialism might consider the net balance of pleasure and pain as part of its overall assessment of the consequences, but its main emphasis is on following rules that lead to good outcomes in general, not specifically on pleasure and pain.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward answer is indeed hedonistic utilitarianism, which directly ties moral rightness to the net balance of pleasure over pain.\n\nI think I'm confident with that choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
