                    "text": "So I have this problem about projectile motion. It says that an ideal projectile should be launched at a certain angle to the horizontal so that its horizontal displacement, which is the range, is equal to its maximum vertical displacement. And I need to find out at what angle that happens. The options are A. sin\u20131 (1/g), B. cos\u20131 (1/g), C. 45\u00b0, D. tan\u20131 4.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the equations for projectile motion. For an ideal projectile launched at an angle \u03b8 with initial velocity v, the range R is given by:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{v^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\]\n\nAnd the maximum height H is:\n\n\\[ H = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{2g} \\]\n\nThe problem states that the horizontal displacement (range) is equal to the maximum vertical displacement. So, R = H.\n\nSo, set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{2g} \\]\n\nHmm, v^2 and g are in both terms, and they're positive, so I can cancel them out:\n\n\\[ \\sin 2\\theta = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\theta}{2} \\]\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for \u03b8. Remember that sin 2\u03b8 = 2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8.\n\nSo, substitute that in:\n\n\\[ 2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\theta}{2} \\]\n\nLet's rearrange this equation:\n\n\\[ 4 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\sin^2 \\theta \\]\n\nAssuming sin \u03b8 \u2260 0, I can divide both sides by sin \u03b8:\n\n\\[ 4 \\cos \\theta = \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by cos \u03b8:\n\n\\[ 4 = \\tan \\theta \\]\n\nSo, \u03b8 = tan\u20131 4.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option D.\n\nBut wait, let's check if sin \u03b8 = 0 is a solution. If sin \u03b8 = 0, then the projectile is launched horizontally, and the maximum vertical displacement would be zero, and the range would also be zero, so R = H holds true. But practically, launching at 0 degrees gives a range of 0, which might not be what the problem is aiming for. Maybe it's excluding this trivial case.\n\nAlso, let's see if there are other angles that satisfy the equation. From 4 cos \u03b8 = sin \u03b8, and knowing that tan \u03b8 = 4, it seems like there's only one solution in the principal range of 0 to 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"ideal projectile,\" which probably assumes no air resistance and level ground, etc. So, the standard model of projectile motion applies.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. Starting from:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{v^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\]\n\n\\[ H = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{2g} \\]\n\nSetting R = H:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} = \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{2g} \\]\n\nCanceling v^2 and g:\n\n\\[ \\sin 2\\theta = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\theta}{2} \\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity:\n\n\\[ 2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sin^2 \\theta}{2} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ 4 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\sin^2 \\theta \\]\n\nAssuming sin \u03b8 \u2260 0:\n\n\\[ 4 \\cos \\theta = \\sin \\theta \\]\n\n\\[ 4 = \\tan \\theta \\]\n\nSo, \u03b8 = tan\u20131 4.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be D. tan\u20131 4.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe in terms of time of flight or something else, but I think this approach is solid.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes problems can be tricky with units or interpretations, but since it's about pure angles and standard projectile motion, this should hold.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. tan\u20131 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
