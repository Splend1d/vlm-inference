Follows the inverse-square law\n\nC. Both of these\n\nD. Neither of these\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the electric field is like between two parallel plates that have opposite charges. I think it's called a parallel plate capacitor. In my physics book, it shows that the electric field between the plates is uniform, meaning it's the same at all points between the plates. So, does that mean it doesn't get weaker with distance inside the plates?\n\nLet me think about option A: \"gets weaker with distance inside the plates.\" If the electric field is uniform, then it shouldn't get weaker with distance. It should stay constant. So, maybe option A is not correct.\n\nOption B: \"follows the inverse-square law.\" I know that the inverse-square law applies to things like gravitational force and electric force between two point charges. The formula is F = k * q1 * q2 / r^2, where r is the distance between the charges. But in this case, we're dealing with two parallel plates, not point charges.\n\nBetween parallel plates, the electric field is uniform, and it doesn't depend on the distance from the plates, does it? Wait, actually, the electric field E is given by E = V / d, where V is the voltage between the plates and d is the distance between them. So, it's constant as long as V and d are constant. That suggests that the electric field doesn't follow the inverse-square law between parallel plates.\n\nSo, if neither A nor B is correct, then the answer should be D: neither of these.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where the electric field between parallel plates would follow the inverse-square law? I don't think so, because the plates are infinite in extent in the ideal case, and the electric field is uniform between them.\n\nMaybe if the plates are not infinite and you're close to the edges, the field might not be uniform, but in the ideal case, it should be uniform.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: neither of these.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
