Hmm, I need to think about this. I've seen a few episodes of Friends, but it's been a while. Let me recall...\n\nFirst, there's Joey. He's the actor, right? I remember he's always eating and stuff, but I don't think he's a chef. Maybe he cooks sometimes, but he's not professionally a chef.\n\nThen there's Monica. She's the one who likes to clean and organize things. I think she's a chef. Wait, no, I think she's a chef in some seasons, but I'm not sure if that's accurate throughout the whole series.\n\nRoss is the paleontologist, right? He's into dinosaurs and teaching. I don't remember him being a chef at all.\n\nAnd Rachel, she starts off as a waitress at Central Perk, right? Then she gets into fashion or something. I don't think she's a chef.\n\nLet me double-check this. Maybe I should look up some information about the characters' jobs in Friends.\n\nOkay, so Joey is indeed an actor, and he's known for his love of food, but he's not a chef. Monica is actually a professional chef in the show. She works at various restaurants and even becomes a head chef at one point. So, option B. Monica seems to be the correct answer.\n\nRoss is a paleontologist and a professor, so he's definitely not a chef. Rachel starts as a waitress and then moves into the fashion industry, so she's not a chef either.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if any of them had side jobs or something. But no, I don't think any of them had side jobs as chefs.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check about Monica's career path. She always wanted to be a chef, and in the show, she pursues that dream. She works at a restaurant called Hell's Kitchen, and later, she becomes a chef at a place called Alto. So, yeah, Monica is clearly the chef among the group.\n\nJoey is an actor, Ross is a paleontologist, and Rachel is in fashion. So, the answer should be B. Monica.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Monica}} \\]"
