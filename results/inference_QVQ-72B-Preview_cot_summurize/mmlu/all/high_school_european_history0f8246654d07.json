                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage by William Morris from 1896, where he talks about how he became a socialist. It's pretty interesting. He says that besides wanting to make beautiful things, his main passion is hating modern civilization. That's a strong statement! He goes on to talk about how he hopes for the destruction of modern civilization and its replacement with socialism.\n\nHe describes modern civilization as having a lot of mechanical power but wasting it, with a society that's poor overall but has some people who are extremely rich. He mentions a \"stupendous organization for the misery of life,\" which sounds really bleak. He also criticizes how it contempts simple pleasures that everyone could enjoy if it weren't for its folly. Art, which could be a solace for labor, has been destroyed by this eyeless vulgarity.\n\nMorris felt all this in the past and still does now. He says that after many ages of struggle, humanity hasn't achieved anything but this \"sordid, aimless, ugly confusion.\" He fears that the future might make things worse by eliminating the last remnants of better times before civilization became so dreary.\n\nHe mentions that he's not into metaphysics, religion, or scientific analysis, but he loves the earth and life on it and is passionate about human history. Given all that, he seems to be saying that he became a socialist because he was horrified by the state of society and wanted something better.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society.\n\nThis seems to align with what he's saying. He talks about the waste of mechanical power and the misery of life in modern civilization.\n\nB. Chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments.\n\nThere's no mention of Marx or specific socialist theories in this passage. He's talking more about his personal feelings and observations about society.\n\nC. Rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion.\n\nThis is the opposite of what he's saying. He hopes for socialism to replace the current ugly confusion of modern civilization.\n\nD. Rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it.\n\nAgain, this is the opposite. He says that his love for the earth and life on it, along with his passion for history, led him to become a socialist, not reject it.\n\nSo, based on the passage, option A seems to be the correct inference. Morris became a socialist because he was appalled by the waste and misery of modern society and hoped that socialism could be a solution to these problems.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's look back at some key phrases.\n\nHe says, \"hatred of modern civilization,\" and \"hope of its destruction\u2014what shall I say of its supplanting by Socialism?\" This suggests that he sees socialism as a replacement for the current system, which he hates.\n\nHe criticizes modern civilization for its misuse of resources, its economic disparities, and its negative impact on culture and art. All of these are issues that socialism aims to address by restructuring society to be more equitable and just.\n\nMoreover, he expresses a desire for a better future, one that values simple pleasures and preserves the beauty of the earth, which he loves. Socialism, in his view, seems to offer a path towards that kind of society.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's safe to say that Morris chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the state of modern society and had hopes that socialism could improve things.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
