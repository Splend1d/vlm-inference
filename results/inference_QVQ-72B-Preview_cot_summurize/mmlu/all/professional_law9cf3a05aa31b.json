                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept about additional terms in acceptance of offers, especially in merchant transactions. I've come across this question here, and I need to figure out which statement is not true regarding additional terms proposed in the acceptance. The options are:\n\nA. They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement.\n\nB. Additional terms always become part of the contract.\n\nC. They become part of the contract unless the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\nD. They become part of the contract unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time to the additional terms.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that in contract law, when one party makes an offer and another party accepts it, there's usually an agreement. But sometimes, the accepting party might add some extra terms to their acceptance. This can complicate things, especially when both parties are merchants.\n\nI recall that there's something called the \"mirror image rule\" which says that the acceptance must match the offer exactly, without any additions or modifications. But in reality, especially in business transactions, it's common for acceptances to include additional terms. So, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the United States has some rules about this, particularly in Article 2, which deals with sales.\n\nLet me think about the UCC's position on additional terms in acceptances between merchants. I think it's called the \"additional terms as proposals\" rule or something like that. Let me look it up to be sure.\n\nOkay, so according to UCC Section 2-207, if both the offeror and the offeree are merchants, and the acceptance includes additional terms, these additional terms are considered to be proposals for addition to the contract. This means that unless the offeror objects to these additional terms, they can become part of the contract.\n\nSo, option D seems to align with this, saying that the additional terms become part of the contract unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time.\n\nBut wait, I think there are more conditions to this. The UCC also talks about whether these additional terms are \"materially altering\" the agreement. If they do materially alter the agreement, then they might not become part of the contract unless both parties agree to them.\n\nSo, option A mentions that additional terms become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement. That seems consistent with what I just thought.\n\nOption C says they become part of the contract unless the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer. I think the UCC also has a provision about this. If the offer says something like \"acceptance must be on the terms stated herein,\" then any additional terms in the acceptance might not be binding.\n\nSo, all of these options seem to be reflecting aspects of the UCC's rules on additional terms in acceptances between merchants.\n\nBut the question is asking which statement is not true. So, I need to find the one that doesn't accurately reflect the UCC's position.\n\nLet's look at option B: \"Additional terms always become part of the contract.\"\n\nHmm, that seems too absolute. Based on what I know, additional terms don't always become part of the contract. There are conditions under which they may not be included, such as if they materially alter the agreement or if the offer expressly limits acceptance to its terms.\n\nSo, option B seems too broad and not entirely accurate. It says \"always,\" but in reality, there are scenarios where additional terms might not become part of the contract.\n\nWhereas options A, C, and D all include conditions under which the additional terms would or would not become part of the contract.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is the statement that is not true.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement.\n\nThis is generally true under the UCC for merchant transactions. If the additional terms don't materially alter the agreement, they can become part of the contract.\n\nC. They become part of the contract unless the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\nThis is also in line with the UCC. If the offer specifies that acceptance must be exact, then additional terms might not be binding.\n\nD. They become part of the contract unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time to the additional terms.\n\nAgain, this reflects the UCC's rule that the offeror must object to the additional terms for them not to become part of the contract.\n\nSo, all of these options except B have conditions under which the additional terms would or would not become part of the contract.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is B: \"Additional terms always become part of the contract.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
