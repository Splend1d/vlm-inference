Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the importance of trading contacts between Sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans from 1450 to 1750 C.E. I need to pick which option best explains that importance based on the information provided by Walter Rodney's quote. Let me read the quote again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nWalter Rodney is talking about how Europe underdeveloped Africa, and he mentions two levels to answer the question of responsibility. First, there's the imperialist system that drained African wealth and prevented the continent from developing its resources quickly. Second, there are the people who manipulate this system and those who are agents or unwitting accomplices of it. He specifically mentions that Western European capitalists extended their exploitation from Europe to cover all of Africa.\n\nSo, the main idea here is that European imperialist activities were detrimental to Africa's development. They took wealth out of Africa and hindered the continent's ability to develop its own resources. Now, the question is asking about the importance of trading contacts between Sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans during the period from 1450 to 1750 C.E.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs. Hmm, that seems a bit off. The New World foodstuffs, like potatoes, tomatoes, and maize, were indeed introduced to the Old World after Columbus's voyages, which started in the late 15th century. So, timing-wise, it fits within the period. But the quote from Rodney emphasizes the negative impact of European imperialist activities, not the benefits of new food crops. Moreover, the idea that Africans relied on Europeans to import New World foodstuffs to sustain population growth suggests a dependency that might not align with historical facts. Many of these crops did spread to Africa eventually, but it's not clear that Africans were dependent on European imports for their population growth. So, I'm a bit skeptical about this option.\n\nOption B says that Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with Europeans for firearms. This seems plausible. During this period, the introduction of firearms by Europeans had a significant impact on African societies and politics. African states that acquired firearms were able to defend themselves better and expand their territories. This aligns with historical evidence of African kingdoms like the Kingdom of Kongo and the Oyo Empire trading with Europeans for weapons and other goods to strengthen their military positions. So, this seems like a relevant and important aspect of African-European trade during this period.\n\nOption C states that Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. This is a strong statement. While it's true that the transatlantic slave trade was a major part of European-African interactions during this period, suggesting that Europeans were the sole purchasers of slaves implies that there was no internal or other external slave trade in Africa. However, slavery and slave trades existed in Africa before European arrival, involving both African and Arab traders. While the European demand for slaves certainly increased the scale of the slave trade, it wasn't the only slave trade in which Africans were involved. Therefore, saying that Europeans were the sole purchasers of slaves is an overstatement and doesn't align with historical reality.\n\nOption D suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. This is an interesting point, but I need to think carefully about it. During the period in question, there were certainly conflicts between Christian European powers and Muslim North African states, such as the Ottoman Empire's presence in North Africa. However, in Sub-Saharan Africa, the situation was more complex. While some African states might have allied with Europeans against Muslim or Arab traders, this wasn't universal. For example, in West Africa, Muslim traders and scholars had been present for centuries before European arrival, and many African kingdoms had established trade relations with them. It's unlikely that all Sub-Saharan Africans saw European allies as a means to evict Muslim and Arab merchants. This option seems too generalized and perhaps not as accurate as option B.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think option B is the best answer. It highlights a specific and historically significant aspect of African-European trade during this period: the consolidation of African states through the acquisition of firearms from European traders. This not only helped African kingdoms defend themselves but also played a role in their expansion and consolidation of power.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. The quote by Walter Rodney emphasizes the negative impact of European imperialist activities on Africa's development. However, the question is about the importance of trading contacts, not necessarily the overall impact of those contacts. So, even if some aspects of trade were beneficial in the short term, the overall context was one of exploitation, as per Rodney's analysis.\n\nGiven that, option B still seems the most accurate because it directly refers to a way in which African states benefited from trade with Europeans by acquiring firearms, which they used to consolidate their power and defend against rivals. This was a significant development in African history during this period.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option B as the best explanation of the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans between 1450 and 1750 C.E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
