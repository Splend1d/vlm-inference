Hmm, I think I remember that the New Testament has fewer books than the Old Testament, but I'm not sure about the exact number.\n\nLet me recall what I know about the New Testament. It's part of the Christian Bible, and it comes after the Old Testament. It primarily consists of the Gospels, Acts, Epistles, and the Book of Revelation. But how many books are there in total?\n\nI think there are four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Then there's the Acts of the Apostles, which makes that five books so far. Next, there are several Epistles, which are letters written by apostles to early Christian communities. I remember there's the Pauline Epistles, which are the letters of Paul, and then there are general epistles.\n\nLet me list them out to keep track:\n\n1. Gospels: 4\n\n2. Acts: 1\n\n3. Pauline Epistles:\n\n- Romans\n\n- 1 Corinthians\n\n- 2 Corinthians\n\n- Galatians\n\n- Ephesians\n\n- Philippians\n\n- Colossians\n\n- 1 Thessalonians\n\n- 2 Thessalonians\n\n- 1 Timothy\n\n- 2 Timothy\n\n- Titus\n\n- Philemon\n\nThat's 13 Pauline Epistles.\n\n4. General Epistles:\n\n- James\n\n- 1 Peter\n\n- 2 Peter\n\n- 1 John\n\n- 2 John\n\n- 3 John\n\n- Jude\n\nThat's 7 general epistles.\n\n5. And finally, the Book of Revelation.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n4 (Gospels) + 1 (Acts) + 13 (Pauline Epistles) + 7 (General Epistles) + 1 (Revelation) = 26\n\nWait, that's 26. But none of the options are 26. The closest is 27, which is option C. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me check again:\n\n- Gospels: 4\n\n- Acts: 1\n\n- Pauline Epistles: 13\n\n- General Epistles: 7\n\n- Revelation: 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 + 13 + 7 + 1 = 26\n\nHmm, perhaps there's an additional book that I'm not accounting for. Let me see if there's any other book in the New Testament that I might have missed.\n\nWait a minute, sometimes there are different canonical books in certain Christian denominations. Maybe I should consider that, but I think the standard New Testament has 27 books. Maybe I missed one in my count.\n\nLet me try another approach. I know that the New Testament has 27 books in the standard Protestant canon. So, option C. 27 seems correct.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me think about the Catholic New Testament. Does it have the same number? I think Catholics have some additional books, but no, actually, the Catholic New Testament also has 27 books. So, it's consistent there.\n\nWhat about the Eastern Orthodox Church? I believe they also accept the same 27 books in the New Testament. So, regardless of the Christian denomination, the New Testament typically consists of 27 books.\n\nSo, even though my initial count added up to 26, it seems I made a mistake in counting. Perhaps I forgot to include one of the Epistles. Let me verify:\n\nListing them out:\n\n1. Matthew\n\n2. Mark\n\n3. Luke\n\n4. John\n\n5. Acts\n\n6. Romans\n\n7. 1 Corinthians\n\n8. 2 Corinthians\n\n9. Galatians\n\n10. Ephesians\n\n11. Philippians\n\n12. Colossians\n\n13. 1 Thessalonians\n\n14. 2 Thessalonians\n\n15. 1 Timothy\n\n16. 2 Timothy\n\n17. Titus\n\n18. Philemon\n\n19. Hebrews\n\n20. James\n\n21. 1 Peter\n\n22. 2 Peter\n\n23. 1 John\n\n24. 2 John\n\n25. 3 John\n\n26. Jude\n\n27. Revelation\n\nOkay, now I see where I went wrong earlier. I forgot to include Hebrews in my initial count. So, yes, there are 27 books in the New Testament.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
