The land was located in a jurisdiction that has in force the following statute:Statute of Limitations \u0080\u0094\"an action to recover the possession of land shall be brought within twenty- one (21) years after the cause thereof accrued, but if a person who is entitled to bring such action at the time the cause accrued is within the age of minority (under 21) or of unsound mind, such action may be brought within ten (10) years after such disability is removed. \"This statute was enacted in the jurisdiction in 1930. The land in question had been owned by a rancher in 1960. On September 1, 1960, the rancher died intestate, leaving his nephew as his only heir. The nephew had been born on October 1, 1954. In addition, there is a deed from the rancher's administrator to the seller dated November 1, 1960, which the latter recorded on the same date. During his title search, the buyer learned that the administrator had never obtained any license to sell the land in question; and also he (the administrator) never formally received the approval of any court with respect to the administration of the rancher's estate. Moreover, the buyer ascertained that the seller entered into possession of the land in question on November 1, 1960. On the assumption that there are no additional facts, the buyer should be advised that the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question\n\nA. on November 1, 1960.\nB. on November 12, 1981.\nC. on October 1, 1985.\nD. when the nephew dies.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out when the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question. There are a few moving parts here, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's establish the timeline:\n\n- May 1, 2006: Contract signed between buyer and seller.\n\n- June 15, 2006: Closing date for the purchase.\n\n- September 1, 1960: Rancher dies intestate, leaving his nephew as the only heir.\n\n- October 1, 1954: Nephew's birthdate.\n\n- November 1, 1960: Deed from the rancher's administrator to the seller, recorded on the same date.\n\n- Seller enters possession on November 1, 1960.\n\nNow, there's a Statute of Limitations in place since 1930 that says:\n\n- An action to recover possession of land must be brought within 21 years after the cause accrued.\n\n- However, if the person entitled to bring such action is a minor or of unsound mind at the time the cause accrued, they have 10 years from when that disability is removed to bring the action.\n\nAlright, so the rancher dies in 1960, and his nephew is his only heir. The nephew was born in 1954, so in 1960, he would have been 6 years old. That means he was a minor when the rancher died.\n\nThe administrator sold the land to the seller on November 1, 1960, but apparently, the administrator didn't have the proper authority to do so because he didn't have a license to sell the land or court approval for the estate administration.\n\nSo, the question is, does the nephew, as the rightful heir, have a claim to the land, and if so, how long does he have to bring an action to recover it?\n\nGiven that he was a minor in 1960, the statute of limitations would be extended for him. The standard period is 21 years from when the cause accrued, but since he was a minor, he gets an additional 10 years from when his disability (minority) is removed.\n\nFirst, let's figure out when his disability was removed. He was born on October 1, 1954, so he would turn 21 on October 1, 1975.\n\nSo, his disability (minority) is removed on October 1, 1975.\n\nThen, he has 10 years from that date to bring an action. So, the deadline would be October 1, 1985.\n\nNow, if he doesn't bring an action by that date, the seller would have clear title.\n\nBut wait, the seller took possession on November 1, 1960, and the deed was recorded on that date.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the statute of limitations?\n\nLet me think about adverse possession. In some jurisdictions, continuous possession for a certain period can lead to ownership. But in this case, the statute of limitations seems to be governing the time within which a claim can be brought, not necessarily the acquisition of title through possession.\n\nWait, the question is asking when the seller became or will become the owner of the land.\n\nOption A says on November 1, 1960, which is when the seller took possession and the deed was recorded.\n\nOption B says on November 12, 1981. Hmm, that doesn't seem to correspond to any significant date in the timeline.\n\nOption C says on October 1, 1985, which is when the nephew's extended statute of limitations expires.\n\nOption D says when the nephew dies, which seems too vague and not directly related to the statute of limitations.\n\nSo, between these options, it seems like Option C might be the correct answer, meaning that the seller becomes the owner when the nephew's right to bring an action expires on October 1, 1985.\n\nBut wait, the seller already took possession in 1960 and had a deed. Does the expiration of the nephew's right to challenge the sale confer some additional legal benefit or just confirm the seller's title?\n\nI think it's more about confirming the seller's title. The seller already had possession and a deed, but there was a potential cloud on the title due to the nephew's minority and the administrator's lack of authority.\n\nSo, once the nephew's right to challenge the sale expires on October 1, 1985, the seller's title is cleared of any potential claim by the nephew.\n\nTherefore, the seller became the owner in a clear and unchallengeable way on October 1, 1985.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. on October 1, 1985.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
