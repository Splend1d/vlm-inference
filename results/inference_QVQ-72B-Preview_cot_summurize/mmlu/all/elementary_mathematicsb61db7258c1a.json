                    "text": "So I have this problem here that asks me to find which pair of ratios cannot form a proportion. The options are:\n\nA. 4 over 5 and 24 over 30\n\nB. 4 over 5 and 20 over 25\n\nC. 36 over 45 and 4 over 5\n\nD. 4 over 5 and 20 over 30\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a proportion is. A proportion is when two ratios are equal, right? So, if I have two fractions that are equal, like a/b = c/d, that's a proportion.\n\nSo, my task is to check each pair and see if they are equal, and find the one that isn't.\n\nLet me start with option A: 4/5 and 24/30.\n\nI can simplify 24/30 to see if it equals 4/5. 24 and 30 can both be divided by 6, so 24 \u00f7 6 = 4 and 30 \u00f7 6 = 5, which gives me 4/5. So, yes, they are equal. Therefore, this is a proportion.\n\nNext, option B: 4/5 and 20/25.\n\nLet's simplify 20/25. Both 20 and 25 can be divided by 5. 20 \u00f7 5 = 4 and 25 \u00f7 5 = 5, so this also simplifies to 4/5. So, again, they are equal, making this a proportion.\n\nNow, option C: 36/45 and 4/5.\n\nFirst, I'll simplify 36/45. Both 36 and 45 can be divided by 9. 36 \u00f7 9 = 4 and 45 \u00f7 9 = 5, so this simplifies to 4/5. Again, it equals 4/5, so this is also a proportion.\n\nLastly, option D: 4/5 and 20/30.\n\nLet's see what 20/30 simplifies to. Both 20 and 30 can be divided by 10. 20 \u00f7 10 = 2 and 30 \u00f7 10 = 3, so this simplifies to 2/3.\n\nNow, 2/3 is not equal to 4/5. To confirm, I can cross-multiply: 4 * 3 = 12 and 5 * 2 = 10. Since 12 \u2260 10, they are not equal.\n\nTherefore, option D is the pair that cannot form a proportion.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by checking if the cross-products are equal for each option.\n\nLet's double-check all options using cross-multiplication to be sure.\n\nOption A: 4/5 and 24/30.\n\nCross-multiplying: 4 * 30 = 120 and 5 * 24 = 120. Since 120 = 120, they are proportional.\n\nOption B: 4/5 and 20/25.\n\nCross-multiplying: 4 * 25 = 100 and 5 * 20 = 100. Since 100 = 100, they are proportional.\n\nOption C: 36/45 and 4/5.\n\nCross-multiplying: 36 * 5 = 180 and 45 * 4 = 180. Since 180 = 180, they are proportional.\n\nOption D: 4/5 and 20/30.\n\nCross-multiplying: 4 * 30 = 120 and 5 * 20 = 100. Since 120 \u2260 100, they are not proportional.\n\nSo, again, option D is the one that does not form a proportion.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of these ratios can be simplified further or if there's any other context I'm missing.\n\nFor example, in option A, 24/30 can be simplified to 4/5, as I did before, which confirms they are proportional.\n\nIn option B, 20/25 simplifies to 4/5, again confirming proportionality.\n\nIn option C, 36/45 simplifies to 4/5, maintaining the proportion.\n\nIn option D, 20/30 simplifies to 2/3, which, as established, does not equal 4/5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that 20/30 simplifies to 2/3. Let me verify that.\n\nDividing both numerator and denominator by 10: 20 \u00f7 10 = 2 and 30 \u00f7 10 = 3, so yes, it's 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if 2/3 is equal to 4/5 by converting them to decimals or finding a common denominator, just to be sure.\n\nLet's try converting them to decimals.\n\n4/5 is 0.8.\n\n2/3 is approximately 0.666..., which is not equal to 0.8.\n\nAlternatively, finding a common denominator: 4/5 = 12/15, and 2/3 = 10/15.\n\nSince 12 \u2260 10, they are not equal.\n\nTherefore, option D is indeed the correct choice for the pair that cannot form a proportion.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to confirm this, so I'm confident that option D is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
