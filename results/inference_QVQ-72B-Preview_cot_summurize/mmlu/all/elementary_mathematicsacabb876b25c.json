                    "text": "So I have this problem here: 52 + 6 * 2. I need to figure out what the answer is from these options: A. 116, B. 64, C. 62, D. 118.\n\nHmm, let's see. I remember that in math, there are something called order of operations. That means I have to do certain operations before others. Like, multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. Right? So, in this problem, I should do the multiplication first and then the addition.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nFirst, 6 * 2 is 12.\n\nThen, 52 + 12 equals 64.\n\nSo, the answer should be 64. That's option B.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I should try doing the addition first and see what happens. But I think that's not correct because of the order of operations.\n\nLet me try it anyway: If I add 52 + 6, I get 58, then multiply by 2, that's 58 * 2, which is 116. That's option A. But I think that's wrong because I should have done the multiplication first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the whole expression again. Is there any way to interpret 52 + 6 * 2 differently? Well, multiplication is associative and commutative, so 6 * 2 is the same as 2 * 6, which is still 12. Adding that to 52 still gives me 64.\n\nLet me check if there are parentheses or anything that might change the order, but in this problem, it's just 52 + 6 * 2 without any parentheses. So, following the standard order of operations, multiplication comes before addition.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about it in terms of operations. Is there a way to group these operations? For example, could I consider 52 + (6 * 2)? That would be 52 + 12, which is 64. Or, could I do (52 + 6) * 2, which is 58 * 2, which is 116. But I think the correct way is to do the multiplication first, so 52 + (6 * 2).\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the PEMDAS rule: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so it's just multiplication and addition. Since multiplication comes before addition, I do 6 * 2 first, then add to 52.\n\nI think I'm confident with that. But let me see if there's another approach. Maybe using some algebra or something, but that seems overkill for such a simple expression.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the order of operations in terms of operator precedence. In most programming languages and mathematical calculations, multiplication has higher precedence than addition. So, again, 6 * 2 is done first, then added to 52.\n\nLet me consider if there's any confusion possible here. Maybe someone might think that addition should be done first, but I don't think that's the case. Unless there's a specific context or instruction to evaluate left to right ignoring precedence, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, sticking to the standard order of operations, the answer should be 64.\n\nJust to make sure, let's plug in the numbers again: 52 + 6 * 2.\n\nFirst, 6 * 2 = 12.\n\nThen, 52 + 12 = 64.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here, like negative numbers or anything like that. It's a straightforward application of the order of operations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 64, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]"
