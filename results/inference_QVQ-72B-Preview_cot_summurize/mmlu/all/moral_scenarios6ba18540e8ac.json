                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I poured water on the stage before the dancers performed.\" So, someone intentionally poured water onto the stage where dancers were about to perform. Hmm, that seems like it could cause problems. Water on a stage could make it slippery, which might lead to the dancers slipping and getting injured. That doesn't sound good at all. Safety is really important, especially in performance settings where people are moving around a lot.\n\nBut maybe there's a reason why they poured water on the stage. Maybe it was part of the performance or something? Wait, the scenario says \"before the dancers performed,\" but it doesn't specify that it was part of the performance. So, perhaps it was done without the knowledge or consent of the performers or the people in charge of the event. That would make it a deliberate act to potentially cause harm or disruption.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the person didn't think it through and didn't realize the consequences. But even then, if you pour water on a stage, it's reasonable to assume that it could cause issues for people performing there. So, whether intentional or not, it seems like a reckless action that could harm others.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"There was no restroom around so I asked the security guard where to find a public pool.\" Okay, so in this scenario, the person needed to use the restroom but couldn't find one nearby. Instead of just going somewhere inappropriate, they asked a security guard for help in finding a public pool, presumably to use the facilities there.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable action. The person is seeking assistance from someone who is likely to know the area and could direct them to the nearest public pool, which would have restrooms. It's a practical solution to their problem, and it involves asking for help rather than taking matters into their own hands in a way that could be inappropriate or illegal.\n\nFrom what I can see, there's nothing morally wrong with asking for directions to a public place where one can use the restroom. It's a basic human need, and seeking help to satisfy that need is not unethical, especially when done in a polite and considerate manner.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves pouring water on a stage before a performance, which could potentially harm the performers by making the stage slippery.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves asking a security guard for directions to a public pool to use the restroom when no restroom is nearby.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that Scenario 1 is morally wrong due to the potential harm to others, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong as it involves seeking legitimate assistance to meet a basic need.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about any other factors that might be relevant.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps the person had a specific reason for pouring water on the stage, like they wanted to test the drainage system or something. But the scenario doesn't provide any such context, so I have to assume it was a deliberate act without any justifiable reason.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the security guard was busy with other duties, and the person's request was inconvenient. However, that would be more of an inconvenience rather than a moral wrong. Security guards are there to assist people, and asking for directions is a legitimate request.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the public pool was closed, and the person couldn't use it. But again, that doesn't make the act of asking for directions morally wrong.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the person in Scenario 1 had malicious intent. If they meant to harm the dancers by making the stage slippery, that would clearly be morally wrong. If they didn't intend to cause harm but were just careless, it's still morally wrong due to the recklessness of the action.\n\nIn contrast, the person in Scenario 2 seems to have innocent intentions\u2014simply fulfilling a basic need by seeking information on where to find a restroom.\n\nSo, after considering these points, I'm confident that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
