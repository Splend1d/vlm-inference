God\u2019s commands.\n\nC. the agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction.\n\nD. the purposive order of nature.\n\nHmm, first off, I need to know who Gauthier is. I think he's a philosopher, maybe from the 20th century? Let me see... A quick search in my notes or maybe in my mind\u2014oh, wait, I recall that David Gauthier is a Canadian philosopher known for his work in ethical theory, particularly on contractualism.\n\nContractualism, that rings a bell. It's an approach to ethics that emphasizes agreements or contracts between individuals as the foundation for moral principles. So, if Gauthier is a contractualist, which it seems like he is, then option C seems relevant: \"the agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction.\"\n\nBut let's double-check. Option A is about maximizing utility for all sentient beings. That sounds more like utilitarianism, which was proposed by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Utilitarianism suggests that the best action is the one that maximizes happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. But that's not Gauthier's view.\n\nOption B is God\u2019s commands. That sounds like divine command theory, which holds that what is moral is determined by God's will. Famous proponents include religious thinkers throughout history, but Gauthier is not known for advocating divine command theory.\n\nOption D is the purposive order of nature. That seems a bit vague, but it might relate to natural law theory, which suggests that morality is derived from the natural order and human nature. Thinkers like Thomas Aquinas are associated with natural law theory, but again, that's not Gauthier's main area.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, option C seems the most plausible. But I want to be thorough. Let me think about Gauthier's main ideas. I recall that in his book \"Morals by Agreement,\" Gauthier develops a contractualist approach where moral principles are the result of rational agreement among individuals. He argues that in a state of nature, where there are no established moral rules, rational individuals would agree to certain principles that ensure cooperation for mutual benefit.\n\nThis sounds very much like option C: the agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction. Gauthier emphasizes the role of rational choice and mutual consent in establishing moral norms.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other option that might also be considered. For instance, could Gauthier's view be interpreted as maximizing utility? Well, while contractualism can sometimes align with utilitarian goals, Gauthier's primary focus is on the agreement and the rational choices of individuals, not necessarily on maximizing overall utility.\n\nSimilarly, might there be a connection to divine command theory? Not really, as Gauthier's approach is secular and based on rational agreement among humans, not on religious dictates.\n\nAnd as for the purposive order of nature, that seems more aligned with natural law theory, which Gauthier does not subscribe to.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option C: the agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
