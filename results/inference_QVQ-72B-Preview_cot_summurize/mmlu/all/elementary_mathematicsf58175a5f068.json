                    "text": "So I've got this equation here: 12 minus 9 plus c equals 12. And I need to find out what value of c makes this equation true. Let me see... I'm a bit rusty on my algebra, but I think I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the equation as much as possible. So, 12 minus 9 is 3, right? So, the equation becomes 3 plus c equals 12. That seems simpler. Now, I need to find out what c is so that when I add it to 3, I get 12.\n\nLet me think about this. If 3 plus c equals 12, then c must be equal to 12 minus 3, which is 9. Wait, but let me double-check that. If I add 9 to 3, I get 12. Yeah, that seems correct. So, c should be 9.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this, just to be sure. Maybe I can think about the original equation again: 12 - 9 + c = 12. If I rearrange it, I can put the constants together: 12 - 9 is 3, and then plus c equals 12. Yeah, same as before. So, c = 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nWait a minute, what if c is not 9? Let's try plugging in one of the other options to see what happens. For example, option A is 0. If c is 0, then 12 - 9 + 0 = 3, which is not equal to 12. So, that doesn't work.\n\nOption B is 3. So, 12 - 9 + 3 = 6, which is still not equal to 12. Hmm, that's not right either.\n\nOption C is 9, which we already think is the correct answer. And option D is 12. Let's check that just to be thorough. If c is 12, then 12 - 9 + 12 = 15, which is more than 12. So, that doesn't work either.\n\nAlright, so it seems like c has to be 9 to make the equation true. Maybe there's another way to approach this, but for now, this seems straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any other operation or if there's a trick here that I'm missing. The equation looks pretty straightforward: just subtraction and addition. No multiplication or division signs visible, so I think I'm safe with adding c to the result of 12 minus 9.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to isolate c in the equation. So, starting from 3 + c = 12, I can subtract 3 from both sides to get c by itself. So, c = 12 - 3, which again is 9. Yeah, that matches what I got before.\n\nI should also consider if c could be a negative number, but in this context, since the equation is set up with addition, and we're dealing with positive numbers, I don't think c can be negative. But just to be sure, let's try c = -3, which is not one of the options. If c = -3, then 3 + (-3) = 0, which is not equal to 12. So, that doesn't work either.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the possibilities here. The answer should be c = 9, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
