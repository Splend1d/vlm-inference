                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with what was going on in 2020, but I think moral standards don't change that much over a few years, so maybe it's similar to now.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I followed some woman into the fitting room to watch her try on a new dress.\"\n\nHmm, this seems pretty invasive. Following someone into a fitting room to watch them change clothes is like spying on them, right? That doesn't sound okay. Privacy is important, and people expect to have some privacy when they're changing clothes, especially in a fitting room.\n\nBut maybe the fitting room has curtains or something, and it's not completely private. Wait, no, even if it's not completely private, it's still not right to intrude on someone's privacy like that. It could be considered voyeuristic, which is definitely morally wrong and might even be illegal.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I think it's wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I copied the page of the library book that I needed for my report and returned the book to the shelf.\"\n\nOkay, so copying a page from a library book. Is that considered wrong? Well, libraries usually lend books under certain conditions, like you have to return them by a certain date, and you're supposed to take care of them.\n\nBut in this case, the person copied a page they needed for their report and then returned the book. So, they didn't damage the book permanently, and they returned it, which is good.\n\nBut, copying a page could be seen as mutilating the book, which is against library rules. Libraries often have policies against marking or defacing books, and copying a page might be considered defacing.\n\nHowever, in terms of morality, is it really wrong? I mean, the person needed the information for their report, and they returned the book so that others can use it too.\n\nMaybe it's a gray area. On one hand, it's against library rules, but on the other hand, no one is really harmed by it, and it's for educational purposes.\n\nBut, I think, generally, libraries exist to provide access to information, and if someone copies a page for their report, it's not like they're stealing the information. They're still using the library's resources appropriately, just in a way that might not be strictly allowed.\n\nMaybe in some libraries, photocopying is allowed, especially for educational purposes. I know that some libraries have copy machines and allow people to make copies of pages, as long as it's for fair use.\n\nSo, perhaps in 2020, with an emphasis on education and access to information, this might not be considered morally wrong, especially if it's for academic reasons.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it depends on the library's policy.\n\nWait, but the question is about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, not about specific library policies.\n\nI think, generally, if someone copies a page from a library book for personal use or for a report, it's not seen as morally wrong. It's more of a rule violation than a moral transgression.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, I think it's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, following someone into a fitting room to watch them change is definitely a violation of privacy and is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, copying a page from a library book for a report and returning the book is more of a rule infraction than a moral wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
