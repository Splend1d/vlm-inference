                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about blackbody radiation. It says that if the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area does which of the following? The options are:\n\nA. Decreases by a factor of 81.\n\nB. Decreases by a factor of 9.\n\nC. Increases by a factor of 9.\n\nD. Increases by a factor of 81.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what a blackbody is and how its radiation properties relate to temperature. I remember that a blackbody is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. It's a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and astrophysics.\n\nNow, the energy radiated by a blackbody per unit area per unit time is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. I think that's the relevant equation here. Let me state that law correctly.\n\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the total energy emitted per unit surface area of a blackbody per unit time is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Mathematically, it's expressed as:\n\n\\[j = \\sigma T^4\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(j\\) is the energy radiated per second per unit area (also known as the emissive power).\n\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nAlright, so from this equation, it's clear that the energy radiated is proportional to \\(T^4\\). That means if you increase the temperature by a certain factor, the energy radiated increases by that factor raised to the fourth power.\n\nIn this problem, the temperature is increased by a factor of 3. So, if \\(T\\) becomes \\(3T\\), then the new energy radiated per second per unit area would be:\n\n\\[j' = \\sigma (3T)^4 = \\sigma \\times 81T^4\\]\n\nComparing this to the original \\(j = \\sigma T^4\\), we see that \\(j'\\) is 81 times \\(j\\). So, the energy radiated increases by a factor of 81.\n\nLet me just double-check that. Starting with \\(j = \\sigma T^4\\), and then \\(j' = \\sigma (3T)^4 = \\sigma \\times 81T^4\\), so \\(j' = 81 \\times j\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Increases by a factor of 81.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other factor that could affect this relationship? For example, might the surface area change if the temperature changes? Well, in this problem, we're considering a blackbody with a fixed surface area, and only the temperature is changing. So, the surface area remains constant, and only the energy radiated per unit area per second changes based on the temperature.\n\nAlso, make sure that we're dealing with absolute temperature here, which is measured in Kelvin. The Stefan-Boltzmann law uses absolute temperature, not Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the blackbody is emitting more energy because it's hotter, but that's already accounted for in the Stefan-Boltzmann law. No other effects are mentioned in the problem, so I think it's safe to assume that the only variable changing is the temperature.\n\nSo, to sum it up, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, increasing the temperature by a factor of 3 leads to an increase in the energy radiated per second per unit area by a factor of 81.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
