                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what to advise this buyer who received nonconforming goods. She doesn't want to accept and pay for them, which makes sense. Let's see what the options are.\n\nOption A says to hold onto the goods and make the best of them because a business cannot reject goods already approved by a written agreement signed by both parties. Hmm, that sounds like once there's a written agreement, she can't reject the goods even if they're nonconforming. But that doesn't seem right. I think she can still reject nonconforming goods, regardless of the written agreement, as long as she does it properly.\n\nOption B suggests trying the goods out for several months and then shipping them back if they're not satisfactory. While holding the goods for inspection is acceptable, keeping them for several months might not be advisable. The U.C.C. generally requires that rejection of goods must be timely, which usually means within a reasonable time after delivery. Waiting several months could be seen as accepting the goods, making rejection later on more difficult.\n\nOption C advises notifying the seller of the nonconformity and demanding a refund while holding onto the nonconforming goods as long as possible. Again, holding onto the goods indefinitely isn't the best approach. The buyer should hold the goods with reasonable care but shouldn't keep them longer than necessary. The U.C.C. allows buyers to reject nonconforming goods and to hold them at the seller's risk and expense, but there are limits to how long this can go on.\n\nOption D seems the most straightforward. It suggests identifying and documenting the nonconformity, then sending the goods back right away. This aligns better with the U.C.C.'s requirements for rejecting nonconforming goods. Timely rejection is key, and documenting the nonconformity helps support the buyer's position.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this more carefully. Under the U.C.C., when a buyer receives nonconforming goods, they have several options. They can accept the goods and seek damages, reject them entirely, or accept part of the shipment and reject the rest. Given that the buyer doesn't want to accept and pay for nonconforming goods, rejection seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, rejection must be timely and communicated to the seller. The buyer should also hold the goods with reasonable care and, if instructed by the seller, prepare them for return. But the buyer isn't obligated to pay for the goods if they've been properly rejected.\n\nLet me consider if there's any difference based on whether the goods were inspected or not. If the goods were inspected and found nonconforming, the buyer should notify the seller immediately. Holding onto the goods for an extended period could imply acceptance.\n\nAlso, if there's a written agreement, it might have specific terms about inspection and rejection periods. But assuming it's a standard U.C.C. transaction, the buyer has the right to reject nonconforming goods.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA is incorrect because it suggests that a written agreement prevents rejection of goods, which isn't the case for nonconforming goods.\n\nB is problematic because it advises keeping the goods for several months, which could be too long and could lead to acceptance by implication.\n\nC is also not ideal because it suggests holding onto the goods as long as possible, which could expose the buyer to claims of conversion or acceptance.\n\nD seems the best advice: identify and document the nonconformity, then send the goods back right away. This ensures that the rejection is timely and documented, which is crucial for protecting the buyer's rights under the U.C.C.\n\nAdditionally, the buyer should notify the seller of the rejection in writing, specifying the reasons for rejection. This notification is essential to preserve any claims against the seller.\n\nIn summary, the most appropriate advice is option D: identify and document the nonconformity, then send the goods back right away, while also notifying the seller of the rejection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
