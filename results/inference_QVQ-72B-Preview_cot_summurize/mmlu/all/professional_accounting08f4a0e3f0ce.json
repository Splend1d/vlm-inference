                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Johnson works for ABC Co. and earns a salary of $100,000. On top of that, he gets group term life insurance as a fringe benefit, and the coverage is twice his salary. So, the insurance is for $200,000, right? Because twice $100,000 is $200,000.\n\nNow, the problem mentions something called the \"annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance,\" which is $2.76 per $1,000 of coverage. So, if the insurance is for $200,000, I need to find out how much that cost would be according to this uniform rate.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the cost of the insurance based on the IRS uniform cost rate. The rate is $2.76 per $1,000. So, for every $1,000 of coverage, it costs $2.76. Since the coverage is $200,000, I need to find out how many $1,000 units are in $200,000.\n\n$200,000 divided by $1,000 is 200. So, there are 200 units of $1,000 in $200,000. Now, I multiply the number of units by the cost per unit: 200 times $2.76.\n\nLet's do that calculation: 200 \u00d7 $2.76. Well, 200 times 2 is $400, and 200 times 0.76 is $152. So, $400 plus $152 is $552. Therefore, the cost of the insurance is $552.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much Johnson must include in his gross income. I know that the salary is $100,000, and the fringe benefit is the group term life insurance. So, presumably, the total gross income would be the salary plus the value of the fringe benefit.\n\nBut wait, fringe benefits can sometimes be taxable, but there might be exceptions or limitations. Especially with group term life insurance, there might be rules about how much is taxable and how much is not.\n\nI need to recall the IRS rules on group term life insurance fringe benefits. I think there's a certain amount of coverage that an employer can provide tax-free to the employee. I believe the first $50,000 of group term life insurance coverage is generally excludible from the employee's gross income. So, only the value of the coverage above $50,000 is taxable.\n\nIn this case, the coverage is $200,000. So, the first $50,000 is excludible, and the remaining $150,000 is potentially taxable.\n\nNow, to find the taxable amount, I need to find the cost of the coverage for the $150,000 using the IRS uniform cost rate.\n\nFirst, find how many $1,000 units are in $150,000. $150,000 divided by $1,000 is 150 units.\n\nThen, 150 units times $2.76 per unit: 150 \u00d7 $2.76.\n\nLet's calculate that: 150 \u00d7 2.76. Well, 150 \u00d7 2 = 300, and 150 \u00d7 0.76 is 114. So, $300 plus $114 is $414.\n\nTherefore, the taxable amount for the fringe benefit is $414.\n\nAdding that to the salary: $100,000 + $414 = $100,414.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $100,000\n\nB. $100,276\n\nC. $100,414\n\nD. $100,552\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I missed something. Let's verify the calculations.\n\nFirst, the insurance coverage is twice the salary: $100,000 \u00d7 2 = $200,000.\n\nThe uniform cost rate is $2.76 per $1,000.\n\nSo, for $200,000 coverage, the total cost is 200 \u00d7 $2.76 = $552.\n\nBut only the coverage above $50,000 is taxable, so $150,000 is taxable.\n\n$150,000 divided by $1,000 is 150 units.\n\n150 \u00d7 $2.76 = $414.\n\nSalary plus taxable fringe benefit: $100,000 + $414 = $100,414.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps there are other factors to consider, like Johnson's age or the premium payment method, but the problem doesn't provide any additional information, so I think the approach taken is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $100,414.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
