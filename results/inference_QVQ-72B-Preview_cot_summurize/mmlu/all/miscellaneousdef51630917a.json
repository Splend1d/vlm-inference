                    "text": "So I've got this question here about layers of rock, specifically sandstone and shale. The question is asking which sequence of events would be consistent with finding a layer of sandstone right above a layer of shale in bedrock. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, I know that shale is a type of sedimentary rock, usually fine-grained, and it's often formed from mud or silt that has been compressed over time. Sandstone, on the other hand, is also a sedimentary rock but consists of larger particles\u2014sand-sized grains\u2014that have been cemented together.\n\nSo, if we have sandstone above shale, it suggests a particular sequence of events where sand was deposited on top of finer-grained material like shale.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that a volcano erupted, sending lava out over a layer of shale. The lava cooled and hardened into sandstone. Hmm, that seems a bit off. Lava cooling and hardening typically forms igneous rocks like basalt or andesite, not sandstone. Sandstone is sedimentary, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B mentions that the water level of a large lake lowered, and a beach formed where there was previously lake bottom. Okay, so if the lake level drops, the area that was once the lake bottom might be exposed, and a beach could form there. Beaches are often composed of sand, which could eventually turn into sandstone through lithification. So, if you have shale formed from the lake bottom sediments and then sandstone from the beach deposits on top, that could explain the sandstone above shale. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C talks about one-celled organisms developing a colony on the seafloor, and their shells accumulated and lithified into sandstone. Wait a minute, shells are typically made of calcium carbonate, which can form limestone, not sandstone. Sandstone is generally made up of quartz sand grains. So, while biogenic sediments can form rocks, I don't think they directly form sandstone. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption D says that mud was deposited and lithified into shale, and then subsequent contact metamorphism resulted in localized recrystallization of the shale into sandstone. Hmm, metamorphism usually transforms existing rocks into new types under high pressure and temperature. But shale turning into sandstone through metamorphism doesn't ring true. Metamorphism of shale typically forms slate or phyllite, not sandstone. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems the most reasonable explanation for having a layer of sandstone above a layer of shale. The lowering of a lake's water level leading to the formation of a beach where sand accumulates on top of the former lake bottom, which could be shale, makes sense in terms of sedimentary layering.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the properties of each rock type again. Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock, typically formed in quiet water environments like the bottom of lakes or seas. Sandstone is formed from larger particles, usually in higher-energy environments like rivers or beaches.\n\nSo, if a lake's water level drops, the exposed lake bottom could become a beach, where waves and wind can deposit sand. Over time, this sand could compact and cement into sandstone, lying atop the older shale layer.\n\nThis scenario aligns well with the geological principle of superposition, where newer layers are deposited on top of older ones.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
