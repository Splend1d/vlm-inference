                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"The maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon in the Euclidean plane is...\" and the options are from A.1 up to D.4. Hmm, I need to figure out how many acute angles a convex 10-sided polygon can have.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a convex polygon, all the interior angles are less than 180 degrees, right? And an acute angle is less than 90 degrees. So, I need to find out how many angles in a 10-gon can be less than 90 degrees while keeping the polygon convex.\n\nI recall that the sum of the interior angles of an n-gon is given by the formula (n-2)*180 degrees. So for a 10-gon, it would be (10-2)*180 = 8*180 = 1440 degrees. That means all the interior angles combined must add up to 1440 degrees.\n\nNow, if I have, say, k acute angles, each being less than 90 degrees, and the rest of the angles are greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees, what's the maximum k can be without violating the total sum of 1440 degrees.\n\nLet's think about the smallest possible sum of the acute angles. If each acute angle is at least, say, 0 degrees, but that doesn't make sense because in a polygon, angles can't be zero. Actually, in a convex polygon, all angles must be positive and less than 180 degrees. But to maximize the number of acute angles, I should consider the smallest possible acute angles.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the maximum number of acute angles, not necessarily the minimum sum. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's assume that there are k acute angles, each less than 90 degrees, and the remaining (10 - k) angles are greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees. I need to find the maximum k such that the sum of all these angles is at least 1440 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the exterior angles. In a convex polygon, each exterior angle is less than 180 degrees, and the sum of all exterior angles is 360 degrees.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly here. Maybe sticking with interior angles is better.\n\nLet's try to set up an inequality. If there are k acute angles, each less than 90 degrees, and (10 - k) angles each greater than 90 degrees, the sum must be 1440 degrees.\n\nTo maximize k, I should minimize the sum of the acute angles and maximize the sum of the larger angles. So, suppose each acute angle is just under 90 degrees, say approaching 90 degrees from below, and each of the larger angles is just over 90 degrees, approaching 180 degrees from below.\n\nBut that doesn't give me a precise answer. Maybe I need to set some bounds.\n\nLet's assume that each acute angle is exactly 89 degrees (just to make it less than 90). Then, the sum of k acute angles would be 89k degrees. The remaining (10 - k) angles must each be at least 91 degrees (just over 90), so their sum would be at least 91(10 - k) degrees.\n\nThe total sum would be 89k + 91(10 - k) = 89k + 910 - 91k = 910 - 2k. This must be at least 1440 degrees, because the actual angles are larger than 89 and 91 degrees.\n\nSo, 910 - 2k \u2264 1440.\n\nWait, that would mean 910 - 2k \u2264 1440.\n\nLet's solve for k:\n\n910 - 2k \u2264 1440\n\n-2k \u2264 1440 - 910\n\n-2k \u2264 530\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (remember to reverse the inequality):\n\n2k \u2265 -530\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because k has to be positive. Maybe I messed up the inequality direction.\n\nWait, starting over:\n\nWe have 910 - 2k \u2264 1440.\n\nSubtract 910 from both sides:\n\n-2k \u2264 530\n\nNow, divide both sides by -2 and reverse the inequality:\n\nk \u2265 -530 / -2\n\nk \u2265 265\n\nBut that can't be right because k has to be between 0 and 10. Clearly, I did something wrong here.\n\nAh, I think the mistake is assuming that the sum is at least 910 - 2k. Actually, the sum is exactly 910 - 2k in this case, but we need it to be equal to 1440.\n\nWait, no. If each acute angle is 89 degrees and each of the larger angles is 91 degrees, then the sum would be 89k + 91(10 - k) = 910 - 2k. But in reality, the larger angles are greater than 91 degrees, so the actual sum would be greater than 910 - 2k.\n\nBut the total sum must be exactly 1440 degrees. So, 910 - 2k < 1440, but that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nMaybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that in a convex polygon, the exterior angles must each be less than 180 degrees, and their sum is always 360 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the relationship between the number of acute angles and the sum of interior angles.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the minimal possible sum with k acute angles.\n\nIf I have k acute angles, each being, say, 89 degrees, and the remaining (10 - k) angles being as small as possible but still greater than 90 degrees, say 91 degrees, then the total sum would be 89k + 91(10 - k).\n\nBut as we saw, this sum is 910 - 2k, which needs to be less than or equal to 1440.\n\nWait, no, actually, since the actual angles are larger than 89 and 91 degrees, the sum would be greater than 910 - 2k.\n\nSo, 910 - 2k < 1440.\n\nBut earlier, solving 910 - 2k \u2264 1440 led to k \u2265 -265, which is nonsensical.\n\nI must be setting up the inequality wrong.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf I have k acute angles, each less than 90 degrees, and (10 - k) angles each greater than 90 degrees, the sum must be exactly 1440 degrees.\n\nI need to maximize k under these constraints.\n\nPerhaps I can set up the inequality such that the sum of k acute angles plus the sum of (10 - k) larger angles equals 1440.\n\nTo maximize k, I should minimize the sum of the acute angles and maximize the sum of the larger angles.\n\nBut in reality, the larger angles can be up to just under 180 degrees, but they have to be greater than 90 degrees.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider specific examples.\n\nSuppose there is only one acute angle. Then, the sum of the other nine angles would be 1440 - 89 = 1351 degrees, assuming the acute angle is 89 degrees.\n\nEach of these nine angles must be greater than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees. That's fine.\n\nWhat if there are two acute angles? Then, the sum of the other eight angles would be 1440 - 2*89 = 1440 - 178 = 1262 degrees.\n\nEach of these eight angles must be greater than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees.\n\nSo, 8*90 < 1262 < 8*180, which is 720 < 1262 < 1440. Yes, that holds.\n\nSimilarly, for three acute angles: sum of seven angles is 1440 - 3*89 = 1440 - 267 = 1173 degrees.\n\n7*90 = 630 < 1173 < 7*180 = 1260. Still holds.\n\nFor four acute angles: sum of six angles is 1440 - 4*89 = 1440 - 356 = 1084 degrees.\n\n6*90 = 540 < 1084 < 6*180 = 1080. Wait, 1084 > 1080? No, 1084 > 1080 is false.\n\nWait, 6*180 = 1080, and 1084 > 1080 is true, but in a convex polygon, all angles must be less than 180 degrees.\n\nSo, if one of the angles were 179 degrees, the others would have to sum to 1084 - 179 = 905 degrees for five angles, which is 5*90 = 450 < 905 < 5*180 = 900.\n\nBut one of those angles would have to be 179 degrees, and the others would have to be less than 180 degrees.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up an inequality where the sum of k acute angles and (10 - k) angles greater than 90 degrees equals 1440, with all angles less than 180 degrees.\n\nTo maximize k, I need to minimize the sum of the acute angles and maximize the sum of the larger angles.\n\nAssuming each acute angle is 89 degrees and each larger angle is 179 degrees, the sum would be 89k + 179(10 - k) = 89k + 1790 - 179k = 1790 - 90k.\n\nThis must equal 1440:\n\n1790 - 90k = 1440\n\nThen, -90k = 1440 - 1790\n\n-90k = -350\n\nk = 350 / 90 \u2248 3.888...\n\nSince k must be an integer, k \u2264 3.\n\nSo, the maximum number of acute angles is 3.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I tried k=4, the sum was 1440 - 4*89 = 1084 degrees for the remaining six angles, which is acceptable as long as each of those six angles is less than 180 degrees.\n\nBut according to this calculation, k=3.888..., so k=3 is the maximum.\n\nBut maybe k=4 is possible.\n\nLet me check for k=4.\n\nSum of four acute angles: 4*89 = 356 degrees.\n\nSum of six larger angles: 1440 - 356 = 1084 degrees.\n\nEach of these six angles must be less than 180 degrees, so 1084 / 6 \u2248 180.666..., which is greater than 180 degrees.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have six angles each less than 180 degrees summing to 1084 degrees, because 6*180 = 1080 < 1084.\n\nSo, with k=4, the sum of the larger angles exceeds the maximum possible sum for six angles in a convex polygon.\n\nTherefore, k=3 is the maximum number of acute angles possible in a convex 10-gon.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
