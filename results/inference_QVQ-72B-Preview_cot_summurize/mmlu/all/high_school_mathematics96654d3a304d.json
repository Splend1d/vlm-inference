                    "text": "So I need to compute the binomial coefficient, which is denoted as C(85, 82) or sometimes written as \"85 choose 82\". This represents the number of ways to choose 82 items out of 85 without regard to the order. The formula for this is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!),\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 85 and k = 82.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate 85! (85 factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to 85. But calculating 85! directly is not practical because it's an extremely large number. The same goes for 82! and 3!, they are also very large numbers.\n\nHowever, I notice that k = 82 and n - k = 3, which suggests that C(85, 82) is equal to C(85, 3) because C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). This is a useful property because 3 is a much smaller number than 82, making the calculations more manageable.\n\nSo, C(85, 3) = 85! / (3!(85 - 3)!) = 85! / (3! * 82!).\n\nAgain, calculating 85! directly is not feasible, but there's a simplification I can use:\n\nC(85, 3) = (85 * 84 * 83) / (3 * 2 * 1),\n\nbecause the rest of the factorials cancel out.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nC(85, 3) = (85 * 84 * 83) / (3 * 2 * 1).\n\nNow, I can calculate the numerator first:\n\n85 * 84 = 7140\n\n7140 * 83 = let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 7140 * 80 = 571200\n\n7140 * 3 = 21420\n\nSo, 571200 + 21420 = 592620\n\nNow, divide that by 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n\nSo, 592620 / 6 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n592620 \u00f7 6.\n\nWell, 6 * 98770 = 592620, because 6 * 98770 = 592620.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n6 * 98770 =\n\n6 * 90,000 = 540,000\n\n6 * 8,770 = 52,620\n\n540,000 + 52,620 = 592,620\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, C(85, 82) = 98770\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 252\n\nB. 4680\n\nC. 98770\n\nD. 101170\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 98770.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, C(85, 82) = C(85, 3) = (85 * 84 * 83) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n\nNumerator: 85 * 84 = 7140\n\n7140 * 83 = 7140 * 80 + 7140 * 3 = 571200 + 21420 = 592620\n\nDenominator: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n\nSo, 592620 / 6 = 98770\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)\n\nFor example, C(85, 3) = C(84, 2) + C(84, 3)\n\nI could try to compute C(84, 2) and C(84, 3) separately and add them up, but that might take more time, and I might still end up with the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula C(n, k) = n / k * C(n-1, k-1)\n\nSo, C(85, 3) = (85 / 3) * C(84, 2)\n\nFirst, compute C(84, 2) = (84 * 83) / (2 * 1) = (84 * 83) / 2\n\n84 * 83 = 6972\n\n6972 / 2 = 3486\n\nThen, C(85, 3) = (85 / 3) * 3486 = 85 * 1162 = 98770\n\nAgain, I get the same result, 98770.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 98770.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{98770} \\]"
