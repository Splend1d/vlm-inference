                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out if this man can stop his neighbor's daughter from building a detached storage shed in her yard based on an agreement he had with her dad. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the man and his neighbor agreed in writing that neither of them would put up detached storage sheds in their yards. They thought the sheds were unsightly, and even though other homeowners in the subdivision had them, their agreement was specifically between these two neighbors. This agreement was recorded, which I believe means it's on public record, probably in the county land records or something like that.\n\nNow, three years later, the neighbor gives his house to his daughter as a gift. Shortly after she moves in, she finds out about this restriction but decides she wants to build a shed anyway. She claims that the restriction isn't enforceable against her. So, the question is, can the man enforce this agreement against the neighbor's daughter to prevent her from building the shed?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. No, because several homeowners in the subdivision have storage sheds in their yards.\n\nWell, just because other people have sheds doesn't mean that this specific agreement isn't enforceable. Maybe those other sheds were built before this agreement was made, or maybe they're not subject to the same restrictions. I don't think this is a strong reason to say the restriction isn't enforceable against the daughter.\n\nB. No, because there was no horizontal privity between the man and the neighbor.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on horizontal privity. I think it refers to a relationship between equals, like neighboring landowners. In this case, the man and the neighbor were peers, both being homeowners in the same subdivision. But I think for covenants to run with the land, there needs to be privity of estate, which is a successive relationship in ownership. Since the daughter is a successor to the neighbor's estate, maybe privity exists there. I need to think more about this.\n\nC. Yes, because the neighbor conveyed the home to the daughter by gift rather than by sale.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. Just because the house was given as a gift doesn't mean that restrictions on its use are automatically transferred. I think the nature of the conveyance might affect things, but I don't know enough about the differences between gifts and sales in this context. Maybe I should look into how covenants are enforced against successors in title, regardless of how they acquired the property.\n\nD. Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\nThis seems plausible. If the agreement was recorded and states that it's enforceable against successors, heirs, and assignees, then it should bind the daughter as the neighbor's successor. The fact that she received the house by gift shouldn't matter; the restriction should still apply to the property regardless of who owns it.\n\nLet me think about the concept of running covenants here. For a covenant to run with the land, it needs to meet certain criteria, like touching and concerning the land, and being intended to bind successors. In this case, the agreement was specifically between these two neighbors, but it was drafted to be enforceable against successors.\n\nI recall that in property law, covenants can be enforceable against successors if they are properly recorded and meet the requirements for running with the land. The recording of the agreement likely makes it binding on subsequent purchasers or transferees of the property, as long as they have notice of it.\n\nSince the agreement was recorded promptly and states that it's enforceable against successors, it seems like the man has a strong case to enforce the restriction against the daughter.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any exceptions or reasons why it might not be enforceable. The daughter claims that the restriction isn't enforceable against her. Maybe she didn't have actual knowledge of it, but since it's recorded, I think constructive notice applies, meaning she's bound by it even if she didn't know about it.\n\nAlso, the fact that other homeowners in the subdivision have sheds might suggest that this restriction isn't consistent with the general practices in the subdivision, but again, if there's a specific recorded agreement between these two properties, that might override general practices.\n\nWait, the subdivision has recorded restrictions that don't prohibit detached storage sheds, but these two neighbors agreed not to have them. So, their agreement is additional to the subdivision restrictions.\n\nI think the key here is that the agreement was recorded, which typically provides constructive notice to anyone who acquires an interest in the property. Therefore, the daughter, as the new owner, is bound by the agreement.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the correct answer is D. Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any principle that would make the restriction unenforceable against her. For example, if the agreement was personal to the original parties and not intended to bind successors, but in this case, the agreement specifically states that it's enforceable against successors.\n\nAlso, if the restriction was against the public policy or some law, but building sheds seems like a legitimate restriction concerning property use.\n\nAnother consideration could be whether the restriction is enforceable against the daughter because she received the property by gift rather than purchase. But I don't think that should matter, as the restriction is attached to the land, not to the person.\n\nSo, after thinking through these points, I'm confident that the man has the right to enjoin the neighbor's daughter from placing a detached storage shed in her yard based on the recorded agreement that binds successors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
