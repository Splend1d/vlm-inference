                    "text": "Let's see. I have this equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + 12y + 57 = -y\u00b2 - 10x. I need to find the center (a, b) and the radius r of the circle, and then find the sum a + b + r.\n\nFirst, I remember that the standard form of a circle's equation is (x - a)\u00b2 + (y - b)\u00b2 = r\u00b2, where (a, b) is the center and r is the radius.\n\nSo, I need to rewrite the given equation in that standard form.\n\nLet me start by moving all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + 10x + y\u00b2 + 12y + 57 = 0.\n\nHmm, that looks like it's almost in the standard form, but not quite.\n\nI need to complete the square for the x terms and the y terms.\n\nLet's group the x terms and the y terms together:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 10x) + (y\u00b2 + 12y) + 57 = 0.\n\nNow, for the x terms, to complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of x, which is 10, divide by 2 to get 5, and then square it to get 25. So, I'll add and subtract 25 inside the parenthesis.\n\nSimilarly, for the y terms, half of 12 is 6, and 6 squared is 36. So, add and subtract 36 inside the parenthesis.\n\nWait, but I'm dealing with an equation equal to zero, so whatever I add, I need to subtract it as well to keep the equation balanced.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 - 25) + (y\u00b2 + 12y + 36 - 36) + 57 = 0.\n\nBut actually, it's easier to just add the necessary constants to both sides to complete the square.\n\nSo, starting again:\n\nx\u00b2 + 10x + y\u00b2 + 12y = -57.\n\nNow, to complete the square for x\u00b2 + 10x, I take half of 10, which is 5, and square it to get 25. Add 25 to both sides.\n\nSimilarly, for y\u00b2 + 12y, half of 12 is 6, and 6 squared is 36. Add 36 to both sides.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 + y\u00b2 + 12y + 36 = -57 + 25 + 36.\n\nSimplify the right side: -57 + 25 = -32, and -32 + 36 = 4.\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) + (y\u00b2 + 12y + 36) = 4.\n\nBut wait, y\u00b2 + 12y + 36 is (y + 6)\u00b2, and x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 is (x + 5)\u00b2.\n\nSo, (x + 5)\u00b2 + (y + 6)\u00b2 = 4.\n\nNow, this is in the standard form of a circle's equation.\n\nComparing to (x - a)\u00b2 + (y - b)\u00b2 = r\u00b2, I can see that:\n\na = -5, b = -6, and r\u00b2 = 4, so r = 2.\n\nTherefore, a + b + r = -5 + (-6) + 2 = -9.\n\nSo, the answer should be -9.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 + 10x + y\u00b2 + 12y = -57.\n\nAdded 25 to both sides for x terms: x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 + y\u00b2 + 12y = -57 + 25 = -32.\n\nThen added 36 to both sides for y terms: x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 + y\u00b2 + 12y + 36 = -32 + 36 = 4.\n\nSo, (x + 5)\u00b2 + (y + 6)\u00b2 = 4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a = -5, b = -6, r = 2.\n\nThus, a + b + r = -5 -6 + 2 = -9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-9} \\]"
