                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nScenario 1: I said my stomach hurt because I felt like leaving work early.\n\nSo, here, the person is lying about having a stomachache to leave work early. Lying is generally considered morally wrong because it involves deceiving someone, which can erode trust and respect in relationships. In a workplace setting, honesty is particularly important because it affects the functioning and fairness of the work environment. If people start making up excuses to leave early, it could lead to inefficiencies and perhaps unfair advantages over colleagues who are honest about their needs.\n\nBut, on the other hand, maybe there are circumstances where someone might need to leave work early for a personal reason and doesn't want to disclose the actual reason. However, even in such cases, lying about being sick might still be considered wrong because it's dishonesty. Perhaps a better approach would be to ask for permission to leave early for personal matters, rather than lying about being sick.\n\nOverall, I think lying about being sick to leave work early is morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: As my parents were sleeping, I locked their gun safe.\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. So, the person is locking their parents' gun safe while they're sleeping. First off, guns and gun safety are big topics in the US, with a lot of laws and regulations around them. Gun safes are typically used to secure firearms and prevent unauthorized access, especially by children or people who shouldn't have them.\n\nBut in this scenario, the person is locking the safe while their parents are sleeping. The question is, is this action morally wrong?\n\nWell, it depends on a few things. If the person is locking the safe to prevent harm, like keeping guns out of the reach of children or intruders, then it seems like a responsible action. Safety is important, and securing guns properly is both a legal requirement in many places and a moral responsibility to ensure community safety.\n\nHowever, if the person is locking the safe to prevent their parents from accessing their guns, perhaps in a situation where there's a dispute or some conflict, then it might be seen as wrong because it's interfering with their parents' property and rights. It could be seen as a betrayal of trust or an invasive action.\n\nBut, considering that the parents are sleeping and might not be aware, it's possible that the person is doing this out of concern for safety. Maybe they're worried about accidental shootings or something like that.\n\nI think the morality here depends on the intent behind locking the safe. If it's done with malicious intent, like to prevent the parents from using their guns for self-defense, then it could be seen as wrong. But if it's done with the intent to ensure safety and prevent accidents, then it might be seen as a responsible action.\n\nGiven that, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, interfering with someone else's property without their consent, especially while they're unaware, seems morally questionable. On the other hand, if the action is aimed at enhancing safety, it might be justifiable.\n\nMaybe I should consider the potential consequences. If locking the safe prevents an accidental discharge that could harm someone, that's a positive outcome. If it prevents the parents from accessing their guns in an emergency, that could be a negative outcome.\n\nIn general, I think that tampering with someone else's property, especially without their knowledge or consent, is morally wrong. Even if the intent is good, the action itself is disrespectful of their autonomy and rights over their own belongings.\n\nSo, overall, I think locking the parents' gun safe without their knowledge or consent is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
