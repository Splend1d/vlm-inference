                    "text": "So I need to figure out the correct ratio for chest compressions and ventilations during CPR. The options are A. 2:25, B. 15:02, C. 1:05, and D. 30:02. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and it's used when someone's heart stops beating or when they're not breathing. It involves pushing on the chest (chest compressions) to help circulate blood and giving breaths (ventilations) to provide oxygen.\n\nNow, I need to recall the standard ratio for these. I think back to some first aid classes I took a while ago. I remember that there's a specific ratio recommended by health organizations like the American Heart Association.\n\nLet me consider option A: 2:25. That seems off. Doing 2 compressions for every 25 ventilations doesn't sound right. That would mean a lot more ventilations than compressions, which I don't think is the case.\n\nOption B: 15:02. This seems familiar. Maybe it's 15 compressions to 2 ventilations? Wait, I think I've heard something like that before.\n\nOption C: 1:05. That would be one compression for every five ventilations. That doesn't seem correct either. Again, that's more ventilations than compressions.\n\nOption D: 30:02. This also rings a bell. I think the current guidelines recommend 30 compressions to 2 ventilations.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that in adult CPR, the ratio was changed a few years back to emphasize more compressions and fewer interruptions for ventilations.\n\nSo, between 15:2 and 30:2, which one is more recent? I think 30:2 is the newer recommendation.\n\nI also remember that in infant and child CPR, the ratio might be different, but for adults, it's 30 compressions to 2 breaths.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try to recall if there's any variation based on the situation. For example, if the victim is drowning, might the ratio be different? I don't think so. I believe the standard ratio applies unless there are specific exceptions.\n\nAnother thing I should consider is whether the person performing CPR is trained or not. I think laypeople are often taught to do hands-only CPR, which is just compressions without ventilations, especially if they haven't been trained in giving rescue breaths. But in this case, since the question mentions both compressions and ventilations, I assume it's for someone trained in CPR.\n\nAlso, I should recall if there are any cultural or regional differences in these ratios. I don't think so; I believe the standard ratios are universal and recommended by major health organizations worldwide.\n\nLet me try to visualize the steps of CPR. First, you check for responsiveness, then call for help or have someone else call emergency services. Next, you check for breathing and pulse. If there's no breathing or no pulse, you start CPR.\n\nStarting with compressions, pushing straight down on the chest at a depth of about 2 inches for adults, at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Then, after 30 compressions, you give 2 breaths, making sure the chest rises with each breath.\n\nThis cycle repeats until help arrives or the person starts breathing on their own.\n\nWait, is there a difference between one-rescuer and two-rescuer CPR? For one rescuer, it's 30 compressions to 2 ventilations, and for two rescuers, it might be different, but I think the ratio remains the same.\n\nI think the primary answer here is D. 30:02, as it's the current standard for adult CPR.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any exception where a different ratio is used. For example, in healthcare settings with advanced equipment, might they use a different ratio? I don't think so. I believe the 30:2 ratio is standard across most scenarios.\n\nAlso, for infants and children, the ratio can be different. For infants, it's 30 compressions to 2 breaths as well, but the technique and depth of compressions differ.\n\nFor toddlers and children, it's similar to adults but adjusted for size.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify age, I'll assume it's referring to adult CPR.\n\nAnother point to consider is the importance of minimizing interruptions in compressions. I recall that each ventilation pause can reduce the effectiveness of CPR, so rapid ventilations without interrupting compressions too much are important.\n\nBut in terms of the ratio, it's still 30:2.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The correct answer should be D. 30:02.\n\nJust to confirm, I'll look back at the options:\n\nA. 2:25 \u2013 That seems like too many ventilations compared to compressions.\n\nB. 15:02 \u2013 This was a previous standard, but I believe it's been updated to 30:2.\n\nC. 1:05 \u2013 Again, more ventilations than compressions, which isn't standard.\n\nD. 30:02 \u2013 This is the current recommended ratio for adult CPR.\n\nYes, I'm confident that D. 30:02 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
