I have this statement: \"Holly loves Frances.\" And there are some symbols given: f stands for Frances, h stands for Holly, and Lxy means \"x loves y.\" So, I need to translate this sentence into predicate logic using these symbols.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the statement represents in the symbolic form. We have:\n\n- f: Frances\n\n- h: Holly\n\n- Lxy: x loves y\n\nSo, the statement \"Holly loves Frances\" should be represented in a way that shows that Holly (h) is the one who loves Frances (f).\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. hLf\n\nThis seems like it's saying that h loves f. So, Holly loves Frances. That sounds right.\n\nB. fLh\n\nThis would be Frances loves Holly. That's not what the statement says. The original statement says Holly loves Frances, not the other way around.\n\nC. Lfh\n\nThis looks like L applied to f and h. So, it might mean Frances loves Holly. Again, that's not what the statement says.\n\nD. Lhf\n\nThis would be L applied to h and f, which is Holly loves Frances. That matches the original statement.\n\nWait a minute, both options A and D seem to represent Holly loves Frances. But options B and C represent the opposite.\n\nLet me double-check the notation. In predicate logic, the order of variables in the predicate is important. So, Lxy means x loves y. Therefore, Lhf would be Holly loves Frances, which is correct.\n\nBut option A is hLf. Is that the same as Lhf? In standard predicate logic, the predicate is usually written as L(x, y), so the order is Lxy or L(x, y). So, Lhf would be L(h, f), which is Holly loves Frances.\n\nhLf seems like h loves f, which is the same as Lhf. Maybe it's just a different notation.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"L\" is being used as a prefix operator, but typically in logic, we write L(h, f) to mean Holly loves Frances.\n\nOption A writes hLf, which might be another way of writing L(h, f). Maybe the \"L\" is being used as a relation between h and f.\n\nBut in standard predicate logic, it's L(h, f), which corresponds to Lhf.\n\nOption D is Lhf, which directly corresponds to L(h, f), meaning Holly loves Frances.\n\nOption A is hLf, which might be interpreted similarly, but it's not the standard notation.\n\nSo, between A and D, D seems more standard and directly corresponds to L(h, f).\n\nOption A might be an alternative notation, but in the context provided, D seems better.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any possibility that hLf is a different interpretation? Maybe in some logical systems, hLf could be used, but in standard predicate logic, it's L(h, f), which is Lhf.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic for \"Holly loves Frances\" is Lhf, which corresponds to option D.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Lhf\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
