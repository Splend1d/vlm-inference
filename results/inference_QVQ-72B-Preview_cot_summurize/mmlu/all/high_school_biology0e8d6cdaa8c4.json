                    "text": "So I have this question about biology, and it's asking which of these options is an example of a cline. I'm a bit rusty on some of these terms, but let's see. First off, what's a cline? I think it has something to do with gradients in biology, maybe like a gradient in traits across a geographical area or something like that. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A talks about a hybrid tomato plant that's stronger and produces better fruit than the pure genotype. Hmm, that sounds like hybrid vigor or heterosis. It's about the offspring being more robust than either parent type, but I don't see a gradient or a cline here. It's more about comparing the hybrid to the pure genotypes, not about a continuous change over space.\n\nOption B mentions that there are two distinct varieties in one population of snail on an island in the Pacific Ocean. So, this seems like there might be some kind of variation within a single population, maybe due to different environments on the island. But again, a cline is more about a gradual change in a trait across a geographical area, not just having two distinct varieties coexisting in one population.\n\nOption C says that males of some species have long antlers to fight other males for females. This seems more related to sexual selection and intrasexual competition. It's about the traits that help males compete for mates, but I don't see a geographical gradient here. It's more about the traits within a species, not varying over space.\n\nOption D talks about one species of rabbit where those that evolved in the cold, snowy north are white, and those that evolved in the south are brown. This sounds interesting. It seems like there's a difference in coloration based on the environment, with white fur in snowy regions and brown fur in warmer regions. This makes sense because white fur would provide better camouflage in snow, while brown fur might blend in better with the southern environment.\n\nBut is this a cline? A cline is typically a gradient where a trait changes gradually over a geographical area, often in response to environmental gradients like temperature or precipitation. In this case, the rabbits in the north are white, and those in the south are brown, which suggests a north-to-south gradient in fur color. So, if you were to move from the north to the south, you'd see a gradual change in fur color from white to brown, which fits the definition of a cline.\n\nLet me double-check. A cline is a continuous variation in a measurable characteristic of an organism over a geographic area. So, in this case, the characteristic is fur color, and it's varying from white in the north to brown in the south. That sounds like a cline.\n\nComparing back to the other options, none of them seem to involve a geographical gradient of a trait. Option A is about hybrid vigor, option B is about two distinct varieties in one population, and option C is about sexual selection and antlers. None of these involve a continuous gradient of a trait across a geographical area.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that option D is the example of a cline. Is that correct? I think so.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
