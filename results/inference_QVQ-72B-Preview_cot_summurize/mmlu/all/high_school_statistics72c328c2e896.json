                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about investment options for a company. There are three different schemes to choose from, and I need to figure out which one they should pick based on different scenarios. Let me try to understand each option first.\n\nOption I: It's a sure $25,000 return. That means no risk, guaranteed money. That sounds pretty safe.\n\nOption II: There's a 50% chance of getting $50,000 and a 50% chance of getting $10,000. So, it's a bit risky because there's a chance of getting less than the sure thing, but there's also a chance of getting more.\n\nOption III: This one seems riskier. There's a 5% chance of getting $100,000 and a 95% chance of getting nothing. So, most of the time, you might get nothing, but there's a small chance of a big payout.\n\nAlright, so first, I should probably calculate the expected values for each option to compare them.\n\nFor Option I: It's a sure $25,000, so the expected value is $25,000.\n\nFor Option II: The expected value is (0.5 * $50,000) + (0.5 * $10,000) = $25,000 + $5,000 = $30,000.\n\nFor Option III: The expected value is (0.05 * $100,000) + (0.95 * $0) = $5,000 + $0 = $5,000.\n\nSo, in terms of expected value, Option II has the highest expected return at $30,000, followed by Option I at $25,000, and Option III at $5,000.\n\nBut expected value isn't the whole story because it doesn't account for risk or the company's specific needs. The company might have different risk tolerances or specific financial requirements, like needing a certain amount to pay off a loan.\n\nLet's look at each scenario:\n\nA. Option II if it wants to maximize expected return.\n\nWell, Option II has the highest expected return at $30,000, which is higher than Option I's $25,000 and Option III's $5,000. So, if the sole goal is to maximize expected return, then yes, Option II would be the best choice.\n\nB. Option I if it needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan.\n\nHere, the company has an urgent need for at least $20,000 to pay off a loan. Option I offers a sure $25,000, which certainly covers that need. Option II offers a 50% chance of $10,000, which is below the needed $20,000, and a 50% chance of $50,000, which would cover it. But there's a risk that they might not get enough to cover the loan. Option III has a 95% chance of getting nothing, which is risky for sure, and a 5% chance of $100,000, which would cover the loan, but that's a big gamble.\n\nSo, if the company needs to be certain to have at least $20,000, Option I is the safest bet because it's guaranteed $25,000. Taking Option II would mean risking not having enough to cover the loan, which could be problematic if they end up with only $10,000. So, yes, Option I would be the best choice in this scenario.\n\nC. Option III if it needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan.\n\nIn this case, the company needs at least $80,000. Let's see what each option offers.\n\nOption I: $25,000, which is way below $80,000.\n\nOption II: 50% chance of $50,000 and 50% chance of $10,000. Even the higher amount ($50,000) is still below $80,000.\n\nOption III: 5% chance of $100,000 and 95% chance of nothing. Here, there's a small chance of getting $100,000, which is above $80,000, but a much higher chance of getting nothing.\n\nSo, if the company absolutely needs at least $80,000, Option III offers the only possibility of achieving that, albeit with a very low probability. However, it's important to note that there's a 95% chance of getting nothing, which could be disastrous if the company doesn't have other means to cover the loan.\n\nTherefore, choosing Option III in this scenario is a high-risk strategy, betting on the slim chance of getting $100,000. If the company has no other options and is willing to take that risk, then yes, Option III could be considered.\n\nBut, in a more practical sense, if the company needs $80,000 urgently, relying on a 5% chance of getting $100,000 might not be the wisest decision, as they would likely need the funds immediately.\n\nD. All of the above answers are correct.\n\nGiven the above analysis, it seems that each scenario makes sense in its own context:\n\n- If maximizing expected return is the goal, choose Option II.\n\n- If needing a guaranteed $20,000 to pay off a loan, choose Option I.\n\n- If needing at least $80,000 and willing to take a high risk, choose Option III.\n\nTherefore, all three statements A, B, and C are correct in their respective contexts, making D the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"Which option should the company choose?\" and then provides four options, A through D. Based on my analysis, D seems to be the correct answer because all three scenarios A, B, and C are valid under certain conditions.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's more to consider. Maybe there's a better way to look at this.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn scenario A, choosing Option II to maximize expected return makes sense because it has the highest expected value.\n\nIn scenario B, choosing Option I to ensure at least $20,000 for the loan is also logical because it's guaranteed.\n\nIn scenario C, choosing Option III to have a chance at $100,000 when needing $80,000 seems risky but is the only option that offers a possibility of reaching that amount.\n\nSo, in each scenario, the suggested option aligns with the company's objective.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: All of the above answers are correct.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps one of the scenarios isn't as straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check scenario C.\n\nIf the company needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan, and the only option that offers a possibility of that much is Option III, then yes, in that specific context, choosing Option III might be considered, despite the high risk.\n\nHowever, in reality, if the company needs the money urgently and can't afford to take the risk of getting nothing, perhaps there are better alternatives they haven't considered, like borrowing from elsewhere or negotiating terms with the lender.\n\nBut based on the information given, and assuming no other options are available, choosing Option III would be the only way they could potentially get $100,000, which is above their required $80,000.\n\nSo, in that sense, statement C is correct.\n\nTherefore, all three statements A, B, and C are correct, making D the right answer.\n\nI think that's the way to look at it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
