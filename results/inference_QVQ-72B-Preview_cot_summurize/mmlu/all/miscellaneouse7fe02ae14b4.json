Primary economic activity\n\nB. Global division of labor\n\nC. Intervening opportunity\n\nD. Global-local continuum\"\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to understand what this question is getting at. It's about footwear companies from rich countries like the US and Europe using cheap labor in Asian countries. So, what does that represent in economic terms?\n\nFirst, let's look at option A: primary economic activity. I think primary economic activities are things like agriculture, mining, fishing, that kind of stuff. Footwear manufacturing seems more like manufacturing, which is usually considered secondary economic activity. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B: global division of labor. I've heard of the division of labor; it's when different people or countries specialize in doing different tasks or producing different goods. Global division of labor would mean that this specialization happens on a worldwide scale. So, footwear companies based in the US or Europe might specialize in design and marketing, while the actual manufacturing is done in countries with cheaper labor costs, like some Asian countries. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption C: intervening opportunity. I'm not sure about this one. It sounds like it might have something to do with migration or something, but I'm not certain. Maybe it's not directly related to this scenario of manufacturing footwear in Asia for cost reasons.\n\nOption D: global-local continuum. This sounds a bit vague to me. A continuum suggests a spectrum between global and local, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Maybe it's about balancing global production with local needs or something, but I need to think more about it.\n\nLet me consider this again. The question is about footwear companies using inexpensive labor in Asian countries. This seems very much like a global division of labor, where different parts of the production process are located in different countries based on where they can be done most efficiently or cost-effectively.\n\nI think global division of labor is the best fit here. It encompasses the idea that companies are distributing their production activities across different countries to take advantage of lower labor costs in certain regions.\n\nPrimary economic activity doesn't fit because manufacturing is generally considered secondary economic activity.\n\nIntervening opportunity seems unrelated to the context of production and more related to migration or something else.\n\nGlobal-local continuum is too vague and doesn't directly address the specific scenario presented.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. Global division of labor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
