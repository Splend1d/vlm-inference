                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about a company transitioning to IFRS reporting. The company's first IFRS reporting period is for the year ended December 31, year 2. During the preparation of the year 2 statement of financial position, management found that a $90,000 loss accrual wasn't recorded. Out of this, $40,000 relates to an event in year 1 and $50,000 relates to an event in year 2.\n\nThe question is asking for the amount of loss accrual that should be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position. The options are $0, $40,000, $50,000, or $90,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what IFRS requires when a company first adopts IFRS. I recall that when a company first applies IFRS, it has to prepare its opening statement of financial position as per IFRS, which is usually one year before the first IFRS income statement.\n\nIn this case, the first IFRS reporting period is year 2, so the opening statement of financial position would be as of December 31, year 1.\n\nNow, they've identified an error in year 2 where a $90,000 loss accrual wasn't recorded. This loss accrual relates to events in year 1 and year 2, with $40,000 from year 1 and $50,000 from year 2.\n\nI need to determine how much of this should be reflected in the year 1 statement of financial position.\n\nI think I should consider this in the context of retrospective application and adjustments under IFRS.\n\nWhen a company first adopts IFRS, it should apply IFRS requirements retrospectively, meaning it should adjust the opening statement of financial position for all cumulative effects of applying IFRS as of the date of transition.\n\nIn this scenario, the transition date is December 31, year 1.\n\nThe error found in year 2 is that a $90,000 loss accrual wasn't recorded. Out of this, $40,000 relates to year 1 and $50,000 to year 2.\n\nSince the error was discovered in year 2, and it pertains to both year 1 and year 2, I need to see how this affects the opening statement of financial position as of December 31, year 1.\n\nMy understanding is that for the opening statement of financial position, only the amounts that relate to year 1 should be adjusted, because year 1 is prior to the transition to IFRS.\n\nWait, but actually, since the transition date is December 31, year 1, and the company is preparing its first IFRS statements for year 2, the opening statement of financial position is as of December 31, year 1.\n\nAny errors relating to year 1 should be corrected in the opening statement of financial position.\n\nSo, the $40,000 loss accrual that relates to year 1 should be recognized in the opening statement of financial position as of December 31, year 1.\n\nBut what about the $50,000 that relates to year 2? Should that also be included in the opening statement of financial position?\n\nI think not, because the year 2 events haven't occurred yet as of December 31, year 1. So, the $50,000 loss accrual is related to events that happened in year 2, which is after the transition date.\n\nTherefore, only the $40,000 relating to year 1 should be included in the opening statement of financial position as of December 31, year 1.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm this. Maybe I should look at some IFRS standards to be sure.\n\nLooking at IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, it states that when a company first adopts IFRS, it should apply IFRS requirements retrospectively, meaning it should adjust the opening statement of financial position for all cumulative effects of applying IFRS as of the date of transition.\n\nIn this case, the transition date is December 31, year 1.\n\nSo, any errors or omissions that relate to periods before the transition date should be corrected in the opening statement of financial position.\n\nThe $40,000 loss accrual relates to year 1, which is before the transition date, so it should be included in the opening statement of financial position.\n\nThe $50,000 relates to year 2, which is after the transition date, so it shouldn't be included in the opening statement of financial position.\n\nTherefore, the company should report $40,000 as the loss accrual in its December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the entire $90,000 should be included because it's an error that was discovered in year 2.\n\nBut no, I think the key is to distinguish between errors relating to periods before and after the transition date.\n\nSince the transition date is December 31, year 1, anything before that should be corrected in the opening statement of financial position, and anything after should be recognized in the period they relate to.\n\nSo, in this case, $40,000 relates to year 1, which is before the transition date, so it should be included in the opening statement of financial position.\n\nThe $50,000 relates to year 2, which is after the transition date, so it should be recognized in year 2's income statement or statement of financial position, as appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. $40,000.\n\nLet me just double-check. If I choose option B, which is $40,000, that aligns with the portion of the loss accrual that relates to year 1, which is before the transition to IFRS.\n\nOption A, $0, seems incorrect because there is an identified error that needs to be corrected.\n\nOption C, $50,000, relates to year 2, which is after the transition date, so that shouldn't be included in the opening statement of financial position.\n\nOption D, $90,000, would include both year 1 and year 2 amounts, but since only the year 1 amount should be in the opening statement of financial position, $90,000 seems too high.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the correct answer is B. $40,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
