On May 1, he telephoned a number of contractors whom he had dealt with in the past and asked them to submit bids to build the homes. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. He notified each subcontractor that he intended to use their bids in submitting a general bid to the developer. A plumber submitted a bid to the contractor in the amount of $50,000, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the developer. On June 1, the contractor submitted a bid to the developer in which he offered to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. On June 4, the plumber notified the contractor that he had overbooked his crews and could not possibly do the work on the developer's job. On June 5, the developer sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein he stated, \"I hereby accept your offer to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. ', Thereafter, the contractor hired another plumber to complete the plumbing work at a cost of $60,000. The contractor then explained the situation to the developer and requested that the overall cost of the job be increased to $510,000. The developer refused on the grounds that he had a contract for $500,000 and that this was the contractor's problem. The contractor then built the 10 tract homes, and the developer sent him a check for $500,000. Which of the following best supports a claim for $10,000 by the contractor against the plumber who refused to do the work?\n\nA. The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\nB. The plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.\nC. The contractor made an offer to the plumber that the plumber accepted when he submitted his bid.\nD. An option contract was created, because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a developer, a contractor, and a plumber. The developer wants to build 10 tract homes and asks several contractors to submit bids. One of these contractors gets bids from subcontractors, including a plumber, to figure out his overall bid. The plumber bids $50,000 for the plumbing work, and the contractor uses this in his calculation to submit a total bid of $500,000 to the developer. The developer accepts the bid on June 5th, but before that, on June 4th, the plumber backs out, saying he's overbooked. The contractor has to find another plumber for $60,000, so he ends up spending $10,000 more. Now, the contractor wants to claim that $10,000 from the original plumber. The question is asking which option best supports this claim.\n\nLet me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the contractor asks the plumber for a bid, and the plumber provides $50,000. The contractor relies on this bid to calculate his own bid to the developer, which is $500,000. The developer accepts this bid on June 5th. But on June 4th, the plumber says he can't do the job because he's overbooked. As a result, the contractor has to find another plumber for $60,000, incurring an extra cost of $10,000.\n\nNow, the contractor wants to recover this $10,000 from the original plumber. The question provides four options, and I need to determine which one best supports the contractor's claim.\n\nOption A says that the plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing his bid to the developer.\n\nOption B says that the plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that couldn't be revoked because both are merchants.\n\nOption C says that the contractor made an offer to the plumber, which the plumber accepted by submitting his bid.\n\nOption D says that an option contract was created because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing his bid to the developer.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, let's consider what constitutes an offer and an acceptance in contract law.\n\nAn offer is when one party (the offeror) proposes certain terms to another party (the offeree), and acceptance is when the offeree agrees to those terms, creating a binding contract.\n\nIn this case, it seems like there are multiple layers of offers and acceptances.\n\nFirst, the plumber provides a bid of $50,000 to the contractor. Is this a firm offer? Well, typically, a bid can be considered an offer to perform work at a specified price.\n\nThe contractor then uses this bid to calculate his own bid to the developer. So, the contractor is relying on the plumber's bid to secure his own contract with the developer.\n\nWhen the developer accepts the contractor's bid on June 5th, that creates a binding contract between the developer and the contractor for $500,000.\n\nHowever, before that acceptance, on June 4th, the plumber backs out, saying he's overbooked.\n\nNow, the contractor has to find another plumber for $60,000, incurring an extra cost of $10,000.\n\nThe question is, can the contractor hold the original plumber responsible for this $10,000?\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A: The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing his bid to the developer.\n\nWell, the plumber submitted a bid of $50,000, which can be seen as an offer to perform the plumbing work for that price. The contractor used this bid to calculate his own bid, which suggests that he accepted the plumber's offer.\n\nHowever, did the contractor explicitly accept the plumber's offer? It seems that the acceptance was implied by using the bid in the larger bid process.\n\nBut, in general, acceptance needs to be communicated to the offeror. Did the contractor communicate acceptance to the plumber before the plumber backed out?\n\nThe scenario doesn't specify that the contractor told the plumber that his bid was accepted. The contractor just used the bid in his own calculation.\n\nSo, maybe there wasn't a formal acceptance before the plumber revoked his offer.\n\nWait, but the plumber submitted his bid with the understanding that it would be used in the general bid to the developer.\n\nDoes that change things?\n\nOption B: The plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that couldn't be revoked because both are merchants.\n\nIn contract law, under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a written offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods can be a \"firm offer\" that is irrevocable for a stated period or a reasonable time if assurance is given that it will be held open.\n\nBut in this case, it's not clear if the plumber's bid was in writing or if there was any assurance that it would be held open.\n\nAlso, both parties are merchants, as they are involved in construction and contracting.\n\nIf the plumber's bid was a firm offer, then the plumber couldn't revoke it within the specified time or a reasonable time period.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify if the bid was in writing or if there was any agreement about holding the bid open.\n\nOption C: The contractor made an offer to the plumber, which the plumber accepted by submitting his bid.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing.\n\nTypically, the plumber submits a bid (offer) to the contractor, and the contractor accepts or not.\n\nBut in this option, it's suggesting that the contractor made an offer to the plumber, and the plumber accepted it by submitting his bid.\n\nThat doesn't seem right. The plumber is the one making the offer to perform the work at a certain price, not the other way around.\n\nOption D: An option contract was created because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing his bid to the developer.\n\nAn option contract is when one party pays consideration to keep an offer open for a certain period.\n\nIn this case, did the contractor pay any consideration to the plumber to keep the bid open?\n\nThe scenario doesn't mention any payment for keeping the bid open.\n\nHowever, it says that the plumber submitted his bid with the knowledge that it would be used in the general bid to the developer.\n\nMaybe the plumber's knowledge and consent to use the bid in the larger bid process implies some sort of option contract.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the key here is that the contractor relied on the plumber's bid to secure his own contract with the developer.\n\nWhen the plumber backed out, the contractor suffered a loss by having to pay $10,000 more for another plumber.\n\nIn law, there's a concept called promissory estoppel, where if someone makes a promise that the other party relies on to their detriment, the promisor may be held liable for the reliance damages.\n\nIn this case, the plumber made a bid (a promise to perform work for $50,000), and the contractor relied on that bid to secure a larger contract.\n\nWhen the plumber backed out, the contractor suffered a $10,000 loss.\n\nSo, perhaps the contractor can claim that the plumber is liable for the $10,000 based on promissory estoppel.\n\nBut none of the options mention promissory estoppel.\n\nOption B mentions the firm offer concept under the UCC.\n\nIf the plumber's bid was a firm offer, then the plumber couldn't revoke it within the specified time or a reasonable time.\n\nGiven that, if the bid was irrevocable, then the plumber's revocation before the developer accepted the contractor's bid might still be invalid if the time period hadn't expired.\n\nBut the developer accepted on June 5th, after the plumber backed out on June 4th.\n\nSo, even if the bid was irrevocable for a certain period, if that period hadn't expired by June 4th, the plumber's revocation would be invalid, and the contractor could enforce the original bid.\n\nBut again, the scenario doesn't specify the terms of the bid regarding revocability.\n\nOption D mentions an option contract.\n\nAn option contract is created when the offeree pays consideration to keep the offer open.\n\nDid the contractor pay anything to the plumber to keep the bid open? The scenario doesn't say so.\n\nHowever, perhaps the contractor's reliance in submitting his own bid could be considered consideration for keeping the plumber's bid open.\n\nBut that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the plumber, knowing that his bid would be used in the general bid, implicitly agreed to keep his bid open until the developer made a decision.\n\nBut again, without explicit terms, it's unclear.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that the contractor accepted the plumber's offer by using it in his own bid.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, acceptance typically needs to be communicated to the offeror.\n\nDid the contractor communicate acceptance to the plumber before the plumber revoked his offer?\n\nThe scenario doesn't say.\n\nIf not, then the acceptance may not be valid, and the plumber could revoke his offer before acceptance.\n\nOption C seems misstated because it suggests that the contractor made an offer to the plumber, which isn't the typical scenario.\n\nSo, perhaps Option B is the best choice.\n\nIf the plumber's bid was a firm offer because both are merchants, then the plumber couldn't revoke it within the specified time or a reasonable time.\n\nIf the developer's acceptance on June 5th was within that period, then the plumber's revocation on June 4th would be invalid, and the contractor could enforce the original bid.\n\nTherefore, the contractor could hold the plumber liable for the $10,000 difference.\n\nSo, Option B seems to be the best support for the contractor's claim against the plumber.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
