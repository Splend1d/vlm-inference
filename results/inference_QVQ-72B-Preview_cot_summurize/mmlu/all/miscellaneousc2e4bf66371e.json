                    "text": "So I need to figure out how much highway gas mileage decreases in heavy rain. The options are about 0.1%, 2%, 10%, or 50%. Hmm, let's think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that weather conditions can affect fuel efficiency, especially when driving on highways. Things like wind resistance and road conditions play a role in how much gas a vehicle uses. But specifically for heavy rain, what factors come into play?\n\nWell, heavy rain can make the road surface wet, which might affect tire traction and increase rolling resistance. That could lead to higher fuel consumption because the engine has to work harder to maintain speed. Also, if visibility is reduced, drivers might have to slow down or use their lights, which could also impact fuel efficiency.\n\nBut how significant is this effect? I need to estimate the percentage decrease in gas mileage.\n\nLet me consider some data or studies that might have looked into this. I recall that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides fuel economy estimates under standard conditions, but real-world conditions can vary. Maybe there are studies or reports from automotive organizations that look at the impact of weather on fuel efficiency.\n\nA quick search in my mind brings up something about wet roads reducing fuel economy by a certain percentage, but I can't remember the exact number. I think it's around 10%, but I'm not sure if that's for light rain or heavy rain.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. If heavy rain significantly affects driving conditions, perhaps the decrease in gas mileage is substantial, like 50%. But that seems pretty high to me. I can't imagine that driving in heavy rain would cut my gas mileage in half.\n\nOn the other hand, if the decrease is minimal, say 0.1%, that might not make much sense either, because even light rain should have some noticeable effect.\n\nLet me try to reason through this. Suppose I'm driving on a highway at a steady speed, say 70 mph. In heavy rain, the engine might need to produce more power to maintain that speed due to increased resistance from the wet road and possibly from the air (if there's wind associated with the rain).\n\nI need to find out what percentage this additional power requirement represents in terms of fuel efficiency.\n\nI found a study once that said driving on wet roads could decrease fuel economy by about 10% compared to dry conditions. Another source mentioned that for every 10% increase in rolling resistance, fuel consumption increases by about 1%. But heavy rain might cause a higher increase in rolling resistance.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the coefficient of rolling resistance. In dry conditions, it's lower, and in wet conditions, it increases. This increase in rolling resistance requires more energy from the engine to overcome, leading to poorer fuel economy.\n\nI think the answer is around 10%. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nIf heavy rain increases rolling resistance by, say, 30%, then the fuel consumption would increase by roughly 3% (since 30% increase in rolling resistance corresponds to about 3% increase in fuel consumption). But that seems lower than I initially thought.\n\nAlternatively, I read that driving on snow-covered roads can decrease fuel economy by up to 25%, but that's for snow, not heavy rain. So maybe heavy rain has a smaller impact.\n\nPerhaps heavy rain decreases gas mileage by about 5%. But that's still less than 10%.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the aerodynamic drag as well. Raindrops can affect the airflow around the vehicle, potentially increasing drag and thus reducing fuel efficiency.\n\nBut I think the primary factor is the increased rolling resistance due to the wet road surface.\n\nLet me try to eliminate some options.\n\nOption A is 0.1%, which seems too small. Even light rain should have a noticeable effect, so 0.1% doesn't seem substantial enough.\n\nOption B is 2%. That might be possible, but I think heavy rain has a larger impact than that.\n\nOption C is 10%, which seems plausible based on what I recall from studies.\n\nOption D is 50%, which seems excessively high for heavy rain alone.\n\nBetween options B and C, I'm leaning towards C, 10%. It just seems like a more reasonable estimate for the decrease in gas mileage during heavy rain on a highway.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the following: if a car gets 30 miles per gallon (mpg) in dry conditions, what would it get in heavy rain according to each option?\n\nOption A: 30 - 0.1% of 30 = 30 - 0.03 = 29.97 mpg\n\nOption B: 30 - 2% of 30 = 30 - 0.6 = 29.4 mpg\n\nOption C: 30 - 10% of 30 = 30 - 3 = 27 mpg\n\nOption D: 30 - 50% of 30 = 30 - 15 = 15 mpg\n\nSo, in heavy rain, would gas mileage drop from 30 mpg to 15 mpg? That seems too drastic. From 30 mpg to 27 mpg seems more reasonable, which aligns with option C, 10%.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that heavy rain might cause a 5% decrease, that would be 30 - 1.5 = 28.5 mpg, which is between options B and C.\n\nBut I still think 10% is a better estimate.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I should look at the energy required to move the vehicle under different conditions. The energy output of the engine needed to overcome rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag would correspond to the fuel consumed.\n\nIf heavy rain increases rolling resistance by a certain percentage, and that leads to a corresponding increase in fuel consumption, then I need to find out what that percentage is.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is probably expecting a general answer, and based on my earlier thoughts, 10% seems like a reasonable estimate for the decrease in gas mileage during heavy rain on a highway.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option C, about 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
