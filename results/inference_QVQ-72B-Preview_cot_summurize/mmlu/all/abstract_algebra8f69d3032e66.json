                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about group theory, and I need to determine whether each statement is true or false. Let's tackle them one at a time.\n\nFirst statement: \"Every group of order 159 is cyclic.\"\n\nOkay, so to evaluate this, I need to recall some facts about groups and their orders. The order of a group is the number of its elements, and a cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element.\n\nSo, why would every group of order 159 be cyclic? Well, I remember that if the order of a group is a prime number, then it's cyclic. But 159 isn't a prime number. Let's factorize 159 to see its prime factors.\n\n159 divided by 3 is 53. So, 159 = 3 \u00d7 53. Both 3 and 53 are prime numbers.\n\nNow, I recall that for groups of certain orders, we can determine if they are cyclic based on their prime factors. There's a theorem that says if the order of a group is pq, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, and p does not divide (q - 1), then any group of order pq is cyclic.\n\nLet's apply this to 159. Here, p = 3 and q = 53.\n\nFirst, check if 3 divides (53 - 1) = 52.\n\n52 divided by 3 is 17 with a remainder of 1, so 3 does not divide 52.\n\nTherefore, according to this theorem, every group of order 159 should be cyclic.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check this. Is there another way to confirm this?\n\nI know that in group theory, the structure of a group of a given order can be determined using Sylow theorems. Maybe I can use that approach.\n\nThe Sylow theorems deal with subgroups of prime power order. For a group of order 159, which is 3 \u00d7 53, both 3 and 53 are prime.\n\nAccording to Sylow's first theorem, there exist Sylow p-subgroups for each prime p dividing the group order.\n\nSo, there's a Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 53-subgroup.\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, satisfies n_3 \u2261 1 mod 3 and n_3 divides 53. The divisors of 53 are 1 and 53. So, n_3 can be 1 or 53.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 53-subgroups, n_53, satisfies n_53 \u2261 1 mod 53 and n_53 divides 3. The divisors of 3 are 1 and 3. So, n_53 can be 1 or 3.\n\nIf n_3 = 1, then there's a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal.\n\nIf n_53 = 1, then there's a unique Sylow 53-subgroup, which is also normal.\n\nIf both are normal and their orders are 3 and 53, and since 3 and 53 are coprime, their product is 159, so the group is the direct product of these two cyclic groups, which would make the group cyclic.\n\nIf n_3 = 53, that means there are 53 Sylow 3-subgroups, which seems unlikely, but I need to check.\n\nSimilarly, if n_53 = 3, there are 3 Sylow 53-subgroups.\n\nBut in this case, since 53 is much larger than 3, n_53 = 3 seems more plausible than n_53 = 1.\n\nWait, but 53 is a prime, and 3 does not divide 53 - 1 = 52, so by Sylow's theorems, n_53 should be 1, meaning there's a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 53-subgroup.\n\nSimilarly, for n_3, since 53 does divide 3 - 1 = 2, which doesn't make sense because 53 doesn't divide 2. Wait, 3 - 1 is 2, and 53 doesn't divide 2, so n_3 should be 1, meaning there's a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nTherefore, both Sylow subgroups are normal, and their product gives the whole group, which would make the group cyclic.\n\nSo, this confirms that every group of order 159 is cyclic.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any non-cyclic groups of order 159.\n\nSuppose there exists a non-cyclic group of order 159. Then, it wouldn't have a unique subgroup of order 53 or order 3, which contradicts what I just found using Sylow's theorems.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for a group of order 159 to be non-cyclic.\n\nSo, statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to statement 2: \"Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\"\n\nFirst, let's factorize 102.\n\n102 divided by 2 is 51, so 102 = 2 \u00d7 51.\n\n51 is 3 \u00d7 17.\n\nSo, 102 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 17.\n\nAll these are distinct prime factors.\n\nThe statement claims that any group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nA nontrivial proper normal subgroup means a normal subgroup that is not the whole group or the trivial group.\n\nSo, does every group of order 102 have such a subgroup?\n\nI can think about the Sylow theorems again.\n\nThe Sylow subgroups for order 102 are:\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroup: order 2\n\n- Sylow 3-subgroup: order 3\n\n- Sylow 17-subgroup: order 17\n\nLet's find the number of each type.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups:\n\nn_2 \u2261 1 mod 2 and n_2 divides 51 (since 102 / 2 = 51).\n\nDivisors of 51 are 1, 3, 17, 51.\n\nSo, n_2 can be 1, 3, 17, or 51.\n\nSimilarly, for Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\nn_3 \u2261 1 mod 3 and n_3 divides 34 (102 / 3 = 34).\n\nDivisors of 34 are 1, 2, 17, 34.\n\nSo, n_3 can be 1 or 34.\n\nFor Sylow 17-subgroups:\n\nn_{17} \u2261 1 mod 17 and n_{17} divides 6 (102 / 17 = 6).\n\nDivisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nSo, n_{17} can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, to have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, we need at least one of these Sylow subgroups to be normal, i.e., n_p = 1 for some prime p.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf n_2 = 1, then the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal.\n\nIf n_3 = 1, then the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.\n\nIf n_{17} = 1, then the Sylow 17-subgroup is normal.\n\nIf any of these is true, then there exists a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nSo, the question reduces to whether at least one of these n_p equals 1 for some p.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities.\n\nFirst, consider n_{17}.\n\nn_{17} \u2261 1 mod 17 and n_{17} divides 6.\n\nPossible values are 1 and 6.\n\nIf n_{17} = 1, then the Sylow 17-subgroup is normal.\n\nSimilarly, n_3 \u2261 1 mod 3 and divides 34.\n\nPossible values are 1 and 34.\n\nIf n_3 = 1, then the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.\n\nn_2 \u2261 1 mod 2 and divides 51.\n\nPossible values are 1, 3, 17, 51.\n\nIf n_2 = 1, then the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal.\n\nSo, in each case, if n_p = 1 for any p, we have a normal Sylow subgroup.\n\nNow, is it possible that none of these n_p equals 1?\n\nThat is, n_2 \u2260 1, n_3 \u2260 1, and n_{17} \u2260 1.\n\nWhich would mean n_2 = 3, 17, or 51; n_3 = 34; and n_{17} = 6.\n\nBut having n_3 = 34 seems problematic because 34 is larger than the index, but actually, n_p can be equal to the index divided by p to the power of something, but I need to recall the exact conditions.\n\nWait, actually, n_p must divide the index, which is 102 / p, and n_p \u2261 1 mod p.\n\nSo, in this case, n_3 must divide 34 and n_3 \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\n34 divided by 3 is 11 with a remainder of 1, so 34 \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nTherefore, n_3 can be 1 or 34.\n\nSimilarly, n_{17} must divide 6 and n_{17} \u2261 1 mod 17.\n\n6 divided by 17 is 0 with a remainder of 6, so 6 \u2261 6 mod 17.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, 17 divides 17, and 6 divided by 17 is 0 with a remainder of 6, but 17 doesn't divide 6.\n\nSo, n_{17} can be 1 or 6.\n\nSimilarly, n_2 must divide 51 and n_2 \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\n51 divided by 2 is 25 with a remainder of 1, so n_2 can be 1, 3, 17, or 51.\n\nNow, suppose n_2 = 3, n_3 = 34, and n_{17} = 6.\n\nIn this case, none of the Sylow subgroups are normal.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nIf so, then there would be no nontrivial proper normal subgroup, which would contradict the statement.\n\nTherefore, I need to check if such a configuration is possible.\n\nLet's think about the number of elements.\n\nOrder of the group is 102.\n\nNumber of elements of order 2: since n_2 = 3, each Sylow 2-subgroup has order 2, and they are all distinct, so there are 3 \u00d7 (2 - 1) = 3 elements of order 2.\n\nSimilarly, number of elements of order 3: n_3 = 34, each Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3, so 34 \u00d7 (3 - 1) = 68 elements of order 3.\n\nNumber of elements of order 17: n_{17} = 6, each Sylow 17-subgroup has order 17, so 6 \u00d7 (17 - 1) = 96 elements of order 17.\n\nNow, total elements accounted for: 3 + 68 + 96 = 167, which is way more than 102.\n\nThis is impossible because the group only has 102 elements.\n\nTherefore, this configuration cannot exist.\n\nSo, it must be that at least one of the n_p equals 1.\n\nTherefore, every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nHence, statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, both statements are true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
