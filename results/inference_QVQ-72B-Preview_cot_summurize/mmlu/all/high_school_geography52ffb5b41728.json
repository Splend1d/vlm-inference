                    "text": "So I've got this question here about African cities, and I need to pick which statement is characteristic of most of them. Let me see what the options are:\n\nA. They have thriving, clean residential areas.\n\nB. There are jobs for most rural-to-urban migrants.\n\nC. They have three separate business districts.\n\nD. They have a well-developed infrastructure.\n\nHmm, I'm not an expert on African cities, but I'll try to think about what I know. I should probably eliminate the options that don't seem to fit.\n\nStarting with option A: thriving, clean residential areas. While I hope this is true, I recall that many African cities have areas of poverty and overcrowding due to rapid urbanization. So, maybe not all residential areas are thriving and clean.\n\nOption B: there are jobs for most rural-to-urban migrants. I think a lot of people move to cities in search of better opportunities, but I'm not sure if there are enough jobs for everyone. Maybe in some cities, but not necessarily in most.\n\nOption C: they have three separate business districts. This seems specific. I don't know much about the layout of African cities, but having three separate business districts sounds organized and planned. Maybe some cities do, but I doubt it's a characteristic of most.\n\nOption D: they have a well-developed infrastructure. Infrastructure is important for city functioning, but I think many African cities struggle with infrastructure development due to fast population growth.\n\nHmm, none of these seem perfectly fitting. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps I should consider the common challenges faced by African cities.\n\nI know that African urbanization is happening at a rapid pace. A lot of people are moving from rural areas to cities, which can lead to issues like slums, inadequate housing, and infrastructure not keeping up with the population growth.\n\nGiven that, option A might not be accurate because not all residential areas are thriving and clean, especially in areas where migrants settle without proper planning.\n\nOption B suggests there are jobs for most migrants, but I suspect that employment opportunities might not keep pace with the number of people moving to the cities. Unemployment and underemployment are likely issues in many African cities.\n\nOption C seems unusual. Having three separate business districts might be a feature of some planned cities, but I don't think it's a general characteristic of most African cities.\n\nOption D: well-developed infrastructure. Again, considering the rapid urbanization, infrastructure might not be adequately developed to handle the growing populations.\n\nSo, if I had to choose one that is least characteristic of most African cities, I might go with option C, having three separate business districts. It just seems too specific and not something that applies to most cities on the continent.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look at it differently. Perhaps one of these options is more accurate than the others.\n\nLet me consider what I know about cities in general. In many growing cities around the world, including in Africa, one common issue is the lack of sufficient infrastructure to support the increasing population. This can lead to problems like inadequate housing, traffic congestion, and insufficient public services.\n\nGiven that, option D seems like it might not be characteristic of most African cities, as infrastructure development often lags behind population growth.\n\nOption A, thriving and clean residential areas, might not hold true for all parts of African cities, especially the informal settlements or slums that often develop where migrants live.\n\nOption B, jobs for most rural-to-urban migrants, might also not be the case, as unemployment is a significant issue in many African countries.\n\nOption C, three separate business districts, seems like an unusual characteristic and not something that would apply to most African cities.\n\nSo, between options, I'm leaning towards option C as being the least characteristic of most African cities.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to trick me. Perhaps option C is actually a common feature in African cities, and I'm misjudging it.\n\nLet me think about some specific African cities. For example, Lagos in Nigeria is a massive city with a complex structure. Does it have three separate business districts? I don't know. Maybe it does, but I doubt that this is a universal characteristic across most African cities.\n\nWhat about Cairo in Egypt? It's another large city. Again, I don't know if it has three business districts.\n\nHow about smaller African cities? I can't imagine they would have three separate business districts.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing knowledge about the urban planning of African cities, and three separate business districts is a common feature due to historical or cultural reasons.\n\nBut I really don't know, and I'm starting to think that maybe option C is not the best choice.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe I should look for the statement that is most likely to be true.\n\nOption A: thriving, clean residential areas. While some areas in African cities are well-maintained, many face challenges like overcrowding and poor sanitation.\n\nOption B: jobs for most rural-to-urban migrants. Employment opportunities vary, but generally, there might not be enough jobs to go around.\n\nOption D: well-developed infrastructure. Given the rapid urbanization, infrastructure often struggles to keep up.\n\nSo, by elimination, option C seems the least plausible, but I'm still unsure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that some African cities do have multiple business districts due to expansion or colonial planning, but again, I don't think it's a characteristic of most African cities.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is option D: they have a well-developed infrastructure. Even if infrastructure is challenged by rapid growth, maybe in relative terms, African cities have developed infrastructure compared to rural areas.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch. I think I'll stick with option C: they have three separate business districts, as it's the least likely to be a general characteristic of most African cities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
