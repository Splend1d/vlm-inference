                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Wayne and Kristen who have different opinions on what constitutes a vowel in the English alphabet. Wayne thinks \"Y\" is a vowel, while Kristen doesn't. We need to find out by what percent the probability of selecting a vowel from the 26 letters is greater according to Wayne compared to Kristen.\n\nFirst, let's understand what they both think:\n\n1. **Wayne's View:**\n   - He considers \"Y\" as a vowel.\n   - So, the vowels according to Wayne are A, E, I, O, U, and Y. That's 6 vowels.\n   - The total number of letters in the alphabet is 26.\n   - Therefore, the probability of selecting a vowel according to Wayne is \\(\\frac{6}{26}\\).\n\n2. **Kristen's View:**\n   - She doesn't consider \"Y\" as a vowel; she only has 5 vowels: A, E, I, O, U.\n   - So, the number of vowels is 5.\n   - The total number of letters is still 26.\n   - Therefore, the probability of selecting a vowel according to Kristen is \\(\\frac{5}{26}\\).\n\nNow, we need to find out by what percent Wayne's probability is greater than Kristen's.\n\nTo do this, we can calculate the difference between Wayne's and Kristen's probabilities and then find out what percentage this difference is of Kristen's probability.\n\nLet's compute it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate Wayne's probability:**\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{Wayne}} = \\frac{6}{26} = \\frac{3}{13} \\approx 0.2308\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Kristen's probability:**\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{Kristen}} = \\frac{5}{26} \\approx 0.1923\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the difference between Wayne's and Kristen's probabilities:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = P_{\\text{Wayne}} - P_{\\text{Kristen}} = \\frac{3}{13} - \\frac{5}{26} = \\frac{6}{26} - \\frac{5}{26} = \\frac{1}{26} \\approx 0.0385\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the percentage increase from Kristen's probability to Wayne's probability:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Difference}}{P_{\\text{Kristen}}} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{1/26}{5/26} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\n   \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming Wayne's probability:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{26} = \\frac{3}{13} \\approx 0.2308\n\\]\nThat's correct.\n\nKristen's probability:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{26} \\approx 0.1923\n\\]\nAlso correct.\n\nDifference:\n\\[\n0.2308 - 0.1923 = 0.0385\n\\]\nYes, that's right.\n\nNow, to find the percentage increase:\n\\[\n\\frac{0.0385}{0.1923} \\times 100\\% \\approx 20\\%\n\\]\nHmm, but looking back at the options, 20% is one of them, but I should make sure there isn't a miscalculation.\n\nLet me try calculating the difference fractionally without converting to decimals to be precise.\n\nDifference:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{26} - \\frac{5}{26} = \\frac{1}{26}\n\\]\n\nNow, percentage increase:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1/26}{5/26} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\n\\]\nThis confirms the 20% increase.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider whether the question is asking for the percentage point increase or the actual percentage increase. In statistics, percentage point difference is just the difference in percentages, while percentage increase is how much it increases relative to the original amount.\n\nGiven that, 20% seems correct, but let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking for the percentage by which Wayne's probability exceeds Kristen's, expressed in terms of Kristen's probability.\n\nIn any case, based on my calculations, 20% seems to be the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs there any other context or detail in the problem that I might have missed? The problem seems straightforward: Wayne considers \"Y\" as a vowel, Kristen does not, and we need to find by what percent Wayne's probability is greater than Kristen's.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the ratio of their probabilities.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Wayne's probability} = \\frac{6}{26} = \\frac{3}{13}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Kristen's probability} = \\frac{5}{26}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3/13}{5/26} = \\frac{3}{13} \\times \\frac{26}{5} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2\n\\]\n\nSo, Wayne's probability is 1.2 times Kristen's probability, which means it's 20% greater.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5%\n\nB. 6%\n\nC. 20%\n\nD. 30%\n\nSo, option C. 20% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
