                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Augustine's view on Academic skepticism. The question is asking what Augustine thinks about Academic skepticism, and there are four options:\n\nA. It's true and can be proven.\n\nB. It's true but cannot be proven.\n\nC. It's false but cannot be refuted.\n\nD. It's false and can be refuted.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Academic skepticism is. I think it's a philosophical position that questions the possibility of certain knowledge. Skeptics argue that we can't be sure about anything and that all beliefs should be doubted.\n\nAugustine was a philosopher and theologian who lived in the 4th and 5th centuries. He was a key figure in the development of Western Christianity and had a lot to say about knowledge and truth.\n\nFrom what I remember, Augustine had issues with skepticism. He believed in the possibility of certain knowledge, especially concerning divine truths and the existence of God. So, he probably didn't agree with Academic skepticism entirely.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Academic skepticism is true and can be proven.\n\nIf Augustine believed that skepticism is true and can be proven, that would mean he agreed with the skeptics that we can't have certain knowledge. But I don't think that's the case. He was a proponent of faith and reason working together to attain knowledge, especially about God and morality.\n\nOption B: It's true but cannot be proven.\n\nThis seems similar to option A but adds that it cannot be proven. Augustine might have thought that some truths are beyond proof, but given his emphasis on the knowability of God and truth through faith and reason, I doubt he would consider skepticism to be true, whether provable or not.\n\nOption C: It's false but cannot be refuted.\n\nThis is interesting. Maybe Augustine thought that skepticism is false, but it's a position that's hard to argue against because skeptics can always doubt the arguments used against them. There's a famous dialogue where Augustine discusses this with a skeptic, pointing out that even the act of doubting presupposes some certainty.\n\nOption D: It's false and can be refuted.\n\nThis would mean that Augustine not only disagreed with skepticism but also believed that he could provide a logical or philosophical argument to disprove it.\n\nGiven what I know about Augustine's philosophy, especially his emphasis on the certainty of knowledge through faith and reason, I think he would consider Academic skepticism to be false. But the tricky part is whether he thought it could be refuted.\n\nLet me think about his arguments against skepticism. In his writings, particularly in \"Confessions\" and \"City of God,\" Augustine grapples with skepticism. He argues that while we may doubt many things, there are some self-evident truths that cannot be doubted, like our own existence and our thoughts.\n\nHe also introduces the idea that truth is knowable through the illumination of the divine, and that faith and reason are complementary ways of knowing.\n\nSo, if he believed that there are knowable truths, he must have thought that skepticism is false. But did he think he could refute it?\n\nSkepticism is a tricky position because skeptics can always fall back on doubting the refutation itself. However, Augustine might have believed that his arguments were strong enough to undermine skepticism.\n\nConsidering this, I'm leaning towards option D: it's false and can be refuted.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a nuanced view where he thought skepticism was false but recognized that it's a position that's difficult to refute definitively because of the skeptic's ability to doubt any refutation.\n\nThat sounds a bit like option C: false but cannot be refuted.\n\nHowever, I recall that Augustine was quite confident in his philosophical and theological arguments. He might have believed that with sufficient reasoning, one could indeed refute skepticism.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he thought that while skepticism is false, it's a position that requires faith in doubt, which is self-defeating.\n\nWait a minute, maybe neither option C nor D fully captures Augustine's view. Perhaps he thought that skepticism is false and that it can be refuted up to a point, but ultimately, faith plays a role in accepting or rejecting it.\n\nBut I need to choose among the given options.\n\nLet me consider the context of the question. It's likely that in Augustine's discussions with Academic skeptics, he presented arguments against their position, trying to show that certainty is possible.\n\nFor example, in his dialogue with a skeptic named Victorinus, Augustine might have presented such arguments.\n\nAssuming that, I think Augustine believed that he could refute Academic skepticism, making option D the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he thought that while skepticism is false, it's a position that's inherently difficult to refute because any argument against it can be doubted by the skeptic.\n\nIn that case, option C would be appropriate.\n\nBut I think Augustine was more optimistic about the power of reason and faith to overcome skepticism. Therefore, I'll go with option D: Academic skepticism is false and can be refuted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
