                    "text": " So I'm trying to figure out who this eighth-century CE female poet is, and she's worshipped in many South Indian temples dedicated to Vishnu. The options are Andal, Devi, Ganga, and Kali. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that South India has a rich tradition of poetry and devotion, especially towards various deities. Vishnu is a major god in Hinduism, and there are many temples dedicated to him in South India. So, it makes sense that a poet who is worshipped in these temples would have some connection to Vishnu.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Andal: I recall that Andal is a prominent figure in Tamil devotional literature. She's known for her poems in Tamil, particularly the \"Thiruppavai\" and \"Thiruppugazh,\" which are still recited widely. Andal is considered an incarnation of Lakshmi, who is Vishnu's consort. Because of her deep devotion to Vishnu, she's revered in Vaishnava traditions. So, it seems plausible that she would be worshipped in Vishnu temples.\n\nNext, Devi: This one is a bit tricky because \"Devi\" is a general term for goddess in Hinduism. It can refer to any female deity, but often it's used to denote Durga or Parvati, who are associated with Shiva, another major god in Hinduism. However, in some contexts, Devi can also refer to Lakshmi, who is associated with Vishnu. So, it's possible that Devi could be worshipped in Vishnu temples, but it's not as specific as Andal, who is directly associated with Vishnu through Lakshmi.\n\nThen there's Ganga: Ganga is the goddess of the Ganges River, which is considered a sacred river in Hinduism. She's worshipped throughout India, not just in South India. While Ganga is a revered deity, I don't recall her being specifically worshipped in Vishnu temples. Usually, she's associated with Shiva, as the Ganges is said to have descended from Shiva's locks. So, it seems less likely that Ganga would be worshipped in Vishnu temples.\n\nLastly, Kali: Kali is another prominent goddess in Hinduism, associated with Shiva as well. She's known for her fierce aspect and is worshipped for her protective and destructive powers. Like Ganga, Kali is more commonly associated with Shiva than with Vishnu. While Kali is worshipped in many places in India, I don't think she's specifically worshipped in Vishnu temples.\n\nConsidering all this, Andal seems to be the most fitting choice. She's a female poet from the eighth century CE, deeply revered in South Indian Vishnu temples, and is herself worshipped as an incarnation of Lakshmi, who is Vishnu's consort.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if I can recall any specific temples that worship Andal. I know that in the Divya Desam tradition, which is a network of Vishnu temples in Tamil Nadu, Andal is a central figure. Her temple in Srivilliputtur is famous, and her compositions are an integral part of the daily worship in many of these temples.\n\nAlso, I remember that Andal is unique among the Alvars, who were a group of Tamil saint poets known for their devotional poems to Vishnu. While most Alvars were male, Andal was female, which makes her stand out.\n\nGiven all this, I'm fairly confident that Andal is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
