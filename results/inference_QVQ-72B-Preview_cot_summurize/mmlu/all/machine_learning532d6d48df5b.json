                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two statements, and I need to decide whether each one is true or false. Then, based on that, pick the correct option from A, B, C, or D. Let's take them one at a time.\n\nFirst statement: \"The BLEU metric uses precision, while the ROGUE metric uses recall.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to know about these two metrics\u2014BLEU and ROUGE. I recall that both are used in natural language processing, especially for evaluating machine translation and text summarization. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nLet me think about BLEU first. I think BLEU stands for Bilingual Evaluation Understudy. It's a method for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to one or more reference translations. From what I remember, it calculates precision for n-grams of different sizes, like unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and so on. So, it looks at how often the n-grams in the machine-translated text match those in the reference texts.\n\nNow, precision in the context of information retrieval is the ratio of relevant results retrieved to the total number of results retrieved. So, in BLEU, it's about how many of the n-grams in the translation are correct compared to the references.\n\nBut wait, is precision the only thing BLEU uses? I think it also uses something called brevity penalty to account for the fact that shorter translations might have higher precision just by chance. So, it's not just precision, but precision adjusted by the length of the translation.\n\nOn the other hand, ROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation. It's used for evaluating automatic summarization. Unlike BLEU, which was primarily for machine translation, ROUGE is for summarization, where you want to ensure that the important parts of the original text are captured in the summary.\n\nROUGE also uses n-grams, similar to BLEU, but it focuses on recall. Recall is the ratio of relevant results retrieved to the total number of relevant results. So, in ROUGE, it's about how many of the important n-grams from the original text are included in the summary.\n\nWait a minute, the statement says \"the BLEU metric uses precision, while the ROGUE metric uses recall.\" From what I just thought, that seems accurate. But I should double-check.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any formulas or definitions. For BLEU, the formula involves a geometric mean of n-gram precisions and a brevity penalty. For ROUGE, it's more about the recall of n-grams, meaning how many of the n-grams in the reference summaries are present in the system-generated summary.\n\nSo, yes, it seems that BLEU is more precision-oriented, and ROUGE is recall-oriented. Therefore, the first statement appears to be true.\n\nNow, moving on to the second statement: \"Hidden Markov Models were frequently used to model English sentences.\"\n\nHmm, Hidden Markov Models, or HMMs, are statistical models where the system is assumed to be a Markov process with hidden states. They've been widely used in various applications, including speech recognition and natural language processing.\n\nIn NLP, HMMs have been applied to tasks like part-of-speech tagging, where each word in a sentence is tagged with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. The hidden states represent the tags, and the observed states are the words themselves.\n\nI recall that HMMs were particularly popular in the 1990s and early 2000s for such tasks. They're still used today, though perhaps less frequently with the rise of neural networks and deep learning approaches.\n\nBut the statement says \"frequently used to model English sentences.\" That seems a bit vague. Does it mean that HMMs are commonly used for modeling the structure of English sentences, or perhaps their grammatical properties?\n\nWell, HMMs have indeed been used for modeling the grammatical structure of sentences, especially for tasks like parsing or tagging. So, in that sense, yes, they have been frequently used.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are other models that are more commonly used now. Given the advancements in deep learning, models like LSTMs, GRUs, and transformer-based models like BERT have become more prevalent for sentence modeling in English.\n\nBut the statement doesn't specify a time frame. It just says \"were frequently used,\" which implies past usage, and that might still hold true, even if they're not as dominant now.\n\nAdditionally, HMMs are still taught and used in NLP courses and practices because of their simplicity and effectiveness for certain tasks, especially when data is limited.\n\nTherefore, I think it's accurate to say that HMMs were frequently used to model English sentences.\n\nSo, both statements seem to be true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice should be A. True, True.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nFor the first statement: BLEU does use precision, and ROUGE uses recall. That checks out.\n\nFor the second statement: HMMs have been frequently used for modeling English sentences, though they might not be as dominant now as they once were. Still, the statement is about past usage, so it's true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
