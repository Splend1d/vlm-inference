Francis of Assisi, and D. John of the Cross. Hmm, I need to recall who among these is known for having stigmata and preaching to birds.\n\nFirst off, I know that stigmata are marks or wounds on the body that resemble those of Christ's crucifixion, typically the nail wounds in the hands and feet, and sometimes the wound in the side. It's a phenomenon sometimes associated with certain saints or religious figures.\n\nPreaching to birds sounds familiar; I think it's related to someone who had a deep connection with nature and animals.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Paul of Tarsus: He was an apostle in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and writing many of the New Testament epistles. I don't recall any stories about him having stigmata or preaching to birds. He was more about spreading Christianity through preaching and teaching.\n\nB. Clare of Assisi: She was a Italian saint, founder of the Order of Poor Clares, a monastic order for women. I know she was a contemporary of Francis of Assisi and was devoted to poverty and simplicity. I don't remember any tales of her having stigmata or preaching to birds. Her focus seemed more on contemplative life and serving the poor.\n\nC. Francis of Assisi: Now, Francis of Assisi rings a bell with both stigmata and preaching to birds. He was an Italian friar, deacon, and preacher, and the founder of the Franciscan Order. I think he is famous for his love of nature and animals, which led to the story of him preaching to birds. Also, I believe he received the stigmata towards the end of his life, making him the first recorded case in Christian history.\n\nD. John of the Cross: He was a Spanish poet and mystic, a reformer of the Carmelite Order, and a companion of Teresa of \u00c1vila. While he is known for his spiritual writings and poems, I don't recall any association with stigmata or preaching to birds. His focus was more on mystical theology and reforming the Carmelite monastic life.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, Francis of Assisi seems to be the one who fits both criteria: having stigmata and preaching to birds. I should probably go with option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about the others.\n\nPaul of Tarsus: No, definitely not associated with stigmata or preaching to birds.\n\nClare of Assisi: While she had a deep spiritual connection, I don't think she received stigmata or preached to birds.\n\nJohn of the Cross: Again, known for his mystical writings, but not particularly for stigmata or preaching to animals.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The correct answer should be C. Francis of Assisi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
