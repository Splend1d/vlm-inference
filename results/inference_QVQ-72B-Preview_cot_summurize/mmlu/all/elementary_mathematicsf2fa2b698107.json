                    "text": "Let's see which of these situations can be represented by the fraction 20 over 8, which is 20/8.\n\nFirst, option A says Leslie spent 20 dollars and 8 cents at a store. So, she spent 20 dollars and an additional 8 cents. To write this as a fraction, I need to express the total amount in terms of cents or dollars, maybe. Let's see.\n\nOne dollar is 100 cents, so 20 dollars is 2000 cents. Adding 8 cents gives a total of 2008 cents. If I were to write this as a fraction, it might be 2008/100, which simplifies to 502/25. That's not 20/8. So, this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, if I write it as 20 and 8/100 dollars, that's still 2008/100 cents, same as before. So, this doesn't seem to be the right choice.\n\nMoving on to option B: Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. To find out how many crackers each grandchild got, I need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of grandchildren.\n\nSo, 20 crackers divided by 8 grandchildren: 20 divided by 8 is 2.5. That's the same as 20/8, which simplifies to 2.5. So, this seems like a possible match.\n\nNext, option C: Mitch bought 20 containers of flowers, and each container has 8 flowers. To find out how many flowers he bought in total, I need to multiply the number of containers by the number of flowers in each container.\n\nSo, 20 containers times 8 flowers per container is 160 flowers. That's 20 multiplied by 8, which is 160, not 20/8. So, this doesn't match.\n\nLastly, option D: Stamps are sold in booklets of 20 stamps. Donna used 8 stamps to send invitations for a party. I need to find out how many booklets of stamps she used.\n\nWell, each booklet has 20 stamps, and she used 8 stamps. To find out how many booklets she used, I need to divide the number of stamps she used by the number of stamps per booklet.\n\nSo, 8 divided by 20 is 8/20, which simplifies to 2/5. That's not 20/8. Alternatively, 20/8 is 2.5, and 8/20 is 0.4, which is different. So, this doesn't match either.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the fraction 20/8 doesn't directly represent a part-to-whole relationship in some of these options, or maybe there's another way to interpret it.\n\nLet me look back at option B. Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. How many crackers did each grandchild get?\n\nAs I calculated earlier, 20 divided by 8 is 2.5, which is indeed 20/8. So, this seems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also represent 20/8 in a different context.\n\nOption A: Leslie spent 20 dollars and 8 cents. If I consider the total amount spent as a fraction of a dollar, it would be 2008/100 cents, which is not 20/8.\n\nOption C: Mitch bought 20 containers with 8 flowers each, totaling 160 flowers. That's 20 times 8, which is 160, not 20/8.\n\nOption D: Donna used 8 stamps from booklets of 20. The fraction of stamps used per booklet would be 8/20, which simplifies to 2/5, not 20/8.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, option B seems to be the only one that directly represents the fraction 20/8.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider units in option B. If there are 20 crackers shared equally among 8 grandchildren, each gets 20/8 crackers, which simplifies to 2.5 crackers per grandchild. So, yes, this matches.\n\nIn the other options, the fractions don't align with 20/8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. How many crackers did each grandchild get?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
