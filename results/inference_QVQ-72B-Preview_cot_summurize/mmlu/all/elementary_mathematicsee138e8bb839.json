                    "text": "So I have this division problem: 7,285 divided by 4. I need to figure out which of these options is correct: A. 1,801, B. 1,801 R1, C. 1,821, or D. 1,821 R1. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should recall how to divide a large number by a single-digit number. I think the best way to approach this is to use long division. That way, I can see each step clearly and make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nAlright, so let's set up the long division problem:\n\n```\n\n4 | 7,285\n\n```\n\nI need to divide 7,285 by 4. I'll start from the leftmost digit. So, 4 goes into 7 how many times? Well, 4 times 1 is 4, but 4 times 2 is 8, which is greater than 7. So, 4 goes into 7 one time. I'll write 1 at the top.\n\nThen, I subtract 4 from 7, which gives me 3. Next, I bring down the next digit, which is 2, to make it 32. Now, 4 goes into 32 exactly 8 times because 4 times 8 is 32. I write 8 next to the 1 at the top.\n\nSubtract 32 from 32, and I get 0. Now, bring down the next digit, which is 8, to make it 08 or just 8. 4 goes into 8 two times because 4 times 2 is 8. I write 2 next to the 18 at the top.\n\nSubtract 8 from 8, and I get 0 again. Now, bring down the last digit, which is 5, to make it 05 or just 5. 4 goes into 5 once because 4 times 1 is 4. I write 1 next to the 182 at the top.\n\nSubtract 4 from 5, and I get 1. Since there are no more digits to bring down, this remainder stays as 1.\n\nSo, the quotient is 1,821 with a remainder of 1. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 1,801\n\nB. 1,801 R1\n\nC. 1,821\n\nD. 1,821 R1\n\nAccording to my calculation, it should be 1,821 with a remainder of 1, which would be option D.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in my division. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting with 7,285 \u00f7 4.\n\nFirst digit: 4 goes into 7 once (4 \u00d7 1 = 4), subtract to get 3, bring down 2 to make 32.\n\n4 goes into 32 eight times (4 \u00d7 8 = 32), subtract to get 0, bring down 8 to make 8.\n\n4 goes into 8 two times (4 \u00d7 2 = 8), subtract to get 0, bring down 5 to make 5.\n\n4 goes into 5 one time (4 \u00d7 1 = 4), subtract to get 1.\n\nSo, quotient is 1,821 with remainder 1. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding the remainder.\n\nSo, 1,821 \u00d7 4 = 7,284, and then add the remainder 1 to get 7,285, which matches the original number. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nWait, but let's see if maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe using repeated subtraction or something, but that seems inefficient for such a large number.\n\nOr perhaps using the decimal method to see if it helps confirm.\n\nSo, 7,285 \u00f7 4.\n\nFirst, 4 goes into 7 once, remainder 3.\n\nThen, 4 goes into 32 eight times, remainder 0.\n\n4 goes into 8 two times, remainder 0.\n\n4 goes into 5 one time, remainder 1.\n\nSo again, 1,821 with remainder 1.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider dividing 7,285 by 4 without a remainder, maybe it's possible, but from the calculations, it seems there is a remainder.\n\nLet me also consider the options.\n\nOption A is 1,801, which is less than 1,821, and option C is 1,821 without a remainder, which doesn't match because there is a remainder.\n\nOption B is 1,801 with remainder 1, but that's even further off.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is D: 1,821 R1.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the multiplication again.\n\n1,821 \u00d7 4 = 7,284.\n\nAdd 1 to 7,284 to get 7,285.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 1,821 R1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
