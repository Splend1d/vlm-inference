                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about marginal utility and total utility, and I need to figure out which statement is true based on the information given. So, the student eats three slices of pizza, and the marginal utility for each slice is given: first slice is 10 utils, second is 7 utils, and third is 3 utils. Then, there are four statements to evaluate, and I need to pick the one that holds true.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what marginal utility and total utility are. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction or utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good, right? And total utility is the total satisfaction received from all the units consumed.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's calculate the total utility from eating three slices. It should be the sum of the marginal utilities of each slice.\n\nTotal utility = MU of first slice + MU of second slice + MU of third slice\n\nThat would be 10 + 7 + 3 = 20 utils. Okay, so option D says the total utility is 20 utils. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if that's the only true statement or if there are others.\n\nOption A says the student would not eat any more pizza. Hmm, well, that depends on whether the marginal utility of the fourth slice would be positive or not. If the marginal utility is still positive, the student might eat more, but if it's zero or negative, they might stop.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give the marginal utility of the fourth slice. It only provides up to the third slice. So, without that information, I can't be sure about whether the student would eat more or not. Maybe they would stop, maybe not. Can't really say.\n\nOption B says the marginal utility of the fourth slice will be zero. But again, the problem doesn't provide that information. It's possible that the marginal utility decreases to zero at the fourth slice, but it's also possible that it decreases further but stays positive, or maybe even increases. Without data, I can't assume it's zero.\n\nOption C says the student should have stopped eating pizza after two slices. Well, let's think about that. After two slices, the total utility is 10 + 7 = 17 utils. Then, with the third slice, the marginal utility is 3 utils, which is still positive. So, even though the marginal utility decreases, as long as it's positive, consuming that extra slice still adds to the total utility.\n\nSo, in that case, it was rational for the student to eat the third slice because it increased their total utility. Therefore, saying they should have stopped after two slices isn't accurate based on the given data.\n\nOption D, as I calculated earlier, is correct. The total utility from eating three slices is indeed 20 utils.\n\nSo, among the given options, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps there's more to consider. For example, in some economic theories, people might consider the cost of the pizza or the diminishing marginal utility to decide how much to consume. But in this problem, since only marginal utilities are provided, and no costs are mentioned, maybe we're supposed to focus solely on the utilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption about the student's budget or something, but again, the problem doesn't provide that information.\n\nGiven the information supplied, I think the best answer is D: The total utility the student received from eating pizza is 20 utils.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
