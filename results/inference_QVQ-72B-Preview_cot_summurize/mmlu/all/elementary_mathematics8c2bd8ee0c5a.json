                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"In which set do all of the values make the inequality 2x \u2014 1 < 10 true?\" And there are four options to choose from: A. {10, 15, 20}, B. {5, 7, 9}, C. {4, 6, 8}, D. {2, 3, 4}.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what the inequality is asking. It says 2x minus 1 is less than 10. So, for each value in the sets, I need to plug it into x and see if that inequality holds true.\n\nMaybe I should start by solving the inequality for x to get a better understanding of what values of x satisfy the inequality.\n\nSo, the inequality is:\n\n2x - 1 < 10\n\nI need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, I'll add 1 to both sides:\n\n2x - 1 + 1 < 10 + 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2x < 11\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\n2x / 2 < 11 / 2\n\nSo, x < 5.5\n\nOkay, so any x that is less than 5.5 should satisfy the inequality.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. {10, 15, 20}\n\nLet's check each one:\n\n10 < 5.5? No, 10 is greater than 5.5, so this set already has a value that doesn't satisfy the inequality.\n\nB. {5, 7, 9}\n\n5 < 5.5? Well, 5 is less than 5.5, but 7 and 9 are greater. So, not all values in this set satisfy the inequality.\n\nC. {4, 6, 8}\n\n4 < 5.5, 6 < 5.5? No, 6 is greater than 5.5, and 8 is also greater. So, again, not all values satisfy the inequality.\n\nD. {2, 3, 4}\n\n2 < 5.5, 3 < 5.5, 4 < 5.5. All of these are less than 5.5. So, this seems like the correct set where all values satisfy the inequality.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check by plugging each value into the original inequality to be sure.\n\nFor set D: {2, 3, 4}\n\nFirst, x = 2\n\n2*(2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 < 10? Yes, 3 < 10.\n\nNext, x = 3\n\n2*(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 < 10? Yes, 5 < 10.\n\nLastly, x = 4\n\n2*(4) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 < 10? Yes, 7 < 10.\n\nSo, all values in set D satisfy the inequality.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check one value from another set.\n\nTake set C: {4, 6, 8}\n\nWe already saw that 4 satisfies the inequality, but 6:\n\n2*(6) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 < 10? No, 11 is not less than 10.\n\nSo, indeed, not all values in set C satisfy the inequality.\n\nSimilarly, set B: {5, 7, 9}\n\n2*(5) - 1 = 9 < 10? Yes, 9 < 10, but 2*(7) - 1 = 13 < 10? No, 13 is not less than 10.\n\nSet A: {10, 15, 20}\n\n2*(10) - 1 = 19 < 10? No, 19 is not less than 10.\n\nTherefore, only set D has all values that satisfy the inequality 2x - 1 < 10.\n\nI think the answer is D. {2, 3, 4}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
