                    "text": "So I've got this case here, and I need to figure out whether the shopper can successfully claim against the glass door company on behalf of her son based on strict products liability. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a drug store that hired an independent contractor to renovate it. Part of the renovation included installing a new front door made of plate glass. The contractor bought the door from a glass door company. The sales rep from the glass door company told both the contractor and the owner that plate glass is \"super safe\" and can withstand a lot of pressure. So, everyone involved thought this was a safe choice for the door.\n\nThe contractor installed the door, finished the other renovations, and the store reopened. A few weeks later, a shopper and her 9-year-old son went to the drug store. The son was skipping ahead and thought the door was open, but when he realized it was closed, he tried to push it open. His hand slipped off the handle, and there was an \"exploding noise\" as the glass shattered, cutting his hand and wrist.\n\nAfter that, an inspection found that the glass door had been negligently installed by the contractor. Now, the shopper wants to make a claim against the glass door company based on strict products liability.\n\nOkay, so strict products liability is a legal doctrine that holds manufacturers liable for defects in their products that cause injury, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. So, the plaintiff doesn't have to prove that the manufacturer was careless; they just have to show that the product was defective and that it caused the injury.\n\nIn this case, the glass door shattered and cut the son's hand and wrist. The inspection revealed that the door was negligently installed by the contractor. But the claim is against the glass door company, not the contractor.\n\nSo, the options are:\n\nA. Prevail, because the glass door was defective.\n\nB. Prevail, because the sales representative said plate glass was \"super safe.\"\n\nC. Not prevail, because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the son negligently pushed open the glass door.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, for option A, if the glass door was defective, that could be a reason to hold the glass door company liable under strict products liability. But wait, the inspection found that the door was negligently installed by the contractor. Does that mean the glass itself was defective, or was it just installed wrong?\n\nI think there's a difference between a manufacturing defect in the glass and an installation defect. If the glass was defective from the factory, that's one thing, but if it was installed incorrectly, that might be separate.\n\nOption B says prevail because the sales rep said it was \"super safe.\" Hmm, that sounds like a marketing statement. It might be considered puffery, which is non-binding promotional talk. I don't think that alone would be enough to hold the company liable, especially since strict products liability is about defects in the product, not about what was said about it.\n\nOption C says not prevail because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door. This seems relevant. If the installation was negligent, that might be seen as an intervening cause that broke the chain of causation between any potential defect in the glass and the injury.\n\nBut wait, in strict products liability, the focus is on the product's defect and whether it caused the injury. If the glass was defective to begin with, and that defect contributed to it shattering, then the negligent installation might be seen as an intervening cause that doesn't relieve the manufacturer of liability.\n\nI think I need to consider whether the glass itself was defective or if the installation was the only issue here.\n\nOption D says not prevail because the son negligently pushed open the glass door. That seems like it could be a possible defense. If the son's actions contributed to the glass shattering, that could be considered comparative negligence, which might reduce the damages or even bar recovery depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nBut again, in strict products liability, the emphasis is on the defect in the product and whether it was unreasonably dangerous.\n\nLet me try to piece this together.\n\nFirst, there's a claim of strict products liability against the glass door company. To succeed, the plaintiff would need to show that:\n\n1. The glass door was defective.\n\n2. The defect made the product unreasonably dangerous.\n\n3. The defect was present when the door left the manufacturer's control.\n\n4. The defect caused the injury.\n\nNow, the inspection found that the door was negligently installed by the contractor. The contractor was an independent contractor hired by the drug store owner, not the glass door company.\n\nSo, if the glass itself was defective, the glass door company could be liable under strict products liability. However, if the installation was negligent, and that negligence caused the glass to shatter when it shouldn't have, then the contractor's negligence might be seen as the direct cause of the injury.\n\nBut in strict products liability, the focus is on the product, not on the installation. So, if the glass was defective from the factory, the glass door company would still be liable, even if the installation was negligent.\n\nWait, but what if the glass wasn't defective, and the only issue was the negligent installation? In that case, the glass door company shouldn't be liable because the defect wasn't in their product.\n\nSo, I need to know whether the glass itself was defective or if the installation was the only problem.\n\nThe problem says that the inspection revealed that the glass door had been negligently installed by the contractor. It doesn't say that the glass was defective.\n\nSo, if the glass was not defective, and the only issue was the negligent installation, then the glass door company shouldn't be held liable under strict products liability because there was no defect in their product.\n\nOn the other hand, if the glass was defective, then the negligent installation might be seen as an intervening cause, but in strict products liability, the manufacturer can still be held liable if the product was defective.\n\nBut in this case, the inspection only found that the installation was negligent, not that the glass was defective.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the plaintiff would not prevail against the glass door company because the inspection didn't find a defect in the glass itself, only in the installation.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the defective installation made the glass more likely to shatter, which could be seen as a defect in the product's expected performance.\n\nBut no, the installation was done by the contractor, not the glass door company. So, unless the glass door company had some role in the installation or knew that the installation would be defective, they shouldn't be liable for someone else's negligence.\n\nAlso, the sales rep said plate glass was \"super safe,\" but that's just a statement; it doesn't necessarily mean that the glass was defective.\n\nMoreover, the son's actions in pushing the door might have contributed to the glass shattering, but again, that's more about comparative negligence, which might affect the damages but not necessarily the liability under strict products liability.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C: not prevail, because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose that the glass was defective from the factory, and the installation was also negligent. In that case, both the manufacturer and the contractor could be liable, but the plaintiff is only suing the glass door company.\n\nIf the glass was defective, the glass door company could be held strictly liable, and the negligent installation might be seen as an intervening cause that doesn't relieve the manufacturer of liability.\n\nBut in this problem, the inspection only found that the installation was negligent; it didn't find any defect in the glass itself.\n\nSo, unless there's evidence that the glass was defective, the glass door company shouldn't be held liable under strict products liability.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff would not prevail because the contractor's negligent installation is the direct cause of the glass shattering, not any defect in the glass itself.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
