                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. It says that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in certain areas, and Congress has given lower federal courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court in all cases except for disputes involving:\n\nA. ambassadors\n\nB. public ministers and consuls\n\nC. different states\n\nD. a state as a party\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what original jurisdiction means. I think it means that the Supreme Court hears these cases first-hand, not as an appeal from a lower court. So, these are cases that start in the Supreme Court.\n\nNow, the question is about which types of cases the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction over, meaning no lower court can hear these cases concurrently.\n\nLet me recall the Constitution. The Constitution outlines the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction in Article III, Section 2. It says that the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased differently. It says Congress has given lower federal courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court in all cases except for disputes involving certain options.\n\nSo, if Congress has allowed lower courts to have concurrent jurisdiction in most cases, but there are exceptions where only the Supreme Court can hear the case originally, those must be the cases where the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. ambassadors\n\nB. public ministers and consuls\n\nC. different states\n\nD. a state as a party\n\nI need to pick the one that Congress hasn't given concurrent jurisdiction to lower courts for.\n\nI remember that cases involving ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls, as well as cases between states, are typically within the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.\n\nBut is this jurisdiction exclusive, meaning no other court can touch these cases?\n\nFor ambassadors and consuls, I think it's exclusive because these involve foreign relations, which are handled at the federal level, and the Supreme Court is the final arbiter.\n\nSimilarly, cases between different states are supposed to be heard by the Supreme Court directly, as per the Constitution.\n\nBut, I've heard of lower courts handling cases involving states in some capacities, so maybe it's not entirely exclusive.\n\nLet me think about the exact wording of the Constitution. Article III, Section 2, Clause 2, states: \"In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.\"\n\nSo, for these types of cases, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction. But does that mean exclusive jurisdiction?\n\nI think for cases involving ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls, it's exclusive. Meaning, only the Supreme Court can hear these cases originally.\n\nFor cases where a state is a party, it's a bit trickier. The Constitution says the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, but sometimes lower federal courts or even state courts might hear cases where a state is a party, depending on the nature of the case.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about disputes involving certain options, and which one is excepted from concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nGiven that, if Congress has granted concurrent jurisdiction to lower courts in most cases, but there's an exception for certain types of disputes, I need to identify which one of these options is not shared with lower courts.\n\nGiven that the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is exclusive in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, then perhaps the answer is C. different states.\n\nWait, but \"different states\" could be interpreted as cases between two or more states, which, according to the Constitution, fall under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.\n\nBut maybe Congress has allowed lower courts to have concurrent jurisdiction in some of these cases, except for specific types.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exception is when a state is a party, meaning that in cases where a state is a party, lower courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, because often states are parties in lower federal courts or even state courts.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose there's a contract dispute between two states. According to the Constitution, the Supreme Court would have original jurisdiction over that. But could a lower court also hear it concurrently?\n\nI don't think so. The Supreme Court has been historically regarded as the sole arbiter in disputes between states.\n\nOn the other hand, cases involving ambassadors or public ministers might also be heard exclusively by the Supreme Court, given their sensitivity involving foreign relations.\n\nBut perhaps Congress has allowed lower courts to have concurrent jurisdiction in some of these areas, except for the most sensitive ones.\n\nWait, the question says \"Congress has given lower federal courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court in all cases except for disputes involving:\n\nSo, Congress has generally allowed lower courts to share jurisdiction with the Supreme Court in most cases, but there are exceptions where only the Supreme Court can handle the case.\n\nGiven that, I need to identify which of the options is such an exception.\n\nOption D is \"a state as a party.\" But in practice, states can be parties in lower federal courts, so maybe that's not the exception.\n\nOption C is \"different states.\" Maybe this is the exception, meaning that disputes between different states are exclusively within the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, and lower courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nLet me verify this. I recall a case where two states were in dispute over water rights, and it went directly to the Supreme Court. I don't recall lower courts handling such disputes.\n\nSimilarly, for cases involving ambassadors, while they might be heard by the Supreme Court originally, lower courts might handle some aspects, but perhaps the core dispute is exclusively for the Supreme Court.\n\nGiven that, maybe both options A, B, and D allow for some concurrent jurisdiction, whereas option C, disputes between different states, are exclusively for the Supreme Court.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. different states.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any possibility that lower courts could have concurrent jurisdiction in disputes between states.\n\nI don't think so. The Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction over cases between states. So, no lower court can hear such a case.\n\nIn contrast, cases where a state is a party could involve situations where the state is suing a private party or being sued by one, and lower courts can handle those.\n\nSimilarly, cases involving ambassadors might have aspects that lower courts can handle, but the main dispute is for the Supreme Court.\n\nTherefore, the exception where lower courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction is in disputes between different states.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. different states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
