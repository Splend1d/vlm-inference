                    "text": "So I have this problem about a right triangle. The legs are 6 and b, and the hypotenuse is c. The perimeter is 18, and I need to find c. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies, so c\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + b\u00b2. But I don't know b yet. Also, the perimeter is the sum of all sides, so 6 + b + c = 18.\n\nSo, I have two equations:\n\n1. c\u00b2 = 36 + b\u00b2\n\n2. 6 + b + c = 18\n\nFrom the second equation, I can solve for b: b = 18 - 6 - c = 12 - c.\n\nNow, plug this into the first equation:\n\nc\u00b2 = 36 + (12 - c)\u00b2\n\nLet's expand that:\n\nc\u00b2 = 36 + (144 - 24c + c\u00b2)\n\nSo, c\u00b2 = 180 - 24c + c\u00b2\n\nHmm, subtract c\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n0 = 180 - 24c\n\nNow, solve for c:\n\n24c = 180\n\nc = 180 / 24\n\nc = 7.5\n\nWait, but one of the options is 15/2, which is also 7.5, so that seems to be the answer. But let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf c = 7.5, then b = 12 - 7.5 = 4.5.\n\nSo, the sides are 6, 4.5, and 7.5.\n\nDoes this satisfy the Pythagorean theorem?\n\n6\u00b2 + 4.5\u00b2 = 36 + 20.25 = 56.25\n\nAnd 7.5\u00b2 = 56.25, so yes, it checks out.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the properties of special right triangles or something?\n\nLet me think. Since it's a right triangle, and the legs are 6 and b, with hypotenuse c, and perimeter 18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express b in terms of c and substitute into the Pythagorean equation.\n\nI already did that, and got c = 7.5.\n\nBut let's try another approach to confirm.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, so c should be greater than both 6 and b.\n\nGiven that, and c = 7.5, that seems reasonable since 7.5 > 6 and 7.5 > 4.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the legs, but since perimeter is given, maybe area isn't directly relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the triangle is right-angled, and try to see if it's similar to any known right triangles, like 3-4-5 or 5-12-13, but scaled up or down.\n\nWait, 3-4-5 scaled by 1.5 would give 4.5, 6, and 7.5, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, 3-4-5 scaled by 1.5: 4.5, 6, 7.5, and the perimeter would be 4.5 + 6 + 7.5 = 18, which matches the given perimeter.\n\nSo, that confirms that c = 7.5 is correct.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. 18\n\nB. 15/2 (which is 7.5)\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 6\n\nSo, B is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if c could be any of the other values.\n\nIf c = 18, then from b = 12 - c, b = 12 - 18 = -6, which doesn't make sense, since side lengths can't be negative.\n\nIf c = 8, then b = 12 - 8 = 4.\n\nDoes 6\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 8\u00b2?\n\n36 + 16 = 52, and 8\u00b2 = 64, which is not equal.\n\nSo, no.\n\nIf c = 6, then b = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nSo, sides are 6, 6, and 6, which would be an equilateral triangle, but that's not right-angled.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is c = 7.5, which is option B.\n\nSo, the answer is B. \\frac{15}{2}"
