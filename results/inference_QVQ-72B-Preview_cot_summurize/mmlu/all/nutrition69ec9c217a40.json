                    "text": "Alright, I have this question about Anorexia Nervosa. It's asking which of the following is not considered a diagnostic feature of Anorexia Nervosa. The options are:\n\nA. Depressive symptoms\n\nB. Significant weight loss\n\nC. Body image distortion\n\nD. Fear of becoming fat\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what the diagnostic criteria for Anorexia Nervosa are. I remember that Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by restrictive eating behaviors leading to low body weight. But let's be more specific.\n\nI think back to the DSM-5 criteria for Anorexia Nervosa. There are several key features:\n\n1. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a persistently low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.\n\n2. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.\n\n3. Disturbance in the way one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the low body weight.\n\nSo, based on this, option B is definitely a diagnostic feature\u2014significant weight loss due to restriction of energy intake.\n\nOption C is also part of the criteria\u2014body image distortion, which includes disturbance in experiencing body weight or shape.\n\nOption D\u2014fear of becoming fat\u2014is another key component of Anorexia Nervosa.\n\nNow, option A is depressive symptoms. While depression can co-occur with Anorexia Nervosa, I don't recall it being a diagnostic criterion for the eating disorder itself. In fact, it's common for individuals with Anorexia to experience depression, but that's more of a comorbid condition rather than a diagnostic feature.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I look at the DSM-5 criteria again, depressive symptoms aren't listed as part of the diagnostic criteria for Anorexia Nervosa. The main features are restrictive eating leading to low weight, fear of gaining weight, and body image disturbances.\n\nTherefore, depressive symptoms are not considered a diagnostic feature of Anorexia Nervosa. The other options\u2014significant weight loss, body image distortion, and fear of becoming fat\u2014are all part of the official diagnostic criteria.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Depressive symptoms.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any possibility that depressive symptoms could be part of the diagnostic criteria in some contexts. But no, I'm pretty confident that they're not part of the core diagnostic features. They can be associated with Anorexia Nervosa but are not used to define it.\n\nAlright, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
