                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, Pipp Co. is developing and producing a computer software product, and there are several costs involved in different stages of the process. The question is asking how much of these costs should be capitalized in the balance sheet as software cost as of December 31 of year 2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the general principles related to capitalizing software costs. According to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), research and development costs are typically expensed as incurred. However, there's a specific guidance for internal-use software, where certain costs can be capitalized once technological feasibility has been established.\n\nSo, technological feasibility is a key milestone here. Before that point, costs are generally expensed. Once technological feasibility is established, certain costs can be capitalized.\n\nLet's look at the costs provided:\n\n1. Completion of detailed program design: $10,000\n\n2. Costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility: $15,000\n\n3. Other coding and testing costs incurred after establishment of technological feasibility: $44,000\n\nFrom my understanding, the completion of detailed program design is likely part of the research and development phase and would be expensed as incurred. The costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility might also be expensed, depending on the specific guidance.\n\nOnce technological feasibility is established, other coding and testing costs can be capitalized. So, in this case, the $44,000 incurred after technological feasibility has been established should be capitalized.\n\nWait a minute, the answer options include $10,000, $25,000, $44,000, and $59,000. So, option C is $44,000, which seems straightforward based on my initial thinking.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's more to it. Perhaps some of the earlier costs can also be capitalized under certain conditions.\n\nLet me recall the specific guidance for capitalizing internal-use software costs. According to FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, capitalization begins when (a) the preliminary project stage is complete, (b) management commits to funding the project, (c) it is probable the project will be completed, and (d) the software will be used only for internal purposes.\n\nHowever, technological feasibility is often considered established when the coding is completed, and the software is ready for testing. But I need to confirm that.\n\nLooking back at the costs:\n\n- Completion of detailed program design: $10,000 \u2013 this sounds like it's part of the preliminary project stage.\n\n- Costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility: $15,000 \u2013 this seems to be part of the process to reach technological feasibility.\n\n- Other coding and testing costs incurred after establishment of technological feasibility: $44,000 \u2013 these are post-feasibility costs.\n\nSo, based on this, the first two costs ($10,000 + $15,000 = $25,000) are likely to be expensed as research and development costs, while the $44,000 are costs incurred after technological feasibility is established and can be capitalized.\n\nWait, but option B is $25,000, which would include both the detailed program design and the coding and testing to establish feasibility. That doesn't seem right, because those should be expensed.\n\nOption A is $10,000, which is just the detailed program design cost. That also doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption C is $44,000, which aligns with the costs incurred after technological feasibility is established, which should be capitalized.\n\nOption D is $59,000, which would include both the post-feasibility costs and possibly some other costs, but based on the guidance, that doesn't seem appropriate.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe some of the earlier costs can also be capitalized under certain circumstances. For example, if the detailed program design is directly related to the software that will be capitalized, perhaps parts of it can be capitalized. But generally, costs incurred before technological feasibility is established are expensed.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the $15,000 for coding and testing to establish feasibility includes some costs that are actually post-feasibility. But the wording suggests that these costs are specifically to establish feasibility, so they should be expensed.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward answer is to capitalize only the $44,000 incurred after technological feasibility is established.\n\nI think the correct answer is C. $44,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
