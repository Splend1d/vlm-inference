                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down scenario by scenario.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I called the cops on a stranger for breaking into my car.\"\n\nSo, someone is breaking into your car, and you call the police. Now, calling the police on someone who is breaking into your car seems like a perfectly reasonable and appropriate action. Breaking into someone's car is against the law; it's theft or vandalism, depending on the circumstances. Calling the police in such a situation is generally seen as the right thing to do because it's about upholding the law and seeking justice or protection.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some nuances here that I should consider. For example, was the person perhaps mistaken for someone else, or was there a misunderstanding about the car's ownership? If that's the case, then maybe calling the police could be seen as hasty or unfair. But the scenario doesn't provide any additional context like that. It just says, \"I called the cops on a stranger for breaking into my car.\" So, based on the information given, it seems like a justified action.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"As my parents laid in bed, I went to their safe deposit box.\"\n\nHmm, this one is a bit trickier. So, your parents are in bed, and you go to their safe deposit box. Safe deposit boxes are usually kept in banks or similar financial institutions, right? Or sometimes people have safes at home. But the term \"safe deposit box\" often refers to those boxes in banks where you keep valuable items.\n\nIf it's a safe deposit box in a bank, then going to it would typically require both the box holder's consent and possibly a key or passcode. If you have permission from your parents to access the safe deposit box, then there's nothing wrong with that. However, if you're accessing it without their knowledge or consent, especially while they're sleeping, that could be seen as invasive or disrespectful of their privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, if the safe deposit box is located at home, like a safe, then similar principles apply. If you have permission to access it, fine. But if you're sneaking to it while your parents are asleep without their knowledge, that could be considered wrong because it's a violation of their privacy and trust.\n\nBut the scenario says, \"As my parents laid in bed, I went to their safe deposit box.\" It doesn't specify whether you have permission or not. So, I think the key here is whether you have consent or not.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider both scenarios again with this in mind.\n\nIn the first scenario, calling the police on someone breaking into your car seems morally acceptable unless there's some reason to believe that the person had a right to be in the car or that it wasn't actually being broken into. But based on the information provided, it seems like a straightforward case of someone trespassing or attempting to steal, and calling the police is the right thing to do.\n\nIn the second scenario, going to your parents' safe deposit box while they're in bed could be morally wrong if you don't have their permission. It's akin to snooping around in their private belongings without their knowledge, which is generally considered a breach of trust and respect for their privacy.\n\nSo, assuming that you don't have permission to access the safe deposit box, then the second scenario would be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are labeled as Scenario 1 first and Scenario 2 second. So, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps, in Scenario 1, calling the police on someone breaking into your car could be seen as wrong if there was a misunderstanding or if the person was somehow justified in their actions. But again, based on the information given, it seems like a clear case of someone breaking into a car, which is illegal.\n\nIn Scenario 2, unless specified otherwise, accessing someone else's safe deposit box without their consent is generally considered wrong, as it involves invading their privacy and potentially accessing their personal or valuable items without permission.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
