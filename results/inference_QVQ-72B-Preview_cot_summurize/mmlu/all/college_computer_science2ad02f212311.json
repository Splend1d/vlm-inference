                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these statements correctly describe a purely segmented memory system. I have three options:\n\nI. It divides memory into units of equal size.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\n\nIII. It suffers from internal fragmentation.\n\nAnd the options are A. I only, B. II only, C. III only, D. I and III.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a purely segmented memory system is. I know that in segmentation, memory is divided into logical units called segments, which can vary in size depending on the program's needs. Unlike paging, where memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages, segmentation allows for more flexibility in how memory is allocated.\n\nSo, looking at statement I: \"It divides memory into units of equal size.\" Based on what I just thought, segmentation doesn't divide memory into equal-sized units. Segments can be different sizes because they correspond to different parts of the program, like code, data, stack, etc., which can have varying sizes. So, I think statement I is incorrect for a purely segmented memory system.\n\nNext, statement II: \"It permits implementation of virtual memory.\" I remember that virtual memory is a technique that allows a computer to use more memory than it physically has by temporarily swapping data to disk. In segmentation, since segments can be swapped in and out of memory as needed, it should be possible to implement virtual memory. So, I think statement II is correct.\n\nLastly, statement III: \"It suffers from internal fragmentation.\" Internal fragmentation occurs when memory is allocated in chunks that are larger than needed, leading to wasted space within those chunks. In pure segmentation, when a segment is allocated, if the actual data is smaller than the segment, there might be unused space within the segment, which sounds like internal fragmentation. However, I'm a bit unsure because in some systems, segments are allocated exactly the size they need, which would avoid internal fragmentation. Maybe it depends on the implementation.\n\nGiven that, I think statement II is definitely correct. Statement I is incorrect because segments are not of equal size. Statement III might be debatable, but I'm leaning towards it being correct because there can be internal fragmentation in some implementations.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for \"purely segmented memory system.\" Maybe there are systems that don't suffer from internal fragmentation in segmentation. I need to double-check that.\n\nLet me think about it differently. In pure segmentation, how is memory allocated? Segments are created dynamically based on the program's needs, and each segment can have its own size, which should ideally match the size of the data they contain. If that's the case, there shouldn't be internal fragmentation because the segment size is tailored to the data size.\n\nOn the other hand, in paging, pages are fixed size, so if the data doesn't fill a whole page, the remaining space is wasted, leading to internal fragmentation.\n\nSo, perhaps in pure segmentation, internal fragmentation isn't an issue because segments are variable in size and can be allocated precisely to fit the data they hold.\n\nIf that's the case, then statement III would be incorrect.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer would be B. II only.\n\nBut I want to make sure about internal fragmentation in segmentation. Let me see if I can find some information to confirm this.\n\nAfter a quick search in my notes, I find that segmentation can lead to external fragmentation, where free memory blocks are scattered throughout memory, making it hard to allocate large segments. However, regarding internal fragmentation, it's generally associated with fixed-size allocation schemes like paging.\n\nIn segmentation, since segments are allocated based on their actual sizes, internal fragmentation isn't a significant issue. Therefore, statement III is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. II only.\n\nWait, but the question says \"purely segmented memory system.\" Is there something different about a \"purely\" segmented system?\n\nI think \"purely segmented\" just emphasizes that it's only using segmentation for memory management, without combining it with paging or other schemes.\n\nIn that case, my previous reasoning still holds, and the answer should be B. II only.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. Segmentation allows for variable-sized segments, which helps avoid internal fragmentation, and it can support virtual memory by swapping segments in and out of physical memory.\n\nSo, the final answer is B. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
