                    "text": "So I have this problem here about the vaporization of water, and I need to find the entropy change. The molar heat of vaporization is given as +43.9 kJ, and I need to choose from four options: A. 8.49 J mol\u207b\u00b9 K\u207b\u00b9, B. 4.184 J mol\u207b\u00b9 K\u207b\u00b9, C. 2.78 J mol\u207b\u00b9 K\u207b\u00b9, or D. 118 J mol\u207b\u00b9 K\u207b\u00b9.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between heat, entropy, and temperature. I remember that entropy change (\u0394S) for a phase change like vaporization can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{q}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(q\\) is the heat absorbed or released during the phase change, and \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin at which the phase change occurs.\n\nIn this problem, the molar heat of vaporization is given as +43.9 kJ. Since it's a molar quantity, it corresponds to the heat required to vaporize one mole of water. So, \\(q = 43.9\\) kJ/mol.\n\nBut wait, the units for entropy are J/mol\u00b7K, and here I have kJ/mol. I should convert the heat to joules to match the units. I know that 1 kJ = 1000 J, so:\n\n\\[\nq = 43.9 \\, \\text{kJ/mol} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{J/kJ} = 43900 \\, \\text{J/mol}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to know the temperature at which this vaporization occurs. However, the problem doesn't provide a specific temperature. I wonder if I should use the normal boiling point of water, which is 100\u00b0C, or 373 K.\n\nLet me check if there's any information about the temperature in the problem. Hmm, no, it's not provided. Maybe it's implied that it's at the boiling point under standard pressure, which is 100\u00b0C or 373 K.\n\nAssuming that's the case, I can proceed with \\(T = 373\\) K.\n\nNow, plugging the values into the entropy change formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{43900 \\, \\text{J/mol}}{373 \\, \\text{K}} \\approx 117.7 \\, \\text{J/mol\u00b7K}\n\\]\n\nLooking at the options, this corresponds to option D. 118 J mol\u207b\u00b9 K\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The formula for entropy change in phase transitions is indeed \\(\\Delta S = \\frac{q}{T}\\), where \\(q\\) is the heat of transition and \\(T\\) is the temperature at which it occurs.\n\nI converted the heat from kJ to J correctly, and used the standard boiling point temperature for water. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nHowever, I notice that some of the options are in tenths or hundredths of joules, so perhaps there's a different approach or additional consideration I need to make.\n\nLet me think about the units again. Entropy is measured in joules per mole per kelvin (J/mol\u00b7K), which matches what I have calculated.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the entropy change is for the system or the surroundings. In this case, since it's the vaporization of water, the system is the water, and the entropy change is for the water undergoing vaporization.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems straightforward. The entropy change is positive because vaporization is an endothermic process, leading to an increase in disorder and thus an increase in entropy.\n\nWait, but the problem says the molar heat of vaporization is +43.9 kJ, which is the heat absorbed by the system. So, yes, it's an endothermic process, and entropy increases.\n\nLet me check the units again. 43.9 kJ/mol is 43,900 J/mol, divided by 373 K gives approximately 117.7 J/mol\u00b7K, which rounds to 118 J/mol\u00b7K.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me see if perhaps the temperature is different or if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the latent heat formula, which is \\(q = n \\cdot \\Delta H\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of moles and \\(\\Delta H\\) is the molar heat of vaporization. But since it's already given per mole, it should be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The molar heat is given to three significant figures (43.9), and the temperature is 373, which is also three significant figures. So, my answer should be reported to three significant figures, which is 118 J/mol\u00b7K.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 118 J mol\u207b\u00b9 K\u207b\u00b9 matches this.\n\nAlternatively, if I had used more significant figures for the temperature, 373.15 K, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta S = \\frac{43900 \\, \\text{J/mol}}{373.15 \\, \\text{K}} \\approx 117.64 \\, \\text{J/mol\u00b7K}\n\\]\n\nWhich still rounds to 118 J/mol\u00b7K.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. 118 J mol\u207b\u00b9 K\u207b\u00b9.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the entropy change, such as changes in volume or pressure. However, in standard phase change calculations, especially for entropy, the formula \\(\\Delta S = \\frac{q}{T}\\) is sufficient and commonly used.\n\nMoreover, the problem specifies the molar heat of vaporization, which is a standard thermodynamic quantity, and the entropy change for vaporization is directly related to it via this formula.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. 118 J mol\u207b\u00b9 K\u207b\u00b9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
