                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about secondary school enrollment in less developed countries. It says that some countries have high secondary-school enrollment as of 2020, and I need to pick the correct option from the ones provided. The options are:\n\nA. Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nB. Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica.\n\nC. Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan.\n\nD. Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what \"less developed countries\" means in this context. Generally, \"less developed\" refers to countries that have lower levels of industrialization, economic growth, or human development compared to more developed nations. But the term can be a bit vague, so I should consider that.\n\nAlso, the question mentions \"high secondary-school enrollment.\" I need to know what the enrollment rates are for these countries. Secondary education typically covers ages roughly between 12 and 18, but it can vary by country.\n\nI don't have specific enrollment data off the top of my head, so I'll need to recall or look up some general information about these countries.\n\nLet's start by considering each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nI know that Uruguay and Costa Rica are often praised for their education systems in Latin America. Uruguay has a strong emphasis on education, and Costa Rica is known for having high literacy rates and investing heavily in education. Colombia and Peru also have made strides in education, but perhaps not as high as Uruguay and Costa Rica in terms of secondary enrollment.\n\nOption B: Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica.\n\nBhutan is a small country in South Asia, and while it has made progress in education, I think its secondary enrollment might not be as high as some other countries in this list. Niger is in West Africa and is one of the poorest countries in the world, so I doubt its secondary enrollment is very high. Cambodia has been recovering from past conflicts and has improving education indicators, but again, I don't think it reaches the levels of some other countries in the list. Costa Rica, however, is known for its good education system.\n\nOption C: Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan.\n\nUruguay and Costa Rica are again in this option, and as I thought earlier, they have strong education systems. Timor-Leste is a young country in Southeast Asia that gained independence relatively recently and might still be building its education system. Pakistan is a large country with varying education levels, but generally, its enrollment rates might not be as high as some other countries in this list.\n\nOption D: Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nSimilar to option B, Bhutan and Cambodia might not have as high secondary enrollment rates as Uruguay and Costa Rica.\n\nGiven this, I'm leaning towards option A, which includes Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. I know that Uruguay and Costa Rica have high enrollment rates, and Colombia and Peru are also known for their education systems, though perhaps not as high as Uruguay and Costa Rica.\n\nBut to make sure, I should think a bit more about the specific enrollment rates.\n\nI recall that in Latin America, countries like Argentina, Chile, Cuba, and Panama also have high secondary enrollment rates. However, they are not in this list.\n\nWait, the question specifies \"less developed countries.\" Even though some Latin American countries have good education systems, they might still be considered less developed compared to, say, Western European countries or the US.\n\nBut I need to consider the context of the question. Maybe \"less developed\" here refers to countries that are not highly industrialized or have lower GDP per capita.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to highlight that even among less developed countries, some have managed to achieve high secondary enrollment rates.\n\nGiven that, perhaps all the countries in the options are considered less developed, but some have higher enrollment rates than others.\n\nIn that case, I need to identify which group has the highest secondary enrollment rates.\n\nAs I thought earlier, Uruguay and Costa Rica are consistently mentioned in discussions about education in Latin America for their high enrollment and literacy rates.\n\nLet me consider if I can recall any specific numbers. I think Uruguay has a secondary enrollment ratio close to 90%, and Costa Rica is also high, maybe around 80-90%. Colombia and Peru might be slightly lower, perhaps around 70-80%.\n\nIn contrast, countries like Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Pakistan might have lower secondary enrollment rates, possibly below 50%.\n\nTherefore, option A seems the most plausible, as it includes Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica, all of which are known for relatively high secondary enrollment rates in the context of less developed countries.\n\nOption D includes Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. Since I suspect Bhutan and Cambodia have lower enrollment rates, this option might not be accurate.\n\nSimilarly, option B includes Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica. Again, Bhutan, Niger, and Cambodia might not have high secondary enrollment rates.\n\nOption C includes Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan. Timor-Leste is a young country still developing its education system, and Pakistan might have lower enrollment rates, so this option might not be entirely accurate either.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to go with option A: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll double-check my knowledge.\n\nI know that in Latin America, there has been a push towards universal education, and many countries have made significant progress in recent decades. Colombia and Peru are part of this trend, with increasing enrollment rates at the secondary level.\n\nUruguay, in particular, has a long tradition of valuing education and has high enrollment and completion rates in secondary education.\n\nCosta Rica is also renowned for its commitment to education, having abolished its army in 1948 and investing a larger portion of its budget in education and health.\n\nIn contrast, countries like Bhutan and Niger face challenges in providing education to all their children, especially at the secondary level, due to factors such as limited resources, geographical barriers, and cultural norms.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
