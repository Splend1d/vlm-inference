                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about self-verification theory. It says that according to this theory, a husband who has low self-esteem, is overweight, and is chronically depressed would prefer his wife to do what regarding his abilities, weight, and mood. The options are:\n\nA. not comment on them at all.\n\nB. make neutral comments about them.\n\nC. confirm his negative self-evaluations.\n\nD. contradict his negative self-evaluations.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what self-verification theory is all about. From what I recall, self-verification theory suggests that people have a desire to confirm their self-concept, whether that self-concept is positive or negative. So, even if someone has a negative self-view, they might prefer others to see them in that same negative light because it matches their self-perception.\n\nGiven that, the husband in question has low self-esteem, is overweight, and is chronically depressed. That means he likely has negative self-evaluations about his abilities, his weight, and his mood. According to self-verification theory, he would prefer others, including his wife, to see him in a way that aligns with his own self-view.\n\nSo, if he sees himself as having low abilities, being overweight, and being in a bad mood often, he might prefer his wife to recognize and acknowledge those things rather than ignore them or try to contradict them.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. not comment on his abilities, weight, and mood.\n\nThis might be seen as avoiding the issue, which might not satisfy his desire for verification.\n\nB. make neutral comments about his abilities, weight, and mood.\n\nNeutral comments might not align with his negative self-view, so this might not provide the verification he seeks.\n\nC. confirm his negative self-evaluations.\n\nThis seems to align perfectly with self-verification theory. If his self-view is negative, he would prefer others to confirm that view.\n\nD. contradict his negative self-evaluations.\n\nThis would be the opposite of what self-verification theory would predict. Contradicting his negative self-view would go against his desired self-perception.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think a bit deeper. Is there any chance that the husband might prefer option D, where his wife contradicts his negative self-evaluations? Maybe if he wants to be encouraged or supported to change his self-perception, but according to self-verification theory, that's not what he would prefer. He would prefer consistency with his existing self-view.\n\nAlso, option A is about not commenting at all. While that might be a way to avoid conflict, it doesn't provide any information that confirms his self-view, which according to the theory, is what he seeks.\n\nOption B is neutral comments. These might not be negative, but they also might not be positive enough to contradict his negative self-view. So, they might not provide the verification he's looking for.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward answer based on self-verification theory is option C: confirm his negative self-evaluations.\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
