                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find out at how many points on the interval [0, \u03c0] the function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x satisfies the Mean Value Theorem. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states.\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem says that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in (a, b) where the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over [a, b]. In other words:\n\nf'(c) = (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)\n\nSo, for my function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x on the interval [0, \u03c0], I need to find all points c in (0, \u03c0) where this equality holds.\n\nFirst, I should check if f(x) is continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, \u03c0]. Since sine is continuous and differentiable everywhere, their combinations are too. So, f(x) is continuous on [0, \u03c0] and differentiable on (0, \u03c0).\n\nNext, I need to compute f(0) and f(\u03c0).\n\nLet's calculate f(0):\n\nf(0) = 2 sin(0) + sin(4*0) = 2*0 + 0 = 0\n\nNow, f(\u03c0):\n\nf(\u03c0) = 2 sin(\u03c0) + sin(4\u03c0) = 2*0 + 0 = 0\n\nInteresting, both f(0) and f(\u03c0) are 0. So, the average rate of change over [0, \u03c0] is:\n\n(f(\u03c0) - f(0))/(\u03c0 - 0) = (0 - 0)/\u03c0 = 0/\u03c0 = 0\n\nSo, I need to find all points c in (0, \u03c0) where f'(c) = 0.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of f(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2 sin x + sin 4x) = 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x\n\nSet f'(x) equal to 0:\n\n2 cos x + 4 cos 4x = 0\n\nI can factor out a 2:\n\n2 (cos x + 2 cos 4x) = 0\n\nSo, cos x + 2 cos 4x = 0\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can express cos 4x in terms of cos x to make it easier to solve.\n\nRecall that cos 4x = 2 cos\u00b2 2x - 1 and cos 2x = 2 cos\u00b2 x - 1.\n\nSo, cos 4x = 2(2 cos\u00b2 x - 1)\u00b2 - 1 = 2(4 cos\u2074 x - 4 cos\u00b2 x + 1) - 1 = 8 cos\u2074 x - 8 cos\u00b2 x + 2 - 1 = 8 cos\u2074 x - 8 cos\u00b2 x + 1\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the equation cos x + 2 cos 4x = 0.\n\nLet me denote cos x as y for simplicity.\n\nSo, y + 2 cos 4x = 0 \u21d2 cos 4x = -y/2\n\nNow, cos 4x = 2 cos\u00b2 2x - 1\n\nAnd cos 2x = 2 cos\u00b2 x - 1 = 2 y\u00b2 - 1\n\nSo, cos 4x = 2(2 y\u00b2 - 1)\u00b2 - 1 = 2(4 y\u2074 - 4 y\u00b2 + 1) - 1 = 8 y\u2074 - 8 y\u00b2 + 2 - 1 = 8 y\u2074 - 8 y\u00b2 + 1\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can graph f'(x) = 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x and see how many times it crosses the x-axis between 0 and \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for symmetry or properties of trigonometric functions to simplify the equation.\n\nLet me consider the function g(x) = cos x + 2 cos 4x.\n\nI need to solve g(x) = 0 on (0, \u03c0).\n\nFirst, note that g(0) = cos 0 + 2 cos 0 = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nAnd g(\u03c0) = cos \u03c0 + 2 cos 4\u03c0 = -1 + 2*1 = -1 + 2 = 1\n\nSo, g(x) goes from 3 at x=0 to 1 at x=\u03c0.\n\nNow, let's see if I can find the roots of g(x) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that cos 4x = cos(4x), and see if there's a way to express this in terms of multiple angles.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the multiple-angle identities to express cos 4x in terms of cos x.\n\nRecall that cos 4x = 8 cos\u2074 x - 8 cos\u00b2 x + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ncos x + 2 (8 cos\u2074 x - 8 cos\u00b2 x + 1) = 0\n\nLet me set y = cos x.\n\nThen, the equation is:\n\ny + 16 y\u2074 - 16 y\u00b2 + 2 = 0\n\nSo, 16 y\u2074 - 16 y\u00b2 + y + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quartic equation in terms of y. Solving quartic equations can be complicated, but maybe I can factor it somehow.\n\nLet me see if I can find rational roots using the rational root theorem.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 2 over factors of 16, so \u00b11/8, \u00b11/4, \u00b11/2, \u00b11.\n\nLet's test y = 1/2:\n\n16*(1/16) - 16*(1/4) + 1/2 + 2 = 1 - 4 + 0.5 + 2 = -0.5 \u2260 0\n\ny = -1/2:\n\n16*(1/16) - 16*(1/4) -1/2 + 2 = 1 - 4 -0.5 + 2 = -1.5 \u2260 0\n\ny = 1:\n\n16 - 16 +1 +2 =3 \u22600\n\ny = -1:\n\n16 -16 -1 +2 =1 \u22600\n\ny =0:\n\n0 -0 +0 +2=2 \u22600\n\nHmm, no rational roots. Maybe I can try to factor it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can treat it as a quadratic in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nLet me set z = y\u00b2, then the equation becomes:\n\n16 z\u00b2 -16 z + y +2 =0\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to consider it as:\n\n16 y\u2074 -16 y\u00b2 + y +2 =0\n\nLet me try to group terms:\n\n(16 y\u2074 -16 y\u00b2) + (y +2) =0\n\nFactor 16 y\u00b2 from the first group:\n\n16 y\u00b2 (y\u00b2 -1) + (y +2) =0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider numerical methods to approximate the roots, but since this is a theoretical problem, I should try to find an exact solution.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can consider the original equation again: 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x =0\n\nI can factor out 2:\n\n2 (cos x + 2 cos 4x) =0 \u21d2 cos x + 2 cos 4x =0\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express cos 4x in terms of sin x.\n\nRecall that cos 4x = cos(4x) = cos(2*2x) = 2 cos\u00b2 2x -1 = 2 (2 cos\u00b2 x -1)\u00b2 -1 = 2 (4 cos\u2074 x -4 cos\u00b2 x +1) -1 = 8 cos\u2074 x -8 cos\u00b2 x +2 -1 =8 cos\u2074 x -8 cos\u00b2 x +1\n\nSo, plugging back into the equation:\n\ncos x + 2 (8 cos\u2074 x -8 cos\u00b2 x +1) =0 \u21d2 cos x +16 cos\u2074 x -16 cos\u00b2 x +2 =0\n\nAgain, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x\n\nPerhaps I can look for its derivative f'(x) = 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x\n\nAnd set f'(x) =0 \u21d2 2 cos x +4 cos 4x =0 \u21d2 cos x +2 cos 4x =0\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function in terms of exponentials using Euler's formula, but that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation cos x +2 cos 4x =0 and look for solutions in terms of x.\n\nLet me recall that cos 4x = cos(4x), and see if I can find x such that this equation holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the fact that cos 4x = 2 cos\u00b2 2x -1 = 2 (2 cos\u00b2 x -1)\u00b2 -1 = 2 (4 cos\u2074 x -4 cos\u00b2 x +1) -1 =8 cos\u2074 x -8 cos\u00b2 x +1\n\nSo, plugging back:\n\ncos x +2 (8 cos\u2074 x -8 cos\u00b2 x +1) =0 \u21d2 cos x +16 cos\u2074 x -16 cos\u00b2 x +2 =0\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x on [0,\u03c0]\n\nI need to find all c in (0,\u03c0) such that f'(c) =0\n\nGiven that f(0)=0 and f(\u03c0)=0, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait a minute, since f(0)=f(\u03c0)=0, and f is continuous on [0,\u03c0] and differentiable on (0,\u03c0), the Mean Value Theorem guarantees at least one point c in (0,\u03c0) where f'(c)=0.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many such points exist.\n\nGiven that f(0)=f(\u03c0)=0, and f is continuous and differentiable, perhaps Rolle's Theorem applies, which is a special case of MVT.\n\nRolle's Theorem states that if f(a)=f(b)=0, and f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), then there exists at least one c in (a,b) where f'(c)=0.\n\nSo, there is at least one such c.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many such points exist.\n\nTo find the number of points where f'(c)=0, I need to analyze the derivative f'(x)=2 cos x +4 cos 4x.\n\nI need to find the number of solutions to 2 cos x +4 cos 4x =0 on (0,\u03c0).\n\nThis seems difficult to solve analytically, so maybe I can consider the behavior of the function and its derivative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can plot f(x) and see how many times it has horizontal tangents on [0,\u03c0].\n\nBut since plotting isn't feasible here, maybe I can consider specific points or look for symmetry.\n\nLet me consider x=\u03c0/2:\n\nf(\u03c0/2)=2 sin(\u03c0/2) + sin(4*(\u03c0/2))=2*1 + sin(2\u03c0)=2+0=2\n\nf'(\u03c0/2)=2 cos(\u03c0/2) +4 cos(4*(\u03c0/2))=2*0 +4 cos(2\u03c0)=0 +4*1=4 \u22600\n\nSo, \u03c0/2 is not a solution.\n\nWhat about x=\u03c0/4:\n\nf'(\u03c0/4)=2 cos(\u03c0/4) +4 cos(4*(\u03c0/4))=2*(\u221a2/2) +4 cos(\u03c0)=\u221a2 -4=1.414 -4=-2.59 \u22600\n\nNot zero.\n\nx=\u03c0/6:\n\nf'(\u03c0/6)=2 cos(\u03c0/6) +4 cos(4*(\u03c0/6))=2*(\u221a3/2) +4 cos(2\u03c0/3)=\u221a3 +4*(-1/2)=\u221a3 -2\u22481.732 -2=-0.268 \u22600\n\nNot zero.\n\nx=\u03c0/3:\n\nf'(\u03c0/3)=2 cos(\u03c0/3) +4 cos(4*(\u03c0/3))=2*(1/2) +4 cos(4\u03c0/3)=1 +4*(-1/2)=1 -2=-1 \u22600\n\nNot zero.\n\nx=3\u03c0/4:\n\nf'(3\u03c0/4)=2 cos(3\u03c0/4) +4 cos(4*(3\u03c0/4))=2*(-\u221a2/2) +4 cos(3\u03c0)= -\u221a2 +4*(-1)=-\u221a2 -4\u2248-2.414 \u22600\n\nNot zero.\n\nx=5\u03c0/6:\n\nf'(5\u03c0/6)=2 cos(5\u03c0/6) +4 cos(4*(5\u03c0/6))=2*(-\u221a3/2) +4 cos(10\u03c0/3)= -\u221a3 +4*cos(10\u03c0/3)= -\u221a3 +4*(-1/2)= -\u221a3 -2\u2248 -3.732 \u22600\n\nNot zero.\n\nHmm, none of these standard angles seem to satisfy f'(x)=0.\n\nMaybe I need to consider numerical methods or look for symmetry in the function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that f(x) is an odd function, but since sin x is odd and sin 4x is also odd, their sum is odd.\n\nWait, sin x is odd, sin 4x is odd, so their sum is odd.\n\nBut on [0,\u03c0], the function might have certain properties.\n\nGiven that f(0)=f(\u03c0)=0, and f is odd, perhaps there are multiple points where the derivative is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the second derivative to understand the concavity and find inflection points.\n\nLet me compute the second derivative f''(x).\n\nf'(x)=2 cos x +4 cos 4x\n\nf''(x)=-2 sin x -16 sin 4x\n\nNow, to find points of inflection, set f''(x)=0:\n\n-2 sin x -16 sin 4x =0 \u21d2 sin x +8 sin 4x =0\n\nAgain, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the original equation f'(x)=0 and see if I can factor it or find a substitution that simplifies it.\n\nLet me consider the equation again: 2 cos x +4 cos 4x =0 \u21d2 cos x +2 cos 4x =0\n\nMaybe I can express cos 4x in terms of cos x.\n\nRecall that cos 4x = 8 cos\u2074 x -8 cos\u00b2 x +1\n\nSo, plugging back in:\n\ncos x +2 (8 cos\u2074 x -8 cos\u00b2 x +1)=0 \u21d2 cos x +16 cos\u2074 x -16 cos\u00b2 x +2=0\n\nThis is a quartic equation in terms of cos x.\n\nLet me set y=cos x, then the equation becomes:\n\n16 y\u2074 -16 y\u00b2 + y +2=0\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which might be difficult to solve analytically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider this as a quadratic in terms of y\u00b2.\n\nLet me set z=y\u00b2, then the equation becomes:\n\n16 z\u00b2 -16 z + y +2=0\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.
