The contract also provided that the agent was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent succeeded in finding a buyer for the parcel. The agent notified the nephew that he had found a developer who wanted to purchase the parcel for $500,000. The agent handed the nephew a real estate sales contract, signed by the developer, in which the developer agreed to pay $500,000 for the purchase of the parcel.

                    "text": "So I've got this situation here involving a nephew who inherited some land and a real estate agent who helped him find a buyer. The agent found a developer willing to buy the land for $500,000, and the nephew signed the sales contract. But then the developer backed out without cause, and now the agent wants to sue the nephew for his commission. I need to figure out what the agent's proper measure of recovery is if he sues for breach of the brokerage agreement.\n\nFirst, let's understand the relationship between the parties. The nephew and the agent had a contract where the agent would try to find a buyer for the land, and if the sale went through, the agent would get a 5% commission on the sale price. The agent found a buyer, the developer, who agreed to pay $500,000. The nephew signed the sales contract, but then the developer reneged on the deal.\n\nNow, the agent wants to enforce the brokerage agreement against the nephew. The question is, what can the agent recover? Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Nothing, because as a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the nephew and the developer, the agent can enforce the contract only against the developer, but not against the nephew.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit confusing. The agent has a separate contract with the nephew for finding a buyer, not directly with the developer. So, the agent isn't a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the nephew and the developer. He has a direct contract with the nephew for his services. So, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nB. Nothing, because the consummation condition has not been fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal to sue the developer will not excuse that condition.\n\nOkay, so the commission is supposed to be paid \"following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title.\" Since the sale didn't go through because the developer backed out, the condition of consummation wasn't met. But the question is whether the agent can still recover his commission.\n\nI think the key here is whether the failure to consummate the sale was due to something beyond the agent's control. If the agent fulfilled his part by finding a willing buyer, and the buyer backed out, is that the agent's fault? Probably not. So, maybe the agent shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nC. $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5% on the sale of the property for $500,000, because fulfillment of the consummation condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control.\n\nThis seems plausible. The agent found a buyer who was willing to pay $500,000, but the buyer backed out without cause. This was an event beyond the agent's control, so perhaps the agent is entitled to his commission anyway.\n\nD. $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5% on the sale of the property for $500,000, because all conditions precedent to the nephew's duty to pay the commission were substantially fulfilled when the nephew and the developer entered into the land sale contract.\n\nThis option suggests that even though the sale didn't go through, the agent has substantially performed his\u4e49\u52a1 by finding a buyer, so he should get his commission.\n\nI need to think about which of these makes the most sense legally.\n\nFirst, the agent had a contract with the nephew to find a buyer, and the commission was to be paid upon consummation of the sale. The agent found a buyer, the developer, who agreed to buy the land for $500,000. The nephew signed the sales contract, but then the developer backed out.\n\nSo, the agent has performed his part by finding a buyer. The failure to consummate the sale was due to the developer backing out, which was beyond the agent's control.\n\nIn such cases, the law often looks at whether the agent has substantially performed his obligations. If the agent has done what was required of him\u2014finding a buyer willing to purchase at the agreed price\u2014the commission may be payable even if the sale doesn't go through due to the buyer's default.\n\nMoreover, the agent's commission is typically earned when he procures a buyer ready, willing, and able to purchase at the specified terms. Once that happens, the commission becomes payable, and the seller can't avoid paying it just because the buyer later backs out.\n\nIn this scenario, the agent found a buyer who signed a contract to buy the land for $500,000. The nephew signed the contract, indicating that the agent had successfully found a buyer acceptable to the nephew.\n\nThe developer then repudiated the contract without cause, which is not the agent's fault. The agent shouldn't be punished for the buyer's default.\n\nTherefore, the agent should be entitled to his commission of 5% of $500,000, which is $25,000.\n\nLooking back at the options, both C and D suggest $25,000, but the reasoning differs slightly.\n\nOption C says that the consummation condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control.\n\nOption D says that all conditions precedent to the nephew's duty to pay the commission were substantially fulfilled when the nephew and the developer entered into the land sale contract.\n\nI think both reasonings are valid, but perhaps option D is a bit more precise in terms of contract law. The agent's obligation was to find a buyer willing to purchase at the specified terms, which he did. The consummation of the sale was contingent on the buyer's performance, which failed, but the agent's part was substantially fulfilled when the contract was signed.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure I'm not missing something here. Maybe I should consider whether the agent has a duty to mitigate damages or if there are any other conditions that need to be met.\n\nAlso, option A suggests that the agent can't enforce the contract against the nephew because he's a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the nephew and the developer. But that doesn't seem right because the agent has a direct contract with the nephew for his services. The agent isn't a party to the contract between the nephew and the developer.\n\nSimilarly, option B says the agent gets nothing because the consummation condition wasn't met, and the nephew's refusal to sue the developer doesn't excuse that condition. But if the agent has already substantially performed by finding a\u5408\u683c buyer, and the failure to consummate is due to the buyer's default, not the agent's, then the agent should still be entitled to his commission.\n\nI think the correct answer is D: $25,000, because all conditions precedent to the nephew's duty to pay the commission were substantially fulfilled when the nephew and the developer entered into the land sale contract.\n\nSo, the agent should be able to recover his commission from the nephew, as he has substantially performed his obligations under their agreement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
