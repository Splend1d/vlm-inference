                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's about understanding why the hopes of a person, presumably Halima Ghomri, weren't met after Algeria's war of independence. The first text is from Olympe de Gouges in 1791, talking about women's rights and the French Revolution. The second text is from Halima Ghomri in the 1970s, reflecting on Algeria's independence.\n\nSo, the question is asking which factor is most likely to have prevented the progress that Halima Ghomri hoped for after Algeria's independence. The options are:\n\nA. Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism\n\nB. Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure\n\nC. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites\n\nD. Prioritization of national liberation over social reform\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Halima Ghomri is saying. She mentions that after the war of independence, not much has changed for her and her family. They were poor peasants before and remain poor peasants after independence. The only difference is that they are free and can work without fear. But education for her children, which she hoped for, didn't happen.\n\nSo, her main concern is about the persistence of poverty and lack of educational opportunities despite gaining independence.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism.\n\nThis suggests that traditional Islamic values might be hindering progress. But the passage doesn't mention anything about religion or Islamic traditions. Halima is talking about economic and educational issues, not cultural or religious ones. So, this seems like a stretch.\n\nOption B: Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure.\n\nThis could be a factor. If Algeria didn't have strong industrial bases or infrastructure, it might struggle to develop economically, which could affect education and poverty levels. However, the passage doesn't provide specific information about Algeria's industrial or infrastructure status in the 1970s. It's possible, but not directly supported by the information given.\n\nOption C: Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites.\n\nThis option points to potential resistance from the new leaders or elites in Algeria after independence. If these leaders were opposed to women's rights, that could hinder progress in areas like education for women and girls, which might affect Halima's hopes for her children.\n\nBut, the passage doesn't specify anything about women's rights or the attitudes of the new elites. Halima mentions that nothing has changed for her family, but she doesn't specify any issues related to women's rights directly.\n\nOption D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform.\n\nThis seems plausible. Perhaps during the struggle for independence, the focus was mainly on achieving political freedom and less on addressing social issues like poverty and education. After independence, the new government might still be primarily focused on consolidating power and dealing with the aftermath of the war, rather than immediately implementing social reforms.\n\nThis could explain why Halima didn't see the changes she hoped for in education and economic conditions for her family.\n\nComparing all the options, D seems the most directly relevant based on the information provided. The other options speculate on cultural, religious, or infrastructural factors, but the passage primarily discusses the lack of social progress despite achieving independence.\n\nSo, my answer would be D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any implicit information that might point towards another answer.\n\nFor example, if Halima is specifically referring to women's education, maybe option C is relevant. But she doesn't specify that; she just says her children didn't get an education. It could be both boys and girls, though often in such contexts, girls' education might be more impacted.\n\nHowever, since she doesn't specify, it's safer to stick with the general social reforms, which would include education for all children, not just girls.\n\nAlso, option A seems to be reaching beyond what's stated. There's no mention of Islam or traditionalism in her statement.\n\nOption B is possible, but again, there's no information in the passage to support it.\n\nTherefore, option D remains the most logical choice based on the given information.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
