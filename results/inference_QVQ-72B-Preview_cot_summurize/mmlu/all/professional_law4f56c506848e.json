                    "text": "So I have this question here about contracts between a client and an attorney when there's no explicit agreement on fees. It's asking what kind of contract exists in that situation. The options are:\n\nA. An implied-in-fact contract.\n\nB. An implied-in-law contract.\n\nC. An express contract.\n\nD. No contract.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each type of contract is.\n\nStarting with an express contract: this is when there's a clear, explicit agreement between two parties, either in writing or orally, that specifies the terms and conditions of their agreement. So, if a client and an attorney sit down and agree that the attorney will handle a case for a specific fee, that would be an express contract.\n\nNow, an implied-in-fact contract is a bit different. This type of contract is not explicitly stated but is inferred from the actions or conduct of the parties involved. For example, if a client hires an attorney without discussing fees, but the attorney provides services and the client accepts them, the court might imply that there was an agreement based on customary fees for similar services.\n\nThen there's an implied-in-law contract, also known as a quasi-contract. This isn't really a contract at all, but a remedy imposed by the court to prevent unjust enrichment. It's used when there's no actual agreement between the parties, but it would be unfair for one party to benefit without paying for it. For instance, if an attorney provides services to a client who doesn't pay because there was no agreement on fees, the court might order the client to pay a reasonable fee to prevent them from being unjustly enriched by the attorney's services.\n\nFinally, there's the option that there's no contract at all. This would mean that no agreement was formed between the client and the attorney, and thus, the attorney cannot enforce payment for their services.\n\nGiven this background, the question is about a scenario where a client accepts the services of an attorney without any agreement concerning the amount of the fee. So, there's no express contract here because there's no clear agreement on the terms.\n\nBut does that mean there's no contract at all? I don't think so. Courts generally don't like to leave people able to receive services without any obligation to pay for them, especially if they knowingly accept the services.\n\nSo, in this case, since there's no express contract, the court might look to imply a contract based on the circumstances. This is where the implied-in-fact contract comes in. If the client hired the attorney and the attorney provided services, the court might infer that there was an agreement to pay a reasonable fee for those services, even if the exact amount wasn't specified.\n\nAn implied-in-law contract, on the other hand, is more of a last resort when there's no actual contract. It's a remedy to prevent one party from being unjustly enriched at the expense of another. So, if there was no implied-in-fact contract, the court might impose an implied-in-law contract to make sure the attorney gets paid a fair amount.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the client accepted the services, it seems like there's at least an implied-in-fact contract to pay a reasonable fee. Therefore, I think option A, an implied-in-fact contract, is the most appropriate answer.\n\nLet me double-check this. If there's no express contract, but the parties' actions suggest that they intended to enter into a contract, then an implied-in-fact contract can be recognized. In the context of attorney-client relationships, it's common for courts to imply such contracts to ensure that attorneys are compensated for their work when there's no explicit agreement.\n\nAn implied-in-law contract would be more relevant if there was no implied-in-fact contract and the court needed to step in to prevent the client from benefiting without paying. But in this case, since there's a basis for implying a contract based on the parties' conduct, it's likely that an implied-in-fact contract would be recognized first.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A. An implied-in-fact contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
