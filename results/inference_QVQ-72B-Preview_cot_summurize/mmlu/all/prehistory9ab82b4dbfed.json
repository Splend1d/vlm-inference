                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what John Frere discovered in 1797. The options are:\n\nA. animal remains scattered on the surface of the ground.\n\nB. the earliest written documents.\n\nC. primitive stone tools excavated at great depth.\n\nD. human skulls with ape-like features.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who John Frere was and what he discovered. I remember that John Frere was an English antiquary and archaeologist. He was involved in some significant archaeological findings, particularly in England.\n\nLet me think about the context of his work. In 1797, during the excavation of a quarry in Hoxne, Suffolk, England, Frere came across some unusual artifacts. I believe these were stone tools, possibly handaxes and scrapers, which are typically associated with early human activity.\n\nOption C mentions primitive stone tools excavated at great depth. That sounds plausible. Frere is known for recognizing that these tools were of great antiquity, possibly from a time when the climate in England was similar to that of modern-day Germany, which was colder.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: animal remains scattered on the surface of the ground. While it's possible that animal remains were found, Frere is more famous for discovering stone tools, not just any animal remains. Moreover, the significance was in the excavation and the depth at which these tools were found, suggesting great age.\n\nOption B: the earliest written documents. I don't recall Frere being associated with the discovery of written documents. His work was more related to prehistoric times, before written records existed.\n\nOption D: human skulls with ape-like features. This seems similar to early hominid remains, like those of Neanderthals or earlier humans. However, Frere's discoveries were primarily stone tools, not human remains. While he might have found bone fragments, I don't think human skulls were part of his notable discoveries.\n\nGiven this information, option C seems the most accurate. Frere did excavate primitive stone tools from a significant depth, which led him to conclude that they were of great antiquity. This was a groundbreaking realization because it suggested that humans had been present in the area much earlier than previously thought.\n\nTo double-check, I can recall that Frere's findings were presented to the Antiquarian Society in 1797, where he argued that the stone tools found at Hoxne were not recent but belonged to a much earlier period, possibly during a different geological era.\n\nSo, in summary, John Frere discovered primitive stone tools excavated at great depth in 1797, which aligns with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
