                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about electoral systems with single-member districts. I'm not entirely sure what all the terms mean, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, a single-member district means that each voting district elects only one representative, right? Like, in some countries, each constituency sends one person to parliament. I think the United States House of Representatives works that way.\n\nOption A says that only two major parties can successfully be supported in such a system. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I've heard of the idea that single-member districts tend to favor a two-party system. Maybe it's because smaller parties have a harder time winning seats if they can't get a majority in any one district. So, perhaps A is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's look at option C, which says third parties can be as successful as the two major parties. That seems to contradict A. Can both be true? Probably not. So, if A is true, C should be false.\n\nOption B says national campaigns can be conducted without incurring great expense. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Even if districts are small, running a campaign in many districts across a large country like the U.S. could still be pretty expensive. But maybe in smaller countries, it's less costly. I need to think about that.\n\nOption D says each political party tends to focus its campaign on a single issue. That doesn't seem right. Most political parties have multiple platforms and focus on several issues, not just one. Maybe some parties focus on a specific issue, but it's not a general rule for all parties in such a system.\n\nLet me think again. If single-member districts favor larger parties, then smaller parties might struggle to win seats, which could lead to a two-party system. So, A seems plausible.\n\nBut, in reality, there are countries with single-member districts that have more than two major parties. For example, the UK has had multiple parties, like the Conservatives, Labour, Liberals, and others, although the two big ones dominate.\n\nWait, but in the UK, the electoral system is first-past-the-post, which is a type of single-member district system, and it tends to produce a two-party system or a dominant two-party system with some smaller parties on the fringes.\n\nSo, maybe A is generally true, but there are exceptions.\n\nOption B: national campaigns can be cheap. I don't think that's necessarily the case. Even in the U.S., presidential campaigns are incredibly expensive, and that's a single-member district system for the presidency (each state is like a district with electoral votes). So, I doubt that's a direct result of single-member districts.\n\nOption C: third parties can be as successful as the two major parties. Well, in practice, in systems with single-member districts, third parties often struggle to win seats because they can't get a majority in any one district. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption D: parties focus on a single issue. No, that doesn't make sense. Parties usually have a range of policies on different issues.\n\nAlright, after considering all this, I think the best answer is A: only two major parties can successfully be supported. It's not that only two parties can exist, but in practice, it's hard for more than two to gain significant representation in the legislature.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
