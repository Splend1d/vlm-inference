                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about a species that gives birth to only one offspring at a time and has a relatively long life-span for its body size. And I need to figure out which of these options is probably also true for this organism. The options are:\n\nA. It lives in a newly colonized habitat.\n\nB. It is an aquatic organism.\n\nC. It requires relatively high parental care of offspring.\n\nD. The age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young.\n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to understand what it means for a species to have these traits. Giving birth to only one offspring at a time and having a long lifespan suggests that this species might be K-selected rather than r-selected. I remember from biology class that r-selected species are those that produce many offspring at once but provide little to no parental care, and they tend to have shorter lifespans. On the other hand, K-selected species produce fewer offspring but invest more in each one, providing greater parental care, and they tend to have longer lifespans.\n\nSo, if this species is giving birth to only one offspring at a time and has a long lifespan, it sounds like it's more towards the K-selection end of the spectrum. That means it probably invests a lot in each offspring, which would align with option C: it requires relatively high parental care of offspring.\n\nBut let's think about the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: it lives in a newly colonized habitat. I'm not sure about this one. Newly colonized habitats might favor species that can rapidly increase their population sizes, which would suggest r-selected traits\u2014producing many offspring quickly but with less care. But this species seems to have K-selected traits, so maybe not. Maybe this species is better adapted to stable environments where competition is high and resources are limited, which is typical for K-selected species.\n\nOption B: it is an aquatic organism. Hmm, being aquatic doesn't necessarily correlate with having one offspring at a time or a long lifespan. Some aquatic organisms like fish can lay thousands of eggs at a time, which is more r-selected, while others like dolphins have one calf at a time, which is more K-selected. So, just being aquatic isn't a strong indicator one way or the other.\n\nOption D: the age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young. This sounds more like an r-selected trait. r-selected species typically mature faster and start reproducing earlier in life to maximize their reproductive output. But our species seems to be more K-selected, which would suggest that they might mature slower and start reproducing at a later age, investing more in growth and development before reproducing.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C seems the most fitting. If the species gives birth to only one offspring at a time and has a long lifespan, it's likely that each offspring requires a significant amount of care and investment from the parents. That makes sense because if you're only having one child at a time, you can afford to put a lot into it.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe considering specific examples. For instance, elephants are known for having one calf at a time and a long lifespan, and they provide extensive parental care. Similarly, humans often have one child at a time (though this can vary) and have long lifespans, and parents invest a lot in their children.\n\nOn the other hand, mice have multiple offspring at a time, short lifespans, and less parental care. They mature quickly and start reproducing early, which aligns with option D.\n\nSo, again, this points towards option C being correct for our species in question.\n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions or special cases that might make another option seem plausible. For example, some species might have one offspring at a time but still not provide much parental care, but I can't think of any off the top of my head. Most species that have single offspring seem to invest heavily in them.\n\nOption A, living in a newly colonized habitat, might favor species that can quickly exploit new resources and spread, which again sounds more like r-selection, not K-selection.\n\nOption B, being aquatic, doesn't seem directly related to the traits mentioned, so it's probably not the answer.\n\nOption D directly contradicts the idea of K-selection, as K-selected species tend to have later maturity and longer intervals between reproductions.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options and relating them to the concepts of r-selection and K-selection, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer. The species likely requires relatively high parental care of offspring.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
