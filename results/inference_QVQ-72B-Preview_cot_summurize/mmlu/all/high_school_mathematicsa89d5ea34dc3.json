I need to simplify the expression:\n\n\\[(9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7) + (x^{11} + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8)\\]\n\nAnd express the answer as a polynomial with terms in decreasing order of degree.\n\nFirst, I should combine like terms. Like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\nLet's list out all the terms together:\n\n\\[9x^9 + 7x^8 + 4x^7 + x^{11} + x^9 + 2x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\\]\n\nNow, I'll group the terms by their exponents to make it easier to combine them.\n\nStarting with the highest degree:\n\n1. \\(x^{11}\\): only one term, so it stays as \\(x^{11}\\).\n\n2. \\(x^9\\): we have \\(9x^9 + x^9 = 10x^9\\).\n\n3. \\(x^8\\): only one term, \\(7x^8\\).\n\n4. \\(x^7\\): \\(4x^7 + 2x^7 = 6x^7\\).\n\n5. \\(x^3\\): only one term, \\(3x^3\\).\n\n6. \\(x\\): only one term, \\(5x\\).\n\n7. Constant term: only one term, 8.\n\nNow, I'll write down the combined terms in decreasing order of degree:\n\n\\[x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\\]\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. \\(x^{11} + 2x^9 + 2x^8\\)\n\nB. \\(x^{11} - 6x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\\)\n\nC. \\(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\\)\n\nD. \\(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\\)\n\nWait a minute, options C and D look the same. Maybe there's a typo, or perhaps it's intentional to see if I'm paying attention.\n\nAnyway, comparing my result with the options:\n\n- My simplified expression is \\(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\\).\n\n- Option A is different.\n\n- Option B has a negative sign and different coefficients.\n\n- Options C and D seem identical to my answer.\n\nBut since options C and D are the same, and both match my calculation, maybe the correct answer is both C and D. However, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, and C and D are supposed to be different. If that's the case, then I need to stick with my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is D, assuming that C might have a typo.\n\nWait, looking closely, option C has an extra \"3x^3\" term, which seems like a typo because it appears twice: once with \"+3x^3\" and another with \"+5x+8\". Maybe it's supposed to be just \"+5x+8\" without the \"+3x^3\".\n\nIf that's the case, then option C would be:\n\n\\[x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 5x + 8\\]\n\nWhich matches my calculation except for the missing \\(3x^3\\) term.\n\nBut in my calculation, I have \\(3x^3\\), so option C as written doesn't match.\n\nOption D matches my calculation perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: \\(x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8\\).\n\nAlternatively, if option C is supposed to have only one \"+3x^3\", then it might be a typo, and the correct answer is C with the \"+3x^3\" included only once.\n\nBut based on the given options, option D matches exactly with my calculation.\n\nSo, my final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
