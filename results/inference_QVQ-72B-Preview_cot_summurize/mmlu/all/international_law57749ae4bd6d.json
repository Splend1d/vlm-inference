From what I recall, in international law, states can perform acts that are either jure imperii or jure gestionis. The question is asking about act jure imperii, and there are four options to choose from. Let me see which one makes the most sense.\n\nOption A says that an act is jure imperii when undertaken by an international organisation. Hmm, international organisations are separate entities from states, although states are often members of them. But I think acts of international organisations are governed differently. Maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B suggests that an act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official state capacity. This sounds plausible. Jure imperii refers to acts that are sovereign in nature, like declaring war, concluding treaties, or exercising diplomatic relations. These are typically official state functions, so this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C states that all acts undertaken by state officials are acts jure imperii. Wait a minute, that can't be right. Just because an act is done by a state official doesn't mean it's automatically a sovereign act. For example, if a state official is shopping for office supplies, that's more like a commercial act, not a sovereign one. So, this seems too broad.\n\nOption D says that an act is jure imperii when undertaken by a state corporation. State corporations can engage in commercial activities, which are generally considered acts jure gestionis. So, unless the state corporation is performing a sovereign function, which is rare, most of their acts would be jure gestionis. Therefore, this option probably isn't correct.\n\nLet me double-check. Jure imperii refers to the sovereign acts of a state, which are acts that are typically immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts. Jure gestionis acts are more like commercial or private acts, for which states may not have immunity.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to be the most accurate because acts undertaken in an official state capacity are likely to be sovereign acts, such as legislating, conducting foreign affairs, or administering justice.\n\nWait, but option A mentions international organisations. Could there be a connection there? Maybe in some contexts, acts of international organisations are considered acts jure imperii of the state, but I don't think that's generally the case. States and international organisations are separate subjects of international law.\n\nOption C is definitely too sweeping, as not every act of a state official is a sovereign act. And option D is likely incorrect because state corporations primarily engage in commercial activities, which are jure gestionis.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think the best answer is B: an act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official state capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
