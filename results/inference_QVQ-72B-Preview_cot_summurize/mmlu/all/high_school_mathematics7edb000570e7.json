Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to figure out how to calculate the number of ways to choose 5 students from a group of 6. I remember something about combinations from math class. Yeah, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, right? So, if I'm just selecting a group of 5 students without considering the order, I should use the combination formula.\n\nThe combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 6 and k is 5.\n\nSo, C(6, 5) = 6! / (5!(6 - 5)! ) = 6! / (5! * 1! ).\n\nLet me calculate that. 6! is 720, 5! is 120, and 1! is 1.\n\nSo, 720 divided by 120 times 1. That's 720 / 120, which is 6.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6.\n\nWait a minute, but is there a simpler way to see this? Since I'm choosing 5 out of 6 students, maybe I can think about it differently. How many ways are there to leave out one student from the group of 6? Because if I'm choosing 5 out of 6, that's the same as leaving out one student.\n\nSo, for each possible group of 5, there's one student not included. Since there are 6 students, there are 6 ways to choose which one to leave out. So, again, the answer is 6.\n\nThat makes sense. So, both approaches lead me to the same answer.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other way to interpret this. Is there any reason to think about permutations instead of combinations? Well, the problem says \"selected from a group,\" and it doesn't mention anything about the order in which they're selected. So, combinations seem appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if the order mattered, I would use permutations, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with my answer of 6.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 6\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility of repetition or any constraints on the students being selected? The problem doesn't specify any restrictions, so I think the straightforward combination calculation applies.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the number of subsets of size 5 from a set of 6 students. The number of such subsets is indeed C(6,5), which is 6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about listing them out. Suppose the students are A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nThen, the possible groups of 5 would be:\n\n1. A, B, C, D, E\n\n2. A, B, C, D, F\n\n3. A, B, C, E, F\n\n4. A, B, D, E, F\n\n5. A, C, D, E, F\n\n6. B, C, D, E, F\n\nSo, that's six groups in total. Matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each time I arrive at the same answer: 6 ways.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
