                    "text": "So I have this question here about the Dred Scott decision of 1857 and what overturned it. The options are:\n\nA. Plessy v. Ferguson decision\n\nB. Missouri Compromise\n\nC. Jim Crow laws\n\nD. Fourteenth Amendment\n\nAlright, let's recall what the Dred Scott decision was about. Dred Scott was a enslaved person who sued for his freedom based on the fact that he had lived in free territories where slavery was prohibited. The Supreme Court ruled against him, stating that Black people, whether enslaved or free, were not considered citizens and therefore could not sue in federal court. Additionally, the Court declared that Congress did not have the authority to prohibit slavery in the territories.\n\nSo, that was a pretty significant ruling that had major implications for the expansion of slavery and the status of Black people in the United States.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which of these options overturned that decision.\n\nLet's consider each one:\n\nA. Plessy v. Ferguson decision\n\nI know that Plessy v. Ferguson was a case in 1896 where the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. This was a different issue from Dred Scott, which was about citizenship and the expansion of slavery. So, I don't think Plessy v. Ferguson overturned Dred Scott. Maybe they built upon each other in some way, but I don't think it directly overturned Dred Scott.\n\nB. Missouri Compromise\n\nThe Missouri Compromise was passed in 1820, which was before the Dred Scott decision. It was about the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, and it established a line at 36\u00b030\u2032 north latitude above which slavery would be prohibited in the territories (except for Missouri). Dred Scott was decided in 1857, so the Missouri Compromise was already in place when Dred Scott occurred. In fact, the Dred Scott decision declared that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional because Congress couldn't prohibit slavery in the territories. So, the Missouri Compromise didn't overturn Dred Scott; rather, Dred Scott invalidated the Missouri Compromise in that regard.\n\nC. Jim Crow laws\n\nJim Crow laws were state and local laws enforcing racial segregation in the Southern United States after the Reconstruction era. They were enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were in place until the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s led to their being struck down. These laws were about segregation and discrimination, not directly about the issues addressed in the Dred Scott decision. So, I don't think Jim Crow laws overturned Dred Scott. If anything, they were part of the broader system of racial oppression that existed after the Civil War.\n\nD. Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was adopted in 1868. It addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law. One of its key provisions is the Citizenship Clause, which states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\" This directly contradicts the Dred Scott decision, which had declared that Black people could not be citizens.\n\nAdditionally, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This was intended to secure the civil rights of formerly enslaved people.\n\nGiven that the Dred Scott decision denied citizenship to Black people and declared that Congress couldn't prohibit slavery in the territories, the Fourteenth Amendment directly addresses and contradicts those assertions by granting citizenship and equal protection under the law to all persons born or naturalized in the United States.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that the Fourteenth Amendment effectively overturned the Dred Scott decision.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI know that the Thirteenth Amendment, adopted in 1865, abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. That was after Dred Scott, but it's not one of the options here.\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment, adopted in 1870, granted citizenship regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and prohibited denying the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\n\nBut the Fourteenth Amendment seems to be the one that directly contradicts the Dred Scott decision by granting citizenship to Black people, which Dred Scott had denied.\n\nMoreover, the Supreme Court itself has recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment overturned the Dred Scott decision. In later cases, such as the Slaughter-House Cases in 1873, the Court acknowledged that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to overturn the Dred Scott decision.\n\nTherefore, it's clear that the Fourteenth Amendment overturned the Dred Scott decision.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
