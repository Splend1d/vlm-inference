                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here. There's a psychologist who's been tasked with overseeing a group that's going to design training programs for outplaced workers. The goal is to help these workers fill existing jobs in community organizations. The first step they should take is one of four options: determine the skill levels and job satisfaction of currently employed people in the community, evaluate the self-esteem of each outplaced worker, perform job analyses for all jobs for which training will be offered, or develop training objectives for all jobs for which training will be offered.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. I need to figure out what the very first thing should be in this process of designing training programs for outplaced workers to fill specific jobs.\n\nOption A is about determining the skill levels and job satisfaction of currently employed people in the community. Hmm, that seems relevant, but is it the first thing they should do? Well, understanding the current workforce's skills and job satisfaction might give some context, but is that directly helpful for training outplaced workers for specific jobs? Maybe not directly. Job satisfaction might not be as relevant here as skill levels, but even then, focusing on current employees' skills might not be the most immediate step for training new people.\n\nOption B is evaluating the self-esteem of each outplaced worker. Now, self-esteem is important for overall well-being and might influence how well someone engages in training or performs in a job. But is this the first step in designing training programs? Probably not. While it's important to consider the psychological well-being of the workers, the immediate need is to align training with the skills required for available jobs. Maybe addressing self-esteem could be part of a broader support program, but it's not the primary focus for designing job-specific training.\n\nOption C is performing job analyses for all jobs for which training will be offered. This sounds pretty fundamental. Job analysis is a process where you identify the tasks, responsibilities, and requirements of a job. It's basically figuring out what the job entails and what skills and knowledge are needed to perform it effectively. Without knowing what the job requires, it would be pretty hard to design a training program that prepares people adequately for that job. So, this seems like a crucial first step.\n\nOption D is developing training objectives for all jobs for which training will be offered. Training objectives are specific goals that define what learners should be able to do after completing the training. While these are important, they should be based on the job requirements identified through job analysis. So, if you haven't done the job analysis yet, how would you know what the training objectives should be? It seems like putting the cart before the horse.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, performing job analyses for all jobs for which training will be offered (Option C) seems like the most logical first step. It provides the foundation for developing training programs that are aligned with the actual needs of the jobs available in community organizations.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it differently. Suppose they skip the job analysis and go straight to developing training objectives. Without knowing the specific requirements of the jobs, these objectives might be generic or based on assumptions, which could lead to training that doesn't adequately prepare workers for the actual jobs. That wouldn't be efficient or effective.\n\nOn the other hand, if they start with a thorough job analysis, they can identify the key competencies, skills, and knowledge needed for each job. This information can then be used to develop targeted and relevant training objectives, ensuring that the training programs are designed to meet the specific needs of the jobs.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that performing job analyses is the first step they should take.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps they should first assess the skills of the outplaced workers to see what training they need. But no, that seems less efficient. If they don't know what the jobs require, how can they match the training to those requirements? It's better to start by understanding the job demands and then assess the workers' existing skills against those demands to determine the training gaps.\n\nAlso, considering the psychologist's involvement, it makes sense that they would prioritize a systematic approach like job analysis, which is a standard practice in industrial-organizational psychology for designing effective training programs.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the angles here. The clear choice is Option C: perform job analyses for all jobs for which training will be offered.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
