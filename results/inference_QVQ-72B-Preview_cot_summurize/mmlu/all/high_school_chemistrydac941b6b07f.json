                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 0.25 moles of a weak, monoprotic acid dissolved in 0.25 liters of distilled water. The pH of this solution is measured to be 4.26, and we need to find the pKa of this weak acid. The options are 4.26, 8.52, 7.52, and 3.66.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a weak, monoprotic acid is. A monoprotic acid is an acid that can donate only one proton (H+) per molecule. Examples include acetic acid (CH3COOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), but since it's specified as a weak acid, it doesn't ionize completely in solution.\n\nGiven that it's a weak acid, its dissociation in water can be represented by the equation:\n\nHA \u21cc H+ + A-\n\nWhere HA is the acid, H+ is the hydrogen ion, and A- is the conjugate base.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation is called the acid dissociation constant, or Ka, and it's expressed as:\n\nKa = [H+][A-] / [HA]\n\nWe also know that pKa is defined as:\n\npKa = -log(Ka)\n\nAnd that pH is:\n\npH = -log([H+])\n\nGiven that the pH is 4.26, we can find [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 10^-4.26 M\n\nNow, since the acid is weak, we can assume that the dissociation is small, meaning that the concentration of H+ ions produced is much smaller than the initial concentration of the acid. However, we need to check if this assumption is valid after solving.\n\nLet's denote the initial concentration of the acid as [HA]0. We have 0.25 moles in 0.25 liters, so:\n\n[HA]0 = 0.25 mol / 0.25 L = 1 M\n\nLet x be the equilibrium concentration of H+ ions, which is also equal to the concentration of A- ions because each HA molecule that dissociates produces one H+ and one A-.\n\nSo, at equilibrium:\n\n[HA] = [HA]0 - x\n\n[H+] = x\n\n[A-] = x\n\nAssuming x is small compared to [HA]0, we can write:\n\nKa = x^2 / [HA]0\n\nBut we know that [H+] = x = 10^-4.26 M\n\nSo,\n\nKa = (10^-4.26)^2 / 1 = 10^-8.52\n\nTherefore, pKa = -log(10^-8.52) = 8.52\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 8.52 seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait a minute, option A is 4.26, which is the pH. Is there a possibility that pKa equals pH in this scenario?\n\nI know that for a buffer solution, pH = pKa when the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal, according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nBut in this case, we only have the acid dissolved in water, not a buffer solution. So, it's unlikely that pKa equals pH here.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nGiven:\n\n[HA]0 = 1 M\n\npH = 4.26, so [H+] = 10^-4.26 M\n\nAssuming x = [H+] = [A-] = 10^-4.26 M\n\nThen,\n\nKa = (10^-4.26)^2 / 1 = 10^-8.52\n\npKa = 8.52\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should check if the assumption that x is negligible compared to [HA]0 is valid. If x is less than 5% of [HA]0, the assumption is generally acceptable.\n\nx = 10^-4.26 M \u2248 0.000056 M\n\n[HA]0 = 1 M\n\n0.000056 / 1 = 0.0056%, which is much less than 5%. So, the assumption holds.\n\nTherefore, the pKa of the weak acid is 8.52.\n\nWait, but option C is 7.52. Is there any possibility that I missed something?\n\nLet me consider if the acid is not monoprotic or if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nNo, the problem states it's a monoprotic acid, so my initial approach should be valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the ICE table to solve for x more accurately.\n\nLet's set up an ICE table for the dissociation:\n\nInitial:\n\n[HA] = 1 M\n\n[H+] = 0 M\n\n[A-] = 0 M\n\nChange:\n\n[HA] decreases by x\n\n[H+] increases by x\n\n[A-] increases by x\n\nEquilibrium:\n\n[HA] = 1 - x\n\n[H+] = x\n\n[A-] = x\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA] = x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nBut since x is much smaller than 1, as we've already established, 1 - x is approximately 1.\n\nSo, Ka \u2248 x^2 / 1 = x^2\n\nThus, pKa = -log(x^2) = 2*(-log(x)) = 2*(4.26) = 8.52\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 8.52.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the acid is strong or weak.\n\nGiven that it's specified as a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely, which aligns with our approach.\n\nIf it were a strong acid, it would dissociate completely, and the pH would be different.\n\nFor example, if it were a strong acid like HCl, 0.25 moles in 0.25 L would give [H+] = 1 M, and pH = 0, which is not the case here.\n\nSo, it's indeed a weak acid, and our calculations hold.\n\nTherefore, the pKa is 8.52.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 8.52} \\]"
