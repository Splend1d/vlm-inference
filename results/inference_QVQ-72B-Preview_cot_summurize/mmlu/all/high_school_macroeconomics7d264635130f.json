                    "text": "Let's see. So, the reserve ratio is 0.10, which means banks have to keep 10% of deposits as reserves. Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account and keeps it as cash in her fridge. I need to figure out how this withdrawal affects the money in circulation.\n\nFirst, I should understand what happens when someone withdraws cash from their checking account. When Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million, that money is no longer in the banking system; it's just sitting in her fridge. So, that $1 million is no longer part of the deposits in the banks.\n\nNow, banks rely on deposits to make loans and create money through the fractional reserve banking system. With a reserve ratio of 0.10, for every dollar deposited, banks can lend out $0.90 because they only need to keep $0.10 as reserves.\n\nSo, when $1 million is withdrawn, the total deposits in the banking system decrease by $1 million. This means that the banks now have less money to lend out. But the impact isn't just the $1 million withdrawal; it's about how that affects the overall money supply through the lending process.\n\nI think I need to use the money multiplier formula to calculate the total change in the money supply. The money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio. Here, the reserve ratio is 0.10, so the money multiplier is 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nSo, any change in reserves leads to a multiplied change in the money supply. In this case, since deposits are decreasing by $1 million, the total decrease in the money supply should be $1 million multiplied by the money multiplier, which is 10. So, $1 million * 10 = $10 million decrease in the money supply.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't match any of the options directly. Let me check my reasoning.\n\nThe money multiplier formula works for increases in reserves, but does it also apply for decreases? I think it does, but I need to make sure.\n\nLet me recall: the money multiplier shows how a change in reserves leads to a change in the money supply. So, if reserves increase by $1, money supply increases by $1 * (1 / reserve ratio). Similarly, if reserves decrease by $1, money supply decreases by $1 * (1 / reserve ratio).\n\nIn this scenario, when $1 million is withdrawn from the checking account, it's like reserves are decreasing by $1 million because the banks have less money to lend out.\n\nSo, the total decrease in the money supply should be $1 million * 10 = $10 million.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. Decreases it by $9 million\n\nB. Decreases it by $1 million\n\nC. Decreases it by $100,000\n\nD. Increases it by $1 million\n\nNone of these match $10 million. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the withdrawal directly reduces the money supply by the amount withdrawn, which is $1 million, and the multiplier affects potential lending, not the actual money supply immediately.\n\nLet me think differently. The $1 million withdrawal reduces the deposits by $1 million. This means that banks now have $1 million less in deposits, and consequently, they have to adjust their lending accordingly.\n\nGiven the reserve ratio of 0.10, for every dollar deposited, banks can lend out $0.90. So, with $1 million less in deposits, the potential lending capacity decreases by $0.90 for every dollar withdrawn.\n\nSo, $1 million * $0.90 = $900,000 less potential lending.\n\nBut wait, this is on top of the direct withdrawal of $1 million. So, total decrease in money supply would be $1 million (direct withdrawal) plus $900,000 (lost lending capacity), totaling $1.9 million.\n\nHmm, that's still not matching any options.\n\nMaybe I need to think in terms of the money multiplier again. If the money multiplier is 10, and the withdrawal is $1 million, then the total decrease in money supply should be $1 million * 10 = $10 million.\n\nBut that seems too high. Maybe the money multiplier doesn't apply directly in this situation.\n\nLet me try to calculate it step by step.\n\nSuppose the banking system has initial deposits of, say, $10 million. With a reserve ratio of 0.10, they need to keep $1 million as reserves and can lend out $9 million.\n\nNow, if Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million, the total deposits become $9 million. Now, the required reserves are $900,000, and they can lend out $8.1 million.\n\nSo, the total money supply before withdrawal:\n\nDeposits: $10 million\n\nLoans: $9 million\n\nTotal money supply: $10 million + $9 million = $19 million\n\nAfter withdrawal:\n\nDeposits: $9 million\n\nLoans: $8.1 million\n\nTotal money supply: $9 million + $8.1 million = $17.1 million\n\nDifference: $19 million - $17.1 million = $1.9 million decrease\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was $10 million decrease, but now it's $1.9 million. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me see. Maybe I need to consider the money multiplier more carefully.\n\nThe money multiplier formula is 1 / reserve ratio, which is 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nSo, if reserves decrease by $1 million, the money supply decreases by $1 million * 10 = $10 million.\n\nBut in my example, it decreased by $1.9 million, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the money multiplier applies to changes in reserves, not withdrawals.\n\nMaybe I need to think about it differently. Perhaps the money multiplier only applies to changes in excess reserves or something like that.\n\nLet me consider the impact of the withdrawal on the banking system's ability to create money.\n\nWhen $1 million is withdrawn, it reduces the deposits by $1 million. This means that the banks have $1 million less to lend out.\n\nGiven the reserve ratio of 0.10, for every dollar deposited, they can lend out $0.90.\n\nSo, with $1 million less deposits, they can lend out $0.90 * $1 million = $900,000 less.\n\nAdditionally, the direct withdrawal of $1 million is already part of the money supply reduction.\n\nSo, total reduction in money supply: $1 million (withdrawal) + $900,000 (lost lending) = $1.9 million.\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the money multiplier applies only to changes in reserves, not to withdrawals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the impact on the money supply in terms of the multiplier effect.\n\nIf the money multiplier is 10, then a $1 million withdrawal could potentially reduce the money supply by $10 million, as the banks have to reduce their lending accordingly.\n\nBut in practice, it might not happen immediately, as banks may have existing loans outstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direct withdrawal reduces the money supply by $1 million, and the potential lending capacity decreases by $9 million, but the actual money supply reduction is only $1 million.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be B. Decreases it by $1 million.\n\nBut I feel like there's more to it. The withdrawal not only removes $1 million from circulation but also affects the banks' ability to lend, which could have further effects on the money supply.\n\nLet me consider the fractional reserve banking process.\n\nWhen a deposit is made, banks keep a fraction as reserves and lend out the rest. This lending then gets deposited elsewhere, and the process repeats, increasing the money supply.\n\nSimilarly, when a deposit is withdrawn, it reduces the reserves, forcing banks to recall loans or reduce lending, which then reduces the money supply through the same multiplier effect.\n\nSo, if the money multiplier is 10, a $1 million withdrawal could lead to a $10 million decrease in the money supply.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the direct withdrawal is only $1 million.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is A. Decreases it by $9 million.\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with my earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B. Decreases it by $1 million, considering only the direct withdrawal.\n\nBut I think the impact is larger due to the multiplier effect.\n\nLet me check a formula for the change in the money supply due to a withdrawal.\n\nThe formula for the change in the money supply due to a change in reserves is:\n\n\u0394M = (1 / r) * \u0394R\n\nWhere:\n\n\u0394M is the change in the money supply\n\nr is the reserve ratio\n\n\u0394R is the change in reserves\n\nIn this case, \u0394R = -$1 million (since it's a withdrawal)\n\nSo, \u0394M = (1 / 0.10) * (-$1 million) = 10 * (-$1 million) = -$10 million\n\nWhich means the money supply decreases by $10 million.\n\nBut none of the options say decreases by $10 million.\n\nOption A says decreases by $9 million, which is close but not exact.\n\nOption B says decreases by $1 million, which is the direct withdrawal.\n\nOption C is decreases by $100,000, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is increases by $1 million, which is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question is assuming a simple direct impact of the withdrawal, not considering the multiplier effect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in applying the money multiplier formula.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe money multiplier is indeed 1 / reserve ratio, which is 10 in this case.\n\nBut applying it directly to the withdrawal might not be accurate, as the withdrawal affects reserves differently.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the withdrawal reduces deposits by $1 million, which reduces reserves by $1 million * reserve ratio = $100,000.\n\nThen, the change in the money supply would be (1 / 0.10) * (-$100,000) = -$1 million.\n\nSo, the money supply decreases by $1 million.\n\nThis seems more reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Decreases it by $1 million.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because of the potential multiplier effects.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose the banking system has initial deposits of $10 million and reserves of $1 million (10% of deposits).\n\nThey can lend out $9 million.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of $1 million, deposits become $9 million, required reserves are $900,000, and they can lend out $8.1 million.\n\nSo, total money supply before withdrawal: $10 million (deposits) + $9 million (loans) = $19 million.\n\nAfter withdrawal: $9 million (deposits) + $8.1 million (loans) = $17.1 million.\n\nDifference: $1.9 million decrease.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the withdrawal directly reduces deposits by $1 million, and the loans are adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut in reality, banks might not immediately recall loans; they might let existing loans run their course and adjust new lending.\n\nSo, perhaps the immediate impact is just the $1 million withdrawal, and over time, as banks adjust their lending, the money supply decreases further.\n\nBut for the purpose of this question, maybe we should consider only the direct impact, which is the $1 million withdrawal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Decreases it by $1 million.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
