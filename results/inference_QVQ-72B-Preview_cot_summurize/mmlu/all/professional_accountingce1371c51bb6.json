                    "text": "So I'm looking at this scenario where an entity prepares its financial statements using the income tax basis, which is different from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The notes to the financial statements include a summary of significant accounting policies that explain the basis of presentation and describe how it differs from GAAP. The question is about whether the dollar amount of the differences between the income tax basis and GAAP needs to be included, and if so, where.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the income tax basis is. I believe it's a method of accounting used for tax purposes, which might differ from GAAP in several ways. For example, GAAP focuses on financial reporting to shareholders, while the income tax basis is geared towards calculating taxable income for the IRS.\n\nNow, the financial statements are prepared on this income tax basis, but they also include notes that explain the significant accounting policies and describe the differences from GAAP. The question is whether the quantitative impact of these differences\u2014that is, the dollar amount\u2014needs to be disclosed, and if so, where: in the auditor's report, in the notes to the financial statements, or both.\n\nOption A says it's required to be included only in the auditor's report. Option B says it's required to be included only in the notes to the financial statements. Option C says it's required to be included in both places, and Option D says it doesn't need to be quantified and included in either place.\n\nI need to recall the generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and any relevant guidance on financial statements prepared on a basis other than GAAP, specifically the income tax basis.\n\nI remember that when financial statements are prepared using a basis other than GAAP, such as the income tax basis, there are specific requirements for disclosure. The AICPA's Audit and Accounting Guide, \"Basis for Financial Statements,\" provides guidance on this topic.\n\nAccording to this guidance, when financial statements are prepared on a basis other than GAAP, the entity should clearly disclose the basis of accounting used and explain how it differs from GAAP. Additionally, it's often required to disclose the financial statement effects of the differences between the chosen basis and GAAP.\n\nIn particular, the guide suggests that when practical, the entity should quantify the differences between the basis used and GAAP. This helps users of the financial statements understand the impact of using a different basis.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the notes already include a summary of significant accounting policies that discuss the basis of presentation and describe how it differs from GAAP. The question is whether the dollar amount of these differences should be included, and where.\n\nI think that, generally, such quantitative disclosures are included in the notes to the financial statements. The auditor's report would reference these disclosures but wouldn't typically include the detailed quantitative information itself.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Is required to be included only in the auditor's report.\n\nB. Is required to be included only in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nC. Is required to be included both in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report.\n\nD. Need not be quantified and included in either the notes to the financial statements or the auditor's report.\n\nGiven that, I believe the correct answer is B: it's required to be included only in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nBut let me double-check. The auditor's report for financial statements prepared on a basis other than GAAP typically includes a description that the financial statements are not presented in accordance with GAAP and that they are presented in accordance with the specified basis, such as the income tax basis.\n\nThe auditor would also mention that the financial statements include disclosures about the basis of accounting and the differences from GAAP, but the actual quantitative disclosures would be part of the financial statements themselves, not the auditor's report.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the dollar amounts would be included in the auditor's report; they belong in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nOption C suggests including it in both places, but that seems redundant and unnecessary. The auditor's report is meant to provide an opinion on the financial statements and related disclosures, not to repeat the disclosures themselves.\n\nOption D suggests that the differences need not be quantified, which contradicts the guidance that encourages or requires quantitative disclosures when practical.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B: it's required to be included only in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any scenario where the dollar amounts might be included in the auditor's report. I can't think of one. The auditor's report is separate from the financial statements and is meant to provide assurance on the financial statements, not to present the financial data itself.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Is required to be included only in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
