The school psychologist has worked with the boy and knows him well. Anthony has a mild learning disability and receives academic support. He is doing well on a daily basis but has difficulty performing on tests. The school psychologist discusses ways in which Ms. Harcar could incorporate study-skills training into classroom activities. With regard to study-skills training, the school psychologist should stress which of the following principles while advising Ms. Harcar?\n\nA. The study skills of students with disabilities are improved when they are given a single, specific study strategy to follow for all subjects.\nB. Students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and need only some guidance and reinforcement by the teacher.\nC. Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\nD. Study strategies are best taught in a small group by having students practice collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which principle the school psychologist should emphasize to Ms. Harcar about study-skills training for Anthony, who has a mild learning disability. He seems to do okay day-to-day but struggles with tests. The options are:\n\nA. Give him one specific study strategy for all subjects.\n\nB. He'll develop study skills on his own with some guidance.\n\nC. Help him guide his own thinking, organize study behaviors, and use different approaches.\n\nD. Teach study strategies in small groups with collaborative problem-solving.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what study-skills training entails, especially for students with learning disabilities. These students often have unique challenges when it comes to learning and retaining information, especially in high-stress situations like tests.\n\nOption A suggests giving Anthony one specific study strategy to use for all subjects. But different subjects require different approaches. For example, studying for a math test might involve practicing problems, while studying for a history test might involve memorizing dates and events. A single strategy might not be effective across all subjects.\n\nOption B says that students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and just need guidance and reinforcement from the teacher. While it's true that some students can develop their own methods, students with learning disabilities might need more structured and direct instruction in study skills rather than just guidance.\n\nOption C emphasizes helping students guide their own thinking, organize their study behaviors, and use varied study approaches. This sounds a lot like metacognitive strategies, where students learn to think about their own thinking and adjust their study methods accordingly. This approach seems tailored to individual needs and flexible enough to adapt to different subjects and types of assessments.\n\nOption D proposes teaching study strategies in small groups through collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher. This could be effective for some students, as it allows for peer interaction and learning from each other. However, Anthony seems to have specific individual needs, so a group setting might not address his unique challenges adequately.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems the most appropriate. It focuses on helping Anthony develop metacognitive skills and the ability to adapt his study methods to different situations. This aligns with what we know about effective intervention for students with learning disabilities, who often benefit from explicit instruction in study strategies that are customized to their learning styles and the nature of the material they are studying.\n\nMoreover, since Anthony has difficulty with tests despite doing well daily, it's likely that his study methods are sufficient for day-to-day learning but not for the deeper understanding or recall required during tests. Option C addresses this by encouraging varied study approaches that could help improve his retention and recall under test conditions.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D either offer a one-size-fits-all solution, assume that Anthony will develop the skills on his own with minimal intervention, or suggest a group approach that might not be as effective for his individual needs.\n\nTherefore, the school psychologist should stress the principles outlined in option C to help Ms. Harcar incorporate effective study-skills training into her classroom activities for Anthony.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
