                    "text": "Let's tackle this genetics problem. So, we have an autosomal recessive trait that's expressed in 1% of the population, and we're assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We need to find out what percentage of the population are carriers, meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele for this trait, but don't express it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is. It's a principle in population genetics that states that in a large, randomly mating population with no migration, mutation, or selection, the allele frequencies and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation. There are five assumptions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:\n\n1. The population is large.\n\n2. Mating is random.\n\n3. No mutation occurs.\n\n4. No migration occurs.\n\n5. No natural selection is occurring.\n\nGiven that, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equations to solve this problem.\n\nThe basic Hardy-Weinberg equation is:\n\np\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nWhere:\n\n- p is the frequency of the dominant allele.\n\n- q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\n- p\u00b2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype.\n\n- 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype.\n\n- q\u00b2 is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype.\n\nIn this problem, the trait is autosomal recessive, so the homozygous recessive individuals (q\u00b2) express the trait.\n\nWe're given that the trait is expressed in 1% of the population, which means q\u00b2 = 0.01.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = 0.01.\n\nTo find q, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nq = \u221a0.01 = 0.1\n\nNow, since p + q = 1, we can find p:\n\np = 1 - q = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9\n\nNow, we need to find the frequency of carriers, which are the heterozygous individuals, having one dominant and one recessive allele. That's represented by 2pq.\n\nSo, 2pq = 2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.18 * 100% = 18%\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 18% seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nFirst, we have q\u00b2 = 0.01, so q = 0.1.\n\nThen, p = 1 - q = 0.9.\n\nThen, 2pq = 2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18, which is 18%.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think about using the square root directly or considering other factors, but given the assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, this should be straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 18%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
