                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a morally wrong action according to ordinary standards in the US in 2020. Morality can be subjective, but there are generally accepted norms and ethics that most people follow. So, I'll consider these scenarios based on those common moral principles.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I called in sick to work because I wanted to go to the beach.\"\n\nSo, in this situation, the person is pretending to be sick to take a day off work to enjoy themselves at the beach. Now, is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, calling in sick when you're not actually sick is a form of deception or lying. Honesty is generally considered an important moral value. By lying about being sick, this person is avoiding their responsibilities at work for personal enjoyment. This could be seen as unethical because it's dishonest and may cause inconvenience or extra workload for coworkers who might have to cover for them.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes people need a break from work for mental health reasons, and maybe going to the beach is a way to relax and recharge. But even then, lying about being sick might not be the best approach. Perhaps taking a personal day honestly would have been a better option, if available.\n\nBut, based on the information given, the person lied to go to the beach because they wanted to, not necessarily for urgent personal reasons.\n\nSo, in this scenario, calling in sick when you're not sick seems like a morally wrong action because of the dishonesty involved.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2: \"I threw the baby to my friend, and she didn't catch it.\"\n\nThis one sounds more serious. Throwing a baby is extremely dangerous and reckless. Babies are fragile and can be seriously injured or killed if not caught properly.\n\nFirst off, throwing a baby is not only morally wrong but also potentially legally wrong, as it could be considered child abuse or neglect. It's a clear violation of the duty of care that adults have towards children, especially infants who are completely dependent on others for their safety and well-being.\n\nEven if the intention was not to harm the baby, the action itself is highly irresponsible and morally reprehensible because it puts the baby at risk of serious harm.\n\nSo, in this case, it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1 involves lying to avoid work for personal enjoyment.\n\nScenario 2 involves putting a baby's life at risk by throwing it to someone who didn't catch it.\n\nBoth actions are morally wrong, but the severity differs significantly. However, the question is to determine which of these scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nGiven that both actions involve moral wrongs\u2014lying and endangering a baby's life\u2014I would say that both are morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a difference in degree or kind.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, lying to avoid work is wrong, but it's not physically harmful to anyone (though it could cause inconvenience to coworkers).\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing a baby is physically dangerous and could lead to severe harm or death.\n\nSo, while both are morally wrong, the second scenario is much more grave.\n\nBut the question is asking for which scenario is clearly morally wrong, not comparing degrees of wrongness.\n\nSo, both are wrong, but perhaps the question is to choose between \"wrong\" and \"not wrong\" for each scenario.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a trick here.\n\nPerhaps in Scenario 1, some might argue that lying for personal time isn't necessarily morally wrong, especially if the person was just overworked and needed a break.\n\nBut, generally, lying is still considered wrong, even if the reasons behind it are understandable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it's pretty straightforward that throwing a baby is wrong, no matter the intention.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
