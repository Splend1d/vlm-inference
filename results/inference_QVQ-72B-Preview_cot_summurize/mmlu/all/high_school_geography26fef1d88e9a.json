                    "text": "So I have this question here about different ways of life based on how people get their food and resources. The question is asking specifically about a lifestyle that involves breeding and herding animals for things like food, shelter, and clothing. The options are swidden, subsistence farming, pastoralism, and hunting and gathering. I need to pick the correct term that describes this way of life.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. Starting with swidden, I think that's another term for slash-and-burn agriculture. In this method, farmers clear forests by cutting down trees and then burning them to release nutrients into the soil. They plant crops in this enriched soil and, after a few years, when the soil's fertility decreases, they move on to another area and repeat the process. So, this seems more about farming crops rather than breeding and herding animals. Maybe swidden isn't the right choice here.\n\nNext is subsistence farming. From what I remember, subsistence farming is when farmers grow just enough food to feed their own families and maybe have a little surplus to trade with neighbors. This type of farming is often small-scale and doesn't involve large-scale production for markets. While this does involve farming, it's primarily about growing plants for food, not necessarily breeding and herding animals. So, again, it doesn't seem to directly fit the description in the question.\n\nThen there's pastoralism. This sounds a lot like what the question is describing. Pastoralism is a way of life based on the herding and breeding of domesticated animals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, or camels. These animals provide various resources: their meat can be eaten, their hides can be used for shelter and clothing, and sometimes they're even used for transportation or as a form of currency. Pastoralists often move with their herds to find fresh grazing land, which is called nomadic pastoralism. So, this seems to match the description in the question pretty closely.\n\nLastly, there's hunting and gathering. This is one of the oldest ways humans have obtained food, involving the direct procurement of wild plants and animals for sustenance. Hunters pursue game, while gatherers collect fruits, nuts, vegetables, and other edible parts of plants. This lifestyle doesn't involve the domestication of animals or plants in the same way that farming and pastoralism do. It's more about utilizing what nature provides without cultivating or breeding.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems that pastoralism is the correct answer to the question. It's the term that specifically refers to the way of life based on breeding and herding animals for various purposes, including food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check each option quickly:\n\n- Swidden: Slash-and-burn agriculture, primarily about growing crops, not herding animals.\n\n- Subsistence farming: Growing crops to feed one's own family, again, not directly related to herding animals.\n\n- Pastoralism: Herding and breeding animals for resources like food, shelter, and clothing.\n\n- Hunting and gathering: Procuring wild plants and animals, without breeding or herding.\n\nYes, pastoralism is the best fit for the description provided in the question. So, the answer should be C. pastoralism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. pastoralism}} \\]"
