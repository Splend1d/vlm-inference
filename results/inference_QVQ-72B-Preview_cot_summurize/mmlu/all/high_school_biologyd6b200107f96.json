                    "text": "So I have this question about fitness in organisms. It says that if an individual organism has greater fitness than another, it specifically means that the organism:\n\nA. lives longer than others of its species.\n\nB. competes for resources more successfully than others of its species.\n\nC. mates more frequently than others of its species.\n\nD. leaves more viable offspring than others of its species.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what fitness means in biology, especially in the context of evolution. I think fitness is related to how well an organism can survive and reproduce in its environment. But let's see, which of these options best defines fitness?\n\nOption A says living longer than others. While living longer might give an organism more time to reproduce, fitness isn't solely about lifespan. Some organisms reproduce quickly and die young, but they still might have high fitness if they produce many offspring. So, maybe this isn't the best definition.\n\nOption B says competing for resources more successfully. While being good at getting resources is important for survival and reproduction, it's not the only factor that determines fitness. Even if an organism is great at finding food, if it doesn't manage to reproduce, its fitness is low. So, perhaps this isn't the core definition either.\n\nOption C mentions mating more frequently. Frequent mating could lead to more offspring, but frequency isn't everything. Some organisms might mate many times but produce offspring that don't survive well. Fitness is more about the number of offspring that also survive and reproduce.\n\nOption D says leaving more viable offspring than others. This seems to align with what I remember about fitness. It's not just about the number of offspring, but the number of offspring that survive and can pass on their genes to the next generation.\n\nLet me think about this again. Fitness, in evolutionary terms, is often referred to as Darwinian fitness, which is essentially about reproductive success. It's about contributing more genes to the next generation than others in the population. So, if an organism produces more offspring that survive and reproduce, it has higher fitness.\n\nSo, living longer might help in producing more offspring, but it's not the direct measure of fitness. Competing successfully for resources is important for survival and reproduction, but again, it's not the direct measure of fitness. Mating frequently is part of the process, but unless those matings result in viable offspring, it doesn't directly contribute to fitness.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate definition of fitness in this context. It's about leaving more viable offspring than others, which directly relates to reproductive success and passing on genes to future generations.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider an example. Suppose there are two birds in a population. Bird A lives a long life but has only a few chicks, some of which survive to adulthood. Bird B has a shorter life but produces a larger number of chicks, and most of them survive to adulthood. According to the concept of fitness, Bird B would have higher fitness because it leaves more viable offspring.\n\nSo, based on this understanding, the correct answer should be D: leaves more viable offspring than others of its species.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
