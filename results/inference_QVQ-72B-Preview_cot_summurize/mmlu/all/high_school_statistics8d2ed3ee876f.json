                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that from 1886 to 2000, there were an average of 8.7 tropical cyclones per year, and out of those, an average of 5.1 became hurricanes each year. Assuming that the probability of any cyclone becoming a hurricane is independent of what happens to any other cyclone, I need to find the probability that, in a year with five cyclones, at least three of them become hurricanes.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have five cyclones in a year, and we want to know the probability that at least three of them turn into hurricanes. The assumption is that each cyclone has an independent chance of becoming a hurricane, so this sounds like a binomial probability problem.\n\nSo, binomial probability deals with situations where you have a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, each cyclone is a trial, and \"success\" is a cyclone becoming a hurricane.\n\nTo use the binomial probability formula, I need to know the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p) on each trial. Here, n is 5 because there are five cyclones. Now, I need to find p, the probability that a single cyclone becomes a hurricane.\n\nThe problem gives me the averages over the years: 8.7 cyclones per year and 5.1 hurricanes per year. So, the probability p that any given cyclone becomes a hurricane is the number of hurricanes divided by the total number of cyclones. That is, p = 5.1 / 8.7.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5.1 divided by 8.7. Well, 8.7 times 0.6 is 5.22, which is a bit high, and 8.7 times 0.58 is 5.046, which is very close to 5.1. So, p is approximately 0.586, or 58.6%.\n\nOkay, so p \u2248 0.586.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability that at least three out of five cyclones become hurricanes. \"At least three\" means three or four or five hurricanes out of five cyclones.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the probability of exactly three, exactly four, and exactly five hurricanes, and then add those probabilities together.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P(k) is the probability of exactly k successes\n\n- C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n\n- n is the number of trials\n\n- k is the number of successes\n\nSo, P(at least 3) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5)\n\nLet's calculate each one.\n\nFirst, P(3):\n\nC(5,3) * p^3 * (1-p)^2\n\nC(5,3) is 10\n\nSo, 10 * (0.586)^3 * (0.414)^2\n\nCalculate (0.586)^3: 0.586 * 0.586 = 0.3434, times 0.586 again is approximately 0.201\n\nThen, (0.414)^2 = 0.171\n\nSo, 10 * 0.201 * 0.171 \u2248 10 * 0.0343 \u2248 0.343\n\nNext, P(4):\n\nC(5,4) * p^4 * (1-p)^1\n\nC(5,4) is 5\n\nSo, 5 * (0.586)^4 * (0.414)^1\n\n(0.586)^4 = 0.586 * 0.586 = 0.3434, times 0.586 again is approximately 0.201, times 0.586 is about 0.118\n\n(0.414)^1 = 0.414\n\nSo, 5 * 0.118 * 0.414 \u2248 5 * 0.049 \u2248 0.245\n\nThen, P(5):\n\nC(5,5) * p^5 * (1-p)^0\n\nC(5,5) is 1\n\nSo, 1 * (0.586)^5 * 1\n\n(0.586)^5 = 0.586 * 0.586 = 0.3434, times 0.586 is about 0.201, times 0.586 is about 0.118, times 0.586 is about 0.069\n\nNow, add them up: 0.343 + 0.245 + 0.069 = 0.657\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.657, or 65.7%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.313\n\nB. 0.345\n\nC. 0.586\n\nD. 0.658\n\nMy calculation gives me approximately 0.657, which is very close to option D's 0.658. Maybe I rounded somewhere, so I'll check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, p = 5.1 / 8.7 \u2248 0.586\n\nThen, P(3) = 10 * (0.586)^3 * (0.414)^2 \u2248 10 * 0.201 * 0.171 \u2248 0.343\n\nP(4) = 5 * (0.586)^4 * 0.414 \u2248 5 * 0.118 * 0.414 \u2248 0.245\n\nP(5) = 1 * (0.586)^5 \u2248 0.069\n\nTotal: 0.343 + 0.245 + 0.069 = 0.657\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be D. 0.658.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to do this? Maybe using the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution. In some calculators or software, you can input n=5, p=0.586, and find the cumulative probability for k \u2265 3.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the complement rule: P(at least 3) = 1 - P(less than 3) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1) + P(2)]\n\nBut calculating that way might be more time-consuming, and I'd still end up with the same result after adding up the probabilities.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct. The probability is approximately 0.657, which rounds to 0.658, matching option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
