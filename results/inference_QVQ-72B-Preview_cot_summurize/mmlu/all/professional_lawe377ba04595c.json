                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, in 2006, an investor buys a 100-acre tract of land in a rural area. They then create a subdivision plan that turns this land into 90 one-acre residential lots, with one 10-acre lot set aside for a public school building. The investor promotes this subdivision, highlighting that there's a proposed school close by and that the county school district won't have to spend tax money to acquire the property for the school.\n\nIn 2007, they record this subdivision plan with the county recorder's office. Then, on January 15, 2009, the county school board votes to build a new school on this 10-acre tract. The question is asking what the best description is for the investor's proposed designation of the 10-acre tract for the school building. The options are:\n\nA. Equitable servitude.\n\nB. Restrictive covenant.\n\nC. Unenforceable restriction.\n\nD. Easement for public use.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, we need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with an equitable servitude: this is typically a non-contractual obligation that runs with the land, meaning it binds subsequent owners. It's often used to enforce restrictions in subdivisions, like limiting the type of buildings that can be constructed or the activities that can take place on the property.\n\nA restrictive covenant is similar but is usually created by agreement between parties, often in a deed or contract, and can also run with the land to bind future owners. It's commonly used to impose limitations on the use of property to maintain a certain character in a neighborhood.\n\nAn unenforceable restriction suggests that there's some sort of restriction in place, but for some reason, it can't be enforced legally. This could be due to various factors, such as it not being properly recorded, being against public policy, or expiring after a certain period.\n\nAn easement for public use is a right to use another person's land for a specific purpose, and when it's for public use, it typically allows the public or a public entity to access or use part of the property for a particular reason, like utilities, roads, or schools.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the investor has designated a 10-acre tract for a public school building. This seems like a specific purpose for which this part of the land is set aside. The investor is not selling or transferring this 10-acre tract; they're designating it for school use.\n\nThe county school board has voted to build a school there, which aligns with this designation. So, it appears that this 10-acre tract is intended for school use, and the school district doesn't have to pay for it, as per the investor's brochure.\n\nSo, is this an equitable servitude, a restrictive covenant, an unenforceable restriction, or an easement for public use?\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Equitable servitude: This might apply if there's a restriction that runs with the land, binding future owners to use the 10-acre tract only for school purposes. However, in this case, it's the investor who is designating the land for school use, and it's not clear if there's a restriction being placed on the land to prevent other uses in the future.\n\nB. Restrictive covenant: This is typically an agreement between parties that restricts the use of the land. If the investor has agreed to restrict the use of the 10-acre tract to school purposes, either through a deed restriction or another agreement, this could be considered a restrictive covenant. However, the problem doesn't specify any such agreement or covenant being in place.\n\nC. Unenforceable restriction: Without more information, it's hard to determine if the designation is unenforceable. If the investor has properly recorded the subdivision plan with the county recorder's office, which includes the designation of the 10-acre tract for school use, it's likely that this designation is part of the recorded plan and therefore enforceable. So, this option seems less likely.\n\nD. Easement for public use: An easement is a non-possessory interest in land that allows someone else to use the land for a specific purpose. In this case, designating the 10-acre tract for school use could be seen as granting an easement to the public or the school district to use that land for constructing a school. Additionally, since it's for public use (a school), it fits into the category of an easement for public use.\n\nGiven this analysis, option D seems the most fitting. The designation of the 10-acre tract for school construction aligns with the concept of an easement for public use. The school district can use this land for building a school without having to purchase it, which benefits the public by providing educational facilities without using tax funds for land acquisition.\n\nMoreover, recording the subdivision plan with the county recorder's office likely makes this designation a matter of public record, which could give it the force of an easement, binding future owners of the property.\n\nSo, my answer is D. Easement for public use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
