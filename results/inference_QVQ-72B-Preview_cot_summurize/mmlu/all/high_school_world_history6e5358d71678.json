                    "text": "So I've got this question here about early modern Africa, and it's referring to a letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal in 1526. The question is asking about the tone of this letter and which development in early modern Africa it best reflects. The options are:\n\nA. A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods\n\nB. Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest\n\nC. The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline\n\nD. The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the letter. King Afonso I was a prominent ruler of the Kingdom of Kongo in the 16th century, and he had established good relations with Portugal, even converting to Christianity. However, as time went on, he became increasingly concerned about the impacts of the slave trade on his kingdom.\n\nLooking at the excerpt from Source 1:\n\n\"Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our kingdoms.\"\n\nHere, King Afonso is expressing concern about the practices of his own people who are capturing and selling others to European traders, particularly the Portuguese. He mentions that these people are motivated by a desire for European goods and are even targeting noblemen and relatives.\n\nNow, looking at Source 2, which is from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo in 1512:\n\n\"This expedition has cost us much: it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand\u2014as though speaking in our name\u2014what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory.\"\n\nThis shows that the Portuguese were interested in trading for various commodities, including slaves, copper, and ivory, and they expected to profit from their expeditions.\n\nGiven these sources, I need to analyze the tone of King Afonso's letter and see which option it best reflects.\n\nOption A suggests a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods. While this is a real development in early modern Africa, the tone of King Afonso's letter seems more critical and concerned about the negative impacts of this trade, particularly the slave trade.\n\nOption B mentions vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest. From the letter, King Afonso is not resisting the Portuguese directly but rather expressing concern about the actions of his own people in collaboration with the Portuguese.\n\nOption C refers to the establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline. While this was happening, the letter is more specifically about the slave trade and its effects on Kongo society.\n\nOption D talks about the consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa. Again, while this was a broader trend, the letter is focused on the problems within Kongo due to the slave trade.\n\nConsidering the content of the letter, it seems that King Afonso is distressed by the internal divisions and the capture and sale of his own people, driven by a desire for European goods. This suggests that there was a growing dependence on trade with Europe, leading to social problems within Kongo.\n\nTherefore, the tone of the letter best reflects option A: a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The letter expresses concern about the negative consequences of this trade, particularly the slave trade. So, while there is a dependence on European goods, the tone is more one of criticism and alarm at how this dependence is leading to the breakdown of social order and the kidnapping of noblemen and relatives.\n\nOption A states \"a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods,\" but the tone of the letter is not just about dependence; it's about the harmful effects of this dependence, especially in terms of slavery and social disruption.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's a better option.\n\nOption B is about resistance to European expeditions of conquest. But King Afonso's letter doesn't show active resistance; rather, it's a plea to King John III to address these issues.\n\nOption C is about the establishment of trading posts. While these posts facilitated the trade that King Afonso is concerned about, the letter is more about the practices and impacts of the trade itself, not just the establishment of the posts.\n\nOption D is about the consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast. Again, this is a broader historical trend, but the letter is focused on specific problems within Kongo.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is A, as the dependence on European goods is a key factor leading to the problems King Afonso is highlighting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tone reflects a combination of dependence and resistance, but among the options, A seems the most fitting.\n\nLet me look back at the question: \"The tone of the first letter best reflects which of the following developments in early modern Africa?\"\n\nThe tone is one of concern and criticism about the impacts of trade with Europe, particularly the slave trade, on Kongo society. This suggests that the development being reflected is the growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods, which is leading to these negative outcomes.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
