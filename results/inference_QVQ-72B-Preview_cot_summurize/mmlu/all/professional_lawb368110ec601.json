                    "text": "So I've got this pretty complex property law scenario here, and I need to figure out what happens with this mortgage that the son took out in 2008. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in 1940, a state deeds a tract of land to a man, and it's recorded right away. That seems straightforward. Then, the man dies in 1990 as a widower and devises all his real property to his son via his will, which is properly probated. So, the son inherits the tract of land.\n\nIn 2005, the son deeds the tract to a friend, but this deed isn't recorded until after the son's death in 2009. That's interesting because there's a gap there. The son dies in 2009, and his will names the friend as the sole legatee and devisee of his entire estate. So, it seems like the friend is getting everything from the son's estate.\n\nNow, in 2008, the son mortgages the tract of land to a bank. But there's already a mortgage from 1988 to a rancher, which was recorded in 1988, and the 2008 mortgage says it's subordinate to that earlier mortgage. All the deeds are general warranty deeds, and the state has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the effect of the 2008 mortgage given by the son to the bank, considering all these prior transactions.\n\nFirst, let's consider the son's conveyance to the friend in 2005. That deed wasn't recorded until after the son's death in 2009. In property law, generally, recording is important for notice to third parties. Since the state has a notice-type recording statute, it probably means that unrecorded deeds don't affect subsequent bona fide purchasers who record their interests without notice of the prior unrecorded deed.\n\nBut in this case, the son mortgaged the property in 2008, before the friend's deed was recorded, but after the conveyance to the friend had been made in 2005 but not recorded yet.\n\nSo, does the bank, as the mortgagee in 2008, have notice of the prior conveyance to the friend?\n\nWell, the conveyance to the friend wasn't recorded until 2009, after the son's death in 2009 and after the mortgage in 2008. So, the bank wouldn't have had constructive notice of the friend's interest at the time of the mortgage in 2008 because it wasn't recorded yet.\n\nBut, the son conveyed the property to the friend in 2005, and the mortgage was in 2008. So, did the son still own the property when he mortgaged it in 2008?\n\nWait, he conveyed it to the friend in 2005, but the deed wasn't recorded until 2009. Does that mean the friend owned the property in 2008, even though the deed wasn't recorded?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, even if a deed isn't recorded, it still transfers title from the grantor to the grantee, but the grantee might not have perfect title against third parties who record later without notice of the prior unrecorded deed.\n\nSo, in 2005, the son conveyed the property to the friend, so the friend became the owner, but because the deed wasn't recorded, the friend's interest wasn't visible to third parties who might record later.\n\nThen, in 2008, the son, who had already conveyed the property to the friend in 2005, mortgages it to the bank. The bank would be relying on the son's representation that he owns the property, and since there's no record of the conveyance to the friend, the bank wouldn't know about it.\n\nBut, the son had already conveyed the property to the friend in 2005, so did the son still have the authority to mortgage it in 2008?\n\nI think not, because he had already conveyed it to the friend. So, the mortgage to the bank might be invalid because the son no longer owned the property.\n\nBut, in some cases, if a person conveys property and doesn't record it, and then conveys it again to someone else who records it, the second conveyance might prevail over the first unrecorded one.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the son mortgaged the property in 2008, and the friend's deed was recorded in 2009, after the mortgage.\n\nSo, the bank, as the mortgagee in 2008, wouldn't have had notice of the friend's prior unrecorded deed from 2005.\n\nIn a notice recording statute, generally, a subsequent bona fide purchaser or mortgagee who records without notice of a prior unrecorded deed takes priority over that prior deed.\n\nSo, if the bank was a bona fide mortgagee without notice of the friend's prior unrecorded deed in 2008, then the bank's mortgage might prevail over the friend's interest.\n\nBut, the friend had a deed from the son in 2005, which should have transferred title to the friend, even if it wasn't recorded yet.\n\nSo, perhaps the friend owns the property, and the bank's mortgage is invalid because the son no longer owned the property when he mortgaged it.\n\nBut, if the bank was a bona fide mortgagee without notice, maybe the bank's interest prevails.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Let me look up the general rules for notice recording statutes.\n\nIn a notice recording statute, generally:\n\n- An unrecorded deed is valid between the parties (grantor and grantee) but does not affect subsequent bona fide purchasers or mortgagees for value without notice of the prior unrecorded deed.\n\n- A subsequent bona fide purchaser or mortgagee who records their deed first, without notice of the prior unrecorded deed, has priority over the prior unrecorded deed.\n\n- If the subsequent purchaser or mortgagee had notice of the prior unrecorded deed, then the prior unrecorded deed prevails.\n\nIn this case, the friend has a deed from the son in 2005, which wasn't recorded until 2009, after the son's death in 2009.\n\nThe son mortgaged the property in 2008, before the friend's deed was recorded.\n\nSo, the bank, as the mortgagee in 2008, wouldn't have had constructive notice of the friend's prior unrecorded deed from 2005.\n\nTherefore, under a notice recording statute, the bank's mortgage, being recorded in 2008, would have priority over the friend's unrecorded deed from 2005.\n\nSo, even though the son had conveyed the property to the friend in 2005, the friend's interest wouldn't be protected against the bank's mortgage because the friend's deed wasn't recorded yet when the bank recorded its mortgage in 2008.\n\nTherefore, the bank's mortgage would be valid and enforceable against the friend's interest.\n\nBut wait, the son had already conveyed the property to the friend in 2005, so did the son still have the authority to mortgage it in 2008?\n\nI think not, because he had already conveyed it to the friend.\n\nSo, perhaps the mortgage is invalid because the son didn't have the right to mortgage the property in 2008.\n\nBut, if the bank was a bona fide mortgagee without notice, maybe the bank's interest prevails.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the chain of title.\n\nIn 1940, the state deeds the land to the man, recorded.\n\nIn 1990, the man dies and devises the land to his son via will, probated.\n\nIn 2005, the son deeds the land to the friend, but the deed isn't recorded until 2009.\n\nIn 2008, the son mortgages the land to the bank, recorded in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the son dies, and his will names the friend as the sole legatee and devisee of his entire estate, probated.\n\nSo, at the time of the mortgage in 2008, the son had already conveyed the property to the friend in 2005, but the friend's deed wasn't recorded yet.\n\nThe bank, as the mortgagee in 2008, wouldn't have had constructive notice of the friend's prior unrecorded deed.\n\nTherefore, under a notice recording statute, the bank's mortgage, being recorded in 2008, would have priority over the friend's unrecorded deed from 2005.\n\nSo, the bank's mortgage would be valid and enforceable.\n\nBut, the friend had a deed from the son in 2005, which should have transferred title to the friend, even if it wasn't recorded yet.\n\nSo, perhaps the friend owns the property, and the bank's mortgage is invalid because it was taken from someone who no longer owned the property.\n\nBut, under the recording statute, the bank, as a subsequent bona fide mortgagee without notice, gets priority.\n\nI think the bank's mortgage is valid and enforceable against the friend's interest.\n\nSo, option D seems correct: the subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n\nOption A says the mortgage would be invalid because the son conveyed his interest to the friend in 2005.\n\nBut, under the recording statute, the bank, as a subsequent bona fide mortgagee without notice, would have priority.\n\nOption B says the mortgage would be invalid because the first mortgage in 1988 would take precedence over the second mortgage.\n\nBut, the 1988 mortgage was to the rancher and was recorded in 1988.\n\nThe 2008 mortgage to the bank is subordinate to the 1988 mortgage, as stated in the mortgage instrument.\n\nBut, the validity of the 2008 mortgage itself is what's in question here.\n\nOption C says the mortgage would be invalid unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.\n\nBut, under a notice recording statute, it's about constructive notice via recording.\n\nThe bank didn't have constructive notice of the friend's unrecorded deed in 2008.\n\nTherefore, the bank's mortgage would be valid.\n\nSo, I think option D is the correct answer.\n\nTo summarize, even though the son had conveyed the property to the friend in 2005, because that deed wasn't recorded until 2009, after the son's death and after the bank's mortgage was recorded in 2008, the bank, as a subsequent bona fide mortgagee without notice of the prior unrecorded deed, would have priority and its mortgage would be valid and enforceable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
