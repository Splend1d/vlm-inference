                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about the death of Qin Dynasty emperor Ying Zheng. The options are pretty dramatic, so I need to recall which one actually matches his memorial.\n\nFirst, option A mentions an enormous mortuary temple filled with gold and gems. That sounds impressive, but I think the Qin Dynasty was more known for other types of monuments.\n\nOption B talks about an enormous pyramid constructed out of millions of huge limestone blocks. Hmm, pyramids make me think of Egypt, but I don't remember China having pyramids like that. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I think the architecture of the Qin Dynasty was different.\n\nOption C says the collective suicide of 60 members of the royal family. That seems extremely drastic and doesn't ring a bell. I can't recall any stories of mass suicide in the Qin Dynasty's history.\n\nOption D mentions an 8,000-member life-sized terra cotta army. Now, that sounds familiar. I think I've heard of the terra cotta warriors before. They were discovered in China, weren't they?\n\nLet me think more carefully. The Qin Dynasty is famous for unifying China and for building the Great Wall, but also for the terra cotta army. I remember that these were thousands of terracotta soldiers buried near the emperor's tomb to protect him in the afterlife.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, the terra cotta army was part of Emperor Ying Zheng's mausoleum. He was the first emperor of China, and he was buried with this vast army of clay soldiers.\n\nLet me cross-verify this. I know that the terra cotta warriors were discovered in the 1970s near Xi'an, in Shaanxi Province, which was the capital of the Qin Dynasty. The tomb complex is massive, and the terra cotta army is just one part of it.\n\nBut is there any truth to the other options? For instance, was there a mortuary temple filled with gold and gems? Well, the Qin Dynasty was known for its grandiose projects, but I think their focus was more on military might and territorial expansion rather than building opulent temples.\n\nAs for the pyramid made of limestone blocks, that sounds a lot like the Egyptian pyramids, which are made of stone and serve as tombs for pharaohs. In China, while there are some pyramidal structures, they are not constructed in the same way as Egyptian pyramids, and I don't think they were made from millions of huge limestone blocks.\n\nLastly, the idea of 60 royal family members committing suicide seems unlikely. I can't think of any cultural or historical context in the Qin Dynasty that would support such an event.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, the correct answer should be D: An 8,000-member life-sized terra cotta army.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check a few points. The terra cotta army consists of over 8,000 life-sized terracotta figures of soldiers and horses, which were buried with the emperor to protect him in the afterlife. This matches option D perfectly.\n\nOption A, an enormous mortuary temple filled with gold and gems, might be confusing with some later Chinese dynasties that did build grand temples, but not to the extent described here, and certainly not filled with gold and gems in the manner suggested.\n\nOption B, an enormous pyramid constructed out of millions of huge limestone blocks, is more characteristic of ancient Egyptian civilization, not Chinese.\n\nOption C, the collective suicide of 60 members of the royal family, doesn't align with any known historical events in the Qin Dynasty.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is D: An 8,000-member life-sized terra cotta army.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
