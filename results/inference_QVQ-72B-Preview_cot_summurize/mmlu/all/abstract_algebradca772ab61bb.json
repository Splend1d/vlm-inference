                    "text": "So I need to find the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I remember that Z_30 is the group of integers modulo 30 under addition. So, elements are like 0, 1, 2, up to 29, and addition is modulo 30.\n\nNow, the cyclic subgroup generated by 25, denoted by <25>, is the set of all integer multiples of 25 modulo 30. So, I need to find all the elements that can be written as 25*k mod 30, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nFirst, let's compute a few multiples of 25 modulo 30 to see if I can spot a pattern or find the order of the subgroup.\n\nStarting with 25*1 mod 30:\n\n25 mod 30 = 25, since 25 is less than 30.\n\nNext, 25*2 mod 30:\n\n50 mod 30 = 20.\n\nThen, 25*3 mod 30:\n\n75 mod 30 = 15.\n\nContinuing:\n\n25*4 mod 30 = 100 mod 30 = 10.\n\n25*5 mod 30 = 125 mod 30 = 5.\n\n25*6 mod 30 = 150 mod 30 = 0.\n\nOkay, so after 6 multiples, I'm back to 0, which means the subgroup <25> consists of the elements {0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25}. That's 6 elements.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nStarting with 25, then adding 25 again to get 50 mod 30, which is 20, then 75 mod 30 is 15, 100 mod 30 is 10, 125 mod 30 is 5, and 150 mod 30 is 0. Then, adding 25 to 0 brings me back to 25, and the cycle repeats.\n\nSo, yes, there are only 6 distinct elements in <25>.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 25\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 6\n\nD. 30\n\nIt seems like the correct answer is C. 6.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's another way to approach this, maybe using properties of cyclic subgroups or the order of elements in Z_n.\n\nI recall that in Z_n, the order of an element a is given by n / gcd(a, n). Here, n = 30, and a = 25. So, gcd(25, 30) = 5.\n\nTherefore, the order of 25 in Z_30 should be 30 / 5 = 6, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I know that the order of the subgroup generated by an element in Z_n is equal to n divided by the greatest common divisor of n and the element.\n\nSo, again, 30 / gcd(25, 30) = 30 / 5 = 6.\n\nThis reinforces that the correct answer is 6.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A is 25. Well, there are 25 elements in Z_30, but that doesn't relate directly to the subgroup generated by 25. So, that doesn't make sense here.\n\nOption B is 5. That might be confusing with the gcd(25, 30) = 5, but according to the formula, it's n / gcd(a, n), which is 30 / 5 = 6, not 5.\n\nOption D is 30. That would be the entire group Z_30, but <25> is a proper subgroup, as it only has 6 elements, not all 30.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed C. 6.\n\nI think that's solid. No further confusion here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
