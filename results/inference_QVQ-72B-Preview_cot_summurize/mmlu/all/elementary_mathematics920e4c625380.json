                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a basketball player who scored 18 points in his first game, and that's four points fewer than he scored in his second game. I need to write and solve an equation to find out how many points he scored in his second game. The options are given, but I want to make sure I understand how to do this on my own.\n\nFirst, I need to define what p represents. According to the question, p is the number of points he scored in his second game. So, p = points in second game.\n\nThe problem says that he scored 18 points in the first game, and that's four points fewer than what he scored in the second game. So, if I think about it, the points in the first game plus four would equal the points in the second game. Or, alternatively, the points in the second game minus four would give me the points in the first game.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPoints in first game + 4 = points in second game\n\nSo, 18 + 4 = p\n\nThat means 22 = p\n\nSo, p = 22\n\nAlternatively, points in second game - 4 = points in first game\n\nSo, p - 4 = 18\n\nThen, if I solve for p, I add 4 to both sides:\n\np = 18 + 4\n\np = 22\n\nSo, both ways lead me to the same answer, p = 22.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 18 = p \u2212 4; 14\n\nB. 18 = p \u2212 4; 22\n\nC. 18 \u2212 4 = p; 14\n\nD. 18 \u2212 p = 4; 22\n\nOption B seems to match what I have: 18 = p - 4, and p = 22.\n\nBut wait, option A also has 18 = p - 4, but it says p = 14, which doesn't make sense because if you plug in p = 14, then 18 = 14 - 4 \u21d2 18 = 10, which is not true.\n\nOption C has 18 - 4 = p, which simplifies to 14 = p, but that contradicts what I found earlier.\n\nOption D has 18 - p = 4, which would mean p = 14, again not matching my answer.\n\nSo, based on my calculations, option B seems correct, but let me double-check.\n\nIf p = 22, then 18 = 22 - 4 \u21d2 18 = 18, which is true.\n\nAlternatively, if p = 22, then 18 - p = 18 - 22 = -4, which is not equal to 4, so option D is incorrect.\n\nOption C suggests p = 14, but then 18 - 4 = 14 \u21d2 14 = 14, which is true, but according to the problem, if the first game is 18 points, which is four fewer than the second game, then the second game should be 22 points, not 14.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the phrasing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"A basketball player scored 18 points in his first game. This is 4 points fewer than he scored in his second game. Write and solve an equation to find p the number of points he scored in his second game.\"\n\nSo, first game: 18 points, which is 4 points fewer than the second game.\n\nSo, second game: p, and first game is p - 4 = 18.\n\nSo, p - 4 = 18 \u21d2 p = 22.\n\nAlternatively, first game + 4 = second game \u21d2 18 + 4 = p \u21d2 p = 22.\n\nYes, so option B is correct: 18 = p - 4; 22\n\nOption A has 18 = p - 4; 14, which would make p = 22, but it lists p = 14, which is inconsistent.\n\nOption C has 18 - 4 = p; 14, which is correct for the equation, but according to the problem, p should be 22.\n\nOption D has 18 - p = 4; 22, which would give p = 14, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\nI think that's it. I just needed to write the equation based on the relationship given and solve for p.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
