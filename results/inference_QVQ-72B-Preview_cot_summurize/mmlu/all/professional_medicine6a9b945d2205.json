                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 63-year-old woman who's come to the doctor with sudden pain and swelling in her right knee. This happened just a day ago, and she didn't injure it or anything. She does take ibuprofen sometimes for mild osteoarthritis in both knees. Her vital signs are pretty normal: temperature is 37\u00b0C, pulse is 97 beats per minute, respirations are 19 per minute, and blood pressure is 129 over 79 mm Hg.\n\nWhen the doctor examines her right knee, they notice warmth, redness (erythema), and fluid buildup (effusion). Even with just a little movement, she experiences a lot of tenderness. They did a joint aspiration, which means they took some synovial fluid from the knee, and under polarized light microscopy, they saw clear fluid with positively birefringent rhomboids.\n\nOkay, so the question is asking what substance's deposition is most likely causing these symptoms. The options are:\n\nA. Ammonium urate\n\nB. Calcium oxalate\n\nC. Calcium pyrophosphate\n\nD. Calcium urate\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The patient has sudden onset of knee pain and swelling without any injury, and she has osteoarthritis. The synovial fluid is clear, which is typical, but there are these rhomboid-shaped crystals that are positively birefringent under polarized light.\n\nI recall that birefringence is a property of crystals to refract light in a specific way when viewed under polarized light. Positively birefringent means that the crystals appear bright when aligned with the polarizer.\n\nNow, let's think about the different types of crystal-associated arthropathies.\n\nStarting with ammonium urate: I'm not too familiar with this one. I know that urate crystals are involved in gout, but those are usually sodium urate crystals, not ammonium urate. Maybe this is a typo or a distractor.\n\nCalcium oxalate: I know that calcium oxalate crystals can be found in urine and are a common cause of kidney stones, but I'm not sure about their association with joint diseases.\n\nCalcium pyrophosphate: This rings a bell. I think it's related to pseudogout or chondrocalcinosis. It's deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joints, which can cause inflammatory arthritis, especially in older adults with osteoarthritis.\n\nCalcium urate: Again, I'm more familiar with sodium urate in gout. Calcium urate deposition is less common and might not be the primary consideration here.\n\nGiven that the patient has osteoarthritis and is experiencing an acute flare-up of knee symptoms, pseudogout comes to mind. Pseudogout is caused by calcium pyrophosphate deposition and can present with acute inflammatory arthritis, often in older adults with osteoarthritis.\n\nLet me double-check the characteristics of the synovial fluid. It's clear, which is consistent with pseudogout, as gouty arthritis often has cloudy or turbid fluid due to the presence of urate crystals.\n\nAlso, the crystals are positively birefringent rhomboids. I remember that calcium pyrophosphate crystals are rhomboid-shaped and exhibit positive birefringence under polarized light microscopy.\n\nIn contrast, urate crystals in gout are needle-shaped and negatively birefringent.\n\nSo, based on the crystal shape and birefringence, calcium pyrophosphate seems to be the most likely culprit here.\n\nLet me consider the other options again to make sure.\n\nAmmonium urate: Not sure about this one, but it's not a standard term I've heard in crystal-induced arthritis.\n\nCalcium oxalate: While calcium oxalate can form crystals, I don't recall them being associated with joint diseases in this manner. They're more commonly known for forming kidney stones.\n\nCalcium urate: Again, urate crystals in gout are typically sodium urate, not calcium urate. So, this might not be the right choice.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is calcium pyrophosphate deposition, which causes pseudogout.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the patient's age and comorbidities. She's 63 years old, which fits the typical age range for pseudogout, as it often affects middle-aged and older adults. She has osteoarthritis, which is a risk factor for CPPD deposition.\n\nAlso, the acute onset of pain and swelling without injury is consistent with a crystal-induced arthritis flare-up, such as pseudogout.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Calcium pyrophosphate}} \\]"
