                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem: a grocery store sells a bag of 5 lemons for $2.00, and I need to find the unit cost of each lemon in the bag. The options are $2.50, $0.60, $0.40, and $0.10. Okay, so unit cost means how much does one lemon cost, right? I need to find the cost per lemon.\n\nAlright, I have the total cost for 5 lemons, which is $2.00. So, if 5 lemons cost $2.00, to find the cost of one lemon, I should probably divide the total cost by the number of lemons. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll take $2.00 and divide it by 5. Let's do that. 2 divided by 5. Hmm, 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So, $2.00 \u00f7 5 = $0.40 per lemon.\n\nLet me double-check that. If one lemon costs $0.40, then five lemons should cost 5 \u00d7 $0.40, which is $2.00. Yeah, that matches the given information.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using fractions. The total cost is $2.00 for 5 lemons, so per lemon it would be $2.00 over 5. Yeah, that's the same as dividing by 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the cost per lemon in terms of cents to make it easier. Since $2.00 is 200 cents, and 200 cents divided by 5 lemons is 40 cents per lemon. That's the same as $0.40. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there any chance that the cost isn't evenly distributed among the lemons? The problem says \"a bag of 5 lemons for $2.00,\" which implies that the total cost for the bag is $2.00, and it's assumed that each lemon costs the same unless stated otherwise.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems straightforward. Just need to divide the total cost by the number of lemons to get the unit cost.\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the unit cost is $0.40 per lemon. That would make the correct answer C. $0.40.\n\nLet me just quickly see what the other options are:\n\nA. $2.50 \u2013 that's higher than the total cost, which doesn't make sense because that would mean each lemon costs more than the whole bag.\n\nB. $0.60 \u2013 that would make the total cost for five lemons $3.00, which is more than the given $2.00.\n\nD. $0.10 \u2013 that would make the total cost for five lemons $0.50, which is less than the given $2.00.\n\nSo, none of these other options match the given total cost except for $0.40.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ \\$0.40} \\]"
