                    "text": "So I have this problem here about expected values and variances of random variables. It says that X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6, E(X) = 307, and var(Y) = 8. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me read that again.\n\nIt says E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6, E(X) = 307, and var(Y) = 8. Hmm, there are two E(X) given, but they're different values. Maybe there's a typo here. One of them might be E(Y) instead of E(X). Let's assume that the second E(X) is actually E(Y).\n\nSo, if E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6, E(Y) = 307, and var(Y) = 8, then I need to find E(X + Y) and var(X + Y).\n\nFirst, for the expected value of X + Y, I recall that E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y), assuming that X and Y are independent or at least uncorrelated for the expected value to simply add up. But wait, do I need independence for E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)? No, actually, for any random variables X and Y, E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y), regardless of whether they're independent or not. So, E(X + Y) = 312 + 307 = 619. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the variance of X + Y, I need to know if X and Y are independent or not. If they are independent, then var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) = 6 + 8 = 14. But if they are not independent, I would need the covariance between X and Y to calculate the variance of the sum. The formula would be var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2*cov(X,Y). Since no information is given about the covariance or whether X and Y are independent, I think I have to assume that they are independent unless told otherwise.\n\nSo, based on that, E(X + Y) = 619 and var(X + Y) = 14.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 7\n\nB. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 10\n\nC. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 14\n\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\n\nGiven my calculations, option C seems correct if we assume independence. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nIf E(X) = 312 and E(Y) = 307, then E(X + Y) = 312 + 307 = 619, that seems right.\n\nFor variance, var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2*cov(X,Y). Since covariance isn't given, and it's not specified if X and Y are independent, I think the safest assumption is that they are independent, leading to var(X + Y) = 6 + 8 = 14.\n\nAlternatively, if they are not independent, I would need cov(X,Y) to calculate the variance, which isn't provided. So, unless specified otherwise, assuming independence is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
