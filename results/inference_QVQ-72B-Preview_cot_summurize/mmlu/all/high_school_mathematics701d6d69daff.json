                    "text": "So I have this problem here: an equilateral triangle with sides of 12 inches, and I need to find its area. The options are A. 62, B. 72, C. 84, and D. 112. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my geometry, but I remember that equilateral triangles have all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. That should make calculating the area easier.\n\nFirst, I recall that there's a formula for the area of an equilateral triangle. Let me think... Oh yeah, I think it's (\u221a3/4) times the side squared. So, area equals (\u221a3/4) * s\u00b2, where s is the length of a side. In this case, s is 12 inches.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, area = (\u221a3/4) * (12)\u00b2. Let's calculate that step by step. First, 12 squared is 144. Then, (\u221a3/4) * 144. Now, what's \u221a3? I think it's approximately 1.732. So, 1.732 divided by 4 is... let's see, 1.732 \u00f7 4 = 0.433. Then, 0.433 * 144.\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.4 * 144 = 57.6, and 0.033 * 144 is about 4.752, so added together, that's roughly 62.352. Looking back at the options, A. 62 is the closest to this calculation.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should be more precise. Let's try using more decimal places for \u221a3. I know that \u221a3 is approximately 1.7320508. So, (\u221a3/4) would be 1.7320508 \u00f7 4, which is approximately 0.4330127. Now, multiply that by 144: 0.4330127 * 144.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.4 * 144 = 57.6\n\n0.03 * 144 = 4.32\n\n0.0000127 * 144 = let's see, 0.0000127 * 100 is 0.00127, and 0.00127 * 44 is about 0.05588. So, total is approximately 57.6 + 4.32 + 0.05588 = 61.97588, which rounds to about 62.0.\n\nSo, the area is approximately 62 square inches. Looking back at the options, A. 62 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using trigonometry? I remember that in any triangle, the area can also be calculated using the formula (1/2) * a * b * sin(c), where a and b are sides and c is the included angle.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. So, if I take two sides as a = b = 12 inches, and the included angle c = 60 degrees, then area = (1/2) * 12 * 12 * sin(60\u00b0).\n\nI know that sin(60\u00b0) is \u221a3/2, which is approximately 0.8660254. So, area = (1/2) * 12 * 12 * 0.8660254.\n\nLet's calculate that: First, (1/2) * 12 * 12 = 72. Then, 72 * 0.8660254.\n\n72 * 0.8 = 57.6\n\n72 * 0.0660254 = let's see, 72 * 0.06 = 4.32, and 72 * 0.0060254 \u2248 0.431. So, total area \u2248 57.6 + 4.32 + 0.431 \u2248 62.351, which again rounds to about 62.0.\n\nThis confirms my previous calculation. So, both methods give me an area of approximately 62 square inches.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can derive the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle. If I draw an altitude (height) from one vertex to the opposite side, it bisects the base into two equal parts of 6 inches each, and forms two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2. So, if the shorter leg is 6 inches (half the base), then the height (the longer leg) is 6 * \u221a3 inches.\n\nTherefore, the height h = 6\u221a3 inches.\n\nNow, the area of the triangle can also be calculated using the formula (base * height)/2.\n\nSo, area = (12 * 6\u221a3)/2 = (72\u221a3)/2 = 36\u221a3.\n\nNow, \u221a3 is approximately 1.732, so 36 * 1.732 = let's calculate that.\n\n36 * 1.732:\n\nFirst, 36 * 1 = 36\n\n36 * 0.7 = 25.2\n\n36 * 0.032 = approximately 1.152\n\nAdding them up: 36 + 25.2 + 1.152 \u2248 62.352, which again is approximately 62.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculations, so I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 62 square inches, which corresponds to option A. 62.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c is \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with sides of 12 inches, s = (12 + 12 + 12)/2 = 18 inches.\n\nThen, area = \u221a[18(18 - 12)(18 - 12)(18 - 12)] = \u221a[18 * 6 * 6 * 6] = \u221a[18 * 216] = \u221a3888.\n\nNow, \u221a3888 can be simplified. 3888 = 36 * 108, so \u221a3888 = \u221a(36 * 108) = 6\u221a108.\n\nBut that seems messy. Alternatively, \u221a3888 = \u221a(16 * 243) = 4\u221a243.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate it directly. 18 * 6 = 108, * 6 = 648, * 6 = 3888. So, \u221a3888.\n\nI can calculate \u221a3888 directly. I know that 62^2 = 3844 and 63^2 = 3969. So, 62^2 = 3844 < 3888 < 3969 = 63^2.\n\nTo find a more precise value, I can use decimal places. 62.2^2 = 62^2 + 2*62*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 3844 + 24.8 + 0.04 = 3868.84\n\nStill less than 3888. Let's try 62.3^2 = 62^2 + 2*62*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 3844 + 37.2 + 0.09 = 3881.29\n\nCloser to 3888. 62.4^2 = 62^2 + 2*62*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 3844 + 49.6 + 0.16 = 3903.76, which is higher than 3888.\n\nSo, 62.3^2 \u2248 3881.29 and 62.4^2 \u2248 3903.76. Therefore, \u221a3888 is approximately 62.3 inches.\n\nThus, the area is approximately 62.3 square inches, which rounds to 62.\n\nThis further confirms that the correct answer is approximately 62 square inches, corresponding to option A. 62.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 62.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 62} \\]"
