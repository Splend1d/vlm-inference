                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about longevity in a certain locality. It says that the standard deviation of longevity is 14 years, and that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. I need to find the mean longevity, and it assumes that life spans follow a normal distribution.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same. But here, I don't know the mean yet, that's what I need to find. So, I can't directly use those concepts right away.\n\nI remember that in a normal distribution, the proportion of data within a certain number of standard deviations from the mean follows specific patterns. There's the empirical rule, or the 68-95-99.7 rule, which says that about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n\nBut in this problem, it's not about ranges around the mean; it's about a specific age, 75 years, and the percentage of people living longer than that. So, I need to relate this 30% to the standard normal distribution.\n\nMaybe I should standardize the value of 75 years using the z-score formula. The z-score is calculated as (X - \u03bc)/\u03c3, where X is the value, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nSo, z = (75 - \u03bc)/14.\n\nBut I don't know \u03bc yet, so I need to find a way to relate this to the given percentage.\n\nI know that 30% of people live longer than 75 years. That means that 70% live 75 years or less.\n\nIn probability terms, P(X \u2264 75) = 0.70.\n\nSince X is normally distributed with mean \u03bc and standard deviation 14, I can standardize this to a standard normal variable Z.\n\nSo, P((X - \u03bc)/14 \u2264 (75 - \u03bc)/14) = 0.70.\n\nBut (X - \u03bc)/14 is Z, which follows the standard normal distribution.\n\nTherefore, P(Z \u2264 (75 - \u03bc)/14) = 0.70.\n\nI know that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution gives the probability that Z is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\nSo, (75 - \u03bc)/14 is the z-score corresponding to the 70th percentile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nI can look up in the standard normal table to find the z-value that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.70.\n\nLooking up the z-table, a cumulative probability of 0.70 corresponds to approximately z = 0.5244.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nActually, in the standard normal table, a cumulative probability of 0.70 corresponds to a z-value of about 0.5244.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.\n\nSo, P(Z \u2264 0.5244) \u2248 0.70.\n\nTherefore, (75 - \u03bc)/14 = 0.5244.\n\nNow, I can solve for \u03bc.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 14:\n\n75 - \u03bc = 0.5244 * 14.\n\nCalculate 0.5244 times 14:\n\n0.5244 * 14 = 7.3416.\n\nSo, 75 - \u03bc = 7.3416.\n\nThen, subtract 7.3416 from both sides:\n\n\u03bc = 75 - 7.3416 = 67.6584.\n\nSo, the mean longevity should be approximately 67.6584 years.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 75 - 0.30(14) = 75 - 4.2 = 70.8\n\nB. 75 + 0.30(14) = 75 + 4.2 = 79.2\n\nC. 75 - 0.4756(14) = 75 - 6.6584 \u2248 68.3416\n\nD. 75 - 0.5244(14) = 75 - 7.3416 \u2248 67.6584\n\nSo, my calculated mean matches option D.\n\nBut wait a minute, the problem says \"30% of the people live longer than 75 years,\" which means P(X > 75) = 0.30, so P(X \u2264 75) = 0.70, which is what I used.\n\nBut let me confirm if the z-score corresponding to 0.70 is indeed 0.5244.\n\nChecking the standard normal table, a cumulative probability of 0.70 corresponds to a z-value of approximately 0.5244.\n\nAlternatively, if I use a calculator or software to find the inverse normal, I can get a more precise value.\n\nLet me use the inverse normal distribution.\n\nThe inverse normal for P(Z \u2264 z) = 0.70 is z \u2248 0.5244.\n\nSo, yes, my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the mean longevity is approximately 67.6584 years, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, the options are given with different z-scores multiplied by the standard deviation.\n\nOption A is 75 - 0.30(14), which is 75 - 4.2 = 70.8\n\nOption B is 75 + 0.30(14) = 79.2\n\nOption C is 75 - 0.4756(14) = 75 - 6.6584 \u2248 68.3416\n\nOption D is 75 - 0.5244(14) = 75 - 7.3416 \u2248 67.6584\n\nSo, based on my calculation, D seems correct.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of percentiles.\n\nSince 70% of the data is below 75 years, that means that 75 is the 70th percentile of the distribution.\n\nIn a normal distribution, the z-score corresponding to the 70th percentile is approximately 0.5244, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, again, z = (75 - \u03bc)/14 = 0.5244.\n\nSolving for \u03bc gives \u03bc = 75 - 0.5244*14 = 75 - 7.3416 \u2248 67.6584.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider using the standard normal distribution table more accurately, perhaps I can find the exact z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.70.\n\nLooking up the z-table, the closest value to 0.70 is 0.6915 at z = 0.5, and 0.7057 at z = 0.55.\n\nSo, 0.5244 seems to be an interpolated value between these points.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator or software, the inverse normal for 0.70 is indeed approximately 0.5244.\n\nTherefore, my calculation is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area under the normal curve to verify.\n\nThe area to the left of z is 0.70, so z \u2248 0.5244.\n\nThus, \u03bc = 75 - 0.5244*14 \u2248 67.6584.\n\nSo, the answer should be option D.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use a different approach, like using the empirical rule or something similar.\n\nBut the empirical rule gives rough estimates, and the problem seems to require a more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that 30% live longer than 75 years, which is the upper 30% of the distribution.\n\nBut in that case, P(X > 75) = 0.30, which is the same as P(X \u2264 75) = 0.70, which is what I used earlier.\n\nSo, no, that doesn't change anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a different z-score.\n\nWait, option C uses 0.4756, which is close to 0.5244 but not exactly the same.\n\nIs 0.4756 a standard z-score?\n\nLooking up in the z-table, z = 0.4756 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.6808, which is close to 0.70 but not exactly.\n\nSo, it's not the same as what's needed here.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to round differently.\n\nIf I round 0.5244 to 0.5, then \u03bc = 75 - 0.5*14 = 75 - 7 = 68, which is option C.\n\nBut that's not precise, and the problem likely expects the more accurate calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
