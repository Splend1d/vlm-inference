                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about an accountant who had his office on the eighth floor of a downtown building. He wanted to renovate the entrance to his office and hired an interior designer for the job. The designer gave him options for the glass in the door: plate glass, which is cheaper but less strong, or tempered glass, which is more expensive but stronger and harder to break. The accountant chose plate glass, and a few months after the door was installed, it shattered when one of his clients pulled on the handle, cutting the client's hand.\n\nNow, the client is considering filing a negligence claim against the accountant, and it's assumed that the manufacturer of the glass door was negligent in manufacturing the door, but this negligence wasn't discoverable through reasonable inspection. The question is, if the client sues the accountant based on negligence, which option will the plaintiff prevail under?\n\nLet me see the options:\n\nA. Prevail, because the accountant is liable for his supplier's negligence.\n\nB. Prevail, because the accountant instructed the designer to install plate glass rather than the more durable tempered glass.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the accountant couldn't reasonably have been expected to discover the defect.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the proper defendant is the manufacturer or the designer, not the accountant.\n\nAlright, so first, I need to understand the relationships here. The accountant hired a designer to do the renovation work, and the designer presumably ordered the plate glass door from a manufacturer. The door was installed, and it shattered later, injuring the client.\n\nThe client is considering a negligence claim against the accountant. Negligence typically requires duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages. So, did the accountant owe a duty to the client to ensure that the door was safely manufactured? If there was negligence in manufacturing the door, does that make the accountant negligent?\n\nOption A says the client will prevail because the accountant is liable for his supplier's negligence. But is that accurate? In general, if someone hires a contractor or supplier, is the hiring party liable for the contractor's negligence? I think it depends on the circumstances. If the accountant was supposed to supervise the work or if there was some delegation of duty, it might be different. But generally, the designer or the manufacturer would be directly responsible for the quality of the door.\n\nOption B says the client will prevail because the accountant chose plate glass instead of tempered glass. So, is choosing a less strong type of glass negligent? Well, the designer mentioned that the majority of residential and small business establishments use plate glass for such doors. Does that mean it's an acceptable standard of care? The accountant relied on professional advice and chose a commonly used material. It's not clear that this choice in itself was negligent.\n\nOption C says the client will not prevail because the accountant couldn't reasonably have been expected to discover the defect. So, if the negligence in manufacturing wasn't discoverable through reasonable inspection, does that mean the accountant wasn't negligent in choosing the door? It seems like the accountant did what was reasonable by selecting a standard type of glass and relying on the designer and manufacturer to provide a safe product.\n\nOption D says the client will not prevail because the proper defendant is the manufacturer or the designer, not the accountant. This seems plausible because the manufacturer is directly responsible for the quality of the glass, and the designer is responsible for installing it correctly. Unless the accountant was directly involved in the manufacturing or installation process, it might not be his fault.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, a property owner can be held liable for injuries that occur on their property if they didn't take reasonable steps to ensure safety. So, maybe the accountant has some duty to ensure that the door is safe, even if he relied on professionals for the choice and installation.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nFirst, the accountant hired a professional designer to handle the renovation. The designer presented options, and the accountant chose plate glass based on the designer's information that it's commonly used and less expensive. There was no indication that plate glass was unsafe for this purpose; in fact, it's stated that the great majority of residential and small business establishments use plate glass for such doors.\n\nSo, the accountant made a choice based on professional advice and common practice. He didn't choose something that was known to be unsafe.\n\nNow, the door shattered due to negligent manufacture by the manufacturer, and this negligence wasn't discoverable through reasonable inspection. That means the accountant, even if he had inspected the door, wouldn't have been able to find out that it was defectively manufactured.\n\nIn this case, if the accountant had no way of knowing that the glass was defectively manufactured, and he had acted reasonably in choosing and installing the door, it seems unfair to hold him liable for the manufacturer's negligence.\n\nIn product liability law, there are different theories of liability, such as negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty. If the accountant is being sued for negligence, the plaintiff would have to show that the accountant breached a duty of care that caused the injury.\n\nDid the accountant have a duty to ensure that the glass door was safely manufactured? Generally, property owners have a duty to maintain their premises in a safe condition, but this usually applies to defects that they know about or should have known about through reasonable inspection.\n\nIn this scenario, the defect was not discoverable through reasonable inspection, so the accountant wouldn't have known about it. Therefore, he didn't breach any duty to maintain the premises safely because he couldn't have known about the defect.\n\nOn the other hand, if the accountant had reason to suspect that the glass might be defective and didn't take action, that might be different. But according to the scenario, there was no way he could have known.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the client wouldn't prevail in a negligence claim against the accountant because the accountant couldn't reasonably have been expected to discover the defect in the glass.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A suggests that the accountant is liable for his supplier's negligence. However, in general, unless there's some specific contractual relationship or unless the accountant was negligent in choosing the supplier, he shouldn't be directly liable for the supplier's actions. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B argues that choosing plate glass over tempered glass is negligent. But given that plate glass is commonly used and was recommended by a professional designer, it doesn't seem negligent to choose it. The accountant relied on expert advice and common practice.\n\nOption D suggests that the proper defendant is the manufacturer or the designer, not the accountant. This is likely true, as the manufacturer is directly responsible for the quality of the glass, and the designer was responsible for installing it. However, in some jurisdictions, the property owner might still be held liable under certain circumstances, even if they weren't at fault.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that the accountant acted reasonably and didn't have any reason to know about the defect in the glass. Therefore, the client shouldn't prevail in a negligence claim against the accountant.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not prevail, because the accountant couldn't reasonably have been expected to discover the defect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
