Jimmy Swaggart.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these famous evangelists is related to the famous rocker Jerry Lee Lewis. I'm not entirely sure about their family connections, so I'll have to do a bit of thinking and maybe recall some information I've come across before.\n\nFirst off, let's think about who Jerry Lee Lewis is. He's a rock and roll pianist and singer, often referred to as \"The Killer.\" He was big in the 1950s and 60s, known for hits like \"Great Balls of Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.\" Now, among the evangelists listed, who might have a connection to him?\n\nBilly Graham is probably the most well-known evangelist on the list. He was an American evangelical Christian minister who reached billions of people through his crusades and broadcasts. He was friends with presidents and had a global impact. But I don't recall any family connection between him and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nOral Roberts was another prominent evangelist, known for his tent revivals and later his television ministry. He founded Oral Roberts University and was famous for his healing services. Again, I don't remember any link to Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nJerry Falwell was an evangelist and moral conservative who co-founded the Moral Majority, a political organization that sought to influence American politics in a conservative direction. He was also the founder of Liberty University. While he was involved in politics and education, I don't think there's a family connection there either.\n\nThat leaves Jimmy Swaggart. He's an evangelist who has had a successful ministry, including television broadcasts and revivals. He's also a musician and has recorded gospel music. Interestingly, I seem to recall that Jimmy Swaggart is related to Jerry Lee Lewis. Let me see if I can confirm that.\n\nI think Jerry Lee Lewis and Jimmy Swaggart are cousins. They both come from Louisiana families with a history in music and, in Swaggart's case, evangelism. I believe their families are related through some common ancestors in the state.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider if there's any other possible connection between the other evangelists and Jerry Lee Lewis. For instance, did Billy Graham ever mention any family ties to Lewis? Not that I know of. Oral Roberts was primarily from Oklahoma, and Jerry Falwell was from Virginia, whereas Jerry Lee Lewis was from Ferriday, Louisiana.\n\nJimmy Swaggart, on the other hand, is also from Louisiana, and I'm pretty confident that they are cousins. In fact, I think Jerry Lee Lewis and Mickey Gilley, another musician, are also related in some way, but that's beside the point here.\n\nSo, based on what I can recall, the correct answer should be D. Jimmy Swaggart. He is the cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis among the evangelists listed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\text{ Jimmy Swaggart}} \\]"
