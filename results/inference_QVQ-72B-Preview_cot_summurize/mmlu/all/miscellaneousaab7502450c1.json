Orangutan.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I need to recall which of these great apes are found naturally in Africa and which one isn't.\n\nI know that great apes belong to the family Hominidae, which includes humans and several species of apes. The question is asking specifically about those that are NOT native to Africa.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Gorilla: I remember that gorillas are native to central Africa. There are lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas, both found in various countries in central Africa. So, gorillas are definitely native to Africa.\n\nNext, B. Human: Humans are also native to Africa. Our evolutionary history shows that Homo sapiens originated in Africa and then spread to other parts of the world. So, humans are originally from Africa.\n\nThen, C. Chimpanzee: Chimpanzees are another primate species that are native to Africa. They are found in various countries across western and central Africa. So, they belong to Africa as well.\n\nFinally, D. Orangutan: Now, this is the one that stands out. Orangutans are native to Southeast Asia, specifically Indonesia and Malaysia. They are found in Borneo and Sumatra islands. So, unlike the other options, orangutans are not native to Africa.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, I should double-check this information. Maybe I can recall some facts about each species.\n\nGorillas: They are the largest living primates and are native to forests of central Africa. So, definitely African.\n\nHumans: Our ancestry traces back to Africa, and the earliest known fossils of Homo sapiens have been found in Ethiopia. So, humans are originally from Africa.\n\nChimpanzees: They are closely related to humans and are found in the forests of western and central Africa. Again, African natives.\n\nOrangutans: These are the only great apes found in Asia, specifically in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. So, they are not native to Africa.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any subspecies or exceptions that might complicate this answer. For example, are there any orangutans that have been introduced to Africa? I don't think so. Orangutans are exclusively found in their natural habitats in Southeast Asia, and they are critically endangered due to habitat loss and other factors.\n\nAlso, considering the historical range of these species, I don't recall any evidence of orangutans ever being native to Africa. The other options\u2014gorillas, humans, and chimpanzees\u2014all have clear ties to Africa, either currently or historically in the case of humans who migrated out of Africa.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be D. Orangutan, as it is not native to Africa.\n\nJust to wrap it up, the question is asking for the great ape that is NOT native to Africa among the given options. Since gorillas, humans, and chimpanzees are all native to Africa, and orangutans are native to Southeast Asia, orangutan is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Orangutan}} \\]"
