                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about decision-making biases. It's asking what the term is for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias. The options are A. Framing bias, B. Hindsight bias, C. Over-confidence bias, and D. Heuristics. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a 'rule of thumb' means in this context. A rule of thumb is generally a simplified guideline or principle that's easy to remember and apply, but it might not always be accurate or applicable in every situation. So, in decision-making, relying too heavily on these shortcuts could lead to biases or errors in judgment.\n\nNow, I need to match this concept with the correct term from the options provided.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Framing bias: I remember that framing bias is when the way information is presented affects our decisions. For example, if something is presented as a gain versus a loss, it can influence our choices. But this doesn't seem directly related to 'rule of thumb' decision-making. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nB. Hindsight bias: This is when, after an event has occurred, we tend to overestimate how well we could have predicted it. It's like saying, \"I knew it all along,\" when in reality, we didn't. This doesn't sound like it fits the 'rule of thumb' description either.\n\nC. Over-confidence bias: This is when we overestimate our own abilities or the accuracy of our beliefs and judgments. While this can lead to making decisions based on incomplete or incorrect information, it's more about overestimating oneself rather than using simplified rules.\n\nD. Heuristics: This one seems promising. Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that people use to make decisions quickly and efficiently. They're useful in many situations, but they can also lead to biases and errors when the situation doesn't perfectly fit the heuristic.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the term that describes the 'rule of thumb' type of bias. So, heuristics seem to fit the bill because they are literally rules of thumb that we use to make decisions faster, but they can sometimes lead to biased or inaccurate judgments.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that any of the other options could also be considered 'rule of thumb' biases?\n\nFraming bias is about how information is presented, not about using a rule of thumb. Hindsight bias is about perceiving predictability after the fact, which isn't directly related to rules of thumb. Over-confidence bias is about overestimating one's own knowledge or abilities, which might involve using personal rules of thumb, but it's not primarily about the rule itself; it's about overconfidence in one's judgments.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision-making is heuristics.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll recall an example. Suppose someone uses the heuristic of \"going with the majority\" to make a decision. This is a simple rule that might often lead to good decisions, but in some cases, it could lead to poor choices if the majority is wrong. This is a classic example of a heuristic leading to a potential bias in decision-making.\n\nAnother example is the availability heuristic, where people make judgments based on how easily examples come to mind. If recent or vivid events are more readily available, this can skew their decisions.\n\nYes, these are all examples of heuristics influencing decision-making and potentially leading to biases.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be D. Heuristics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
