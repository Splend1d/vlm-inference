                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Who was the longest reigning monarch in French history?\" and the options are Louis XIII, Louis XIV, Louis XV, and Louis XVI. Okay, I need to figure out which one of these kings reigned for the longest time.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall the reign periods of each of these monarchs. I know that the Bourbon dynasty was prominent in French history, and these Louis were part of that dynasty. Let me think about their reign durations.\n\nStarting with Louis XIII: I think he reigned from 1610 to 1643. So, that would be about 33 years. Is that right? Let me confirm that. Yes, Louis XIII became king in 1610 when his father, Henry IV, was assassinated, and he died in 1643.\n\nNext, Louis XIV: He is often associated with the Sun King and had a long reign, didn't he? He came to power in 1643, after his father Louis XIII died, and he ruled until 1715. So, that would be from 1643 to 1715. Let me calculate that: 1715 minus 1643 is 72 years. Wow, that's a long time.\n\nNow, Louis XV: He followed Louis XIV and reigned from 1715 to 1774. So, that's from 1715 to 1774, which is 59 years. Still less than Louis XIV's 72 years.\n\nLastly, Louis XVI: He is famous for being the king during the French Revolution. He reigned from 1774 to 1792, when he was overthrown and later executed. So, that's from 1774 to 1792, which is 18 years.\n\nSo, let's summarize:\n\n- Louis XIII: 1610-1643 (33 years)\n\n- Louis XIV: 1643-1715 (72 years)\n\n- Louis XV: 1715-1774 (59 years)\n\n- Louis XVI: 1774-1792 (18 years)\n\nClearly, Louis XIV had the longest reign among these options, with 72 years.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure there aren't any other Louis or monarchs who might have reigned longer in French history. Let me think about it.\n\nI recall that there were other Bourbon kings before Louis XIII, like Henry IV, who was his father, but Henry IV reigned from 1589 to 1610, which is only 21 years. So, that's shorter than Louis XIII.\n\nGoing back further, there were Valois kings, like Charles VII or Louis XI, but their reigns were also shorter. For example, Charles VII reigned from 1422 to 1461 (39 years), and Louis XI from 1461 to 1483 (22 years).\n\nWhat about later kings after Louis XVI? After the French Revolution, there was a republic and then the First Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon was emperor from 1804 to 1815, which is about 11 years, still much shorter than Louis XIV.\n\nAfter Napoleon, the Bourbon monarchy was restored with Louis XVIII, who reigned from 1814 to 1824 (about 10 years), and then Charles X from 1824 to 1830 (about 6 years). So, none of these come close to Louis XIV's reign length.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to conclude that Louis XIV was the longest-reigning monarch in French history, with a reign spanning 72 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Louis XIV}} \\]"
