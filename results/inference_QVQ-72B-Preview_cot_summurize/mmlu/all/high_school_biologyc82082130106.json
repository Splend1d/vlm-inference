                    "text": "So I have this question about DNA base composition in different species. It says that the base composition varies from one species to another, which makes sense because different organisms might have different sequences of nucleotides in their DNA. But then it asks which of the following ratios would I expect to remain constant in DNA. The options are:\n\nA. Cytosine : Adenine\n\nB. Pyrimidine : Purine\n\nC. Adenine : Guanine\n\nD. Guanine : Deoxyribose\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about DNA structure and base pairing. DNA is a double-stranded molecule with two complementary strands held together by hydrogen bonds between specific pairs of bases. The famous Watson and Crick model tells us that adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) always pairs with guanine (G). This is called base pairing specificity.\n\nSo, A = T and C = G.\n\nGiven that, the ratios of these complementary bases should be constant across different species because of this pairing rule.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for ratios that would remain constant in DNA, not necessarily across different species, but in DNA in general. Hmm, maybe I need to be more precise.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Cytosine : Adenine\n\nIn DNA, C pairs with G, and A pairs with T. So, the amount of C is related to G, and A is related to T. There's no direct relationship between C and A except through the total base composition. So, the ratio of C to A could vary depending on the overall base composition of the DNA. For example, in some species, there might be more C and G, and in others, more A and T. So, this ratio isn't necessarily constant.\n\nB. Pyrimidine : Purine\n\nLet's recall what pyrimidines and purines are. Pyrimidines are the bases C (cytosine) and T (thymine), while purines are A (adenine) and G (guanine). So, pyrimidines are the smaller bases, and purines are larger.\n\nIn DNA, the total number of pyrimidines should equal the total number of purines because each pyrimidine on one strand pairs with a purine on the other strand. Specifically, C pairs with G (both purine), and T pairs with A (pyrimidine with purine).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of pyrimidines to purines should be 1:1 in DNA, regardless of the specific base composition. So, this seems like a constant ratio.\n\nC. Adenine : Guanine\n\nAgain, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. So, A and G are not directly paired with each other. Their ratio could vary depending on the base composition. For example, in DNA with a high A+T content, there would be more A relative to G, whereas in DNA with more C+G, G would be more prevalent relative to A. So, this ratio isn't constant.\n\nD. Guanine : Deoxyribose\n\nThis one is interesting. Guanine is one of the nitrogenous bases, while deoxyribose is the sugar component of DNA. In each nucleotide, there is one base and one deoxyribose sugar. However, in DNA, the number of nucleotides can vary, but the ratio of bases to sugars should be 1:1 because each base is attached to one deoxyribose.\n\nSo, the ratio of guanine to deoxyribose would depend on the proportion of guanine in the total bases. Since guanine is one of the four bases, its ratio to deoxyribose would vary depending on how much G is present in the DNA relative to A, C, and T.\n\nTherefore, this ratio isn't constant.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, options B and D seem to have constant ratios, but upon closer inspection, D actually varies because guanine's proportion can change relative to the total deoxyribose.\n\nWait, no. In DNA, each nucleotide has one base and one deoxyribose, so the total number of bases equals the total number of deoxyribose molecules. However, the ratio of a specific base like guanine to total deoxyribose would depend on the percentage of guanine in the DNA, which can vary between species.\n\nTherefore, option D is not constant.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, the ratio that would remain constant in DNA is B. Pyrimidine : Purine, because the total pyrimidines always equal total purines due to base pairing.\n\nBut wait, what about option A, Cytosine : Adenine? In some specific cases, like in Chargaff's rules, it's known that in DNA, the amount of C equals G, and A equals T, but C to A ratio isn't necessarily constant unless C=G=A=T, which isn't generally the case.\n\nSimilarly, option C, A : G, wouldn't be constant unless A=G, which isn't typically true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Pyrimidine : Purine, because pyrimidines always equal purines in DNA due to base pairing rules.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
