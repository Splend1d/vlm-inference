                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 and whether it would be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era. The options are:\n\nA. Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal\"\n\nB. Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties\n\nC. No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\"\n\nD. No, because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was. From what I recall, it was a piece of legislation passed during Woodrow Wilson's presidency that aimed to lower tariffs on various imported goods. It was part of the Democratic Party's platform at the time, and it was seen as a way to make trade more free and to reduce the prices of imported goods, which might help consumers.\n\nNow, the question is about whether Progressives of that era would endorse this tariff. The Progressive Movement was a broad coalition of reformers who were active in the early 20th century, advocating for social and political changes. They were concerned with issues like corruption in government, the power of big business, and the well-being of workers and ordinary citizens.\n\nThe excerpt provided is from the Progressive Party Platform in 1912, which emphasizes the importance of the people's conscience and the need for a government that serves the people's interests. It talks about maintaining equal opportunity and industrial justice, and ensuring that laws and institutions are used for the general interest.\n\nSo, Progressives were big on reform, equality, and ensuring that the government worked for the benefit of all, not just a select few.\n\nNow, Teddy Roosevelt was a key figure in the Progressive Movement. He ran for president in 1912 under the Progressive Party, also known as the Bull Moose Party, after breaking away from the Republican Party. His \"Square Deal\" was a set of policies that aimed to control corporations, regulate railroads, and protect natural resources. Later, he talked about a \"New Nationalism,\" which emphasized the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and promoting social justice.\n\nWoodrow Wilson, on the other hand, was the Democratic candidate in 1912 and went on to become president. He had his own set of progressive ideas, known as the \"New Freedom,\" which focused on breaking up monopolies, reducing tariffs, and promoting competition.\n\nThe Underwood-Simmons Tariff was part of Wilson's New Freedom agenda. It aimed to lower tariffs to reduce the protective barriers for American industries, which Wilson believed would lead to lower prices for consumers and more competition.\n\nSo, considering that, I need to think about whether Progressives, who were into reform and looking out for the average person, would support this tariff.\n\nOption A says yes, because Progressives supported Teddy Roosevelt's Square Deal. But the Square Deal was more about regulating big business and conserving natural resources. I don't recall tariffs being a big part of the Square Deal. Maybe there's some connection I'm missing here.\n\nOption B says yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties. Well, that makes sense because the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was a Democratic initiative under Wilson. Democrats at that time were generally in favor of lower tariffs as part of their platform.\n\nOption C says no, because Progressives supported Teddy Roosevelt's New Nationalism. But New Nationalism was more about strong government regulation of business and economy. Again, not directly related to tariff policies.\n\nOption D says no, because Progressives were opponents of Woodrow Wilson. While it's true that Teddy Roosevelt and Wilson were political rivals, and Roosevelt ran against Wilson in 1912, that doesn't necessarily mean that Progressives would oppose everything Wilson did.\n\nI think I need to look at this differently. Maybe I should consider that Progressives were a diverse group, and some aligned more with Roosevelt's views, while others aligned with Wilson's New Freedom.\n\nAlso, the Progressive Party platform from 1912, which is provided, seems to align more with the idea of reform and ensuring that the government works for the people. Lowering tariffs could be seen as a way to reduce prices for consumers, which might benefit the general public.\n\nBut I also recall that some Progressives were protectionist, believing that high tariffs protected American jobs and industries from foreign competition. So, there might have been divide among Progressives on this issue.\n\nHowever, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by Wilson, and it was part of the Democratic Party's platform, which advocated for lower tariffs.\n\nGiven that, I think that many Progressives, especially those who aligned with Wilson's New Freedom, would have supported the Underwood-Simmons Tariff because it aligned with their goals of reducing the power of big business and promoting competition.\n\nOn the other hand, Progressives who were more aligned with Roosevelt's New Nationalism might have had different views, but even then, Roosevelt was a Progressive at heart and supported many reforms.\n\nI think the key here is that the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was a Democratic initiative, and Democrats were generally in favor of lower tariffs, as option B suggests.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is B: Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"would be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era.\" While many Progressives were Democrats, not all Progressives were Democrats. Some Progressives were Republicans, like Teddy Roosevelt and his followers.\n\nSo, maybe it's not accurate to say that most Progressives were Democrats who advocated lower duties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Progressive Movement, regardless of party affiliation, would have supported the Underwood-Simmons Tariff because it aligned with their broader goals of reform and promoting the general welfare.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure.\n\nLet me consider this another way. If I look back at the Progressive Party Platform from 1912, it emphasizes the importance of the government working for the people's interests and promoting equal opportunity and industrial justice.\n\nLowering tariffs could be seen as a way to promote competition and prevent monopolies from dominating the market, which aligns with Progressive goals.\n\nHowever, if some Progressives believed that lower tariffs would lead to job losses or harm to American industries, they might oppose the tariff.\n\nBut from what I recall, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was generally seen as a progressive measure because it aimed to reduce the protective tariffs that favored big businesses and instead promoted free trade and lower prices for consumers.\n\nMoreover, it was part of Wilson's New Freedom platform, which was progressive in nature.\n\nGiven that, I think that most Progressives would have supported the Underwood-Simmons Tariff because it aligned with their values of reform and promoting the general welfare.\n\nOption A suggests that Progressives supported Teddy Roosevelt's Square Deal, but the Square Deal was more about regulating big business and conservation, not specifically about tariffs.\n\nOption C suggests that Progressives supported Roosevelt's New Nationalism, which was more about strong government regulation, but again, not directly related to tariff policies.\n\nOption D suggests that Progressives were opponents of Woodrow Wilson, but that doesn't necessarily mean they would oppose his policies across the board.\n\nOption B seems the most straightforward: yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties, and the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was a Democratic initiative to lower tariffs.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that not all Progressives were Democrats, and some Progressive Republicans might have had different views on tariffs.\n\nBut, given that the Progressive Movement was largely in favor of reforms that benefited the general public, and that lowering tariffs was seen as a way to achieve that, I think that overall, Progressives would have endorsed the Underwood-Simmons Tariff.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option B: Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
