Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The \"Know-Nothings,\" lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day\u2026.But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers\u2026..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst\u2014a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War\u2014Poland and Italy.\"\nRobert H.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about nativism, and I need to pick which one of these legislative acts is the best example of nativism. The options are:\n\nA. The Wagner Act of 1935\n\nB. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798\n\nC. The Espionage Act of 1917\n\nD. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what nativism is. From what I recall, nativism is a policy or attitude that favors the interests of native-born citizens over those who are immigrants or are considered outsiders. It's often associated with protectionist measures and can involve discrimination or prejudice against immigrants.\n\nSo, to answer this question, I need to look at each of these acts and see which one aligns most closely with the definition of nativism.\n\nLet's start with The Wagner Act of 1935. I think this was part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It's also known as the National Labor Relations Act. From what I remember, this act was designed to protect the rights of workers to organize into unions and to engage in collective bargaining. It seems like this was more about labor rights and wasn't directly targeted at immigrants or outsiders. So, I'm not sure if this is the best example of nativism.\n\nNext, The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. These sound familiar. I think they were passed during the Federalist administration of John Adams, around the time of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. These acts were aimed at strengthening national security by making it harder for foreigners to become citizens and by increasing the penalties for sedition or speech critical of the government.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit contradictory. On one hand, they were targeting aliens, which would suggest some nativist tendencies, but on the other hand, they were also restricting free speech, which might not be directly related to nativism. Maybe I need to look into this a bit more.\n\nThen there's The Espionage Act of 1917. This was passed during World War I, I believe. It was likely related to national security measures during wartime. I think it made it a crime to interfere with military recruitment or to support enemies of the United States. Again, this seems more about national security during war than about nativism per se.\n\nFinally, The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. I know that this act significantly changed U.S. immigration policy by abolishing the national origins quota system, which had been in place since the 1920s and had favored European immigrants, particularly from Northern and Western Europe. Instead, this act established a system based on family reunification and skills-based immigration.\n\nGiven that, it seems like this act was moving away from nativist policies by removing the discriminatory quotas based on national origin. So, it doesn't seem like an example of nativism; rather, it was a step towards more inclusive immigration policies.\n\nSo, let's summarize what I've thought so far:\n\n- The Wagner Act of 1935: More about labor rights, not directly related to nativism.\n\n- The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798: Targeted aliens and restricted speech, which might be seen as nativist, but need to think more about it.\n\n- The Espionage Act of 1917: Primarily about national security during wartime, not specifically nativist.\n\n- The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965: Actually moved away from nativist policies.\n\nGiven that, maybe none of these are the best examples of nativism. But the question asks which one is most closely an example of nativism, so perhaps one of them stands out more than the others.\n\nLet me think about The Alien and Sedition Acts again. These acts were passed at a time when there was a lot of political tension between the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans. The Federalists were in power and were worried about the influence of French ideas and the potential for unrest among recent immigrants who sympathized with the French Revolution.\n\nSo, these acts were aimed at suppressing opposition, particularly from immigrants who were seen as a threat to national security and stability. By making it harder for immigrants to become citizens and by cracking down on dissent, the Federalists were protecting the interests of native-born citizens and established political power structures.\n\nThat sounds a lot like nativism\u2014favoring natives over immigrants and viewing newcomers with suspicion.\n\nOn the other hand, The Espionage Act of 1917 was passed during wartime and was more about preventing actual espionage and sabotage than about general restrictions on immigration or discrimination against particular groups.\n\nThe Wagner Act was indeed about labor rights and had nothing to do with nativism.\n\nAnd The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was actually a move away from nativist policies by eliminating the discriminatory quotas.\n\nTherefore, it seems that The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 are the most closely aligned with the concept of nativism among the given options.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there's any other context that could change this conclusion. For example, were there other acts in between these dates that might be more nativist in nature?\n\nWell, the question specifies these four options, so I think the answer is clear based on the provided choices.\n\nSo, my final answer would be B. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
