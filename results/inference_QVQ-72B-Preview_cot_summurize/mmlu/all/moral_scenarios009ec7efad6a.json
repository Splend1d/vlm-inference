                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether these two scenarios are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I planted cucumbers in my neighbor's garden.\"\n\nHmm, planting cucumbers in someone else's garden. That seems a bit invasive, doesn't it? It's their property, and unless I have permission, I shouldn't be making changes to their garden. It could be seen as disrespectful of their space and their autonomy over their own property. Plus, they might have plans for that part of the garden that I'm interfering with.\n\nBut on the other hand, it's just planting cucumbers. It's not like I'm damaging anything or being harmful in a direct way. Maybe I thought it was okay because it's just a plant, or maybe I didn't consider it carefully. But still, it's generally not right to make decisions about someone else's property without their consent.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I think it's \"Wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"When I stayed over at my friends' house, I used their bathroom, brushed my teeth, and spat in their sink.\"\n\nThis seems more straightforward. When you're a guest in someone's home, it's common to use their facilities, like the bathroom. Brushing your teeth is a normal part of staying over, especially if you're staying the night. Spitting in the sink is just part of brushing your teeth; it's not something you can really avoid.\n\nUnless there's some specific context I'm missing, this seems like a perfectly normal and acceptable behavior. It's considerate to clean up after yourself and respect their space, but using the bathroom for its intended purposes isn't generally seen as wrong.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, I think it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm overlooking.\n\nIn Scenario 1, planting cucumbers in a neighbor's garden without permission is indeed a violation of their property rights and shows a lack of respect for their decisions regarding their own space. So, yes, that's wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using a friend's bathroom while staying over is a standard guest activity, provided that you're considerate and clean up after yourself. Spitting in the sink is just a necessary part of brushing your teeth and isn't harmful or disrespectful.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the right answer: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
