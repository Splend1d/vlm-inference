                    "text": "So I have this problem here about autocorrelation coefficients, and I need to figure out which of these coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level. The data given is for lags 1, 2, and 3, with their respective coefficients: 0.2, -0.15, and -0.1. It also says to assume that the coefficients are approximately normally distributed. The options are:\n\nA. 1 only\n\nB. 1 and 2 only\n\nC. 1, 2 and 3 only\n\nD. It is not possible to determine the statistical significance since no standard errors have been given.\n\nHmm, standard errors are important for determining significance because they help us understand the variability or uncertainty around the estimated coefficients. Without standard errors, it's tough to know how far off the estimates might be due to sampling variability.\n\nBut wait, in the context of autocorrelation, there are some standard rules of thumb to assess significance, especially for autocorrelation coefficients. For instance, in time series analysis, the autocorrelation function (ACF) plots often include confidence bands to determine if the coefficients are significantly different from zero.\n\nI recall that for large samples, the standard error of the autocorrelation coefficient at lag k is approximately 1/sqrt(n), where n is the sample size. Given that n=250 here, the standard error would be about 1/sqrt(250) \u2248 0.0632.\n\nSo, if we assume that the coefficients are normally distributed, we can use this standard error to calculate a z-score for each coefficient to test against the 5% significance level.\n\nFirst, let's confirm if this assumption holds. Since the sample size is 250, which is quite large, the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the distribution of the autocorrelation estimates should be approximately normal.\n\nNow, for a normal distribution, a coefficient is considered statistically significant at the 5% level if it is more than approximately 1.96 standard errors away from zero (since 1.96 corresponds to the 95% confidence level in a standard normal distribution).\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the margin of error for significance. With a standard error of about 0.0632, the critical value for significance would be \u00b11.96*0.0632 \u2248 \u00b10.123.\n\nSo, any autocorrelation coefficient whose absolute value is greater than approximately 0.123 would be considered statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\nNow, let's look at the coefficients:\n\n1. Lag 1: 0.2\n\n2. Lag 2: -0.15\n\n3. Lag 3: -0.1\n\nComparing these to the significance threshold:\n\n- Lag 1: 0.2 > 0.123 \u2192 significant\n\n- Lag 2: 0.15 < 0.123 \u2192 not significant\n\n- Lag 3: 0.1 < 0.123 \u2192 not significant\n\nTherefore, only the lag 1 coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\nWait a minute, but the options include combinations like 1 and 2, or all three. Based on this calculation, only lag 1 is significant, so option A seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should double-check the standard error calculation. The formula for the standard error of the autocorrelation coefficient is indeed 1/sqrt(n), where n is the sample size. So with n=250, SE \u2248 0.0632, which seems right.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use 1/sqrt(n-k) for the standard error of the autocorrelation at lag k, to adjust for the reduced effective sample size at higher lags. But in this case, since n is already 250, and lags are only up to 3, the difference would be negligible.\n\nLet me calculate the standard error more precisely. The formula is 1/sqrt(n), so for n=250, SE = 1/sqrt(250) \u2248 0.0632.\n\nThen, the 95% confidence interval for each coefficient is approximately \u00b11.96*0.0632 \u2248 \u00b10.123.\n\nSo, coefficients outside of -0.123 to 0.123 are significant.\n\nGiven that, lag 1 (0.2) is significant, but lags 2 (-0.15) and 3 (-0.1) are not.\n\nBut wait, -0.15 is less than -0.123, so lag 2 might actually be significant.\n\nLet me check that again.\n\nThe critical value is approximately \u00b10.123.\n\nSo, lag 1: 0.2 > 0.123 \u2192 significant\n\nLag 2: -0.15 < -0.123 \u2192 significant\n\nLag 3: -0.1 < 0.123, but -0.1 > -0.123 \u2192 not significant\n\nWait, -0.15 is less than -0.123, which means it's still outside the confidence interval, so it should be significant.\n\nHmm, maybe I miscalculated the critical value.\n\nLet me recalculate the standard error and the critical value.\n\nSE = 1/sqrt(250) \u2248 0.0632\n\nCritical value at 5% significance: \u00b11.96*SE \u2248 \u00b11.96*0.0632 \u2248 \u00b10.123\n\nSo, coefficients less than -0.123 or greater than 0.123 are significant.\n\nLag 1: 0.2 > 0.123 \u2192 significant\n\nLag 2: -0.15 < -0.123 \u2192 significant\n\nLag 3: -0.1 > -0.123 \u2192 not significant\n\nTherefore, lags 1 and 2 are significant, while lag 3 is not.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 1 and 2 only.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"assuming that the coefficients are approximately normally distributed\", and we've used that assumption to calculate the significance.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider?\n\nWell, in practice, when dealing with autocorrelation coefficients, we often use the Ljung-Box test or other portmanteau tests to check for overall significance of multiple lags, but the question specifically asks about individual coefficients.\n\nAlso, sometimes, the standard errors can be adjusted based on the sample autocovariances, but given the information provided, and the assumption of normality, the approach taken should be sufficient.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in small samples, the distribution of autocorrelation coefficients might not be exactly normal, but with n=250, it's a large enough sample for the normal approximation to hold.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes people use different rules of thumb, like considering a coefficient significant if its absolute value is greater than 2/\u221an, which for n=250 is approximately 0.1265, which is similar to what we calculated earlier.\n\nGiven all that, it seems that lags 1 and 2 are significant, while lag 3 is not, based on the 5% significance level.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 1 and 2 only.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might change this conclusion.\n\nFor example, perhaps the standard errors are different for different lags, especially in small samples, but again, with n=250, the standard error should be reasonably stable across lags.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a multiple testing correction needed since we're testing three coefficients, but the problem doesn't specify anything about that, and given the options, it's likely that we're to consider each coefficient individually at the 5% level.\n\nSo, after double-checking, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 1 and 2 only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
