                    "text": "So I have this math problem here: find 13 over 14 plus 7 over 14. Okay, let's see. I need to add these two fractions together. Both fractions have the same denominator, which is 14. That makes it a bit easier because I don't have to worry about finding a common denominator.\n\nSo, the fractions are 13/14 and 7/14. To add fractions with the same denominator, I just add the numerators and keep the denominator the same. So, 13 plus 7 is 20, and the denominator stays 14. That gives me 20/14.\n\nNow, 20/14 seems like it can be simplified. Let's check if 20 and 14 have any common factors. Both are divisible by 2. So, dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 gives me 10/7.\n\nWait a minute, is 10/7 the final answer? Or should I convert it to a mixed number? Well, 10 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 3, so 10/7 is equal to 1 and 3/7.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1 and 4 over 7\n\nB. 1 and 3 over 7\n\nC. 1 and 5 over 14\n\nD. 20 over 28\n\nMy answer is 1 and 3/7, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again:\n\nAdd 13/14 and 7/14. Since the denominators are the same, add the numerators: 13 + 7 = 20, so 20/14.\n\nSimplify 20/14 by dividing both by 2: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10, 14 \u00f7 2 = 7, so 10/7.\n\nConvert 10/7 to a mixed number: 10 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 3, so 1 and 3/7.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert both fractions to have a common denominator of 28, but since they already have the same denominator, that's not necessary.\n\nWait, option D is 20 over 28. Well, 20/28 is equivalent to 20/14 because both numerator and denominator are multiplied by 2. But that's not the simplest form.\n\nSo, 20/28 simplifies to 20 \u00f7 4 over 28 \u00f7 4, which is 5/7. But earlier, I had 20/14 simplifying to 10/7, which is different from 5/7. So, option D can't be correct.\n\nOption A is 1 and 4/7. That would be 11/7, because 7/7 is one, and 4/7 added to it makes 11/7.\n\nOption B is 1 and 3/7, which is 10/7.\n\nOption C is 1 and 5/14, which is 19/14.\n\nOption D is 20/28, which simplifies to 5/7.\n\nSo, according to my calculations, option B matches my answer of 10/7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if the answer should be in improper fraction or mixed number form. The question doesn't specify, so either could be acceptable, but often, mixed numbers are preferred for final answers.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see if 13/14 + 7/14 equals 20/14, and then check if 20/14 is indeed 1 and 3/7.\n\nLet me try adding them differently. Maybe break it down further.\n\n13/14 can be written as 9/14 + 4/14, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, 14/14 is 1, so 13/14 is 1 - 1/14.\n\nSimilarly, 7/14 is 1/2.\n\nSo, 1 - 1/14 + 1/2.\n\nFirst, add 1 - 1/14: that's 13/14.\n\nThen add 1/2: convert 1/2 to 7/14 (since 1/2 = 7/14).\n\nSo, 13/14 + 7/14 = 20/14 = 10/7 = 1 and 3/7.\n\nYes, this matches my initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using decimals, but that might be more complicated.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the options again.\n\nOption A: 1 and 4/7, which is 11/7.\n\nOption B: 1 and 3/7, which is 10/7.\n\nOption C: 1 and 5/14, which is 19/14.\n\nOption D: 20/28, which is 5/7.\n\nSo, among these, option B is 10/7, which matches my answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here, but I don't think so. It seems straightforward.\n\nIn conclusion, 13/14 + 7/14 equals 20/14, which simplifies to 10/7, or 1 and 3/7, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
