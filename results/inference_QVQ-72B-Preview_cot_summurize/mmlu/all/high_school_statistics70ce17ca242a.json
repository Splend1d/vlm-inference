                    "text": "So I have this problem here about random variables X and Y. I'm given that X has a mean of 32 and a standard deviation of 5, and Y has a mean of 44 and a standard deviation of 12. Also, X and Y are independent. I need to find the mean and standard deviation of the random variable X + Y.\n\nFirst, I remember that for independent random variables, the mean of the sum is just the sum of the means. So, \u03bcx+y = \u03bcx + \u03bcy. Plugging in the values, that's 32 + 44, which is 76. So, the mean of X + Y is 76.\n\nNow, for the standard deviation of X + Y, I think I need to use the formula for the variance of the sum of independent random variables. The variance of X + Y is \u03c3x^2 + \u03c3y^2. Wait, but I need to be careful here. Is there a formula that directly gives me the variance of the sum of two independent random variables?\n\nLet me recall: for independent random variables X and Y, the variance of their sum is indeed \u03c3x^2 + \u03c3y^2. So, \u03c3x = 5, so \u03c3x^2 = 25, and \u03c3y = 12, so \u03c3y^2 = 144. Therefore, the variance of X + Y is 25 + 144, which is 169.\n\nNow, to find the standard deviation, I need to take the square root of the variance. So, \u03c3x+y = \u221a169, which is 13.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \u03bcx+y = 76, \u03c3x+y = 8.5\n\nB. \u03bcx+y = 76, \u03c3x+y = 13\n\nC. \u03bcx+y = 76, \u03c3x+y = 17\n\nD. \u03bcx+y = 38, \u03c3x+y = 17\n\nSo, based on my calculations, B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's a different way to approach this, or maybe I missed something.\n\nI know that for independent random variables, the mean of the sum is the sum of the means, which I did correctly. For the variance, since they're independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the individual variances, which I also did correctly.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think that the standard deviation of the sum is just the sum of the standard deviations, but that's not correct. It's important to work with variances because standard deviations don't add directly.\n\nLet me verify the calculations again. Variance of X is 5^2 = 25, variance of Y is 12^2 = 144. Sum of variances is 25 + 144 = 169. Square root of 169 is indeed 13. So, \u03c3x+y = 13.\n\nAlso, confirming the mean: \u03bcx + \u03bcy = 32 + 44 = 76.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. \u03bcx+y = 76, \u03c3x+y = 13.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other information needed or if there's a trick here that I'm missing. The problem states that X and Y are independent, which is crucial for the variance addition. If they weren't independent, I'd need to consider the covariance, but since they're independent, covariance is zero, and my approach holds.\n\nAdditionally, all options have \u03bcx+y = 76, except for option D, which has \u03bcx+y = 38. That seems like a typo or perhaps a distractor, but based on my calculations, it should be 76.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
