                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out who has the rightful title to Greyacre, this one-acre piece of property. Let's see, Alice originally owned it in fee simple, which means she had complete ownership with no time limits or conditions attached. Then she sold it to Barbara, who moved in but didn't record the deed. Later, Alice sold the same property to Charlene, who did record her deed right away. The jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a race-notice statute is. From what I recall, a race-notice statute determines who has priority in property ownership based on two main things: whether a subsequent purchaser is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of prior unrecorded interests, and the timing of recording deeds.\n\nSo, in a race-notice jurisdiction, the first to record their deed generally has priority, provided they were without notice of any prior unrecorded interests at the time of purchase.\n\nLet me map this to the scenario:\n\n1. Alice sells to Barbara, who doesn't record her deed.\n\n2. Alice then sells to Charlene, who records her deed immediately.\n\nNow, since Barbara didn't record her deed, and Charlene recorded hers first, Charlene would seem to have priority under the race-notice statute, assuming she didn't have notice of Barbara's interest.\n\nWait a minute, but Alice sold the property to Barbara first, and then to Charlene. Does Charlene have notice of Barbara's interest?\n\nThe question mentions that the jurisdiction has a tract index system, which is a type of recording system where deeds are indexed by the property's description, making it easier to search for records related to a specific piece of land.\n\nIn such a system, a subsequent purchaser can search the records based on the property's legal description to find out about any prior claims or liens.\n\nBut in this case, since Barbara didn't record her deed, her interest isn't in the public record. So, Charlene, when she searched the records, wouldn't have found any prior deeds or claims on the property, assuming Alice hadn't sold it to anyone else before.\n\nTherefore, Charlene is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any prior unrecorded interests, and she recorded her deed first.\n\nSo, according to the race-notice statute, Charlene should have priority.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any way Barbara could still have a claim.\n\nBarbara didn't record her deed, but she moved into the residence. Maybe there's some argument about actual notice based on possession.\n\nIf Charlene had actual knowledge that Barbara was in possession as owner, that might give her constructive notice of Barbara's interest.\n\nHowever, the problem states that Charlene filed the deed immediately, and presumably, if Charlene recorded her deed first, she must not have known about Barbara's interest.\n\nUnless Barbara was visibly in possession in a way that would put a reasonable person on notice, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the jurisdiction has a race-notice statute, which typically protects bona fide purchasers who record first and are without notice of prior unrecorded interests.\n\nSo, unless there's something about actual possession that trumps the recording, which I don't think is the case in a race-notice jurisdiction, Charlene should prevail.\n\nWait, maybe there's something about \"race-notice\" and \"notice\" that I need to clarify.\n\nIn a race-notice jurisdiction, to have priority, a subsequent purchaser must be the first to record their deed and must not have had notice of any prior unrecorded interests at the time of purchase.\n\nCharlene recorded first and, assuming she didn't have notice of Barbara's interest, she should have priority.\n\nBarbara, on the other hand, didn't record, so even if she was the first to purchase, her interest isn't protected under the statute.\n\nBut let's think about the \"notice\" part again.\n\nWhat constitutes \"notice\" in this context?\n\nThere's actual notice, which is direct knowledge of a prior interest, and constructive notice, which is imputed from the recording of a deed.\n\nSince Barbara didn't record her deed, there's no constructive notice to Charlene.\n\nBut what if Charlene had actual knowledge of Barbara's interest?\n\nIf Charlene knew or should have known about Barbara's prior purchase, even if unrecorded, that might affect her status as a bona fide purchaser without notice.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide any information suggesting that Charlene was aware of Barbara's purchase.\n\nSo, based on the information given, Charlene appears to be a bona fide purchaser without notice who recorded first, giving her priority under the race-notice statute.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nMaybe there's something about adverse possession or some equitable doctrine that could favor Barbara.\n\nBut the problem states that Alice owned the property in fee simple, sold it to Barbara, who moved in, and then Alice sold it again to Charlene.\n\nThere's no mention of any adverse possession period having passed, and since the time frame is three years, which might not be sufficient for adverse possession, depending on local laws.\n\nMoreover, equitable doctrines often require consideration of all the facts, but based on the information provided, Charlene seems to have acted in good faith and recorded her deed promptly.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.\n\nWell, Alice did own the property first, but she sold it twice, and once Charlene recorded her deed, Alice's ownership should be superseded.\n\nOption B says Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.\n\nBut according to the information, Charlene didn't have notice because Barbara didn't record her deed.\n\nOption C says Barbara, because she was the first to record her deed.\n\nBut Barbara didn't record her deed; Charlene did.\n\nSo, that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
