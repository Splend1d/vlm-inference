                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this scenario about an auditor selecting purchase orders for testing. The auditor is using a method where they match random numbers to purchase order numbers to decide which ones to inspect. Now, sometimes a random number might match a voided purchase order. The question is about what the auditor should do in that case, especially if the voided purchase order falls into certain categories.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what a voided purchase order is. A purchase order is a document that a company sends to a vendor to order goods or services. It's prenumbered for tracking purposes. If a purchase order is voided, that probably means it was canceled or not used for some reason. But not all voided purchase orders are the same. The options given suggest different reasons why a purchase order might be voided.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Represents office equipment ordered and never received.\n\nIf a purchase order was for office equipment that was ordered but never received, that sounds like a problem. Maybe the vendor didn't send the goods, or there was an issue with the order. In this case, the purchase order hasn't been fulfilled, and it might be important for the auditor to investigate why the equipment was ordered but never received. But the question is about replacing the voided purchase order with another one for testing purposes.\n\nB. Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.\n\nThis seems a bit vague. What does it mean to be \"properly voided in the normal course of business\"? Maybe it's a standard procedure when certain conditions are met, like if the order is canceled before it's sent to the vendor or if there's a change in requirements. If it's properly voided, perhaps it's handled correctly and doesn't need further investigation.\n\nC. Represents office equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor.\n\nThis is similar to option B. It's about ordering something and then canceling it before the vendor takes any action. This could happen if the company decides they don't need the item anymore or if they find a better deal elsewhere. If it's canceled before the vendor processes it, maybe there are no ramifications, and it's just a standard part of business operations.\n\nD. Has been electronically deleted from the purchase order file.\n\nThis one is interesting. If a purchase order is voided and then deleted electronically, it might raise questions about record retention and compliance. Auditors generally like to see that all purchase orders, even voided ones, are properly documented and retained for audit trails.\n\nNow, the question is asking what the auditor would ordinarily do if a random number matches a voided purchase order, specifically if it falls into one of these categories. The auditor needs to decide whether to replace that voided purchase order with another one in the sample or not.\n\nI think the key here is understanding whether the voided purchase order is still relevant to the internal control activities being tested. The auditor is testing the proper approval of purchase orders before office equipment is ordered. So, they are interested in purchase orders that were actually issued for ordering equipment.\n\nIf a purchase order was voided because it was never intended to be used (e.g., canceled before being processed by the vendor), then it might not be relevant for testing the approval process, as it never reached the stage of actually ordering equipment.\n\nOn the other hand, if a purchase order was voided after being issued but before the equipment was received, it might still be relevant to test the approval process, as it was issued and could have been processed.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that in certain cases, the auditor would replace the voided purchase order with another one. So, perhaps in those cases where the voided purchase order isn't relevant to the test, it should be replaced.\n\nLet me think about each option again in relation to replacement:\n\nA. If the purchase order represents office equipment ordered and never received, it might still be relevant to test the approval process, as it was ordered. The fact that it was never received could be a separate issue, perhaps related to follow-up on orders or payment controls.\n\nB. If it's been properly voided in the normal course of business, maybe it's not necessary to test it, as the voiding was part of standard procedures. Therefore, it could be replaced with another purchase order that was actually used to order equipment.\n\nC. If it represents equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor, it's similar to B. It was voided before any action was taken by the vendor, so it might not be relevant for testing the approval process, as no actual order was placed.\n\nD. If it's been electronically deleted from the purchase order file, this could be a red flag. Auditors might want to investigate why it was deleted, as it could indicate an attempt to hide something. In this case, they might not replace it immediately but rather look into it further.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the answer is B. Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.\n\nBecause in that case, the voiding is part of standard procedures, and the purchase order didn't proceed to the ordering stage. Therefore, it's not relevant for testing the approval process before ordering equipment, so it can be replaced with another purchase order that was used to order equipment.\n\nOption A might still be relevant because the equipment was ordered, even if it was never received. Option C is similar to B but specifies cancellation before vendor processing, which might make it less relevant for the approval testing. Option D could be a special case that requires investigation rather than replacement.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is B. Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
