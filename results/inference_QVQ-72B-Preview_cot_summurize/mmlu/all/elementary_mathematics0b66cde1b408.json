                    "text": "Let's tackle this expression step by step. It looks a bit tricky at first glance, but if I break it down, I can manage it. The expression is:\n\n2(3(4^2 + 1)) - 2^3\n\nFirst off, I need to remember the order of operations. I think it's PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n4^2 + 1\n\n4 squared is 16, and adding 1 gives me 17.\n\nSo, 3(17)\n\nThen, 3 multiplied by 17 is 51.\n\nNext, 2(51)\n\n2 multiplied by 51 is 102.\n\nNow, subtract 2^3\n\n2 cubed is 8.\n\nSo, 102 - 8 equals 94.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 156\n\nB. 110\n\nC. 94\n\nD. 48\n\n94 is one of the options, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nExpression: 2(3(4^2 + 1)) - 2^3\n\nFirst, calculate 4^2 + 1:\n\n16 + 1 = 17\n\nThen, 3(17) = 51\n\nNext, 2(51) = 102\n\nFinally, 2^3 = 8\n\nSo, 102 - 8 = 94\n\nThat seems correct. But maybe I should consider if there are any other ways to interpret the expression. Is there any ambiguity in the parentheses?\n\nLooking closely, the expression is clearly nested parentheses: first calculate 4^2 + 1, then multiply by 3, then multiply by 2, and finally subtract 2^3. I don't see another way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach, like distributing somewhere, but I don't think it's necessary here.\n\nLet me consider the units digit to cross-verify. The units digit of 4^2 is 6 (since 4*4=16), add 1 to get 7, multiply by 3 to get 21, multiply by 2 to get 42, and subtract 8 to get 34. Hmm, that's not matching my previous answer of 94. There must be something wrong with this approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the expression inside the parentheses is being multiplied correctly step by step.\n\nLet me try evaluating it again, more carefully.\n\n4^2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17\n\n3(17) = 51\n\n2(51) = 102\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n102 - 8 = 94\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Maybe the units digit approach isn't helpful here, or I'm misapplying it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire expression as a single term and compute it directly.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the associative property of multiplication. Since multiplication is associative, 2*(3*(4^2 + 1)) is the same as (2*3)*((4^2 + 1)).\n\nFirst, compute 4^2 + 1 = 17\n\nThen, 2*3 = 6\n\nThen, 6*17 = 102\n\nFinally, subtract 2^3 = 8\n\nSo, 102 - 8 = 94\n\nThis matches my previous calculation. Maybe the answer is indeed 94, which is option C.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the expression.\n\nIs there a possibility of miscounting the exponents or the operations?\n\nFor example, could 4^2 + 1 be interpreted as (4^2) + 1 or as 4^(2+1)? No, because the standard order of operations dictates that exponents are evaluated before addition.\n\nSimilarly, 2(3(4^2 + 1)) could be seen as 2 multiplied by the entire expression inside, but given the parentheses, it's clear that it's 2 multiplied by 3*(4^2 + 1).\n\nAlso, 2^3 is straightforward\u20142 cubed is 8.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 94.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's plug in the values step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute 4^2 + 1\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n16 + 1 = 17\n\nStep 2: Multiply by 3\n\n3 * 17 = 51\n\nStep 3: Multiply by 2\n\n2 * 51 = 102\n\nStep 4: Subtract 2^3\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n102 - 8 = 94\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 94, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{94} \\]"
