                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which estimation techniques are suitable for over-identified systems of simultaneous equations. The options are OLS, ILS, 2SLS, and IV. I need to pick the correct ones from these choices.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an over-identified system is. In econometrics, a system of equations is considered over-identified if there are more instruments (or more equations in some cases) than there are endogenous variables. This means that there are more restrictions than necessary to identify the parameters of the model.\n\nNow, let's recall what each of these estimation techniques is used for:\n\n1. **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: This is a standard method for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model. It minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. However, OLS is not appropriate for simultaneous equation models because it doesn't account for the endogeneity caused by the simultaneous relationships between variables.\n\n2. **Iterative Least Squares (ILS)**: I think this might be a typo or misremembering of \"Indirect Least Squares.\" Indirect Least Squares (ILS) is a method used to estimate structural equations in a system of equations. It involves estimating each equation separately by transforming the structural equations into reduced-form equations and then estimating them using OLS. However, ILS is not suitable for over-identified systems because it requires exactly identified equations.\n\n3. **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)**: This is a common estimation technique for simultaneous equation models. It's particularly useful when the system is over-identified because it uses instrumental variables to account for the endogeneity. In the first stage, it estimates the endogenous variables using instruments. In the second stage, it uses these predicted values in the structural equation. So, this seems like a good candidate for over-identified systems.\n\n4. **Instrumental Variables (IV)**: This is a general approach that includes 2SLS as a special case. IV estimation requires instruments that are correlated with the endogenous explanatory variables but uncorrelated with the error term. In the context of over-identified systems, where there are more instruments than endogenous variables, IV estimation can be used, but it's important to test the validity of the additional instruments.\n\nGiven this background, OLS is not appropriate for simultaneous equation models, and ILS is suitable only for exactly identified equations. Therefore, for over-identified systems, 2SLS and IV seem to be the relevant techniques.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this more carefully. Is 2SLS the only option, or can IV estimation be used as well?\n\nI recall that 2SLS is a specific type of IV estimation where the instruments are used in a two-stage process. In over-identified systems, IV estimation can be performed using generalized methods of moments (GMM), which allow for more instruments than endogenous variables by minimizing a weighted distance between the sample and theoretical moments.\n\nSo, in practice, 2SLS is a special case of IV estimation where the number of instruments equals the number of endogenous variables. But in over-identified systems, where there are more instruments, IV estimation can still be applied, but it's often referred to as limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) or more commonly in this context, as GMM estimation.\n\nTherefore, IV estimation can handle over-identified systems, although 2SLS, being a special case, is typically used when the system is just identified.\n\nGiven that, it seems that both 2SLS and IV are applicable to over-identified systems, but 2SLS is specifically designed for just-identified systems, whereas IV can handle both just-identified and over-identified systems.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to clarify: 2SLS can be used in over-identified systems, but it's more commonly associated with just-identified systems. In over-identified systems, while 2SLS can still be applied, it's not the most efficient estimator, and other methods like GMM might be preferred.\n\nHowever, in the options provided, 2SLS is listed separately from IV, and the question is to choose from the given techniques.\n\nSo, considering the options:\n\n- OLS: No, not suitable for simultaneous equations.\n\n- ILS: No, only for exactly identified equations.\n\n- 2SLS: Yes, can be used in over-identified systems, though it's more efficient in just-identified cases.\n\n- IV: Yes, can handle over-identified systems using methods like GMM.\n\nTherefore, the correct choices are (iii) 2SLS and (iv) IV.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"over-identified systems of simultaneous equations.\" So, it's not just one equation but a system of equations.\n\nIn that case, I need to consider estimation methods that can handle systems, not just single equations.\n\nI recall that in systems of equations, we have structural equations that represent the relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables, and there might be multiple equations to be estimated simultaneously.\n\nIn such cases, methods like Three-Stage Least Squares (3SLS) or Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) are used to estimate the entire system jointly, taking into account the correlations between the error terms across equations.\n\nHowever, 3SLS is an extension of 2SLS to systems of equations, and FIML is another approach that uses all available information in the system.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 3SLS isn't listed, so perhaps the expectation is to choose from the given techniques.\n\nGiven that, and considering that 2SLS and IV can be applied to single equations, but the system might require estimating multiple equations simultaneously, perhaps the answer isn't as straightforward as I initially thought.\n\nLet me consider that in over-identified systems of simultaneous equations, we might need to estimate multiple equations, and some of these techniques are designed for single equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to estimating individual equations within the system, assuming that each equation is over-identified.\n\nIn that case, for each equation, we could use 2SLS or IV estimation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are system-wide estimation methods that can handle over-identification across the entire system.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully.\n\nLet me look up some references to confirm.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that in econometrics, when dealing with systems of simultaneous equations that are over-identified, estimation techniques like Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML), Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML), and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) are commonly used.\n\nHowever, in the given options, only 2SLS and IV are listed, and LIML, FIML, and GMM aren't options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is (iii) and (iv), meaning 2SLS and IV.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because the question specifies \"systems\" of equations, not individual equations.\n\nLet me consider that in systems of equations, 2SLS can be applied equation by equation, which is called equation-by-equation estimation, but this might not be efficient if there are correlations across equation errors.\n\nOn the other hand, IV estimation can also be applied to individual equations, but again, for systems, it might be better to use methods that consider the entire system.\n\nPerhaps the question is expecting that for over-identified systems of equations, 2SLS and IV are applicable on a per-equation basis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only IV is applicable, since 2SLS is more commonly associated with single equations.\n\nWait, but 2SLS can be extended to systems using 3SLS, but again, 3SLS isn't an option here.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I think the answer is (iii) and (iv), meaning 2SLS and IV.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. (iii) and (iv) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
