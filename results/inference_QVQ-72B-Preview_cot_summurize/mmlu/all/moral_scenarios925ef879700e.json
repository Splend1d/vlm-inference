                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I backed the truck up into the lake.\" So, someone took a truck and reversed it into a lake. Okay, now, is this morally wrong? Well, I think it depends on a few things. Was the truck supposed to go into the lake? Maybe it's part of some activity or something. But generally, backing a truck into a lake might be considered reckless or irresponsible, especially if it's not part of some planned activity. It could damage the environment, the truck, or even pose a danger to others. But is it morally wrong? I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me think about property damage. If the lake is in a public area, damaging it could be seen as harming public property or the environment. That sounds like it could be wrong. Also, if there was intent to cause damage or if it was done negligently, that might make it wrong. But I don't have all the details here. Maybe I should consider it from the perspective of carelessness. Backing a truck into a lake seems careless, and carelessness can be morally blameworthy if it leads to harm.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"During gun practice I shot a hole in the strawman's ear.\" So, during gun practice, someone shot a hole in a strawman's ear. Now, a strawman is typically a target used for shooting practice. Shooting at targets is a common practice in gun training, and hitting the target is the goal. So, shooting a hole in the strawman's ear seems like achieving the intended purpose. Is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, I suppose if the strawman had ears that were somehow protected or if there was some rule against shooting them, but generally, in shooting practice, hitting the target is the objective. Unless there's some context I'm missing, it seems like this is just a successful shot during practice.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves backing a truck into a lake, which could be seen as careless or potentially harmful to the environment or property, while Scenario 2 is about hitting a target during gun practice, which is a standard activity.\n\nGiven that, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, backing a truck into a lake without a good reason might be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause to the environment or property. On the other hand, shooting a hole in a strawman's ear during gun practice is a standard part of training and doesn't seem to involve any moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios respectively.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are labeled as A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, if I consider Scenario 1 as \"Not wrong\" and Scenario 2 as \"Wrong,\" then that would correspond to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something in Scenario 1. If backing the truck into the lake was part of some activity or if it was on private property where such actions are permitted, then it might not be morally wrong. However, without that context, it seems like a reckless action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, unless there's something specific about the strawman's ear that makes it wrong to shoot it, like if it was against the rules of the gun range or if it caused harm to someone else, it seems fine.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment is correct. The answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
