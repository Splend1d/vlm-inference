Hmm, I think I remember that the largest city in New Mexico is Albuquerque, but I'm not entirely sure about the spelling. Let me see.\n\nFirst off, I know that New Mexico is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It's known for its diverse cuisine, rich history, and beautiful landscapes like the desert and mountains. But back to the question at hand: what's the correct spelling of its largest city?\n\nLet me recall: I think the city starts with \"Albuquerque.\" Wait, but option A has \"Albuqerque,\" which seems off because I think there's a double \"r\" in there, but I'm not sure. Option B is \"Albuquerque,\" which looks more familiar. Option C is \"Albequerque,\" which seems incorrect because I think there's a \"qu\" in there somewhere. And then there's option D, \"Santa Fe,\" which I know is the capital of New Mexico, but I don't think it's the largest city.\n\nI should probably eliminate some options based on what I know. Since Santa Fe is the capital but not the largest city, I can likely eliminate option D. That leaves me with options A, B, and C.\n\nNow, focusing on the spelling of \"Albuquerque.\" Let me try to break it down. I know that \"Al-\" might be a prefix, and \"buquerque\" seems to have some French influence, maybe? I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the etymology of the name.\n\nUpon a quick recall, I think \"Albuquerque\" is derived from a Spanish name, Don Francisco Cuervo y Vald\u00e9s, 1st Duke of Alburquerque. Wait, but I'm getting confused between Albuquerque and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Actually, I think the city was named after the Duke of Albuquerque, a Spanish nobleman and colonial governor.\n\nSo, if that's the case, maybe the spelling is \"Albuquerque.\" Looking back at the options, B is \"Albuquerque,\" while A is \"Albuqerque\" and C is \"Albequerque.\" The double \"r\" in option A seems misplaced, and option C has an \"e\" instead of a \"qu,\" which doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me consider the pronunciation. I think it's pronounced \"Albuquerque,\" with the \"qu\" sound. So, that would make option B the correct one.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should think about the population sizes of these cities. If I recall correctly, Albuquerque has a larger population than Santa Fe, which is the capital. So, that aligns with my thought that Santa Fe is the capital but not the largest city.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to think about major cities in New Mexico. Albuquerque is known for being a significant urban center in the state, famous for events like the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. In contrast, Santa Fe is smaller and more known for its cultural significance and history.\n\nGiven all this, I'm fairly confident that \"Albuquerque\" is the correct spelling for New Mexico's largest city. So, option B is the right answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I can mentally spell it out: A-l-b-u-q-u-e-r-q-u-e. Yes, that seems correct. Option A has an extra \"r\" in the middle, making it \"Albuqerque,\" which isn't right. Option C has \"Albequerque,\" which doesn't match the standard spelling. And option D, \"Santa Fe,\" is the capital but not the largest city.\n\nTherefore, the correct spelling of New Mexico's largest city is \"Albuquerque,\" which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
