                    "text": "So I have this question here about research methods in psychology or developmental science, I think. The scenario is that a researcher is studying problem-solving skills in different age groups: 10-year-olds, 20-year-olds, and 30-year-olds. There are twenty participants in each age group. And the question is asking what research method this researcher is using. The options are longitudinal, stage, developmental, and cross-sectional.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of research methods.\n\nStarting with longitudinal studies: I believe these are studies where the same group of participants is observed or tested over an extended period of time. So, for example, if a researcher wanted to see how problem-solving skills change from age 10 to 30, they might select a group of 10-year-olds and then test them again when they turn 20 and 30. That would be a longitudinal study.\n\nNext, stage studies: I'm not as familiar with this term in research methods. Maybe it refers to studies that look at different developmental stages, but I'm not sure. I might need to look into this more.\n\nDevelopmental studies: This seems broad. It probably refers to any research that looks at development over time, which could include both longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches. So, it's not a specific method but rather a general approach to studying development.\n\nCross-sectional studies: These are studies where different groups of people of different ages are compared at the same point in time. So, for example, you might test a group of 10-year-olds, a group of 20-year-olds, and a group of 30-year-olds all in the same year and compare their problem-solving skills.\n\nGiven this, the scenario described seems like a cross-sectional study because the researcher is testing different groups of participants, each representing a different age group, at the same time.\n\nBut let me double-check. In the scenario, there are twenty 10-year-old participants, twenty 20-year-old participants, and twenty 30-year-old participants. So, that's three separate groups, each consisting of people of the same age. If the researcher is testing all of these groups at the same time, that fits the definition of a cross-sectional study.\n\nA longitudinal study would involve following the same participants over time, measuring their problem-solving skills at multiple points as they age. For example, starting when they're 10, then again at 20, and again at 30. But in this scenario, it's not mentioned that the same participants are being followed over time. It just says that there are twenty 10-year-olds, twenty 20-year-olds, and twenty 30-year-olds being tested. So, it's likely that these are different participants in each age group, which again points towards a cross-sectional design.\n\nAs for \"stage\" studies, I'm still not sure about that one. Maybe it's a mistranslation or a typo. I don't recall \"stage\" being a standard term for a research method in this context.\n\n\"Developmental\" studies are more about the general field of studying development, which could include various research methods, not a specific method itself.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the correct answer is D. cross-sectional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
