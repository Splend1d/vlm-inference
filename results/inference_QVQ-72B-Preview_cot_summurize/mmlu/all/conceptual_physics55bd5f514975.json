                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about traveling at a speed close to the speed of light. It's asking what I might notice about myself in such a scenario: does my mass change, does my pulse decrease, or both, or neither? Hmm, this seems like it's related to Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically special relativity, since we're talking about high speeds.\n\nFirst off, I know that according to special relativity, when an object moves at speeds close to the speed of light, some weird things happen from the perspective of an observer who's stationary relative to the object. Things like time dilation and length contraction come into play. But in this case, it's about my own observations of myself, not from someone else's perspective.\n\nLet me think about mass first. I recall that in special relativity, there's this concept of relativistic mass, which increases as an object's velocity increases. The formula is m = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. So, if I'm moving at a speed close to c, my mass would increase significantly from the perspective of someone who's stationary relative to me. But the question is about what I would notice about myself.\n\nWait a minute, if I'm the one moving at that speed, would I notice any change in my own mass? From my own perspective, would I feel heavier or anything like that? I'm not so sure. Maybe not, because everything in my reference frame would be moving with me, including my internal processes and the forces I'm used to. So, perhaps from my point of view, my mass remains the same.\n\nBut let me consider another angle. There's also the concept of invariant mass or rest mass, which doesn't change with velocity. Maybe that's what really matters for how I perceive myself. If that's the case, then even at speeds close to light, my rest mass stays the same, and I wouldn't notice any change in my mass.\n\nOkay, so for mass, I'm leaning towards \"neither,\" meaning I wouldn't notice any change in my mass.\n\nNow, about my pulse. Pulse rate is the number of heartbeats per minute, right? So, if time dilation occurs when moving at high speeds, does that affect my pulse rate from my own perspective?\n\nI know that time dilation means that time passes slower for me compared to someone who's stationary relative to me when I'm moving at high speeds. So, from their perspective, my heart might be beating slower, but from my own perspective, does my pulse feel normal?\n\nI think so, because in my own reference frame, time is passing normally for me. My heart is beating at its usual rate according to my own perception of time. So, even though time is dilated from the perspective of someone else, from my point of view, everything seems normal, including my pulse.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Could there be any direct effect on my biological processes due to the speed itself? Probably not, because it's not like speed has a direct impact on biological functions beyond the effects of time dilation, which, as I said, are observed from an external frame.\n\nSo, again, from my own perspective, I wouldn't notice any change in my pulse rate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Neither of these.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI remember that in relativity, lengths contract in the direction of motion, but again, from my own perspective, I wouldn't notice any contraction because everything, including me, is contracting uniformly.\n\nSimilarly, for mass and pulse, it seems consistent that from my own point of view, nothing changes.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. Neither of these.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
