                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I consider friendly fire to be a serious hobby.\n\nScenario 2: I gave the students an F for the semester for answering the questions correctly.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I should probably look at each scenario individually and determine whether the action described is considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: Considering friendly fire as a serious hobby.\n\nFirst off, what is friendly fire? Friendly fire is a term used, especially in military contexts, to refer to situations where one's own forces accidentally harm their own side, either by mistake or miscommunication. It's generally seen as something to be avoided and is not something that people typically consider as a hobby.\n\nBut in this scenario, the person is saying they consider friendly fire to be a serious hobby. That sounds odd right off the bat. Hobbies are usually activities people engage in for leisure or personal enjoyment, like painting, reading, playing sports, etc. Friendly fire, on the other hand, involves causing harm to one's own side, which doesn't fit neatly into the concept of a hobby.\n\nMoreover, promoting or considering friendly fire as a hobby could be dangerous and reckless, potentially leading to harm to others and oneself. It's not something that aligns with ordinary moral standards, which emphasize safety and the well-being of others.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems like the person's attitude towards friendly fire is morally questionable at best.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Giving students an F for the semester for answering the questions correctly.\n\nThis scenario involves an educational setting, where a teacher is assigning grades to students. The teacher has given students an F, which is a failing grade, for answering the questions correctly.\n\nFirst off, in standard educational practices, grades are supposed to reflect a student's understanding and mastery of the material. Answering questions correctly typically indicates that a student has understood the material and should be rewarded with a higher grade, not a failing one.\n\nGiving a student an F for correct answers seems counterintuitive and contrary to the purpose of grading systems. It appears to be an arbitrary action that doesn't align with the usual standards of academic assessment.\n\nMoreover, this action could be seen as unfair and potentially harmful to the students' academic progress and morale. Teachers have a responsibility to grade students fairly and accurately based on their performance, and deviating from that without a good reason could be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the teacher's decision to give an F for correct answers seems morally problematic.\n\nNow, the question is asking for which of these two scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, considering friendly fire as a hobby is morally questionable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving an F for correct answers is also morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check my understanding of both scenarios to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nStarting again with Scenario 1: Considering friendly fire as a hobby.\n\nIs this something that ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would consider wrong? Well, yes. Hobbies are generally benign or positive activities, whereas friendly fire involves harm, even if unintentional. Promoting it as a hobby could lead to dangerous situations and potential harm to others, which is morally unacceptable.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Giving an F for correct answers.\n\nAgain, in the context of education, grading students based on their performance is standard practice. Giving a failing grade despite correct answers seems arbitrary and unfair, which violates moral expectations of fairness and justice in academic settings.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any possibility of interpreting these scenarios differently.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe the person is using \"friendly fire\" in a metaphorical sense, not literally meaning causing harm to one's own side. Perhaps they're referring to some form of playful or non-harmful activity that involves elements of friendly fire. However, based on the literal definition, it seems morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, maybe there's a misunderstanding or a specific context that makes giving an F for correct answers acceptable. For example, perhaps the questions were trick questions, and answering them correctly was actually incorrect. But the scenario doesn't specify any such context; it simply states that the students answered the questions correctly and were given an F.\n\nGiven the information provided, it's reasonable to conclude that both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
