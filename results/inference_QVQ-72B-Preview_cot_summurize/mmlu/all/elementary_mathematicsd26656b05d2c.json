                    "text": "So I've got this math problem here: 8 + 8 \u00f7 2 + 2. And there are four options to choose from: A. 4, B. 8, C. 10, D. 14. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when solving equations with multiple operations, there's a specific order to follow. It's called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right). So, I should follow that order to get the right answer.\n\nLooking at the equation: 8 + 8 \u00f7 2 + 2. There are no parentheses or exponents here, so I should start with division.\n\nSo, 8 \u00f7 2 is 4. Now, the equation becomes: 8 + 4 + 2.\n\nNext, I just need to add these numbers together: 8 plus 4 is 12, and 12 plus 2 is 14.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Maybe I should double-check if there are any other operations hidden here. Let me look again: 8 + 8 \u00f7 2 + 2. No, just addition and division, no multiplication or anything else.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, 8 \u00f7 2 is 4.\n\nThen, add that to 8: 8 + 4 = 12.\n\nFinally, add 2: 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me think about if there's any trick here. Sometimes these kinds of problems can be tricky with the order of operations.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the whole expression as it is and see if there's any other way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the terms to make it clearer.\n\nLet me try grouping differently, but I have to be careful not to change the order of operations.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 8 + (8 \u00f7 2) + 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. First, compute 8 \u00f7 2, which is 4, and then add 8 + 4 + 2.\n\nAgain, that gives me 14.\n\nWait, but is there any chance that the division could be interpreted differently? Like, could it be 8 + 8 first, then divide by 2, and then add 2?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense according to PEMDAS. Division comes before addition, so I have to do the division first, then add the other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think to do 8 + 8 first, which is 16, then divide by 2, which is 8, and then add 2, which would be 10.\n\nBut that's not correct because according to the order of operations, division should be done before addition.\n\nSo, if I follow the correct order, it's 8 + (8 \u00f7 2) + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14.\n\nI think 14 is the right answer.\n\nBut let me check the options again: A. 4, B. 8, C. 10, D. 14.\n\nSo, D. 14 seems to be the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to look at it. Perhaps using fractions or something, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nNo, I don't think so. This is a straightforward order of operations problem.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that the answer is 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
