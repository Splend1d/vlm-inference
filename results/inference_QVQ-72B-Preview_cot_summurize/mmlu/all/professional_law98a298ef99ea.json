The 80-acre tract included the family home, an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by a wealthy industrialist. For many years, the closest town to the tract had been in the grips of economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area. By the early 1 990s, prosperity had burst upon the area. To take advantage of the real estate boom, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers. Each deed contained the following provisions:\"It is an express covenant and condition that the property hereby conveyed shall not be used for other than single-family residences. \"\"The grantor hereby covenants for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to insert a similar restriction in all deeds to lots now owned by grantor in the 80- acre tract. \"In 1996, the county board of supervisors purchased from the attorney 30 lots within the 80-acre tract.

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which option is correct based on the situation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in 1980, an attorney buys an 80-acre tract in a rural area. This tract includes a fancy mansion built in 1929. The nearby town has been struggling economically for a while, but things start to turn around in the late 1980s when big companies build plants there. By the early 1990s, the area is booming.\n\nThe attorney decides to capitalize on this boom by dividing the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney has sold 90 of these lots to individual buyers. Each of these deeds has two key provisions:\n\n1. The property must only be used for single-family residences.\n\n2. The grantor (the attorney) promises to include similar restrictions in all deeds for the remaining lots in the 80-acre tract.\n\nIn 1996, the county board of supervisors buys 30 lots from the attorney. The county plans to build a new pest-control office on this land. The deed from the attorney to the county doesn't mention the restrictive covenants that were in the deeds to the other lot buyers. However, it does say that the conveyance is \"in lieu of the exercise of the power of eminent domain.\" That means the county could have taken the land using their eminent domain power but chose to buy it instead.\n\nAfter buying the lots, the county enacts a zoning ordinance that rezones these 30 lots to allow for the construction of the pest-control office. When they start building, the other lot owners in the 80-acre tract sue to stop the construction or to get damages. They're probably arguing that the restrictive covenants prevent the land from being used for anything other than single-family residences.\n\nNow, the question is asking what would happen if the county board of supervisors prevails on both counts\u2014that is, if the court rules in favor of the county on both the injunction and the damages claims. We need to choose from four options:\n\nA. The power of eminent domain is the equivalent of the power to zone.\n\nB. The purchase of the 80-acre tract property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is an act of inverse condemnation.\n\nC. The abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.\n\nD. Restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.\n\nLet's analyze each option one by one.\n\nOption A: \"The power of eminent domain is the equivalent of the power to zone.\"\n\nEminent domain is the government's power to take private property for public use, typically with just compensation. Zoning is a regulatory tool that controls how land can be used, such as residential, commercial, or industrial zones. While both relate to land use, they are distinct powers. Eminent domain involves taking property, whereas zoning regulates property use without taking ownership. So, they are not equivalent; they serve different purposes.\n\nOption B: \"The purchase of the 80-acre tract property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is an act of inverse condemnation.\"\n\nInverse condemnation typically occurs when a government action affects property rights without formal condemnation proceedings, and the property owner seeks compensation. In this case, the county bought the land, so it's a direct purchase, not an inverse condemnation. The deed specifies that the conveyance is \"in lieu of the exercise of the power of eminent domain,\" meaning they chose to buy it instead of taking it through eminent domain proceedings. So, this doesn't seem to fit the definition of inverse condemnation.\n\nOption C: \"The abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.\"\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. A restrictive covenant is an agreement that limits how a property can be used. In this case, the covenant restricts the land to single-family residences. If the county is abrogating (cancelling or ignoring) this covenant to build a pest-control office, the other lot owners might argue that this violates their rights and entitles them to compensation.\n\nHowever, if the court rules that the abrogation of this covenant isn't a compensable taking, it means that the lot owners aren't entitled to damages even if the covenant is not enforced. This could be because the covenant is unenforceable against the county, perhaps due to the county's sovereign immunity or because the covenant was not properly recorded or enforced against the county's purchase.\n\nOption D: \"Restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.\"\n\nThis is an important point. Generally, restrictive covenants run with the land and bind subsequent owners, provided they are properly recorded and enforceable. However, there might be exceptions, especially if the buyer didn't have notice of the covenant or if the covenant was not included in their deed.\n\nIn this scenario, the county's deed didn't mention the restrictive covenants that were in the other lot owners' deeds. So, if the law holds that restrictions only bind buyers whose deeds contain them, then the county might not be bound by the covenant restricting use to single-family residences.\n\nNow, considering the question: \"If the county board of supervisors, the named defendant, prevails on both counts, it will be because...\"\n\nThe county prevails on both the injunction and the damages claims. That means the court allows the construction to proceed and doesn't award damages to the other lot owners.\n\nIf the county prevails, it's likely because the restrictive covenant doesn't apply to them, either because the covenant isn't enforceable against them or because their deed didn't include the covenant.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option D seems directly relevant: restrictions on land use can only be enforced against buyers whose deeds contain the restrictions.\n\nIf this is the case, then since the county's deed didn't include the covenant, they wouldn't be bound by it. Therefore, they could proceed with their construction without violating any covenant, and the other lot owners wouldn't be entitled to damages.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's another option that could also lead to the county prevailing on both counts.\n\nOption C says that the abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking. If this is true, then even if the covenant is being ignored, the lot owners wouldn't get damages. But, in that case, the county might still be enjoined from building if the covenant is enforceable against them.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the county's deed doesn't include the covenant, they might not be bound by it anyway. So, Option D seems more directly applicable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because eminent domain and zoning are different legal concepts.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the situation described is a purchase in lieu of eminent domain, not an inverse condemnation.\n\nOption C might be relevant, but Option D seems more directly applicable to the county's position.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is Option D: restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.\n\nThis would mean that since the county's deed didn't include the covenant, they aren't bound by it, and thus can proceed with their construction without violating any enforceable restriction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
