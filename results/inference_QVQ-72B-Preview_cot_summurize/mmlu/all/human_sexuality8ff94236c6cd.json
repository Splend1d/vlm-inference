                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about sociobiology and gender differences. The question is: \"The theory of _______ is used by sociobiologists specifically to explain the evolution of gender differences.\" And the options are A. natural selection, B. the new synthesis, C. sexual selection, and D. the gender schema.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what sociobiology is. From what I recall, sociobiology is a field that applies evolutionary theory to social behavior, particularly in humans. It suggests that some social behaviors may have evolved over time because they provided survival or reproductive advantages.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about explaining the evolution of gender differences. So, I need to find out which theory among these options is most directly related to understanding why males and females differ in certain traits or behaviors.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: natural selection. Natural selection is a fundamental concept in evolution, where traits that enhance survival and reproduction tend to become more common in a population over time. While natural selection is certainly involved in the evolution of gender differences, it's a broad concept that applies to all traits, not specifically to gender differences.\n\nOption B: the new synthesis. I'm not as familiar with this term. A quick search in my notes tells me that the modern synthesis, or the neo-Darwinian synthesis, is the combination of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection with Gregor Mendel's principles of genetics. This provides a comprehensive framework for understanding evolution at the genetic level. While this is important for understanding how traits evolve, including gender differences, it's not specifically about gender differences themselves.\n\nOption C: sexual selection. This sounds promising. Sexual selection is a type of natural selection that involves traits that give individuals an advantage in mating. It can lead to differences between males and females in a species, often called sexual dimorphism. For example, peacocks have elaborate tails that attract peahens, but males and females look quite different otherwise. In humans, some traits might be subject to sexual selection, leading to differences between men and women.\n\nOption D: the gender schema. This sounds more like a psychological or social construct rather than an evolutionary theory. A gender schema is a mental framework that helps individuals understand and categorize gender roles and characteristics. It's more about how people perceive and interpret gender differences based on cultural and social norms, not about the evolutionary origins of those differences.\n\nSo, comparing these options, natural selection is too broad, the new synthesis is about the integration of genetics and evolution, and the gender schema is more of a social psychological concept. Sexual selection, on the other hand, is directly related to the evolution of traits that differ between males and females, making it the most appropriate choice for explaining the evolution of gender differences in sociobiology.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check a reliable source. According to E.O. Wilson, who is often considered the father of sociobiology, sexual selection plays a crucial role in shaping gender differences in behavior and physiology. He argues that these differences evolved because they provided advantages in mating and reproduction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. sexual selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
