                    "text": "So I have this problem here: In the xy-plane, the curve with parametric equations x = cos t and y = sin t, where t is between 0 and \u03c0, and I need to find its length. The options are 3, \u03c0, 3\u03c0, and 3/2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this curve looks like. I know that x = cos t and y = sin t typically represents a circle, right? But usually, for t from 0 to 2\u03c0, it's a full circle. Here, t only goes from 0 to \u03c0, so maybe it's a semicircle?\n\nLet me think about it. If t goes from 0 to \u03c0, starting at t=0: x=cos(0)=1, y=sin(0)=0, so the point (1,0). At t=\u03c0: x=cos(\u03c0)=-1, y=sin(\u03c0)=0, so (-1,0). So, it's like the top half of the unit circle, from (1,0) to (-1,0).\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about the direction. Since x = cos t and y = sin t, as t increases from 0 to \u03c0, x goes from 1 to -1 and y goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0. So, it's a semicircle, yes.\n\nNow, to find the length of this curve, I should use the arc length formula for parametric equations. I remember that the arc length L is given by:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^2} \\, dt \\]\n\nIn this case, a=0 and b=\u03c0.\n\nFirst, I need to find dx/dt and dy/dt.\n\nGiven x = cos t, then dx/dt = -sin t.\n\nGiven y = sin t, then dy/dt = cos t.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sqrt{(-\\sin t)^2 + (\\cos t)^2} \\, dt \\]\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n\\[ (-\\sin t)^2 + (\\cos t)^2 = \\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1 \\]\n\nSo, \\[ \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the integral simplifies to:\n\n\\[ L = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} 1 \\, dt \\]\n\nThat's just the integral of one from 0 to \u03c0, which is \u03c0.\n\nWait a minute, that would mean the length is \u03c0, which is one of the options. But let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nI know that the circumference of a full circle with radius 1 is \\( 2\\pi r = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi \\). Since this is a semicircle, the arc length should be half of that, which is \u03c0. So, that seems to make sense.\n\nBut let's consider another approach to confirm. Maybe I can eliminate the parameter t and work with x and y directly.\n\nFrom x = cos t and y = sin t, I know that x^2 + y^2 = cos^2 t + sin^2 t = 1. So, the equation of the curve is x^2 + y^2 = 1, which is indeed a circle of radius 1.\n\nSince t goes from 0 to \u03c0, and as t increases, x decreases from 1 to -1, and y increases from 0 to 1 and then back to 0, it's the top half of the circle.\n\nSo, again, the arc length should be \u03c0, which matches the integral result.\n\nWait, but let's try to parametrize it differently. Suppose I use x = t and try to express y in terms of x. From x = cos t, solving for t: t = arccos x. Then y = sin(arccos x).\n\nBut I think parametric equations are the way to go here, and the arc length formula works well in this case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the curve is a semicircle and calculate its length geometrically.\n\nThe circumference of a full circle is 2\u03c0r, so a semicircle has length \u03c0r. Since r=1, \u03c0*1 = \u03c0.\n\nThat matches my earlier result.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the derivative again.\n\ndx/dt = -sin t\n\ndy/dt = cos t\n\nSo, \\[ \\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^2 = \\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1 \\]\n\nSquare root of 1 is 1, so the integral is indeed \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the length of the curve is \u03c0.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any possibility of misinterpretation.\n\nIs the curve x = cos t and y = sin t for t from 0 to \u03c0 really a semicircle?\n\nLet me plot a few points:\n\nAt t=0: (1,0)\n\nAt t=\u03c0/2: (0,1)\n\nAt t=\u03c0: (-1,0)\n\nYes, it's the top half of the unit circle, traced from (1,0) to (-1,0).\n\nSo, the arc length should indeed be \u03c0.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nMaybe it's a different shape, or perhaps there's a different way to parameterize it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the arc length of a circle can also be calculated using the formula s = r\u03b8, where \u03b8 is in radians.\n\nGiven that t spans from 0 to \u03c0 radians, and r=1, s = 1 * \u03c0 = \u03c0.\n\nAgain, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the parametric equations and think about the speed along the curve.\n\nThe speed is ds/dt = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 ) = sqrt( sin^2 t + cos^2 t ) = 1.\n\nSo, ds/dt = 1, meaning ds = dt.\n\nTherefore, integrating from t=0 to t=\u03c0, the length is \u03c0.\n\nI think I've confirmed it in multiple ways, and they all point to the length being \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. \u03c0.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of a mistake.\n\nSuppose I integrate incorrectly.\n\nThe integral of 1 with respect to t from 0 to \u03c0 is indeed \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, if I parametrize differently, say using t = \u03c0 - s, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nNo, I think I'm confident with this.\n\nSo, the final answer is B. \u03c0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\pi} \\]"
