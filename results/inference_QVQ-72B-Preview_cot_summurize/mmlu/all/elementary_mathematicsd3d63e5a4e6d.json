The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering which direction from zero the number is. So, it's always non-negative.\n\nLet me recall that:\n\n- The absolute value of a positive number is the number itself.\n\n- The absolute value of a negative number is the opposite of that number.\n\n- The absolute value of zero is zero.\n\nSo, for option A, -6: the absolute value is 6, because it's 6 units away from zero.\n\nFor option B, -5: the absolute value is 5.\n\nFor option C, 0: the absolute value is 0.\n\nFor option D, 5: the absolute value is 5.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number that has an absolute value greater than 5. So, among the options, we have:\n\nA. -6 \u2192 | -6 | = 6\n\nB. -5 \u2192 | -5 | = 5\n\nC. 0 \u2192 | 0 | = 0\n\nD. 5 \u2192 | 5 | = 5\n\nComparing these to 5:\n\n- 6 is greater than 5\n\n- 5 is equal to 5\n\n- 0 is less than 5\n\nSo, the only option that fits the criteria is A. -6, because its absolute value is 6, which is greater than 5.\n\nWait a minute, but option D is 5, and its absolute value is 5, which is not greater than 5; it's equal to 5. Similarly, -5 has an absolute value of 5, which is also equal to 5. And 0 has an absolute value of 0, which is less than 5.\n\nSo, the only correct answer is A. -6.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any trick here. The question says \"greater than 5,\" so strictly greater than 5, which would exclude 5 itself. Therefore, options B and D are equal to 5, so they shouldn't be considered.\n\nOption C is 0, which is less than 5.\n\nOption A is -6, which has an absolute value of 6, which is greater than 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. -6.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if there are any other interpretations. Is there a possibility that the absolute value could be less than 5 for any of these numbers?\n\nNo, because the absolute value is always non-negative, and for the given options, only -6 has an absolute value greater than 5.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. -6} \\]"
