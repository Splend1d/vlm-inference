It says that in a class, half the group was told to listen for sounds of words, and the other half was asked to gauge the emotional impact of the words. Then, the group that gauged the emotional impact remembered more words. The question is, what does this suggest about better retention? The options are:\n\nA. Semantic features\n\nB. Echoic features\n\nC. Shallow processing\n\nD. Surface processing\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with \"semantic features\": semantics has to do with the meaning of words. So, semantic features would refer to the meaning aspects of the words.\n\n\"Echoic features\" sounds like it relates to sound or auditory aspects. Echoic memory is a type of sensory memory that specifically deals with sounds.\n\n\"Shallow processing\" and \"surface processing\" seem similar at first glance. Shallow processing refers to learning or processing information based on superficial characteristics, like the way it sounds or looks, without engaging with the meaning. Surface processing is similar, focusing on the surface-level features of information rather than its deeper meaning.\n\nGiven that, the group that was directed to listen for sounds was engaging in a type of shallow or surface processing, focusing on the auditory aspects of the words. On the other hand, the group that gauged the emotional impact was likely engaging with the meaning of the words, which would be deeper processing.\n\nThe result was that the group that gauged emotional impact remembered more words. This suggests that paying attention to the meaning and emotional content of words leads to better retention compared to just focusing on how they sound.\n\nSo, if I look at the options again:\n\nA. Semantic features \u2013 this would involve the meaning of the words, which aligns with gauging emotional impact since emotions are tied to meanings.\n\nB. Echoic features \u2013 this is about the sound of the words, which is what the first group was focusing on, but the second group did better by focusing on emotions.\n\nC. Shallow processing \u2013 this is the opposite of what led to better retention; shallow processing is less effective for retention.\n\nD. Surface processing \u2013 similar to shallow processing, focusing on superficial aspects.\n\nGiven this, it seems that option A, semantic features, is the correct answer because paying attention to the meaning of the words (their semantic features) led to better retention.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nEchoic features are specifically about sound, and while that might be important for immediate recall, especially in auditory presentations, the study shows that focusing on emotional impact, which is more related to meaning, leads to better retention.\n\nShallow and surface processing are both terms that refer to processing information at a basic level without delving into deeper meanings, which in this case would be focusing on sounds rather than emotions.\n\nSo, if shallow and surface processing involve paying attention to less meaningful aspects, and the group that did that had poorer recall, then it's clear that deeper processing, like focusing on semantic features (meaning and emotions), leads to better retention.\n\nTherefore, the evidence supports that better retention results with attention to semantic features.\n\nI think the answer is A. Semantic features.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
