                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Nozick's response to a criticism of his historical entitlement theory. The criticism is that if the distribution of goods in society is unjust, those at the bottom always lose. And the question is asking how Nozick answers this criticism. The options are:\n\nA. It can be remedied by redistribution of wealth.\n\nB. If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just.\n\nC. Historical factors are secondary to moral imperatives.\n\nD. He has no answer.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Nozick's historical entitlement theory is all about. I remember that Nozick argues that a distribution of wealth is just if it arises from a just starting point through a series of just transfers. So, the focus is on the process of acquisition and transfer, not necessarily on the end result.\n\nThe criticism seems to be saying that even if each transfer is just, the overall distribution might still be unfair, particularly disadvantaging those at the bottom. So, the question is whether Nozick has a response to this concern.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. It can be remedied by redistribution of wealth.\n\nI know that Nozick is a libertarian, and libertarians generally oppose forced redistribution of wealth because they see it as a violation of individual property rights. So, it's unlikely that Nozick would advocate for redistribution as a solution.\n\nB. If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just.\n\nThis seems to align with Nozick's view. He argues that as long as each person has justly acquired their holdings, the overall distribution is just by virtue of the justness of each individual's holdings. This is because justice in holdings is more important than the overall distribution.\n\nC. Historical factors are secondary to moral imperatives.\n\nThis seems a bit vague, but Nozick's theory does emphasize historical entitlement, meaning that the history of how holdings were acquired and transferred matters for determining justice. So, historical factors are actually central to his theory, not secondary.\n\nD. He has no answer.\n\nThis seems unlikely because Nozick was a philosopher who carefully thought through objections to his theory and provided responses.\n\nGiven this, option B seems the most plausible. Nozick would likely argue that if each person's holdings are justly acquired and no one is being wronged in their current holdings, then the overall distribution is just. He doesn't focus on the overall distribution as much as on the justice of individual entitlements.\n\nLet me think about this further. Suppose that through a series of just transfers, a society ends up with a very unequal distribution of wealth, where a few have a lot and many have very little. The criticism might be that this is unjust because it leaves the poorest worse off.\n\nNozick would respond that as long as each transfer was voluntary and no one was coerced or cheated, the current distribution is just. He would disagree with the idea that the overall distribution needs to meet certain criteria of fairness beyond the justice of individual entitlements.\n\nSo, in essence, Nozick is saying that if each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution is just, even if it's unequal. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider the other options again:\n\nA. Redistribution: Nozick would likely oppose this as it involves interfering with individual property rights.\n\nC. Historical factors are secondary: This contradicts Nozick's emphasis on historical entitlement.\n\nD. He has no answer: This seems improbable given Nozick's thoroughness in defending his theory.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
