                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Fulcher & Scott's criteria for a community. Let me see what they consider to be essential elements of a community. The options are:\n\nA. A shared sense of identity and belonging together\n\nB. Common activities involving all-round relationships\n\nC. A fixed geographical location\n\nD. Collective action based on common interests\n\nI need to figure out which one of these is not identified by Fulcher & Scott as a criterion of community.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what Fulcher & Scott define as a community. From what I recall, they might emphasize certain aspects like shared identity, common activities, and collective action. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A shared sense of identity and belonging together. This seems like a fundamental aspect of any community. If people feel they belong and share a common identity, that's likely an important factor. Maybe Fulcher & Scott do consider this as a criterion.\n\nOption B: Common activities involving all-round relationships. This also sounds relevant. Communities often engage in shared activities that foster bonds and relationships among members. So, perhaps this is another criterion they mention.\n\nOption C: A fixed geographical location. Hmm, this is interesting. While many traditional communities are based on geography, like neighborhood communities or village communities, nowadays with the rise of online communities, people can form communities without being in the same place. Maybe Fulcher & Scott don't consider a fixed geographical location as a necessary criterion for a community.\n\nOption D: Collective action based on common interests. This seems similar to options A and B. If people come together to take action based on shared interests, that sounds like a key aspect of community. So, probably this is also considered a criterion.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to stand out as possibly not being a criterion according to Fulcher & Scott. They might focus more on the shared identity, common activities, and collective action, rather than the physical location.\n\nBut, to be sure, I should think about it more carefully. Maybe they do consider geography as part of their definition. After all, in sociology, place and space can be important for community formation.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should look up Fulcher & Scott's definition of community to get a clearer idea. I think they might be authors of a sociology textbook or something similar.\n\nAssuming that's the case, let's consider what sociology generally defines as a community. Typically, communities are groups of people who share a common characteristic, such as location, interests, or identity, and interact with one another in meaningful ways.\n\nIn this context, options A, B, and D all relate to shared identity, common activities, and collective action, which are central to most definitions of community.\n\nOption C, a fixed geographical location, might not be essential in all types of communities, especially with the prevalence of virtual communities today.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that Fulcher & Scott do not consider a fixed geographical location as a necessary criterion for a community.\n\nBut, to make sure, maybe I should consider some examples.\n\nSuppose there's an online forum where people with a common interest in, say, photography, come together to share photos, give feedback, and organize photo walks. They have a shared identity as photographers, engage in common activities like sharing and discussing photos, and may take collective actions like planning events or advocating for certain causes related to photography.\n\nIn this case, their community exists primarily online, without a fixed geographical location. If Fulcher & Scott recognize this as a community, then a fixed geographical location isn't a required criterion.\n\nAnother example could be a community of practice, where professionals in the same field, say healthcare, collaborate and learn from each other, possibly across different locations. Again, geography isn't the defining factor here.\n\nOn the other hand, some communities are indeed defined by their geographical boundaries, like local neighborhood associations or community gardens in a specific area.\n\nBut even in these cases, while geography plays a role, it's the interactions and shared identities of the residents that truly define the community.\n\nPerhaps Fulcher & Scott emphasize the importance of social ties and shared experiences over the physical location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they consider that communities can be both place-based and interest-based, without requiring a fixed geographical location in all cases.\n\nGiven this, it seems likely that option C, a fixed geographical location, is not a criterion of community according to Fulcher & Scott.\n\nTo further support this, I can think about the concept of \"community of interest\" versus \"community of place.\"\n\nA community of interest is based on shared interests or activities, regardless of where its members live, whereas a community of place is defined by the geographical area where its members reside.\n\nIf Fulcher & Scott recognize both types of communities, then they wouldn't consider a fixed geographical location as an essential criterion for defining a community.\n\nMoreover, in contemporary sociology, the idea of community has expanded beyond physical spaces to include virtual and digital platforms, further reinforcing the idea that a fixed geographical location isn't a necessary condition for a community.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I would conclude that option C, a fixed geographical location, is not identified by Fulcher & Scott as a criterion of community.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
