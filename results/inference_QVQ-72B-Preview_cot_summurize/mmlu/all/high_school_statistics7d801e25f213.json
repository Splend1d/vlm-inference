                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a dentist who sees that about two out of every seven children develop cavities before they turn 10. Last week, he examined five unrelated children younger than 10, and X is the number of children who develop cavities before turning 10. I need to find which of the given options gives the probability that at least one of these five children will develop a cavity before turning 10.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. It says that about two children in every seven develop cavities before age 10. So, the probability that a single child develops a cavity before age 10 is 2/7, right? Because two out of seven means 2/7 probability.\n\nNow, last week he examined five unrelated children, and I need to find the probability that at least one of them has a cavity before turning 10. So, X follows a binomial distribution, where n is the number of trials (children examined), which is 5, and p is the probability of success (developing a cavity), which is 2/7.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is P(X = k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nBut here, I need P(X \u2265 1), which is the probability that at least one child has a cavity before turning 10.\n\nThere are a few ways to calculate P(X \u2265 1). One way is to calculate the sum of probabilities for X = 1, X = 2, X = 3, X = 4, and X = 5. But that seems tedious.\n\nAnother way is to use the complement rule, which says that P(X \u2265 1) = 1 - P(X = 0). This seems simpler because I only have to calculate the probability that none of the five children have cavities before turning 10.\n\nLet me see what the options are:\n\nA. P(X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\n\nWait, but only five children were examined. So, X can only be from 0 to 5. Maybe this option is incomplete or miswritten.\n\nB. P(X = 2 out of 7)\n\nAgain, only five children were examined, so talking about 7 doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nC. P(X = 1)\n\nThis is just the probability that exactly one child has a cavity, not at least one.\n\nD. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0)\n\nThis seems to align with the complement rule I thought of earlier.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is correct. But let me double-check.\n\nIf P(X = 0) is the probability that none of the five children have cavities before turning 10, then 1 - P(X = 0) would indeed be the probability that at least one of them does have a cavity before turning 10.\n\nSo, yes, that seems right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret \"at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10\"?\n\nWell, \"at least one\" means one or more, so that's X \u2265 1.\n\nAnd as I thought, the complement is X = 0, so 1 - P(X = 0) gives the probability of X \u2265 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
