                    "text": "So I've got this question about lactase persistence and non-persistence in adults worldwide. It's asking for the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters globally, and there are four options to choose from. Let me try to understand what this is all about.\n\nFirst off, lactase is an enzyme that helps digest lactose, which is the sugar found in milk and dairy products. Lactase is normally present in the small intestine, especially in infants and young children, because they need it to digest milk as their primary food source. However, as people age, the production of lactase can decrease in some populations. This reduction is called lactase non-persistence.\n\nWhen someone has low levels of lactase, they might not be able to digest lactose properly, leading to lactose intolerance. This can cause symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea after consuming dairy products.\n\nNow, the question is about the percentage of adults who are lactase non-persisters worldwide. The options are:\n\nA. 45%-50%\n\nB. 70%-75%\n\nC. 10%-15%\n\nD. 30%-35%\n\nI need to recall some statistics about lactase persistence and non-persistence across different populations.\n\nFrom what I remember, lactase persistence into adulthood is more common in populations with a history of dairy farming and milk consumption, like certain European populations, particularly those from northern Europe. For example, Scandinavians and Dutch people have high rates of lactase persistence, often above 90%.\n\nOn the other hand, in many other parts of the world, such as Asia, Africa, and parts of Southern Europe, lactase non-persistence is more common. In these regions, the majority of adults may have reduced lactase levels.\n\nLet me think about the global distribution. If I consider the entire world population, the percentage of lactase non-persisters would be higher than in Europe alone.\n\nLet's see, Europe has about 10% of the world's population, roughly. If Europeans have a higher rate of lactase persistence, and the rest of the world has lower rates, then globally, the percentage of lactase non-persisters should be higher than the European average.\n\nFor instance, in many Asian countries, the rate of lactase non-persistence can be up to 90-95%. In Africa, it varies, but in many regions, it's around 70-80%. In the Middle East, it's also quite high.\n\nGiven that, the worldwide average would be skewed towards higher percentages of lactase non-persistence.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 45%-50%\n\nB. 70%-75%\n\nC. 10%-15%\n\nD. 30%-35%\n\nOption C (10%-15%) seems too low, as that would only apply to some European populations, not globally.\n\nOption D (30%-35%) might be possible, but I think it's lower than the actual global average.\n\nOption A (45%-50%) is higher, but still, I think the global percentage is even higher.\n\nOption B (70%-75%) seems plausible because, as I mentioned, many parts of the world have high rates of lactase non-persistence.\n\nLet me try to recall some specific numbers. I think that worldwide, about 65-70% of adults are lactase non-persisters.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for some data to confirm this.\n\nI recall that in East Asian populations, lactase non-persistence is around 90-95%. In Sub-Saharan Africa, it's about 70-80%. In Southern Europe, like Italy and Greece, it's around 60-70%. In North America, due to the diverse population, it varies, but it's still higher than in Northern Europe.\n\nGiven that, the global average should be higher than 50%, probably around 70-75%.\n\nI also remember that in some indigenous populations, like the Saami people in Scandinavia, who have a history of dairy use, lactase persistence is higher, but they are a small portion of the global population.\n\nTherefore, considering the majority of the world's population comes from regions with high rates of lactase non-persistence, the overall percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide should be around 70-75%.\n\nSo, I would go with option B: 70%-75%.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my memory. I think that the World Health Organization (WHO) has some statistics on this, but since I don't have access to that right now, I'll rely on my knowledge.\n\nYes, I'm confident that B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
