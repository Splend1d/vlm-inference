The options are:\n\nA. simpler\n\nB. more natural\n\nC. older\n\nD. greater and grander\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Paley is arguing here. I remember that Paley was an 18th-century philosopher who proposed the teleological argument for the existence of God, often referred to as the \"watchmaker analogy.\" In his famous work \"Natural Theology,\" he compares the complexity of a watch to the complexity of nature.\n\nThe essence of his argument is that just as a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker due to its intricate design and purpose, so too does the intricate design and purposefulness of nature imply the existence of a divine designer, i.e., God.\n\nSo, in this analogy, the watch represents a man-made object with a clear purpose and complex mechanism, while nature represents a similarly complex and purposeful creation but on a much larger and more encompassing scale.\n\nGiven that, the question is asking about the key difference between the \"contrivance\" of a watch and that of nature. \"Contrivance\" here likely refers to the design, complexity, or purposeful arrangement of these entities.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. simpler: Is nature simpler than a watch? That seems counterintuitive. Nature is vastly more complex than a watch, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nB. more natural: This option seems a bit too obvious and perhaps not substantive enough in the context of Paley's argument. After all, Paley is trying to highlight the similarity in design between man-made objects and natural ones, not their difference in being \"natural.\"\n\nC. older: While it's true that nature is older than human-made objects like watches, I don't think this is the primary difference Paley was emphasizing. His focus seems to be more on the complexity and design rather than the age of the entities.\n\nD. greater and grander: This seems plausible. Nature is not just a single watch but encompasses an entire universe of diverse and interconnected systems, from biological organisms to geological formations. Its scale and scope are far greater and grander than that of any man-made object.\n\nConsidering Paley's argument, which emphasizes the design and purpose in both the watch and nature, the difference lies in the magnitude and scope of the design. A watch is a single, intricate object, whereas nature is a vast, interconnected system of countless intricate designs working together.\n\nTherefore, the key difference is that nature's contrivance is greater and grander than that of a watch.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
