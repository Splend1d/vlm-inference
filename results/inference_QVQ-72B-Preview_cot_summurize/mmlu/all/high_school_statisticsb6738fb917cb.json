                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about increasing the sample size and how it affects the distribution of the sample proportion. So, the scientists are studying geese and want to estimate what proportion comes back to the same breeding site next season. Initially, they had a sample size of 200, and now they're thinking of increasing it to 2,000. The question is, how does this affect the distribution of the sample proportion.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some statistics here. I remember that when we talk about the distribution of the sample proportion, we're dealing with the proportion of successes in a sample, right? In this case, a \"success\" would be a goose returning to the same breeding site.\n\nSo, the sample proportion, often denoted as \\(\\hat{p}\\), is given by the number of successes divided by the sample size, \\(n\\). Here, \\(n\\) is increasing from 200 to 2,000.\n\nI recall that the distribution of the sample proportion has a mean and a standard deviation. The mean of the sample proportion is equal to the population proportion, \\(p\\), and the standard deviation, often called the standard error, is \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\).\n\nSo, if we increase the sample size \\(n\\), what happens to the standard deviation of the sample proportion?\n\nLet me think about this. The standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of \\(n\\). So, if \\(n\\) increases, the standard error decreases. That means the distribution of the sample proportion becomes less spread out.\n\nWait a minute, that makes sense intuitively too. With a larger sample size, we expect our estimate of the proportion to be more precise, meaning less variability in the sample proportion from sample to sample.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out.\n\nB. The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.\n\nC. The spread of the distribution of the sample proportion will remain unaffected.\n\nD. The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.\n\nGiven that increasing the sample size leads to a decrease in the standard error, option B seems correct. But let me double-check.\n\nI remember there's something about the Central Limit Theorem that says that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample proportion becomes more normally distributed, provided that \\(np\\) and \\(n(1-p)\\) are sufficiently large, like greater than 5 or 10, depending on the rule of thumb.\n\nBut in this question, we're specifically asked about the spread of the distribution, not its shape.\n\nWait, option D says that the distribution will more closely resemble the binomial distribution. Hmm, the sample proportion is based on the binomial distribution, but when \\(n\\) is large, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution, right?\n\nBut the question is about the distribution of the sample proportion, which is already a proportion, and its distribution is often modeled as approximately normal for large \\(n\\), with mean \\(p\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\).\n\nSo, increasing \\(n\\) would make the distribution of the sample proportion more normal, but in terms of spread, it would make it less spread out, not more.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the spread besides the sample size.\n\nIs there any mention of the population proportion \\(p\\) changing? No, the question doesn't mention that. So, assuming \\(p\\) remains constant, increasing \\(n\\) should only affect the standard error, making the distribution less variable.\n\nOption A is the opposite of what should happen; increasing \\(n\\) should not make the distribution more spread out.\n\nOption C says the spread remains unaffected, but that's not the case; the spread decreases with larger \\(n\\).\n\nOption D mentions that the distribution will more closely resemble the binomial distribution. While it's true that with larger \\(n\\), the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution, the primary effect here is on the spread, not the shape.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option B: the distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check again. If \\(n\\) increases, the denominator in the standard error formula increases, so the standard error decreases, leading to less spread in the distribution of the sample proportion.\n\nYes, I'm confident that option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
