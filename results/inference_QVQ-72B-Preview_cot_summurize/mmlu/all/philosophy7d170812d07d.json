                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about John Stuart Mill's views on justice and moral obligations. The question is saying that Mill claims the distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds perfectly to the distinction between:\n\nA. perfect and imperfect obligations.\n\nB. positive and negative duties.\n\nC. strong and weak duties.\n\nD. absolute and relative obligations.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what Mill said about justice and moral obligations. I remember that Mill was a utilitarian philosopher, and he had some specific ideas about how different types of duties relate to each other.\n\nLet me start by understanding what each option means:\n\nA. Perfect and imperfect obligations: I think perfect obligations are those that are absolute and must always be followed, like not lying or not stealing. Imperfect obligations are more about doing good when possible, but there's more flexibility in when and how you fulfill them, like helping others when you can.\n\nB. Positive and negative duties: Positive duties are about doing something, like helping others or keeping promises. Negative duties are about refraining from doing something, like not harming others or not breaking promises.\n\nC. Strong and weak duties: This seems a bit vague. Maybe strong duties are more important or have greater moral weight, while weak duties are less important or more easily overridden.\n\nD. Absolute and relative obligations: Absolute obligations are unconditional and must always be followed, no matter the circumstances. Relative obligations can be overridden depending on the situation.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Mill said about justice in relation to these distinctions.\n\nI remember that Mill distinguished between justice and other moral obligations, suggesting that justice is a subset of morality that deals with rights and wrongs against individuals, while other moral obligations might be more about promoting general happiness or well-being.\n\nIn his work \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill discusses the importance of justice and how it relates to utility. He acknowledges that people often see justice as something distinct from utility, but he argues that justice is ultimately grounded in utility.\n\nBut specifically, which of these distinctions does he equate with the distinction between justice and other moral obligations?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I should consider what Mill considered justice to be equivalent to in terms of obligations.\n\nI recall that Mill talks about justice as involving rights, and rights as being related to perfect duties\u2014that is, duties that are absolute and must be respected without exception.\n\nFor example, he might say that it's a perfect duty not to steal from someone because that's a matter of justice, whereas it might be an imperfect duty to help someone in need, which is more about promoting happiness.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then justice would correspond to perfect obligations, and other moral obligations would correspond to imperfect obligations.\n\nWait, but let's see. Is that what Mill actually said?\n\nI think in \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill does make a distinction between different types of duties, and he talks about how some duties are more stringent than others.\n\nLet me try to recall his exact words or the general idea.\n\nHe discusses the idea that some duties are \"perfect\" in the sense that they are absolute and allow no exceptions, while others are \"imperfect\" or \"conditional,\" allowing for some flexibility based on circumstances.\n\nMoreover, he suggests that justice is concerned primarily with these perfect duties, especially those that involve the rights of others.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the distinction between justice and other moral obligations would correspond to the distinction between perfect and imperfect obligations.\n\nBut let's double-check this because I want to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption B is positive and negative duties. While these are different types of duties, I don't recall Mill specifically equating justice with either positive or negative duties exclusively. He might have discussed both in relation to justice, but I don't think he used this distinction to define justice versus other moral obligations.\n\nOption C is strong and weak duties. This seems similar to the idea of more or less important duties, but again, I don't remember Mill using this exact terminology to distinguish justice from other moral obligations.\n\nOption D is absolute and relative obligations. This is close to the perfect and imperfect distinction, as perfect obligations are often considered absolute, and imperfect obligations can be relative. However, Mill specifically uses the terms \"perfect\" and \"imperfect\" obligations, so using \"absolute\" and \"relative\" might not be as precise.\n\nTherefore, based on my recollection, the most accurate answer should be A. perfect and imperfect obligations.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that justice involves both perfect and imperfect obligations, and that the distinction isn't so clear-cut. But I don't think that's what Mill believed. He seemed to draw a line between justice and other moral obligations, suggesting that justice is primarily about perfect duties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Mill considered justice to involve only perfect duties, while other moral obligations are imperfect. That would make sense, as justice is about respecting absolute rights of others, whereas other obligations are more about promoting good outcomes.\n\nWait, but does Mill say that all perfect duties are related to justice? Or only some of them?\n\nI think he does consider that justice is primarily concerned with perfect duties, especially those that involve not harming others or infringing on their rights.\n\nFor example, he might consider the duty not to lie as a perfect duty related to justice, whereas the duty to help others might be an imperfect duty, more related to beneficence or promoting happiness.\n\nTherefore, the distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds to the distinction between perfect and imperfect obligations.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. perfect and imperfect obligations.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's any other perspective I should consider.\n\nMaybe I should think about the sources where Mill discusses this. In \"Utilitarianism,\" he talks about how the violation of justice is connected to the infringement of perfect duties.\n\nHe also discusses how utility can ground both perfect and imperfect duties, but that perfect duties are more strictly enforced because they involve rights that others have against us.\n\nTherefore, the distinction between justice and other moral obligations aligns with the distinction between perfect and imperfect obligations.\n\nI think that's a solid conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
