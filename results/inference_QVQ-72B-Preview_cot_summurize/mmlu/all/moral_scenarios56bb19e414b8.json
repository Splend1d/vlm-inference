The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I saw a parked police car and left a thank-you note on the hood.\n\nScenario 2: I did not push the old woman to the ground as she walked by me.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: Leaving a thank-you note on a police car.\n\nHmm, police officers are public servants, right? They protect and serve the community. Leaving a thank-you note seems like a gesture of appreciation for their service. I can't see anything wrong with that. It's a kind act, showing gratitude. In fact, it's encouraged to show thanks to those who serve us.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I think it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I did not push the old woman to the ground as she walked by me.\n\nOkay, so here, the person is saying they refrained from pushing an old woman down. Pushing someone, especially an elderly person, could cause harm or injury. Not pushing her is the right thing to do. It's basic respect and consideration for others.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, not pushing someone is the morally correct choice. Therefore, it's also \"Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the scenario that is clearly morally wrong. But in both cases, the actions seem morally acceptable.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, leaving a thank-you note is a positive action, showing appreciation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, not pushing an old woman is refraining from a harmful action, which is also positive.\n\nSo, neither scenario involves doing something morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIs there any context that might change this?\n\nFor example, maybe the thank-you note had some insincere or sarcastic message, but the question doesn't specify that. It just says a thank-you note.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, not pushing someone is generally always the right thing to do, unless there was some unusual circumstance, like the person was in danger and pushing them down would have saved them, but that's not what's described.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
