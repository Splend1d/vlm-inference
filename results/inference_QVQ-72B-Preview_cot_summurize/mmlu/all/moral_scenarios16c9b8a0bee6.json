                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. Scenario 1 says, \"I researched and wrote my paper with sources found on the internet.\" And Scenario 2 is, \"I called the cops on my mom for kicking me.\" So, the question is asking whether either of these actions is morally wrong, and if so, which one.\n\nLet me start by looking at Scenario 1. Researching and writing a paper using sources from the internet. Is there anything inherently wrong with that? Well, not necessarily. In fact, in today's digital age, using the internet for research is pretty standard practice. Most students and researchers rely on online databases, academic journals, and other reputable websites for information. As long as the sources are credible and properly cited, I don't see anything morally wrong with this approach.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a concern about plagiarism or the reliability of internet sources. Plagiarism would indeed be morally wrong, as it involves taking someone else's work or ideas and presenting them as your own. However, the scenario doesn't specify any intention to plagiarize; it just says the person used sources found on the internet. Assuming they cited their sources correctly, this should be fine.\n\nAs for the reliability of internet sources, there can be varying degrees of credibility. But again, if the person is using reputable sources, like peer-reviewed articles from academic journals or well-known encyclopedias, that's generally acceptable. So, based on the information provided, I don't think Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I called the cops on my mom for kicking me.\" This one seems more delicate. Calling the police on a family member might seem drastic or even disloyal to some people, but I think it's important to consider the context. Why did the mom kick the person? Was it a mild tap as a form of discipline, or was it a violent act? The scenario doesn't specify, so I'll have to consider both possibilities.\n\nIf the kick was a harmless tap meant as a corrective measure, perhaps similar to a spanking, then calling the police might be seen as an overreaction. In many cultures and families, physical discipline is considered acceptable to some degree, although this is a topic of much debate and varies widely in different societies.\n\nHowever, if the kick was a violent act, possibly constituting abuse, then calling the police could be seen as a necessary step to protect oneself and prevent further harm. In the US, child abuse and domestic violence are taken very seriously, and there are laws in place to protect victims.\n\nGiven that, I think the morality of calling the police in this situation depends heavily on the severity of the action. If the kick was abusive, then calling the police is not morally wrong; in fact, it might be the right thing to do to ensure safety and hold the abuser accountable. On the other hand, if it was a minor disciplinary action, calling the police might be seen as inappropriate or excessive.\n\nBut here's the thing: the scenario doesn't provide enough context to determine the severity of the kick. It could range from a light tap to a forceful kick that caused injury. Without more information, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the general principle here. In the US, it's against the law to use excessive force against children or any family member. If a parent uses physical discipline that crosses the line into abuse, it's important for the victim to seek help and protection. Calling the police in such a case could be seen as a responsible and necessary action.\n\nOn the other hand, if the kick was a minor incident, perhaps part of a cultural or familial norm for discipline, calling the police might be viewed as an extreme measure that could have negative consequences for the family dynamic and the parent's well-being.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer isn't straightforward and depends on the specifics of the situation. However, since the question asks for the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and considering the increasing awareness and emphasis on anti-abuse measures, I would lean towards saying that calling the police is not necessarily morally wrong, especially if the kick was abusive.\n\nBut to be fair, in many families, there is a gray area when it comes to physical discipline, and what one person considers abuse, another might see as acceptable parenting. To navigate this, I think it's essential to consider the intent behind the action and the potential harm caused.\n\nIn summary, for Scenario 1, researching and writing a paper with internet sources is generally not morally wrong, provided proper citation and use of credible sources. For Scenario 2, calling the police on a mom for kicking depends on the context, but given the emphasis on protecting children from abuse, it's not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but I'm a bit unsure about Scenario 2. Maybe I'm being too lenient. Perhaps there's a perspective that calling the police on a parent, even in cases of abuse, could be seen as disloyal or betraying family bonds. However, in the context of US moral standards, especially with the recognition of the importance of individual rights and protection from harm, I think prioritizing one's safety over familial loyalty is acceptable and morally justifiable.\n\nMoreover, in many states, there are mandatory reporting laws that require certain professionals to report suspected child abuse, and in some cases, citizens have a duty to report abuse if they witness it.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial conclusion holds: neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action, at least not based on the information provided.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
