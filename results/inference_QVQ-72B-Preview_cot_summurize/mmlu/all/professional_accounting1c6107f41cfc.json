                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, Mill Co. has a reported pretax income of $152,500 for the year ended December 31. But there are some errors that the external auditors found during the year-end audit. The errors are:\n\n1. Ending inventory is $30,000 overstated.\n\n2. Depreciation expense is $64,000 understated.\n\nAnd the question is asking what amount should Mill report as the correct pretax income for the year after adjusting for these errors. The options are $58,500, $118,500, $186,500, or $246,500.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand how these errors affect the pretax income.\n\nStarting with the ending inventory being overstated by $30,000. In accounting, inventory is an asset on the balance sheet, and the cost of goods sold (COGS) is an expense on the income statement. There's a relationship between inventory and COGS.\n\nThe formula for COGS is:\n\nCOGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\n\nIf ending inventory is overstated, that means it's higher than it should be. So, in the formula, a higher ending inventory leads to a lower COGS (since COGS decreases as ending inventory increases). But wait, let's think carefully.\n\nActually, if ending inventory is overstated, that means COGS is understated, because COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory. So, if Ending Inventory is too high by $30,000, COGS is understated by $30,000.\n\nNow, pretax income is calculated as revenues minus expenses. If COGS is understated by $30,000, then expenses are understated by $30,000, which means pretax income is overstated by $30,000.\n\nSo, to correct the pretax income, I need to subtract $30,000 from the reported pretax income.\n\nNext, depreciation expense is understated by $64,000. Depreciation is an expense, and if it's understated, that means expenses are lower than they should be, which makes pretax income higher than it should be.\n\nSo, if depreciation expense is understated by $64,000, pretax income is overstated by $64,000. Therefore, to correct this, I need to subtract $64,000 from the reported pretax income.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Inventory overstated by $30,000 \u2192 COGS understated by $30,000 \u2192 Pretax income overstated by $30,000 \u2192 Subtract $30,000\n\n- Depreciation expense understated by $64,000 \u2192 Pretax income overstated by $64,000 \u2192 Subtract $64,000\n\nTotal adjustment = $30,000 + $64,000 = $94,000\n\nCorrected pretax income = Reported pretax income - Total adjustment = $152,500 - $94,000 = $58,500\n\nLooking back at the options, $58,500 is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, the inventory overstatement leads to an understatement of COGS, which in turn overstates pretax income. So, adjusting by subtracting $30,000 seems correct.\n\nSecond, the depreciation expense being understated directly understates expenses and overstates pretax income, so subtracting $64,000 also seems correct.\n\nAdding both adjustments: $30,000 + $64,000 = $94,000\n\nSubtracting that from the reported pretax income: $152,500 - $94,000 = $58,500\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the correct pretax income should be $58,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 58,500} \\]"
