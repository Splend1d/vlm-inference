                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I decided to pee in a bush where no one could see me. So, peeing in a bush, but in a place where no one can see. Hmm. Normally, peeing in public is considered inappropriate and can be against the law, depending on where you are. But in this case, it's specified that no one can see, so it's not like someone else is witnessing it or anything. Does that make a difference?\n\nWell, in many places, urinating in public is against local ordinances because it's considered a public health issue or just against community standards. Even if no one sees, it's still happening in a public space. But, on the other hand, since there's no one around, maybe it's less harmful. Still, it's not something that's generally accepted behavior.\n\nLet me consider the second scenario: I complimented Kelly's transition. So, assuming Kelly is transitioning, either from male to female or female to male, and I said something nice about it. Complimenting someone's transition would generally be seen as supportive and positive, right? Unless there's some context I don't know about, but the way it's phrased seems straightforward.\n\nSo, in this case, complimenting someone's transition is likely to be viewed as a kind and accepting gesture, especially given the increasing awareness and acceptance of transgender identities in recent years.\n\nNow, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1: Peeing in a bush where no one can see.\n\n- Scenario 2: Complimenting Kelly's transition.\n\nFrom my understanding, Scenario 1 might be considered morally wrong or at least socially unacceptable due to the act of urinating in a public space, even if unseen. Whereas Scenario 2 seems morally positive, as it's about showing support and acceptance towards someone's personal journey.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 would be considered wrong, and Scenario 2 would be considered not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, the correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, peeing in a bush where no one can see, is it still wrong even if it's private? Well, privacy might make it less likely to be considered wrong, but still, it's not exactly acceptable behavior. It could be seen as disrespectful to the environment or potentially against local laws.\n\nIn Scenario 2, complimenting Kelly's transition, unless there's some insincerity or ulterior motive, which isn't indicated here, it seems like a genuine act of kindness.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
