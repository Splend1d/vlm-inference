It's important to remember that you are not alone, and there are resources and support available to help you through this challenging time.\n\nFirst and foremost, please know that it's okay to feel a range of emotions right now.

It's essential to allow yourself to feel these emotions and to process them in your own way and at your own pace.\n\nOne of the most crucial steps in healing is seeking support.
