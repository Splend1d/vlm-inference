The options are conservation, the object concept, formal operations, and the symbolic function. I need to pick which one is a key accomplishment of this stage. Let me think about what each of these terms means in the context of cognitive development.\n\nFirst off, Piaget's preoperational stage is part of his theory of cognitive development. It comes after the sensorimotor stage and before the concrete operational stage. I think the preoperational stage is when kids start using symbols to represent things, like using words and images in their mind. That sounds a lot like the symbolic function. So, option D, the symbolic function, might be relevant.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure. Conservation is something I remember from psychology class; it's the understanding that certain properties of objects remain the same even when their appearance changes. For example, if you pour water from a tall glass into a short, wide one, the amount of water doesn't change, even though the shape of the glass does. But I think conservation is something that develops during the concrete operational stage, not the preoperational stage. So, maybe option A isn't the right choice here.\n\nNext, the object concept. I think this is about understanding that objects continue to exist even when they're not in sight. Like, if you hide a toy under a blanket, a child who has the object concept knows the toy is still there, even if they can't see it. But again, I believe this starts developing during the sensorimotor stage, especially in the later sub-stages. So, perhaps the object concept is more associated with the sensorimotor stage rather than the preoperational stage.\n\nLastly, formal operations. I recall that this is the stage where abstract thinking really comes into play. It's when adolescents and adults can think about possibilities and hypothetical situations. So, this seems way beyond the preoperational stage, which is typically from ages 2 to 7.\n\nGiven all that, it seems like the symbolic function is the most fitting answer for a key accomplishment of the preoperational stage. During this stage, children begin to use symbols, like words and images, to represent their thoughts and experiences. They engage in imaginative play and start to understand that things can be symbolically represented, which is a big deal in their cognitive development.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall some examples from the preoperational stage. For instance, a child might use a block as a phone during play, showing that they can assign meaning to objects beyond their physical properties. That's symbolic thinking in action. Also, they start to draw pictures and use language more complexly.\n\nI don't think conservation is a key feature of this stage because that's more about logical thinking, which comes later in the concrete operational stage. Similarly, the object concept is something that emerges earlier, during the sensorimotor stage.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is D. the symbolic function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
