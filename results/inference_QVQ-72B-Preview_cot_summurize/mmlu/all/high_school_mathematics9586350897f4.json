                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a right triangle. It says that the hypotenuse measures 10 inches, and one angle is 45 degrees. I need to find the area of the triangle in square inches. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, and it's opposite the right angle. The fact that one angle is 45 degrees tells me that it's an isosceles right triangle because in a right triangle, if one angle is 45 degrees, the other non-right angle must also be 45 degrees because the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.\n\nSo, if one angle is 45 degrees and another is 90 degrees, the third must be 45 degrees. That means the two legs are equal in length. That's helpful.\n\nLet me denote the lengths of the legs as \"a.\" Since it's an isosceles right triangle, both legs are \"a\" inches long, and the hypotenuse is 10 inches.\n\nI recall the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the sides of a right triangle: a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, plugging in the known value:\n\na\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = 10\u00b2\n\n2a\u00b2 = 100\n\nNow, I'll solve for a\u00b2:\n\n2a\u00b2 = 100\n\na\u00b2 = 50\n\nSo, a squared equals 50.\n\nNow, the area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height. Since the base and height are both \"a,\" the area is (1/2) * a * a = (1/2)a\u00b2.\n\nFrom above, a\u00b2 = 50, so the area is (1/2) * 50 = 25 square inches.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if there's another way to approach this or if I've missed anything.\n\nAlternatively, I could use trigonometric functions since I know one angle and the hypotenuse.\n\nI know that sin(45\u00b0) = opposite side / hypotenuse.\n\nSo, sin(45\u00b0) = a / 10.\n\nI know that sin(45\u00b0) is approximately 0.7071, so:\n\n0.7071 = a / 10\n\nTherefore, a = 10 * 0.7071 \u2248 7.071 inches.\n\nNow, the area would be (1/2) * a * a = (1/2) * (7.071) * (7.071) \u2248 (1/2) * 50 \u2248 25 square inches.\n\nHmm, that matches my previous result. Good, it's consistent.\n\nAnother way, maybe using the properties of special right triangles. I know that in a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : 1 : \u221a2.\n\nSo, if the hypotenuse is 10 inches, then each leg is 10 / \u221a2 inches.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\na = 10 / \u221a2 \u2248 10 / 1.4142 \u2248 7.071 inches, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the area is (1/2) * a\u00b2 = (1/2) * (10 / \u221a2)\u00b2 = (1/2) * (100 / 2) = (1/2) * 50 = 25 square inches.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently through different methods, and each time I get 25 square inches as the area of the triangle.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10\n\nB. 45\n\nC. 125\n\nD. 25\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 25.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other information or angle I might have missed. The problem states that it's a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 10 inches and one angle of 45 degrees. No other information is given, so I think I've used all the information provided effectively.\n\nAlso, considering the units, since the hypotenuse is in inches, the area should indeed be in square inches, which aligns with the options given.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 25 square inches, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
