An indefinite period of time.\n\nB. Minutes to days, depending on the depth of encoding.\n\nC. About 60 to 90 seconds.\n\nD. Less than 5 seconds.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what sensory memory is and how long it lasts.\n\nI remember that sensory memory is the initial stage of memory where information from our senses is briefly stored. It's like a buffer that holds sensory information for a very short time before it's either ignored or passed on to short-term memory.\n\nNow, specifically for images and sounds, which are visual and auditory sensory memories, what's the duration?\n\nLet me think about visual sensory memory first. I think it's called iconic memory for vision. How long does iconic memory last? I recall that it's very brief, maybe just a fraction of a second to a couple of seconds.\n\nSimilarly, for sounds, there's echoic memory, which is the auditory sensory memory. How long does that last? I think it's a bit longer than iconic memory, maybe up to 3 or 4 seconds.\n\nBut the question is asking for both images and sounds, so probably it's referring to both iconic and echoic memory.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Indefinite period \u2013 that sounds too long for sensory memory. I don't think it's forever.\n\nB. Minutes to days depending on the depth of encoding \u2013 that seems more like short-term or long-term memory durations. Depth of encoding affects how well something is remembered, but sensory memory is more about the initial registration.\n\nC. About 60 to 90 seconds \u2013 that's a full minute to one and a half minutes. That seems too long for sensory memory. I don't think sensory memory lasts that long.\n\nD. Less than 5 seconds \u2013 this seems plausible. Iconic memory is about seconds, and echoic memory can be up to 3 or 4 seconds. So, less than 5 seconds covers both.\n\nWait, but I think echoic memory can last up to about 3-4 seconds, and iconic memory is even shorter, maybe 0.25 to 2 seconds. So, both are within the less than 5 seconds range.\n\nMoreover, sensory memory is known for its very short duration, primarily serving to register information briefly before it's either attended to or discarded.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI recall that sometimes, with very intense or surprising stimuli, sensory memory might last a bit longer, but generally, it's considered to be very brief.\n\nAlso, considering that sensory memory is the first stage of memory processing, and it's meant to decay quickly unless attention is paid to the information, which then transfers it to short-term memory.\n\nTherefore, the statement that images and sounds are maintained in sensory memory for less than 5 seconds seems accurate.\n\nI think the answer is D. Less than 5 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
