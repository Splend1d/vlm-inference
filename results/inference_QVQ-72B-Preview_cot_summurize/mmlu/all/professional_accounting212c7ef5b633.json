                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this auditing question. The objective is to detect the overstatement of sales. I need to understand which path the auditor should follow to trace transactions from a certain source to another to achieve this goal.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an overstatement of sales means. It probably means that the company has recorded more sales than it actually made, either intentionally or unintentionally. The auditor's job is to find such overstatements.\n\nNow, the options are about tracing transactions from different journals to different documents:\n\nA. Sales journal to the shipping documents.\n\nB. Shipping documents to the cash receipts journal.\n\nC. Cash receipts journal to the customer's purchase orders.\n\nD. Customer's purchase orders to the sales journal.\n\nI think tracing involves following transactions from one record to another to verify their accuracy and completeness.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nOption A: Sales journal to shipping documents. If the auditor traces from the sales journal to shipping documents, they are essentially checking that each recorded sale has a corresponding shipping document, which proves that the goods were actually shipped to the customer. This seems like a good way to verify that the sales are real and not overstatement.\n\nBut wait, if the company is overstatement sales, they might have recorded sales without actually shipping anything, so tracing from sales journal to shipping documents would help catch that, right?\n\nOption B: Shipping documents to cash receipts journal. Here, the auditor is checking that for each shipping document, there is a corresponding entry in the cash receipts journal. This seems like ensuring that cash received matches the shipments. But if the company is overstatement sales, they might have recorded fake sales without actual cash receipts. So, tracing from shipping documents to cash receipts journal might help identify if there are shipments without corresponding cash receipts, which could indicate overstatement of sales.\n\nHowever, sometimes companies might have credit sales, so not all shipments would immediately have cash receipts. So, this might not be the most direct way to detect overstatement of sales.\n\nOption C: Cash receipts journal to customer's purchase orders. This seems like checking that each cash receipt has a corresponding customer's purchase order. This might help verify that the cash received was authorized by the customer, but it's not directly related to overstatement of sales. Overstatement of sales could happen without involving cash receipts, especially if it's on credit. So, this might not be the best approach.\n\nOption D: Customer's purchase orders to the sales journal. This seems like checking that each customer's purchase order has a corresponding entry in the sales journal. This would help ensure that all sales are recorded, but it's more about detecting understatements or omissions rather than overstatements.\n\nWait, if the auditor is trying to detect overstatement, they are looking for sales that shouldn't be there or are inflated. Tracing from purchase orders to sales journal might help ensure completeness, but not necessarily overstatement.\n\nLet me think again. If the auditor wants to detect overstatement of sales, they need to verify that the sales recorded actually happened and are not inflated.\n\nTracing from sales journal to shipping documents (Option A) seems promising because it checks that for each sale recorded, there is evidence that goods were shipped. If there is no shipping document for a recorded sale, that could indicate an overstatement.\n\nSimilarly, tracing from shipping documents to cash receipts journal (Option B) could help identify if there are shipments without corresponding cash receipts, which might suggest that the sales were recorded but not actually paid for, possibly indicating overstatement.\n\nHowever, considering that companies often have credit sales, there might be legitimate reasons for shipments without immediate cash receipts. So, this might not be as direct as tracing from sales journal to shipping documents.\n\nOption C seems less relevant for detecting overstatement of sales, as it's more about verifying that cash receipts are authorized by customer purchase orders, which doesn't directly address whether the sales are overstatement.\n\nOption D, tracing from customer purchase orders to sales journal, is more about ensuring that all sales are recorded (completeness), not that the sales are not overstatement.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option A: Sales journal to shipping documents. This directly ties the recorded sales to evidence that the goods were actually shipped, which is a strong indicator that the sale actually occurred.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other factors or if this is the most effective approach. For example, the auditor might also look at invoices or other supporting documents, but based on the options provided, tracing from sales journal to shipping documents seems the most straightforward way to detect overstatement of sales.\n\nSo, my answer is Option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
