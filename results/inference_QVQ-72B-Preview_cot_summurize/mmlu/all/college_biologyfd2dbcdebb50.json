                    "text": "Let's see. So, I have this question about plant hybrids and chromosome numbers. It says that hybrids between some related plant species are sterile because they have different chromosome numbers. But sometimes, the chromosome number in these hybrid plants doubles spontaneously. And the question is asking what best describes the descendants of these plants with the double chromosome number.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what happens when chromosome numbers double in these hybrids. I remember that in biology, chromosome number is crucial for reproduction. Normally, plants have a certain number of chromosomes, and when they hybridize with another species with a different chromosome number, the resulting offspring might have an uneven number of chromosomes, which can lead to sterility because the genes can't pair up correctly during meiosis.\n\nBut if the chromosome number doubles in such a hybrid, that means each set of chromosomes is duplicated. So, instead of having, say, one set from one parent and one set from another parent, which might not match up well, doubling would give the plant two sets from each parent, making it tetraploid.\n\nWait, yes, that's polyploidy. Polyploidy is when an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes. In plants, this is quite common and can lead to new species formation.\n\nSo, in this case, if a hybrid plant that had, let's say, 2n1 and 2n2 chromosomes (from the two parents) doubles its chromosome number, it would have 4n1 and 4n2. This could potentially resolve the pairing issues during meiosis because now there are matching pairs of chromosomes.\n\nOption A says that the plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants. But if the doubling allows the chromosomes to pair correctly, maybe that's not the case.\n\nOption B mentions selective advantage because of increased ability to introgress. Introgression is when genes from one species are introduced into another through hybridization. While polyploidy can sometimes facilitate introgression, I'm not sure if that's the primary effect here.\n\nOption C says the descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species. But if they have double the chromosome number, they might not be able to backcross easily because of differences in chromosome numbers.\n\nOption D says the descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally. This seems plausible if the doubling allows for matching pairs of chromosomes during meiosis.\n\nLet me think about this again. If a hybrid has chromosomes from two different species, and their numbers don't match, it causes problems in meiosis. But if the entire set is duplicated, maybe it creates a situation where the chromosomes can pair up properly, at least among themselves.\n\nFor example, if one parent has 6 chromosomes (3 pairs), and the other has 8 (4 pairs), the hybrid would have 7 chromosomes (which is odd, so meiosis is messy). But if the chromosome number doubles to 14, perhaps it's now possible to have matching pairs, or at least the plant can undergo meiosis more successfully.\n\nIn polyploidy, especially autopolyploidy, where the extra sets are from the same species, it can lead to sterile offspring if the species is self-incompatible or if there are issues with meiosis. But in allopolyploidy, where the extra sets are from different species, it can lead to fertile hybrids.\n\nGiven that the parents are different species, it's likely allopolyploidy. So, the doubled chromosome number would make the plant allopolyploid, which could be fertile.\n\nTherefore, option D seems the most accurate: the descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n\nBut let me double-check. Could they backcross with the parental species? Probably not, because their chromosome numbers wouldn't match. For example, if one parent is diploid and the hybrid is tetraploid, crossing them back would result in triploid offspring, which are often sterile.\n\nSo, option C is less likely.\n\nOption B, about introgression, might be a possibility, but I think the primary benefit here is restoring the ability to undergo meiosis properly, not necessarily introgressing genes.\n\nOption A is definitely incorrect because the question states that the chromosome number doubles spontaneously, which could resolve the sterility issue.\n\nSo, my best answer is option D: the descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
