                    "text": "So I'm looking at these two statements about groups in abstract algebra. I need to determine which ones are true or false. Let's take them one at a time.\n\nFirst statement: In a group, (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2}.\n\nHmm, I remember that in group theory, the order of elements matters a lot because groups aren't necessarily commutative. That is, ab isn't always equal to ba.\n\nLet me think about the properties of exponents in groups. I know that for any element a in a group, (a^{-1})^n = (a^n)^{-1}, but here we have two elements a and b.\n\nWait, actually, I think there's a general formula for (ab)^n in a group. Let me recall: in a general group, (ab)^n is not equal to a^n b^n unless the group is abelian, meaning that ab = ba.\n\nBut in this case, the exponent is -2, which is negative. Maybe the negative exponent changes things.\n\nLet me compute (ab)^{-2} directly. Since (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1}, then (ab)^{-2} = [(ab)^{-1}]^2 = (b^{-1} a^{-1})(b^{-1} a^{-1}).\n\nNow, let's multiply these together: (b^{-1} a^{-1})(b^{-1} a^{-1}) = b^{-1} (a^{-1} b^{-1}) a^{-1}.\n\nBut a^{-1} b^{-1} is not necessarily equal to b^{-1} a^{-1} unless the group is abelian. Wait, actually, in general groups, a^{-1} b^{-1} is not equal to b^{-1} a^{-1}.\n\nBut let's see: b^{-1} (a^{-1} b^{-1}) a^{-1}. Is this equal to b^{-2} a^{-2}?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should try expanding b^{-2} a^{-2} as well.\n\nb^{-2} a^{-2} = (b^{-1})^2 a^{-2} = b^{-1} b^{-1} a^{-2}.\n\nComparing this to b^{-1} (a^{-1} b^{-1}) a^{-1}, it's not immediately clear if they're equal.\n\nMaybe I should consider specific examples to test this.\n\nLet's suppose that a and b commute, i.e., ab = ba. Then, (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1} = a^{-1} b^{-1}, and (ab)^{-2} = (a^{-1} b^{-1})^2 = a^{-1} b^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1}.\n\nOn the other hand, b^{-2} a^{-2} = b^{-1} b^{-1} a^{-1} a^{-1}.\n\nSince a and b commute, a^{-1} and b^{-1} also commute, so (ab)^{-2} = a^{-1} b^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1} = a^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1} b^{-1} = a^{-2} b^{-2}, which is not the same as b^{-2} a^{-2} unless a and b commute with each other, which they do in this case. Wait, but a and b commuting implies a^{-1} and b^{-1} commute, but the expression is different.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. If a and b commute, then a^{-1} and b^{-1} also commute because (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1} = a^{-1} b^{-1} if a and b commute.\n\nSo, in that case, (ab)^{-2} = a^{-1} b^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1} = a^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1} b^{-1} = a^{-2} b^{-2}, which is not b^{-2} a^{-2} unless the group is abelian.\n\nWait, but the statement says (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2} a^{-2}, which seems to be different from what I just got.\n\nMaybe I need to consider non-abelian groups to test this.\n\nLet me try a specific example in a non-abelian group, like the symmetric group S3.\n\nIn S3, let's take a = (1 2), b = (2 3).\n\nThen, ab = (1 2)(2 3) = (1 2 3).\n\nNow, (ab)^{-1} = (1 2 3)^{-1} = (1 3 2), and (ab)^{-2} = (ab)^{-1} * (ab)^{-1} = (1 3 2)(1 3 2) = (1 2)(2 3)(1 2)(2 3).\n\nWait, but (ab)^{-2} = [(ab)^{-1}]^2 = (b^{-1} a^{-1})(b^{-1} a^{-1}).\n\nGiven that a = (1 2), a^{-1} = (1 2), and b = (2 3), b^{-1} = (2 3).\n\nSo, (ab)^{-2} = (b^{-1} a^{-1})(b^{-1} a^{-1}) = (2 3)(1 2)(2 3)(1 2).\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, (2 3)(1 2) = (1 2 3).\n\nThen, (1 2 3)(2 3) = (1 3 2).\n\nSo, (ab)^{-2} = (1 3 2).\n\nNow, b^{-2} a^{-2} = (2 3)^2 (1 2)^2 = (2 3)(2 3)(1 2)(1 2) = (2)(1) = identity.\n\nWait, but (2 3)^2 = (2 3)(2 3) = identity, and (1 2)^2 = (1 2)(1 2) = identity, so b^{-2} a^{-2} = identity.\n\nBut (ab)^{-2} = (1 3 2), which is not the identity.\n\nTherefore, in this case, (ab)^{-2} \u2260 b^{-2} a^{-2}.\n\nSo, statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, statement 2: In a group, (ab)^n = a^n b^n.\n\nI know that in general groups, this is not true unless the group is abelian.\n\nIn abelian groups, ab = ba, so (ab)^n = a^n b^n.\n\nBut in non-abelian groups, this doesn't hold.\n\nFor example, in S3, take a = (1 2), b = (2 3).\n\nThen, ab = (1 2 3), and (ab)^2 = (1 2 3)(1 2 3) = (1 3 2).\n\nOn the other hand, a^2 = (1 2)(1 2) = identity, and b^2 = (2 3)(2 3) = identity, so a^2 b^2 = identity.\n\nThus, (ab)^2 \u2260 a^2 b^2.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is also false.\n\nWait, but maybe there are specific cases where it holds, but in general, it's not true.\n\nSo, both statements are false.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nI know that in non-abelian groups, (ab)^n \u2260 a^n b^n in general.\n\nAnd in the case of negative exponents, as we saw in statement 1, it's also not generally true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. False, False.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any groups where these statements hold.\n\nFor statement 1, in abelian groups, yes, because a and b commute, so (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2} a^{-2}.\n\nBut since the question is about general groups, and it's not specified that the group is abelian, we can't assume that.\n\nSimilarly, for statement 2, in abelian groups, (ab)^n = a^n b^n, but again, not in general groups.\n\nTherefore, both statements are false in the context of general groups.\n\nSo, the answer is B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
