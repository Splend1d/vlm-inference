                    "text": "Okay, I need to construct a truth table for the propositions C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D, and then determine their logical relationship. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the logical operators involved:\n\n- \u2283 represents material implication, which is \"if...then.\"\n\n- \u2228 is the disjunction, meaning \"or.\"\n\n- \u00b7 is the conjunction, meaning \"and.\"\n\n- ~ is the negation, meaning \"not.\"\n\nSo, the first proposition is C \u2283 (D \u2228 C), which means \"if C, then D or C.\" The second proposition is C \u00b7 ~D, which means \"C and not D.\"\n\nTo build the truth table, I need to consider all possible truth values for C and D and then evaluate both propositions for each combination.\n\nLet's list all possible truth values for C and D:\n\n- C can be either True (T) or False (F).\n\n- D can be either True (T) or False (F).\n\nSo, there are four possible combinations:\n\n1. C = T, D = T\n\n2. C = T, D = F\n\n3. C = F, D = T\n\n4. C = F, D = F\n\nNow, let's evaluate each proposition for these combinations.\n\nStarting with C \u2283 (D \u2228 C):\n\nFor each row:\n\n- First, evaluate D \u2228 C.\n\n- Then, evaluate C \u2283 (result from above).\n\nSimilarly, for C \u00b7 ~D:\n\n- First, evaluate ~D.\n\n- Then, evaluate C \u00b7 (result from above).\n\nLet's compute step by step.\n\nRow 1: C = T, D = T\n\n- D \u2228 C = T \u2228 T = T\n\n- C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = T \u2283 T = T\n\n- ~D = ~T = F\n\n- C \u00b7 ~D = T \u00b7 F = F\n\nSo, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is T, and C \u00b7 ~D is F.\n\nRow 2: C = T, D = F\n\n- D \u2228 C = F \u2228 T = T\n\n- C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = T \u2283 T = T\n\n- ~D = ~F = T\n\n- C \u00b7 ~D = T \u00b7 T = T\n\nSo, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is T, and C \u00b7 ~D is T.\n\nRow 3: C = F, D = T\n\n- D \u2228 C = T \u2228 F = T\n\n- C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = F \u2283 T = T\n\n- ~D = ~T = F\n\n- C \u00b7 ~D = F \u00b7 F = F\n\nSo, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is T, and C \u00b7 ~D is F.\n\nRow 4: C = F, D = F\n\n- D \u2228 C = F \u2228 F = F\n\n- C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = F \u2283 F = T\n\n- ~D = ~F = T\n\n- C \u00b7 ~D = F \u00b7 T = F\n\nSo, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is T, and C \u00b7 ~D is F.\n\nNow, let's tabulate this:\n\n| C | D | D \u2228 C | C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) | ~D | C \u00b7 ~D |\n|---|---|-------|-------------|----|--------|\n| T | T |   T   |      T      |  F |    F   |\n| T | F |   T   |      T      |  T |    T   |\n| F | T |   T   |      T      |  F |    F   |\n| F | F |   F   |      T      |  T |    F   |\n\nNow, looking at the columns for C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D:\n\n- C \u2283 (D \u2228 C): T, T, T, T\n\n- C \u00b7 ~D: F, T, F, F\n\nSo, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is always true, which means it's a tautology.\n\nOn the other hand, C \u00b7 ~D has both true and false values, so it's contingent.\n\nNow, to determine the logical relationship between these two propositions:\n\nA. Logically equivalent: both have identical truth values in all rows.\n\nFrom the table, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is always T, while C \u00b7 ~D is not always T, so they are not logically equivalent.\n\nB. Contradictory: their truth values are always opposite.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = T, C \u00b7 ~D = F \u2192 same\n\n- Row 2: C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = T, C \u00b7 ~D = T \u2192 same\n\n- Row 3: C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = T, C \u00b7 ~D = F \u2192 same\n\n- Row 4: C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = T, C \u00b7 ~D = F \u2192 same\n\nWait, in Row 2, both are T, which would not be contradictory. So, they are not contradictory.\n\nC. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\nConsistent means there is at least one row where both propositions are true.\n\nLooking at the table, in Row 2:\n\n- C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) = T\n\n- C \u00b7 ~D = T\n\nSo, there is at least one row where both are true, which means they are consistent.\n\nD. Inconsistent.\n\nInconsistent means there is no row where both propositions are true, but in this case, there is at least one row where both are true, so they are not inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nLogically equivalent: no, because their truth values don't match in all rows.\n\nContradictory: no, because in some rows their truth values are the same.\n\nConsistent: yes, because there is at least one row where both are true.\n\nInconsistent: no, since consistent is the opposite of inconsistent.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if there's any further analysis needed.\n\nAlternatively, we could check if the biconditional between the two propositions is a tautology (for logical equivalence) or always false (for contradiction).\n\nLet's compute C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) \u2261 C \u00b7 ~D.\n\nLooking at the truth values:\n\n- Row 1: T \u2261 F \u2192 F\n\n- Row 2: T \u2261 T \u2192 T\n\n- Row 3: T \u2261 F \u2192 F\n\n- Row 4: T \u2261 F \u2192 F\n\nSo, the biconditional is T only in Row 2 and F in Rows 1,3,4.\n\nTherefore, it's not a tautology, nor is it always false.\n\nHence, they are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory.\n\nAdditionally, since there is at least one row where both are true, they are consistent.\n\nThus, the answer is C: neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
