                    "text": "So I need to find the LCM of 24 and 36. I remember that LCM stands for Least Common Multiple, which is the smallest number that both 24 and 36 can divide into without leaving a remainder. There are a few ways to find the LCM, but I think I'll use the prime factorization method because it seems straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to find the prime factors of each number.\n\nLet's start with 24.\n\n24 divided by 2 is 12, so 2 is a prime factor.\n\n12 divided by 2 is 6.\n\n6 divided by 2 is 3.\n\nSo, 24 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3.\n\nWait, let me count the twos. 2 times 2 is 4, times 2 is 8, times 3 is 24. So, yes, three twos and one three.\n\nNow, 36.\n\n36 divided by 2 is 18.\n\n18 divided by 2 is 9.\n\n9 divided by 3 is 3.\n\nSo, 36 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: 2 times 2 is 4, times 3 is 12, times 3 is 36. Yes, two twos and two threes.\n\nSo, for 24: 2^3 \u00d7 3^1\n\nFor 36: 2^2 \u00d7 3^2\n\nNow, to find the LCM, I need to take the highest power of each prime number from both factorizations.\n\nSo, for 2, the higher power is 2^3 (from 24).\n\nFor 3, the higher power is 3^2 (from 36).\n\nTherefore, LCM = 2^3 \u00d7 3^2 = 8 \u00d7 9 = 72.\n\nLet me just double-check that.\n\nI know that the LCM of two numbers can also be found using the formula:\n\nLCM(a, b) = (a \u00d7 b) / GCD(a, b)\n\nWhere GCD is the Greatest Common Divisor.\n\nMaybe I can use this formula to verify my answer.\n\nFirst, find GCD of 24 and 36.\n\nI know that GCD(24, 36) is 12, because 12 is the largest number that divides both 24 and 36 without a remainder.\n\nThen, LCM(24, 36) = (24 \u00d7 36) / 12\n\n24 \u00d7 36 = 864\n\n864 / 12 = 72\n\nYes, that matches my previous result.\n\nSo, the LCM is 72.\n\nLet me just make sure by checking if 72 is divisible by both 24 and 36.\n\n72 divided by 24 is 3, which is a whole number.\n\n72 divided by 36 is 2, which is also a whole number.\n\nSo, it works.\n\nIs there a smaller number that is also divisible by both 24 and 36?\n\nWell, 36 times 2 is 72, and 24 times 3 is 72, so no, 36 doesn't divide into 48 or 60, which are multiples of 24, so 72 seems to be the smallest.\n\nAlternatively, let's see what the options are.\n\nOption A is 96.\n\nOption B is 144.\n\nOption C is 72.\n\nOption D is 120.\n\nSo, among these, 72 is the smallest, and it fits.\n\nWait, but 96 is larger than 72, and 144 is even larger, so they can't be smaller than 72, unless there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if 96 is divisible by both 24 and 36.\n\n24 divides into 96: 96 / 24 = 4, yes.\n\n36 divides into 96: 96 / 36 = 2.666..., which is not a whole number.\n\nSo, 96 is not divisible by 36.\n\nTherefore, 96 is not a common multiple.\n\nSimilarly, 144.\n\n24 divides into 144: 144 / 24 = 6.\n\n36 divides into 144: 144 / 36 = 4.\n\nSo, 144 is also a common multiple, but it's larger than 72.\n\nBut the LCM is the smallest, so 72 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check 120.\n\n24 divides into 120: 120 / 24 = 5.\n\n36 divides into 120: 120 / 36 = 3.333..., which is not a whole number.\n\nSo, 120 is not a common multiple.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, 72 is the correct LCM of 24 and 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
