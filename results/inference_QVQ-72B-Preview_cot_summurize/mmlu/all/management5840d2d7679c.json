From what I can gather, it's some sort of group or team that focuses on improving the quality of work in an organization. But I want to make sure I get it right, so let's see.\n\nOption A says it's to bring together managers and workers to find improvements. That sounds plausible. Maybe they meet regularly to discuss ways to enhance processes or products.\n\nOption B mentions bringing them together to discuss output. Output could refer to the quantity of work produced, right? So, perhaps it's about reviewing production levels or efficiency.\n\nOption C suggests reviewing the quality of work. That seems straightforward. Maybe they assess the current quality standards and look for areas that need improvement.\n\nOption D is about reviewing targets. This could involve setting and tracking goals related to quality, production, or other metrics.\n\nHmm, all of these seem related in some way, but I need to pinpoint which one is the primary purpose of a quality circle.\n\nLet me think back to what I know about quality circles. I recall that they were popularized in the 1970s and 1980s, especially in Japan, as a way to involve employees at all levels in the continuous improvement of quality.\n\nSo, they are typically small groups of workers, sometimes including supervisors and managers, who voluntarily meet regularly to identify and solve problems related to quality.\n\nGiven that, option A seems particularly relevant because it's about finding improvements, which aligns with solving problems and enhancing quality.\n\nOption B, discussing output, might be part of it, but output can sometimes focus more on quantity than quality. While quality circles might touch on output, their main emphasis is on quality improvement.\n\nOption C, reviewing quality of work, is certainly a key aspect. However, I think it's more than just reviewing; it's about continuously improving quality.\n\nOption D, reviewing targets, could be related to quality goals, but again, it seems a bit too broad. Quality circles are more specifically about the quality of products or services, not necessarily other types of targets.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's a combination of these options. Perhaps quality circles involve discussing output in the context of quality improvement, and reviewing targets related to quality.\n\nBut the question is asking for the primary purpose, and I need to choose one option.\n\nLet me consider the definition again. A quality circle is a group of employees who meet regularly to identify and solve problems related to quality.\n\nSo, their main objective is to find ways to improve quality through collaborative problem-solving.\n\nTherefore, option A, bringing together managers and workers to find improvements, seems to capture the essence of this purpose.\n\nOption C is close, but it's more about reviewing quality rather than actively finding improvements.\n\nOptions B and D seem somewhat related but not directly on point with the primary purpose of quality circles.\n\nAdditionally, I remember that quality circles encourage employee participation and empowerment, allowing workers to have a say in how to improve their work processes and the quality of their outputs.\n\nThis further supports the idea that the main purpose is to find improvements through collaborative efforts between managers and workers.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
