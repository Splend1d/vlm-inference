                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about monitoring wildlife populations, specifically terns, which are seabirds. The study found that the number of calls heard per minute can be used to estimate the number of nesting sites. It says that more calls happen when there are more birds, which makes sense. And it mentions that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what this means. The number of calls is related to the number of nests, and they're saying that 71% of the variation in nest abundance is explained by the number of calls. This sounds like a correlation or a regression analysis in statistics.\n\nI remember that in statistics, when we talk about the variation explained by a variable, we often refer to the coefficient of determination, which is denoted as R-squared (R\u00b2). R-squared tells us the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.\n\nIn this case, the number of calls is the independent variable, and the abundance of nests is the dependent variable. So, if the number of calls explains 71% of the variation in nest abundance, that would mean R\u00b2 = 0.71.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the correlation coefficient, which is denoted as r. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The square of the correlation coefficient, r\u00b2, is the coefficient of determination, R\u00b2.\n\nSo, if R\u00b2 is 0.71, then r is the square root of 0.71.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, r = sqrt(0.71)\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.71):\n\nWell, sqrt(0.64) = 0.8, and sqrt(0.81) = 0.9. So, sqrt(0.71) should be between 0.8 and 0.9.\n\nA quick calculation: 0.84 squared is 0.7056, which is very close to 0.71.\n\nActually, 0.84^2 = 0.7056\n\nAnd 0.85^2 = 0.7225\n\nSo, 0.84 is approximately sqrt(0.71)\n\nTherefore, the correlation coefficient r is approximately 0.84.\n\nNow, the question is, is the correlation positive or negative? The options are -0.71, 0.71, -0.84, and 0.84.\n\nThe problem states that more calls happen when there are more birds. So, as the number of calls increases, the number of nests increases as well. That suggests a positive correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests.\n\nTherefore, the correlation coefficient should be positive.\n\nSo, the correct statement should be that the correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The correlation coefficient is -0.71.\n\nB. The correlation coefficient is 0.71.\n\nC. The correlation coefficient is -0.84.\n\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n\nGiven that r is approximately 0.84 and the relationship is positive, the correct choice should be D. 0.84.\n\nWait a minute, but option B is 0.71. Is that possible?\n\nNo, because 0.71 is R-squared, not r. The correlation coefficient is the square root of R-squared, which is approximately 0.84.\n\nSo, option D is correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nR-squared = (correlation coefficient)^2\n\nGiven R-squared = 0.71\n\nTherefore, correlation coefficient r = sqrt(0.71) \u2248 0.84\n\nAnd since the relationship is positive, r is positive.\n\nHence, the correct statement is D. The correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
