Historical, B. Analytical, C. Command, D. Sociological. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these schools of thought believes that law should help achieve sociological goals.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what jurisprudence is. Jurisprudence is the study of law and legal theory, right? So, different schools of jurisprudence have different views on what law is and what its purpose should be.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is Historical. I think historical jurisprudence focuses on how laws have developed over time, maybe looking at the evolution of legal systems based on cultural, political, and social changes. But does it specifically say that law should achieve sociological goals? Not sure. Maybe it emphasizes understanding law in its historical context, but I don't think it directly\u4e3b\u5f20 that law should be a tool for sociological advancement.\n\nOption B is Analytical. Analytical jurisprudence, I believe, is concerned with the logical analysis of legal concepts and principles. It tries to clarify what law is by examining its nature and structure. This seems more about understanding and defining law rather than using it as a tool for achieving sociological goals.\n\nOption C is Command. The command school of jurisprudence, I think, is associated with legal positivism and views law as commands issued by those in power that are backed by sanctions. So, law is seen as a set of rules imposed by the sovereign. This doesn't sound like it emphasizes using law to achieve sociological goals. Instead, it's more about the authority and enforcement of laws.\n\nOption D is Sociological. This one seems the most straightforward. The sociological school of jurisprudence likely views law as a social institution that serves to maintain social order and promote social progress. So, it probably does assert that law should be used to achieve and advance sociological goals.\n\nLet me double-check. Sociological jurisprudence is often associated with the idea that law should be studied in its social context and should be used to address social problems and further social objectives. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the correct answer is D. Sociological.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options might also fit somehow. For example, could the historical school argue that law should advance sociological goals based on historical perspectives? Maybe in some cases, but I don't think that's its primary focus. Historical jurisprudence is more about understanding law's development over time rather than using it as an instrument for social change.\n\nAnalytical jurisprudence is more about clarity and definition, not about the purposes or goals law should serve. And the command school is about the authoritative nature of law and compliance through fear of sanctions, which isn't directly related to achieving sociological goals.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Sociological.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Sociological}} \\]"
