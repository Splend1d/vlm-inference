Capillaries.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my respiratory system anatomy, but let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the respiratory system is responsible for getting oxygen into our bodies and removing carbon dioxide. The lungs are a crucial part of this system, and they have these little air sacs called alveoli. I think that's where the gas exchange happens. But let me make sure.\n\nAlveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs, and they're surrounded by capillaries, which are small blood vessels. So, when we breathe in, air fills these alveoli, and oxygen from the air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli into the capillaries, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli to be exhaled out. That sounds like the gas exchange process. So, alveoli seem to be the place where this happens.\n\nNow, bronchi and bronchioles are parts of the respiratory tract that lead air into the lungs. Bronchi are larger tubes that branch into smaller bronchioles, which eventually lead to the alveoli. So, they're more about conducting air to and from the alveoli, not directly involved in gas exchange.\n\nCapillaries are indeed involved in gas exchange, but they're not the primary site where it happens. They surround the alveoli and facilitate the diffusion of gases between the air and the blood. So, while they're essential for gas exchange, they aren't the structures where the exchange primarily occurs.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to double-check that. In the options given, capillaries are listed, and I know that capillaries are where exchange of substances happens in general, like in the circulatory system. But in the context of the lungs, gas exchange specifically refers to the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the blood.\n\nBut is the gas exchange happening at the level of alveoli or capillaries? Let me think again. The alveoli are where the air is in direct contact with the blood through the alveolar membrane, and that's where diffusion occurs. So, alveoli are the sites of gas exchange, and capillaries are the blood vessels that bring the blood in close proximity for that exchange to happen.\n\nBronchi and bronchioles, as I said earlier, are more about transporting air to and from the alveoli. They don't have the structure to facilitate gas exchange; their walls aren't as thin or as suited for diffusion as those of the alveoli.\n\nSo, based on this, I would say that alveoli are the structures that allow gas exchange in the lungs. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. Alveoli.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that capillaries could be considered the primary site of gas exchange in the lungs. In the circulatory system, capillaries are where exchanges occur between blood and tissues, but in the lungs, it's specifically the alveolar capillary membrane that facilitates gas exchange. So, perhaps it's a bit of both, but the alveoli are the primary structures involved.\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice. The answer is A. Alveoli.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Alveoli}} \\]"
