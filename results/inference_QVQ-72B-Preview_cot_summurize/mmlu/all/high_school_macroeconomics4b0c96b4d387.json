                    "text": "Let's see. So, the government of country Z is increasing spending by $12 million and also increasing taxes by the same amount, $12 million. And I need to figure out what the overall impact of these actions will be on the real GDP of the country. The options are:\n\nA. Real GDP will increase by $6 million.\n\nB. Real GDP will decrease by $6 million.\n\nC. Real GDP will remain unchanged.\n\nD. Real GDP will increase by $12 million.\n\nHmm, at first glance, it might seem like these actions cancel each other out, right? The government spends an extra $12 million and takes $12 million more in taxes. So, maybe the real GDP stays the same because the spending and the taxes are equal. But I think there's more to it than that.\n\nLet me recall some basic macroeconomics here. Government spending is one component of aggregate demand, and taxes affect consumer spending and saving. When the government spends more, it can increase aggregate demand, which can lead to higher GDP. But when it increases taxes, that reduces disposable income for households, which in turn can lead to decreased consumer spending, potentially offsetting the increase in government spending.\n\nHowever, the multiplier effect might come into play here. The multiplier effect suggests that an initial increase in spending can lead to a larger increase in GDP because the money circulates through the economy multiple times. Similarly, an increase in taxes can have a negative multiplier effect.\n\nBut in this case, both increases are happening simultaneously. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the government increases spending by $12 million. This directly adds $12 million to aggregate demand. Assuming the economy is not at full employment, this should lead to an increase in real GDP by some multiple of $12 million, depending on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the multiplier formula, which is 1 / (1 - MPC).\n\nNext, the government increases taxes by $12 million. This reduces disposable income by $12 million, leading to a decrease in consumer spending by $12 million multiplied by the MPC. So, the decrease in aggregate demand due to higher taxes would be MPC times $12 million.\n\nNow, to find the net effect on real GDP, I need to consider both the increase from government spending and the decrease from reduced consumer spending due to higher taxes.\n\nLet's denote the MPC as 'c'. Then, the multiplier for government spending is 1 / (1 - c), and the multiplier for taxes is -c / (1 - c).\n\nSo, the net change in real GDP would be:\n\n\u0394GDP = (1 / (1 - c)) * $12 million + (-c / (1 - c)) * $12 million\n\nLet's factor out $12 million:\n\n\u0394GDP = $12 million * [(1 / (1 - c)) - (c / (1 - c))]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 / (1 - c) - c / (1 - c) = (1 - c) / (1 - c) = 1\n\nSo, \u0394GDP = $12 million * 1 = $12 million\n\nWait a minute, this suggests that the net effect is an increase in real GDP by $12 million, which would be option D. But that seems counterintuitive because we're also increasing taxes by $12 million, which should have a contractionary effect.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something here. Let's think about this differently.\n\nSuppose the MPC is, say, 0.8. Then, the multiplier for government spending is 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5. So, an increase in government spending of $12 million would initially increase GDP by $12 million * 5 = $60 million.\n\nBut then, increasing taxes by $12 million reduces disposable income by $12 million, leading to a decrease in consumer spending by $12 million * 0.8 = $9.6 million. The multiplier effect for taxes is also 1 / (1 - c) = 5, so the total decrease in GDP due to higher taxes would be $9.6 million * 5 = $48 million.\n\nNow, net change in GDP would be $60 million - $48 million = $12 million increase. So, in this case, the net effect is still a $12 million increase in GDP.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my initial thought that the increase in spending and the increase in taxes might cancel each other out. Clearly, in this example, they don't cancel out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to look at this. Maybe the net effect is zero because the government is spending $12 million and taxing $12 million, so it's like moving money around within the economy.\n\nBut according to the multiplier analysis, there's a net positive effect. So, perhaps the answer is D, real GDP will increase by $12 million.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase in government spending leads to an increase in GDP, but the increase in taxes leads to a decrease, and the net effect is smaller, say $6 million, which would be option A.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me see if I can find a formula or a rule that applies to this situation.\n\nI recall that in Keynesian economics, the government spending multiplier is larger in magnitude than the tax multiplier. Specifically, the government spending multiplier is 1 / (1 - MPC), and the tax multiplier is -MPC / (1 - MPC).\n\nSo, if we have both an increase in government spending and an increase in taxes, the net effect on GDP would be:\n\n\u0394GDP = (increase in government spending) * (1 / (1 - MPC)) + (increase in taxes) * (-MPC / (1 - MPC))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u0394GDP = $12 million * (1 / (1 - c)) + $12 million * (-c / (1 - c))\n\nFactor out $12 million and the denominator:\n\n\u0394GDP = $12 million * [1 - c] / (1 - c) = $12 million * 1 = $12 million\n\nAgain, this suggests that the net effect is an increase in GDP by $12 million.\n\nBut this seems too straightforward. Is there something I'm missing here? Maybe the impact on interest rates or other parts of the economy.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the crowding-out effect. If the government increases spending, it might lead to higher interest rates, which could reduce investment spending and partially offset the increase in GDP.\n\nHowever, in the simple Keynesian cross model, we often ignore crowding out for simplicity. Maybe in this problem, we're supposed to assume that crowding out doesn't occur, and thus the net effect is indeed an increase in GDP by $12 million.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the increase in taxes reduces consumption, which in turn reduces GDP, but the government spending increases GDP, and the net effect is zero.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier calculation, it's not zero.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose the MPC is 0.8 again.\n\nIncrease in government spending by $12 million leads to an initial increase in GDP of $12 million * 5 = $60 million.\n\nIncrease in taxes by $12 million reduces consumption by $12 million * 0.8 = $9.6 million.\n\nThis $9.6 million reduction in consumption then has a multiplied effect: $9.6 million * 5 = $48 million decrease in GDP.\n\nNet change: $60 million - $48 million = $12 million increase in GDP.\n\nAgain, I get $12 million increase.\n\nBut this seems too good to be true. The government spends $12 million and taxes $12 million, and GDP increases by $12 million. It's like getting a free lunch.\n\nIn reality, increasing taxes might not have as strong an effect as increasing government spending, but I feel like there's something amiss here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the difference between changes in government spending and changes in taxes in terms of their impact on aggregate demand.\n\nI think the key here is that the multiplier for government spending is larger than the multiplier for taxes, so even if the government spends and taxes the same amount, the net effect is still an increase in GDP.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D, real GDP will increase by $12 million.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
