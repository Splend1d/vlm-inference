                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I bared my entire naked body at the nudist beach.\" So, someone went to a nudist beach and was naked. Nudist beaches are places where being naked is allowed and even expected. It's a place where people can enjoy nature without clothes, and it's usually in private or designated areas where it's legal to be nude. So, if someone is at a nudist beach, being naked there isn't against the law, and it's considered acceptable behavior in that context. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems to be \"not wrong\" because it's in a designated area where nudity is permitted.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I don't want to see my baby being teased, so I'll have his ears fixed.\" This one is a bit more complex. It sounds like the parent is considering a cosmetic procedure to change the appearance of their baby's ears to prevent teasing. The intention is to protect the child from being teased by peers, maybe because the ears stick out or look different in some way.\n\nNow, morally, intentions are important. The parent wants to prevent their child from being bullied or teased, which is a noble and loving intention. However, there might be some ethical considerations here. For one, the child is very young and can't consent to the procedure. Also, is the procedure necessary for the child's health or is it purely cosmetic?\n\nIn the US, cosmetic surgeries on children are generally reserved for cases where there's a medical need or significant psychological benefit. If the procedure is safe and minimally invasive, and if it can prevent future emotional distress, some might consider it acceptable. On the other hand, others might argue that it's better to teach the child to cope with teasing or to address the behavior of the teasers rather than changing the child's appearance.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think this decision would be seen as \"not wrong.\" The parent is trying to prevent harm to their child, and the procedure is likely to be safe and beneficial in the long run. It's important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and actual medical decisions should be made with careful consideration and possibly consulting with professionals.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong (being naked at a nudist beach is acceptable).\n\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong (parent is acting with good intentions to prevent potential teasing).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario 1, is there any chance that being naked at a nudist beach could be considered wrong? Well, if the beach isn't actually a designated nudist area, or if there are children present, or if someone feels uncomfortable, it might be seen as inappropriate. But the scenario specifies it's a nudist beach, so I assume it's an accepted place for nudity.\n\nIn scenario 2, could there be any moral issues with the parent's decision? Maybe some people would argue that it's better to accept differences and teach the child to be confident rather than changing their appearance. However, if the procedure is safe and can prevent years of potential bullying, it seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided and considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios seem to be \"not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
