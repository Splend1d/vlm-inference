The options are:\n\nA. Review the service auditor\u2019s report on controls placed in operation.\n\nB. Review the service auditor\u2019s report and outline the accounting system in a memo to the working papers.\n\nC. Audit the service organization\u2019s controls, assess risk, and prepare the audit plan.\n\nD. Audit the service organization\u2019s controls to test the work of the service auditor.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the role of a service organization in this context. A service organization is a company that performs services for other entities, like processing transactions or storing data. When an audit client uses a service organization, the auditor needs to consider how the service organization's controls affect the client's financial statements.\n\nNow, as a user auditor, my primary responsibility is to audit the client's financial statements. But since the client relies on a service organization for some processes, I need to take into account the controls at the service organization that impact the client's financial reporting.\n\nOption A suggests reviewing the service auditor\u2019s report on controls placed in operation. This sounds reasonable because if the service organization has been audited by another auditor, their report can provide valuable information about the effectiveness of the controls at the service organization. This could help me understand the risks associated with the client's use of the service organization.\n\nOption B proposes reviewing the service auditor\u2019s report and outlining the accounting system in a memo to the working papers. This seems similar to option A, but with an additional step of documenting the accounting system. While documenting the accounting system is important for understanding the client's internal controls, it might be redundant if the service auditor has already provided detailed information about the controls in their report.\n\nOption C suggests auditing the service organization\u2019s controls, assessing risk, and preparing the audit plan. This approach involves directly auditing the service organization's controls myself. While this would give me firsthand knowledge of the controls, it might not be the most efficient use of resources, especially if the service organization is large or complex. Plus, if the service organization already has a service auditor who has performed such an audit, duplicating their work could be time-consuming and costly.\n\nOption D recommends auditing the service organization\u2019s controls to test the work of the service auditor. This seems even more resource-intensive than option C. Not only am I auditing the controls, but I'm also effectively reviewing the work of another auditor. Unless there are specific reasons to doubt the service auditor's report, this seems like an unnecessary step.\n\nLet me consider the efficiency aspect more carefully. Efficiency in auditing means achieving the audit objectives with the least amount of effort and resources. So, if I can rely on the work of a qualified service auditor, that would save time and money compared to performing my own audit of the service organization.\n\nBut, I also need to ensure that the service auditor's report is reliable and that their audit was performed in accordance with applicable standards. So, reviewing the service auditor's report (option A) would be a starting point to understand the controls in place and assess whether they are sufficient for my audit purposes.\n\nOption B adds the step of outlining the accounting system in a memo. While this might be useful for documentation purposes, it's not clear if it adds significant value beyond what's provided in the service auditor's report. Maybe it's something that's already covered in the review of the report.\n\nBetween options A and B, I think option A is more straightforward and efficient. Reviewing the service auditor's report should give me the necessary information about the controls at the service organization without the added step of documenting the accounting system separately.\n\nOptions C and D involve more extensive work, which may not be necessary if I can rely on the service auditor's report. Unless there are specific concerns about the service organization or the service auditor's report, performing my own audit of the service organization's controls would likely be less efficient.\n\nAdditionally, if the service organization serves multiple clients, it's possible that they have undergone a System and Organization Controls (SOC) audit, which is designed to provide assurance about the effectiveness of their controls. In such cases, the service auditor's report would be a standard industry report that user auditors can rely on, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nSo, in summary, reviewing the service auditor's report (option A) seems to be the most efficient procedure to include in the audit plan. It provides the necessary information about the service organization's controls without requiring additional resources to audit the controls myself or to test the work of the service auditor.\n\nI think the answer is A. Review the service auditor\u2019s report on controls placed in operation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
