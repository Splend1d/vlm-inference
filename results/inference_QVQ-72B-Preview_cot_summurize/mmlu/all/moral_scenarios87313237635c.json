                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I blew smoke away from the child's face.\" So, someone is smoking near a child and blows the smoke away from the child's face. Hmm, smoking around children is generally considered bad because secondhand smoke can be harmful to kids. It can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. So, the act of smoking near a child is already problematic from a moral standpoint because it endangers the child's health.\n\nBut in this scenario, the person is blowing the smoke away from the child's face. Is that an attempt to protect the child from the smoke, or is it just a reflex? Maybe it's a way to prevent the smoke from directly hitting the child's face, but the smoke is still in the air, and the child is still being exposed to it. It seems like a half-measure that doesn't really solve the problem of exposing the child to smoke.\n\nSo, even if the person is trying to be considerate by blowing the smoke away from the child's face, the fact remains that the child is still being exposed to secondhand smoke, which is harmful. Therefore, I would say that this action is morally wrong because it involves smoking around a child, regardless of where the smoke is being directed.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I passionately kissed my son in the living room.\" This one is a bit tricky because it involves family relationships and expressions of affection. In many cultures, including in the US, it's perfectly acceptable for parents to show affection to their children, including hugs and kisses.\n\nHowever, the term \"passionately\" might raise some eyebrows. Passionate kisses are often associated with romantic relationships, not parental ones. So, kissing a son passionately could be seen as crossing a boundary into inappropriate territory, especially if the son is old enough to understand romantic expressions.\n\nBut, I need to consider the context. If the son is a young child, perhaps a toddler or preschooler, then a passionate kiss might just be a spontaneous expression of love and affection from a parent. It might not carry the same connotations as it would with an older child or adolescent.\n\nOn the other hand, if the son is older, say, a teenager, then a passionate kiss could be uncomfortable for the son and potentially inappropriate. It's important to respect boundaries as children grow older and develop their own sense of personal space and comfort with physical affection.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't specify the age of the son, I have to consider general moral standards. In the US, parental kisses are common and accepted for younger children, but as children get older, the nature of physical affection might change to respect their developing sense of privacy and boundaries.\n\nA passionate kiss, regardless of the son's age, might be seen as overly intimate and not appropriate for a parent-child relationship. It could make the son feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, especially if it's done in a public setting like the living room, where others might witness it.\n\nMoreover, in terms of moral standards, it's important to ensure that expressions of affection don't cross into areas that could be misunderstood or cause emotional distress. While there's nothing inherently wrong with parents showing love through physical affection, the manner and context matter.\n\nSo, considering all this, I would say that passionately kissing a son in the living room could be considered morally wrong, particularly if it disregards the son's comfort level or age-appropriate boundaries.\n\nNow, to answer the question, both scenarios seem to involve actions that could be deemed morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The first scenario involves exposing a child to secondhand smoke, which is harmful to their health, while the second involves a potentially inappropriate expression of affection that may not respect the son's boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are labeled as A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, if both scenarios are wrong, then A is the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective I'm missing.\n\nIn the first scenario, perhaps the person is smoking but trying to minimize the smoke exposure to the child by blowing it away from their face. While the intention might be to protect the child somewhat, the action itself still involves smoking around the child, which is harmful. So, yes, that's morally wrong due to the harm caused.\n\nIn the second scenario, a passionate kiss from a parent to a child might be seen as overstepping the bounds of appropriate physical affection, especially if the child is older. Even if the child is young, some might argue that passion implies a level of intensity that isn't necessary or appropriate in a parent-child relationship.\n\nHowever, I can see how some people might view the second scenario differently, depending on cultural backgrounds or personal beliefs. But based on general US moral standards in 2020, I still think both actions would be considered wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an argument to be made that the first scenario is clearly wrong due to the health risks involved, whereas the second scenario might be more gray, depending on the specifics.\n\nLet me consider if there's any way the second scenario could be interpreted as not wrong. If the son is a very young infant, perhaps a passionate kiss is just a natural expression of parental love, and there's no sexual connotation to it. In that case, some might argue that it's harmless and not morally wrong.\n\nBut even then, the term \"passionate\" might still raise concerns about the appropriateness of the expression, regardless of the son's age.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the passionate kiss is a way to comfort the son in a time of distress, and in that context, it might be seen as an act of love and care rather than something inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't provide any context for why the kiss is happening, so I have to assume it's just a spontaneous act without any specific justification.\n\nGiven that, and considering ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, I still lean towards both actions being morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, my answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
