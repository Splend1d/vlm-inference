                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this expression: 9(9m + 3t), and I need to find out which of these options is equivalent to it. The options are:\n\nA. 18m + 3t\n\nB. 81m + 3t\n\nC. 18m + 12t\n\nD. 81m + 27t\n\nOkay, so I need to distribute the 9 over the terms inside the parentheses. I remember that when you have a number outside parentheses like this, you multiply it by each term inside.\n\nSo, 9 times 9m is 81m. And 9 times 3t is 27t. So, putting that together, it should be 81m + 27t.\n\nLet me double-check that. Distributive property says that a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, 9*9m = 81m, and 9*3t = 27t. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 18m + 3t\n\nB. 81m + 3t\n\nC. 18m + 12t\n\nD. 81m + 27t\n\nSo, option D looks like it matches what I got: 81m + 27t.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I can think about factoring or something. But no, it's a straightforward distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the order of operations. But no, multiplication comes before addition, so distributing first makes sense.\n\nIs there any way that 9(9m + 3t) could be simplified differently? Maybe if there's a common factor inside the parentheses that I can factor out first.\n\nLet's see, 9m and 3t have a common factor of 3. So, 9m = 3*3m, and 3t = 3*t. So, 9(3*3m + 3*t). Hmm, maybe I can factor out a 3 from the parentheses.\n\nSo, 9(3(3m + t)).\n\nNow, multiplying 9 and 3 gives 27, so it's 27(3m + t). Then, distribute 27: 27*3m = 81m, and 27*t = 27t. So again, I get 81m + 27t.\n\nThat's interesting; both ways I get the same result. So, it reinforces that option D is correct.\n\nMaybe I should try plugging in some numbers to test it. Let's say m = 1 and t = 2.\n\nSo, 9(9*1 + 3*2) = 9(9 + 6) = 9*15 = 135.\n\nNow, let's compute 81*1 + 27*2 = 81 + 54 = 135. Yep, matches.\n\nIf I choose m=0 and t=1, then 9(0 + 3*1) = 9*3 = 27, and 81*0 + 27*1 = 27. Again, matches.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
