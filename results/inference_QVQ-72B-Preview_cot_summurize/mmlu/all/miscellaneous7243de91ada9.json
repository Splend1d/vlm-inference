                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Who sang lead vocals for the band Big Brother and the Holding Company?\" and the options are Grace Slick, Janis Joplin, Mama Cass, and Karen Carpenter. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these singers was part of Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\nFirst off, I know that Big Brother and the Holding Company was a band from San Francisco, and they were pretty famous in the '60s. I think they were associated with the whole counterculture movement back then. But who exactly sang lead vocals for them?\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Grace Slick: I know Grace Slick was part of another San Francisco band called Jefferson Airplane. They had hits like \"White Rabbit\" and \"Somebody to Love.\" But I don't recall her being in Big Brother and the Holding Company. Maybe she collaborated with them sometimes, but I don't think she was their lead vocalist.\n\nB. Janis Joplin: Now, Janis Joplin is a name that comes to mind when I think of Big Brother and the Holding Company. I remember that she was a powerful blues-rock singer, and I think she rose to fame with this band. Didn't she sing \"Piece of My Heart\" and \"Ball 'n' Chain\" with them? That seems familiar.\n\nC. Mama Cass: Mama Cass was part of The Mamas & the Papas, right? They had a lot of harmony-based songs like \"California Dreamin'\" and \"Monday, Monday.\" I don't think she was ever in Big Brother and the Holding Company. Maybe there's some connection between the bands, but I don't think she sang lead for Big Brother.\n\nD. Karen Carpenter: Karen Carpenter was part of the Carpenters, a pop duo with her brother Richard. They had hits like \"Close to You\" and \"We've Only Just Begun.\" Their style was quite different from Big Brother and the Holding Company, which was more psychedelic and bluesy. So, I doubt Karen Carpenter was the lead vocalist for Big Brother.\n\nAlright, based on what I know, it seems like Janis Joplin is the most likely answer. Let me just double-check some facts in my mind. I know that Janis Joplin became famous in the late '60s, around the time of the Summer of Love in San Francisco. Big Brother and the Holding Company was formed in 1965, and I believe Janis Joplin joined them in 1966 or 1967. They performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, which helped launch their career.\n\nI also recall that Janis Joplin eventually left the band to pursue a solo career, but during her time with them, they had some significant successes. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident that Janis Joplin was the lead vocalist for Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider if there was anyone else who might have sung lead for them. I don't think Grace Slick was ever part of Big Brother; she was firmly established in Jefferson Airplane. Mama Cass was with The Mamas & the Papas, and Karen Carpenter was with the Carpenters. So, no, those other options don't seem to fit.\n\nMaybe I should think about the early days of Big Brother and the Holding Company. Before Janis Joplin joined, did they have another lead vocalist? I think they did have other singers, but Janis Joplin was undoubtedly their most famous and impactful lead vocalist.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The correct answer should be B. Janis Joplin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Janis Joplin}} \\]"
