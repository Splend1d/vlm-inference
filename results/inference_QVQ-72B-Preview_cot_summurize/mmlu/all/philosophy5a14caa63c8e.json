The options are:\n\nA. consequentialism and hedonism.\n\nB. universalizability and prescriptivity.\n\nC. contractualism and rule-following.\n\nD. consistency and coherence.\n\nI need to pick the two essential features that Hare claims are part of the logic of moral judgments.\n\nFirst, I should probably know who Hare is. I recall that R.M. Hare was an ethical theorist who worked on moral philosophy, particularly on meta-ethics and the nature of moral language. He's known for developing a form of prescriptive moral theory called \"prescriptivism.\"\n\nNow, the question is about the \"logic of moral judgments.\" That probably refers to the structural or logical underpinnings of how we make moral decisions or evaluations. So, it's not about the content of specific moral rules but about the general principles that govern moral reasoning.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. consequentialism and hedonism.\n\nConsequentialism is a theory that holds that the consequences of an action determine its moral value. So, it's about the outcomes of actions. Hedonism specifically suggests that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and that actions are right if they maximize pleasure.\n\nWhile consequentialism is a significant moral theory, and hedonism is one type of it, I don't think these are the essential features Hare would emphasize for the logic of moral judgments. Hare was more focused on the prescriptive nature of moral statements and the importance of universalizability.\n\nB. universalizability and prescriptivity.\n\nUniversalizability sounds familiar; it's the idea that moral judgments should apply to everyone in similar situations. So, you shouldn't have one rule for yourself and another for others. Prescriptivity seems related to prescriptions or recommendations about how one ought to behave.\n\nThis option aligns with Hare's prescriptivism, which holds that moral statements are prescriptions that are universalizable. He thought that moral statements are not just descriptive but are prescriptive and should be applicable to everyone in the same way.\n\nC. contractualism and rule-following.\n\nContractualism is another moral theory that suggests that moral norms arise from agreements or contracts that rational individuals would enter into. Rule-following implies adhering to established rules or norms.\n\nWhile contractualism is an interesting theory, it's not central to Hare's work. Hare was more concerned with the logical structure of moral language and the idea that moral statements are prescriptions that we can reason about and universalize.\n\nD. consistency and coherence.\n\nConsistency and coherence are important in logical arguments and theories. Consistency means that the parts of the theory don't contradict each other, and coherence suggests that they fit together well.\n\nWhile these are desirable properties of any logical system, including moral theories, I don't think they are the two essential features that Hare would highlight for the logic of moral judgments. They are more about the quality of the theory rather than its fundamental nature.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B seems the most appropriate choice. Universalizability and prescriptivity capture the core aspects of Hare's view on moral judgments: that they are prescriptions that should apply universally.\n\nTo double-check, I can recall that Hare was a proponent of prescriptivism in ethics, emphasizing that moral statements are not statements of fact but are instead prescriptions that guide action and are meant to be universal in their application.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. universalizability and prescriptivity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
