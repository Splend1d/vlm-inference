                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says that a restaurant used 231 eggs last week. Out of these, 46 were brown, and the rest were white. I need to find out which equation can be used to solve for w, which represents the number of white eggs used last week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I know the total number of eggs used is 231. Out of these, 46 are brown, and the remaining ones are white. So, if I let w be the number of white eggs, then I can express the total number of eggs as the sum of brown eggs and white eggs.\n\nSo, total eggs = brown eggs + white eggs\n\nThat means 231 = 46 + w\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let's see what the options are.\n\nOption A is 231 + 46w = 0. That doesn't seem right because the total eggs are 231, and it's adding 46w to it, which wouldn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption B is 46 + w = 231. This looks familiar. It's the same as what I just thought: total eggs is brown plus white equals 231.\n\nOption C is w = 231 + 46. That would mean the number of white eggs is more than the total number of eggs, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is 231 = 46w. That would imply that the total number of eggs is equal to 46 times the number of white eggs, which doesn't align with the given information.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct equation to solve for w, the number of white eggs used last week.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of subtracting the brown eggs from the total to find the white eggs, then w = 231 - 46. But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps the equation should be set up to solve for w in terms of addition.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other relationship that could be used to form an equation.\n\nIs there any possibility of overlapping categories? For example, are there eggs that are neither brown nor white? No, the problem states that all eggs are either brown or white.\n\nSo, no, all eggs are categorized into either brown or white.\n\nTherefore, total eggs = brown eggs + white eggs.\n\nSo, 231 = 46 + w.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I rearrange the equation to solve for w, w = 231 - 46.\n\nBut again, that's not among the options.\n\nSo, the correct choice is option B: 46 + w = 231.\n\nWait a minute, but in option B, it's written as 46 + w = 231, which matches my initial equation.\n\nBut in option C, it's w = 231 + 46, which would mean that the number of white eggs is greater than the total number of eggs, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption A is 231 + 46w = 0, which seems unrelated to the problem.\n\nOption D is 231 = 46w, which would imply that the total number of eggs is equal to 46 times the number of white eggs, which doesn't align with the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is option B: 46 + w = 231.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
