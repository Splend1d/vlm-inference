Baptism and Ordination\n\nC. Eucharist and Marriage\n\nD. Eucharist and Confession\n\nHmm, I need to be careful with this one. I know that sacraments are sacred ceremonies or acts in Christianity that are believed to be instituted by Jesus Christ and that they convey grace from God. But not all Christian denominations recognize the same number of sacraments.\n\nLet me recall: the Roman Catholic Church recognizes seven sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance (Confession), Anointing of the Sick, Marriage, and Holy Orders (Ordination). The Eastern Orthodox Church also has seven sacraments, though they might use different terms for some of them. The Anglican Church recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and Eucharist, while other sacramental actions are considered sacramentals. Protestant denominations, especially those with roots in the Reformation, typically recognize only two sacraments: Baptism and the Eucharist (or Lord's Supper).\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the two sacraments that all Christians celebrate, I need to find the ones that are universally accepted across different denominations.\n\nOption A is Baptism and Eucharist. From what I just thought, this seems to be the case because both Catholics and Protestants, and even Orthodox Christians, recognize these two.\n\nOption B is Baptism and Ordination. While Catholics and Orthodox recognize both, some Protestant denominations do not consider Ordination a sacrament in the same way.\n\nOption C is Eucharist and Marriage. Again, while many Christians celebrate Marriage as a sacrament, some Protestant groups do not view it as a sacrament.\n\nOption D is Eucharist and Confession. Confession is recognized as a sacrament by Catholics and Orthodox, but not by all Protestant denominations.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, Baptism and Eucharist seem to be the two sacraments that are most widely accepted and celebrated by all Christians, regardless of denomination.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check this. Are there any Christian groups that don't recognize Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments?\n\nLet me think about Baptism first. Almost all Christian denominations practice Baptism, whether by immersion, pouring, or sprinkling, as a sign of faith and incorporation into the Church. Even groups that might have different understandings of Baptism still consider it a crucial part of Christian life.\n\nAs for the Eucharist, or Lord's Supper, it's also widely observed across Christian traditions. While the understanding of the nature of Christ's presence in the Eucharist varies (real presence in Catholicism, memorial in some Protestant denominations), the act of partaking in the bread and wine is a common practice.\n\nAre there any Christian groups that don't celebrate either Baptism or Eucharist? I can't think of any off the top of my head. Perhaps some extreme sects, but generally, these two are universal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Baptism and Eucharist.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other sacraments that might be similarly universal. For example, Confirmation is primarily a Catholic and Orthodox practice, though some Protestant churches have something similar. Marriage is recognized as a sacrament in Catholic, Orthodox, and some Anglican churches, but not in all Protestant denominations. Ordination is recognized as a sacrament in Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches, but again, not in all Protestant groups. Confession, or Penance, is primarily a Catholic and Orthodox practice.\n\nSo, again, Baptism and Eucharist seem to be the most inclusive and universally accepted sacraments across all Christian denominations.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
