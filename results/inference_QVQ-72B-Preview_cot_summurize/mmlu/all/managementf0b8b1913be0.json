                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Who was a major protagonist of utilitarianism?\" and the options are John Stuart Mill, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, and Adam Smith. Okay, I need to figure out which one of these philosophers is known for being a major proponent of utilitarianism.\n\nFirst off, I know that utilitarianism is a theory in ethics that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as happiness or pleasure. So, the philosopher who developed or heavily promoted this idea should be the answer.\n\nLet me think about John Stuart Mill. I recall that he was an English philosopher who lived in the 19th century. He wrote a famous book called \"Utilitarianism\" where he elaborated on this ethical theory. Yeah, that sounds promising. So, option A seems like a strong candidate.\n\nNext, Thomas Hobbes. I remember him as an English philosopher from the 17th century, known for his work \"Leviathan.\" He had ideas about the social contract and the state of nature, suggesting that life without government would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" But I don't recall him being associated with utilitarianism. So, maybe not option B.\n\nThen there's Karl Marx. He's famous for his theories on communism and class struggle. He wrote \"The Communist Manifesto\" and \"Das Kapital,\" critiquing capitalism and proposing a society without classes. Again, not directly related to utilitarianism, as far as I know. So, probably not option C.\n\nLastly, Adam Smith. He's often referred to as the father of economics. His book \"The Wealth of Nations\" is a foundational text in classical economics, advocating for free markets and laissez-faire policies. While his ideas about individual self-interest leading to the greater good might have some similarities to utilitarianism, he wasn't primarily known for promoting utilitarianism. So, option D seems less likely.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any chance that one of these other philosophers contributed significantly to utilitarianism in a way that I might have forgotten?\n\nLet me consider if any of them had writings or theories that align closely with utilitarian principles. Thomas Hobbes' social contract theory is about maximizing individual self-interest to achieve social order, but that's more about preserving life and property rather than maximizing happiness or utility.\n\nKarl Marx's ideas were more about eliminating suffering and inequality through revolution and establishment of a classless society. That sounds a bit like utilitarian aims, but his approach was different, focusing on economic structures and historical materialism rather than utility maximization.\n\nAdam Smith's invisible hand concept suggests that individuals pursuing their own self-interest can lead to beneficial outcomes for society, but again, this isn't strictly utilitarianism. It's more about economic efficiency and market mechanisms.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, on the other hand, not only wrote extensively about utilitarianism but also refined the theory, distinguishing between higher and lower pleasures and addressing criticisms of earlier utilitarian thinkers like Jeremy Bentham.\n\nWait, Jeremy Bentham! He was another major figure in utilitarianism, preceding John Stuart Mill. But he's not listed in the options, so maybe the question is limited to these four philosophers.\n\nGiven that, and considering that John Stuart Mill is perhaps the most famous utilitarian philosopher, especially known for his work on utilitarianism, I think the answer is A. John Stuart Mill.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should check if any of the other philosophers had significant contributions to utilitarian thought that I might have overlooked.\n\nThomas Hobbes, while important in political philosophy, isn't typically associated with utilitarianism. Karl Marx's critique of capitalism might align somewhat with utilitarian goals of reducing suffering, but his methods and theories are distinct from utilitarian ethics.\n\nAdam Smith, though he discussed ideas about moral sentiments and the role of self-interest in promoting the public good, is more aligned with classical liberalism and free-market economics than with utilitarianism.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that John Stuart Mill is the correct answer to this question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ John Stuart Mill}} \\]"
