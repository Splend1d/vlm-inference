                    "text": "So I have this question about a cable and its capacitance. It says that if the length of the cable is doubled, what happens to its capacitance C? The options are:\n\nA. one-fourth.\n\nB. one-half.\n\nC. doubled.\n\nD. unchanged.\n\nHmm, I need to figure this out. I remember that capacitance is related to how much charge a capacitor can store for a given voltage. But in this case, we're dealing with a cable, which I guess can be thought of as a kind of capacitor, especially if it's a transmission line or something like that.\n\nLet me think about the formula for capacitance of a cable. I think for a simple parallel-wire line, the capacitance per unit length is given by something like C/L = (\u03c0\u03b5)/ln(d/a), where \u03b5 is the permittivity of the medium, d is the distance between the wires, and a is the radius of the wires. But I might be misremembering.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a coaxial cable, where there's an inner conductor and an outer conductor. For a coaxial cable, the capacitance per unit length is C/L = (2\u03c0\u03b5)/(ln(b/a)), where b is the radius of the outer conductor and a is the radius of the inner conductor.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Maybe I should consider the cable as a distributed capacitor, where the capacitance is proportional to the length.\n\nIf capacitance is proportional to length, then doubling the length would double the capacitance. That would make the answer C. doubled.\n\nBut wait, let's think carefully. In a standard parallel-plate capacitor, the capacitance is given by C = \u03b5A/d, where \u03b5 is the permittivity, A is the area of the plates, and d is the distance between them.\n\nIn a cable, if the cable is like a transmission line with two parallel wires, increasing the length would increase the capacitance because there's more area for charge storage along the length.\n\nSimilarly, in a coaxial cable, increasing the length would increase the capacitance proportionally.\n\nSo, based on this, if the length is doubled, the capacitance should indeed be doubled.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nIs there any possibility that increasing the length could change other parameters that affect capacitance?\n\nFor example, in a parallel-wire line, if the distance between the wires remains constant and the radius of the wires remains constant, then capacitance should scale linearly with length.\n\nSimilarly, in a coaxial cable, with constant radii for inner and outer conductors, capacitance per unit length is constant, so total capacitance scales with length.\n\nTherefore, doubling the length should double the capacitance.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that for very long cables, there might be some non-linear effects, but I think that's more related to signal propagation and less to static capacitance.\n\nMoreover, the question seems to be considering the cable as a kind of capacitor, probably assuming it's not too long for capacitance to remain proportional to length.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. doubled.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the formula for capacitance of a parallel-wire line.\n\nThe capacitance per unit length is given by C/L = (\u03c0\u03b5)/(ln(d/a)), where d is the separation between wires and a is the radius of the wires.\n\nSo, total capacitance C = (\u03c0\u03b5)/(ln(d/a)) * L.\n\nIf we double the length to 2L, then C' = (\u03c0\u03b5)/(ln(d/a)) * 2L = 2C.\n\nSimilarly, for a coaxial cable, C/L = (2\u03c0\u03b5)/(ln(b/a)), so C = (2\u03c0\u03b5)/(ln(b/a)) * L.\n\nDoubling L to 2L gives C' = (2\u03c0\u03b5)/(ln(b/a)) * 2L = 2C.\n\nSo, in both cases, capacitance doubles with length.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. doubled.\n\nI don't think it's one-fourth, one-half, or unchanged, unless there's some other factor at play that I'm not considering.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the cable's diameter changes with length or something, but the problem doesn't indicate any such thing.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. doubled.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
