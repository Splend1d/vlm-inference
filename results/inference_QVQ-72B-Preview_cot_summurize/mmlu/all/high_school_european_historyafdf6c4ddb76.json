Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration is de las Casas most likely to think is most important in Source 2?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the motives for exploration, based on two sources from Christopher Columbus and Bartholomew de las Casas. The question is asking which motive de las Casas would most likely think is the most important in Source 2. The options are:\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity\n\nB. Financial gain\n\nC. Personal glory\n\nD. Finding new mates\n\nFirst, I need to understand what de las Casas is saying in Source 2. He describes the Spanish treating the indigenous people like \"gentle lambs\" that the Spanish fell upon like \"ravening wolves\" or \"savage lions.\" That sounds really harsh and violent. He talks about the Spanish tearing the natives to shreds, murdering them, and inflicting untold misery and distress. He also mentions that the population of Hispaniola decreased from three million to only two hundred, which is a massive decline.\n\nDe las Casas attributes this destruction to the Christians' desire to acquire gold and become rich quickly, rising to a high estate beyond their merits. He seems to be criticizing the Spanish for their greed and the brutal methods they used to exploit the indigenous people for their own financial gain.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity\n\nB. Financial gain\n\nC. Personal glory\n\nD. Finding new mates\n\nGiven that de las Casas is criticizing the Spanish for their treatment of the natives in pursuit of gold and wealth, it seems that he would think financial gain is the most important motive in Source 2. He explicitly states that the reason for the killings and destruction is the desire to acquire gold and become rich quickly.\n\nBut let me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Converting the natives to Christianity. While Columbus mentions in Source 1 that he gave gifts to the natives to conciliate them and lead them to become Christians, de las Casas in Source 2 seems to be more focused on the negative aspects of Spanish behavior. He does mention that the Christians have an ultimate aim to acquire gold, but he doesn't emphasize conversion as the primary motive in this source.\n\nOption C: Personal glory. There's no direct mention of personal glory in Source 2. De las Casas is more concerned with the economic motivations behind the Spanish actions.\n\nOption D: Finding new mates. This seems unrelated to the content of Source 2. De las Casas is discussing the treatment of the natives and the reasons behind it, which revolve around acquiring gold and wealth, not finding partners.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B. Financial gain. De las Casas clearly attributes the brutal treatment of the natives to the Spanish desire for gold and rapid enrichment.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look back at Columbus's Source 1 to see if there's any contrast or additional context that might influence this.\n\nIn Source 1, Columbus describes how the Indians would barter items like cotton and gold for things like fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars. He mentions that he forbade such bartering as unjust and instead gave the natives many beautiful and acceptable articles in return for nothing, to conciliate them and encourage them to become Christians and have regard for the King and Queen of Spain.\n\nThis shows that Columbus had intentions beyond just financial gain; he was also thinking about spreading Christianity and establishing good relations with the natives for the benefit of Spain.\n\nHowever, in de las Casas's Source 2, written several decades later, the tone is much more critical of Spanish actions. De las Casas seems to be focusing on the negative impacts of Spanish colonization, particularly the quest for gold and the resulting destruction of the indigenous population.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Financial gain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
