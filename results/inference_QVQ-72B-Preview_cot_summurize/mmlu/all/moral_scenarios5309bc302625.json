                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario separately and evaluate whether the action described is morally wrong or not. Then, I have to match my answers to the options provided. Okay, let's start with Scenario 1.\n\nScenario 1: \"I saw that the girl was crying so I brought her a milkshake.\"\n\nSo, someone notices that a girl is crying and decides to bring her a milkshake. Now, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong. Let's consider the context. Maybe the person thought that bringing a milkshake would cheer the girl up. In many cultures, especially in the US, acts of kindness and comfort are encouraged. Helping someone who is upset by offering them something nice, like a milkshake, seems like a thoughtful and considerate gesture.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some nuances here that I'm missing. For instance, does the girl want a milkshake? Maybe she's crying because she's lactose intolerant and can't drink milkshakes. Or perhaps she's on a diet and doesn't want to be tempted by something sweet. But the scenario doesn't provide any information about that. It just says that the person saw the girl crying and brought her a milkshake.\n\nAssuming that the person had good intentions, which seems to be the case here, and that the milkshake was meant as a gesture of comfort, I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's an act of kindness, even if it might not be the most appropriate thing for everyone. Maybe it's not the best solution to someone's problems, but it's not inherently immoral.\n\nAlright, moving on to Scenario 2.\n\nScenario 2: \"I home school my kids so they don't get smarter than me.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. Here, someone is choosing to homeschool their children with the intention of preventing them from becoming smarter than the parent. Now, homeschooling itself is not necessarily wrong; many parents choose to homeschool for a variety of reasons, such as providing a more personalized education, religious beliefs, or dissatisfaction with public schools. In fact, homeschooling is a recognized and legal practice in the US.\n\nHowever, the motive behind homeschooling in this scenario is specifically to prevent the children from getting smarter than the parent. That seems like a self-centered and perhaps insecure reason. Education is generally seen as a means to expand knowledge and opportunities for children, not just to ensure that they don't surpass their parents in intelligence.\n\nDenying a child an education that could help them reach their full potential out of fear that they might become smarter than you could be considered morally wrong. It's putting one's own ego ahead of the child's best interests. In the US, parents have a moral and legal obligation to provide their children with an adequate education. While homeschooling can be adequate, the intention here seems to be to limit the child's knowledge rather than to enhance it.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to this. Perhaps the parent is worried about losing emotional connection with their child if the child becomes too intelligent or independent too soon. Or maybe there's a cultural context I'm not considering. But based on the information provided, it seems that the parent is primarily motivated by a desire to maintain their own intellectual superiority over their children, which does appear to be a morally questionable stance.\n\nSo, now that I've analyzed both scenarios, I need to decide whether each action is morally wrong or not, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFor Scenario 1, bringing a milkshake to someone who is crying seems like a kind and considerate act, intended to comfort them. Unless there's some specific reason why the milkshake would be inappropriate, which isn't provided in the scenario, I don't see this as morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, homeschooling with the intent to prevent children from getting smarter than the parent seems self-serving and against the child's best interests. It appears to be morally wrong because it's motivated by the parent's fear of being outshone rather than a desire to provide the best possible education for the child.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios respectively.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps the girl didn't want a milkshake and felt insulted by the gesture, or maybe she was allergic to dairy. In that case, the action might be seen as insensitive or thoughtless. But again, the scenario doesn't provide any information to suggest that, so I think it's reasonable to assume that the intention was good.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even though homeschooling is acceptable, the motive behind it is crucial. If the parent is doing it to limit the child's intellectual growth out of self-interest, that's ethically problematic.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. The first scenario is not morally wrong, while the second one is.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
