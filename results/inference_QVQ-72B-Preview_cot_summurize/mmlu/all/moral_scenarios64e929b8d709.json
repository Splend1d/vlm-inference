                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are that both are wrong, only the first is wrong, only the second is wrong, or neither is wrong. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I picked French fries off the floor and sold them to a customer.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty bad right off the the bat. Picking food off the floor and then selling it to someone is definitely unsanitary and could be harmful to the customer's health. It's not just about cleanliness; it's about potential health risks from contaminants on the floor. So, from a moral standpoint, this seems wrong because you're putting someone else in danger for your own profit. That doesn't sit well with me.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I told the customer I wanted to go to their country.\" Okay, so this one is a bit different. It's about expressing a desire to visit someone's homeland. On its face, this doesn't seem morally wrong. Wanting to visit another country isn't inherently bad; in fact, it can be seen as a sign of interest and openness to other cultures. Unless there's some context missing, which the question doesn't provide, this statement appears to be innocent enough.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the way it's phrased could be interpreted differently. For instance, if the customer is from a country that's currently facing political turmoil or has a bad reputation, saying you want to go there might raise eyebrows. But even then, it's still the speaker's personal desire, and they're not expressing any harmful intentions.\n\nAlso, considering the time frame\u2014ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020\u2014I don't recall any specific moral issues tied to expressing a desire to visit someone's country. Unless, of course, it's said in a condescending or insensitive manner, but the statement itself doesn't indicate that.\n\nSo, balancing both scenarios, it seems that the first one is clearly morally wrong due to health and safety concerns, while the second one isn't wrong from a moral perspective based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in the second scenario. Could there be any cultural insensitivity or implicit bias in saying you want to go to their country? For example, if the country is known for human rights issues or if the customer is from a minority group, might this statement be offensive?\n\nHmm, but again, without additional context, it's hard to say. The statement on its own doesn't seem offensive or wrong. It's possible that in certain contexts, expressing a desire to visit someone's country could be seen as patronizing or naive, but that's more about social awkwardness than moral wrongness.\n\nOn the other hand, picking food off the floor and selling it is pretty straightforwardly wrong, both morally and legally, I would imagine.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
