                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The voluntary association of three or more countries willing to give up some measure of sovereignty is called...\" and the options are A. nationalism, B. devolution, C. supranationalism, D. complementarity. Hmm, I need to figure out which one fits this description.\n\nFirst, let's break down the question. It's about countries coming together voluntarily and giving up some of their sovereignty. So, sovereignty means the independent authority of a state to govern itself, right? So, if countries are giving up some of that to work together, it must be some form of international cooperation where they agree to follow common rules or decisions that might override their own individual policies in certain areas.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Nationalism: I know nationalism is more about a strong sense of national pride and identity, often emphasizing what makes one's own country unique or better than others. It's not really about countries giving up sovereignty to work together; in fact, it might promote keeping sovereignty to oneself. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nB. Devolution: This term I've heard in the context of transferring powers from a central government to regional or local governments within a single country. For example, in the UK, devolution gave power to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It's not about multiple countries coming together, but rather about dividing power within one country. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nC. Supranationalism: This sounds like it involves something above the nation-state. Supra means above or beyond, right? So, supranationalism would involve entities that operate beyond the control of a single nation-state, like international organizations that have authority that member countries agree to abide by. This seems promising because it suggests that countries are giving up some sovereignty to be part of a larger entity that has its own decision-making powers.\n\nD. Complementarity: This term sounds like it's about things that complement each other, maybe in trade or economic terms. For example, countries might have complementary economies where one produces what the other needs. But this doesn't directly suggest that countries are giving up sovereignty; it's more about mutual benefit without necessarily surrendering control over their own affairs.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, C. supranationalism seems to be the most fitting answer. It directly refers to countries giving up some sovereignty to be part of a larger entity that has authority over them, which matches the description provided in the question.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think of an example. Take the European Union (EU). It's a voluntary association of multiple countries that have given up some measure of their sovereignty in areas like trade, law, and currency. The EU can make decisions that override individual member states' policies in these areas. This is a classic example of supranationalism in action.\n\nNationalism, on the other hand, would emphasize individual national interests and might even lead to movements against such unions. Devolution is more about internal power distribution within a country, and complementarity is about economic synergies rather than surrendering sovereignty.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. supranationalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. supranationalism}} \\]"
