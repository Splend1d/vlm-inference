He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nWhich of these statements best describes the Emancipation Proclamation?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about the Emancipation Proclamation. I need to pick which statement best describes it based on the information given. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.\n\nSo, the question is: \"Which of these statements best describes the Emancipation Proclamation?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. It guaranteed the freedom of all slaves living within the boundaries of the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War.\n\nB. It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.\n\nC. It declared that the freedom of the slaves was conditional upon the agreement of individual southern states to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. government.\n\nD. It prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both the Union and Confederate Armies.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what the Emancipation Proclamation actually did. I know that it was issued during the Civil War by President Lincoln, but I think it didn't free all the slaves immediately everywhere in the U.S. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me think carefully.\n\nOption A says it guaranteed freedom for all slaves in the U.S. at the conclusion of the Civil War. But I think it was issued during the war, in 1863, and it only applied to the areas in rebellion. So, it wouldn't have covered all slaves right away, would it?\n\nOption B says it freed only the slaves in states and parts of states that were in rebellion against the U.S. at the time it was issued. That sounds familiar. I remember that Lincoln didn't have control over the Confederate states, so he could only free slaves in the areas he didn't control, as a military measure.\n\nOption C says that the freedom of slaves was conditional upon southern states signing a peace treaty with the U.S. government. Hmm, I don't recall that. I think the Emancipation Proclamation was more of a declaration by Lincoln as Commander-in-Chief, not something that depended on the Confederates agreeing to a treaty.\n\nOption D says it prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both the Union and Confederate Armies. That doesn't sound right. I thought the Emancipation Proclamation was about freeing slaves, not specifically about their use in combat. Plus, the Confederates were using slaves to support their army, but I don't think the Proclamation addressed that directly.\n\nLet me go back to the text from Eric Foner. It says, \"even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition.\" So, it seems like Lincoln saw the Proclamation as a step toward abolition but didn't consider it the final solution.\n\nI need to focus on what the Proclamation actually did. I think it declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territories were free as of a certain date, but it didn't apply to the border states that remained loyal to the Union, like Maryland and Delaware, which still had slavery.\n\nSo, option B seems to align with that. It only freed slaves in states and parts of states that were in rebellion against the U.S. at the time it was issued.\n\nWait a minute, but I think the Proclamation was issued in two parts: a preliminary announcement in September 1862 and the final Proclamation on January 1, 1863. So, the \"time it was issued\" might be a bit vague, but I think it's referring to when it took effect.\n\nAlso, I recall that the Proclamation didn't immediately free any slaves because the Confederates didn't recognize it. It was more of a statement that, as the war progressed, slaves in rebel areas were considered free.\n\nMoreover, it's important to note that it didn't affect the border states that were still in the Union because they weren't in rebellion. So, slavery continued in those states until later actions, like the 13th Amendment.\n\nLooking back at option A, it says \"all slaves living within the boundaries of the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War.\" But the Emancipation Proclamation was issued during the war, in 1863, and didn't cover all slaves. The 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery everywhere in the U.S., wasn't ratified until 1865, after the war ended.\n\nSo, option A is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation didn't free all slaves immediately; it only applied to rebel areas.\n\nOption C mentions that freedom was conditional upon southern states signing a peace treaty. That doesn't sound right. The Emancipation Proclamation was a unilateral declaration by Lincoln, not something that depended on the Confederates' actions.\n\nOption D is about prohibiting the use of slaves in combat, which isn't directly related to the Proclamation's main purpose of freeing slaves.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct description: it freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if there's any information in the text that contradicts this. The text says Lincoln made a distinction between his personal wish for all men to be free and his official duties within the legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. It also mentions that even after the Proclamation, he preferred gradual abolition.\n\nThis reinforces that the Proclamation was a measured step, not a blanket freedom for all slaves.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option B is the best description of the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
