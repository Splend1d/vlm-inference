                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement isn't true for both issues management and crisis management. Let's see, I need to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst off, issues management is about identifying and dealing with issues that could potentially affect an organization in the future. It's kind of like being proactive and trying to manage things before they turn into big problems.\n\nCrisis management, on the other hand, is more about responding to immediate threats or situations that have already escalated into crises. It's about minimizing the damage and recovering as quickly as possible.\n\nOkay, so both are about risks, but one is more forward-looking and preventive, while the other is reactive.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. They both require research monitoring.\n\nI think this makes sense because in issues management, you need to monitor trends and potential issues that might arise. In crisis management, research monitoring would help you understand the scope of the crisis and how to respond effectively. So, both require some form of research and monitoring.\n\nB. They both deal with acute risks.\n\nAcute risks are severe or intense risks. Crises are definitely acute risks because they're high-impact and time-sensitive. Issues management might deal with potential risks that could become acute if not managed properly, but not all issues are acute right away. So, maybe this isn't true for both.\n\nC. New organizational practices are developed as a result of each.\n\nI can see how both can lead to new practices. After managing an issue or a crisis, organizations often learn lessons and adjust their policies and procedures accordingly. So, this seems plausible for both.\n\nD. Both have the potential to damage an organisation's reputation.\n\nYes, both issues and crises can harm a company's reputation if not handled well. Issues can erode trust over time, and crises can cause sudden damage. So, both can affect reputation.\n\nBased on this, option B seems like the one that isn't true for both. While crises are acute risks, issues might not be acute right away; they could become acute if they're not managed properly, but initially, they might be more latent.\n\nLet me double-check. Issues management is about identifying and addressing issues before they become crises or acute problems. So, in that case, not all issues are acute risks from the start. Crisis management, however, deals directly with acute risks that are happening or about to happen.\n\nTherefore, it's not accurate to say that both issues management and crisis management deal with acute risks all the time. Issues management deals with potential risks that may or may not become acute, whereas crisis management is specifically about acute risks.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. They both deal with acute risks.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another perspective. Maybe in some contexts, issues are considered acute risks from the beginning, but I don't think that's the case. Issues can be emerging trends or concerns that have the potential to turn into acute risks if not managed properly, but they aren't necessarily acute from the outset.\n\nWhereas, crises are by definition acute situations that require immediate attention.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that B is the statement that isn't true for both issues management and crisis management.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
