                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. Starting with Statement 1: \"Suppose {s_n} and {t_n} are sequences of complex numbers such that lim_n\u2192\u221e s_n = s and lim_n\u2192\u221e t_n = t. Then, lim_n\u2192\u221e s_n*t_n = st.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to determine if this statement is true or false. I remember that for real numbers, the limit of a product of two sequences is the product of their limits, provided those limits exist. But here, we're dealing with complex numbers. Is this property still valid for complex sequences?\n\nLet me recall that complex numbers can be represented as ordered pairs (a, b), where a and b are real numbers, and their arithmetic operations are defined component-wise. So, multiplication of two complex numbers (a, b) and (c, d) gives (ac - bd, ad + bc).\n\nGiven that, if {s_n} converges to s and {t_n} converges to t, both s and t being complex numbers, then the sequence {s_n * t_n} should converge to s*t, right? Because when you multiply the limits component-wise, it should match the limit of the product sequence.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any exceptions or special cases where this might not hold. For instance, if one of the sequences diverges or if there are any issues with the convergence of the product sequence.\n\nBut no, the statement assumes that both sequences converge to s and t respectively. So, there shouldn't be any divergence issues here.\n\nLet me try to think of a counterexample. Suppose s_n approaches s and t_n approaches t. If I pick specific sequences, maybe something like s_n = (1/n, 0) and t_n = (0, 1/n), where the sequences are approaching 0 in the complex plane.\n\nThen, s_n * t_n would be (1/n * 0 - 0 * 1/n, 1/n * 1/n + 0 * 0) = (0, 1/n^2), which approaches (0,0), which is s*t, since both s and t are 0.\n\nHmm, that seems to support the statement rather than contradict it.\n\nAlternatively, if I take s_n = 1 + 0i and t_n = 0 + 1i, then s_n approaches 1 and t_n approaches i. Their product s_n*t_n would be (1,0)*(0,1) = (-0,1 + 0,1) = (0,1), which is i, and s*t is 1*i = i. So, again, it holds.\n\nI can't seem to find a counterexample where the sequences converge but their product doesn't converge to st. Maybe this is indeed a general property for complex sequences.\n\nLet me consider the proof. If {s_n} converges to s and {t_n} converges to t, then by definition, for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists N1 such that for all n > N1, |s_n - s| < \u03b5, and similarly, there exists N2 such that for all n > N2, |t_n - t| < \u03b5.\n\nThen, for n > max(N1, N2), |s_n*t_n - s*t| = |s_n*t_n - s*t_n + s*t_n - s*t| \u2264 |t_n*(s_n - s) + s*(t_n - t)| \u2264 |t_n|*|s_n - s| + |s|*|t_n - t|.\n\nNow, since {t_n} converges to t, it's bounded, meaning there exists M such that |t_n| < M for all n. So, |s_n*t_n - s*t| < M*\u03b5 + |s|*\u03b5.\n\nBy choosing \u03b5 small enough, the right side can be made arbitrarily small, which implies that s_n*t_n converges to s*t.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nAlright, moving on to Statement 2: \"There exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence.\"\n\nThis seems familiar. I think there's a theorem that says every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence. Is that right?\n\nLet me recall the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Yes, it states that every bounded sequence in R^k has a convergent subsequence. Since we're dealing with real numbers (R^1), this should apply.\n\nSo, according to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, every bounded sequence of real numbers has at least one convergent subsequence.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is claiming the opposite, which is false based on the theorem.\n\nWait, but is there any exception or special case where a bounded sequence doesn't have a convergent subsequence? According to the theorem, no, as long as the sequence is bounded in R, it must have a convergent subsequence.\n\nMaybe if the sequence is bounded but oscillates infinitely without settling towards any particular limit, but even then, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there should be a convergent subsequence.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence (-1)^n, which alternates between 1 and -1. This sequence is bounded but doesn't converge. However, it has two convergent subsequences: one converging to 1 and the other to -1.\n\nSo, even in this case, there are convergent subsequences.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nStatement 1: True\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. True, False\n\nC. False, True\n\nD. False, False\n\nThe correct answer should be B. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
