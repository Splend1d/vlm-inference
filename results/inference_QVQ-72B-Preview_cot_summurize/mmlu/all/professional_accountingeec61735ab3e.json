                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that sells both DVD players and home entertainment systems. The DVD players are sold at $200 each with a variable cost of $160 per unit. For every four DVD players sold, they sell one home entertainment system, which costs $460 to make and sells for $600. The fixed costs for the company are $90,000. We need to find out how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even, given that the sales mix is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what break-even means. Break-even is the point where total revenue equals total costs, right? So, total revenue minus total variable costs minus total fixed costs equals zero at the break-even point.\n\nGiven that there's a sales mix, I should consider the contribution margin per unit of DVD players and home entertainment systems, and then find out how many units of each need to be sold to cover the fixed costs.\n\nLet me start by calculating the contribution margin for each product.\n\nFor DVD players:\n\nSelling price per unit: $200\n\nVariable cost per unit: $160\n\nContribution margin per DVD player: $200 - $160 = $40\n\nFor home entertainment systems:\n\nSelling price per unit: $600\n\nVariable cost per unit: $460\n\nContribution margin per system: $600 - $460 = $140\n\nNow, according to the sales mix, for every four DVD players sold, one home entertainment system is sold. So, the sales ratio is 4:1.\n\nLet's denote the number of DVD players sold as D and the number of home entertainment systems sold as H.\n\nFrom the sales mix, H = D/4\n\nWe need to find the total contribution margin from both products combined to cover the fixed costs.\n\nTotal contribution margin = (contribution from DVD players) + (contribution from home entertainment systems)\n\n= ($40 * D) + ($140 * H)\n\nBut since H = D/4, we can substitute H in the equation:\n\n= $40D + $140*(D/4) = $40D + $35D = $75D\n\nNow, at break-even, total contribution margin equals total fixed costs.\n\nSo, $75D = $90,000\n\nNow, solve for D:\n\nD = $90,000 / $75 = 1,200 DVD players\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLet me verify the contribution margin calculations.\n\nFor DVD players: $200 - $160 = $40 per unit.\n\nFor home entertainment systems: $600 - $460 = $140 per unit.\n\nGiven the sales mix of 4 DVD players to 1 system, the combined contribution per set of 4 DVD +1 system is:\n\n(4 * $40) + ($140) = $160 + $140 = $300\n\nAnd the cost per set is $300, and fixed costs are $90,000.\n\nSo, number of sets needed to break even is $90,000 / $300 = 300 sets.\n\nBut since each set includes 4 DVD players, total DVD players needed are 300 * 4 = 1,200.\n\nSo, that matches my initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the contribution margin ratio approach.\n\nBut I think the way I did it first is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1,200 DVD players.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 300\n\nB. 500\n\nC. 1200\n\nD. 1500\n\nSo, option C. 1200 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
