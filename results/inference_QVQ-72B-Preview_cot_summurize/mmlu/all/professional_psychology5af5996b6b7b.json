                    "text": "So I've got this research study here that says raising the minimum age for buying alcohol from 18 to 21 actually increases underage drinking among college students. That seems counterintuitive at first glance, but maybe there's a psychological theory that can explain why this happens. Let's see what options we have:\n\nA. The inoculation model.\n\nB. Cognitive dissonance theory.\n\nC. Psychological reactance theory.\n\nD. The deindividuation model.\n\nAlright, let's recall what each of these theories is about.\n\nStarting with the inoculation model: I think this is about preparing people to resist persuasive messages by exposing them to weak versions of those messages, kind of like a vaccine for ideas. So, it's about building resistance to influence. Doesn't seem directly related to increasing underage drinking when you raise the drinking age.\n\nNext, cognitive dissonance theory. This is about the discomfort we feel when we hold two inconsistent beliefs or behaviors. It suggests that we'll change our attitudes or behaviors to reduce that discomfort. Maybe if you're underage and drinking is illegal, but you still drink, there's dissonance between knowing it's illegal and doing it anyway. But would raising the drinking age increase that dissonance, leading to more drinking? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it could go either way.\n\nThen there's psychological reactance theory. I remember this is about how people resist constraints on their freedom. If you tell someone they can't do something, it makes them want to do it even more because their freedom is being threatened. So, if the drinking age is raised, it might make 18-20-year-olds feel like their freedom to drink is being taken away, which could make them want to drink more as a reaction. That sounds plausible.\n\nLastly, the deindividuation model. This is about how people are more likely to act in impulsive, sometimes irresponsible ways when they feel anonymous or part of a group. Maybe in college settings, during parties or events where students are in large groups, they feel less individual responsibility and might drink more. But does raising the drinking age specifically increase this kind of behavior? Not sure if there's a direct link there.\n\nSo, comparing these options, psychological reactance theory seems to be the most directly applicable here. It specifically deals with people's resistance to constraints on their behavior, which raising the drinking age is. So, according to this theory, raising the drinking age would make 18-20-year-olds want to drink more because their freedom to do so is being restricted.\n\nLet me double-check. The question says that raising the drinking age to 21 increases underage drinking among college students, and this finding is consistent with which theory? Well, reactance theory predicts that when freedom is threatened, people will seek to restore it by asserting their autonomy, which in this case could mean drinking more.\n\nInoculation model doesn't seem directly related because it's more about resisting persuasion, not about reacting to restrictions.\n\nCognitive dissonance theory could be a bit ambiguous here. While it's possible that raising the drinking age increases dissonance for those who drink, leading them to justify their behavior by drinking more, it's not as straightforward as reactance theory.\n\nDeindividuation model focuses on group behavior and loss of self-awareness, which might lead to increased drinking in certain settings, but again, it's not specifically tied to the legal drinking age being raised.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. Psychological reactance theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
