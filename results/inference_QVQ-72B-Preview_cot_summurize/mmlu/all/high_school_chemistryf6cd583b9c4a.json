                    "text": "So I have this question about bases, and I need to figure out which statement is true for all bases. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that all bases donate OH- ions into solution. I know that bases can accept protons or donate hydroxide ions, depending on the definition you use. But according to the Bronsted-Lowry theory, bases are proton acceptors. However, in many cases, bases do donate OH- ions, like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which dissociates into Na+ and OH- ions in water. But is this true for all bases?\n\nWait a minute, what about ammonia (NH3)? It's a base, but it doesn't directly donate OH- ions. Instead, it accepts a proton from water to form NH4+ and OH-. So, in this case, it's producing OH- ions, but not directly donating them. So, maybe option A isn't entirely accurate for all bases.\n\nOption B says that only strong bases create solutions in which OH- ions are present. But I think that both strong and weak bases can produce solutions with OH- ions, just that strong bases will do so more completely. For example, a weak base like ammonia (NH3) still produces some OH- ions when dissolved in water, but not as many as a strong base like NaOH would. So, this statement seems incorrect because weak bases also create solutions with OH- ions, just at lower concentrations.\n\nOption C states that only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution. I recall that electrolytes conduct electricity based on how well they ionize in solution. Strong bases are strong electrolytes and ionize completely, making them good conductors. Weak bases, on the other hand, ionize only partially, so their solutions are poorer conductors. Therefore, this statement seems true: only strong bases are good conductors because they ionize completely, producing plenty of ions to carry the electric current.\n\nOption D says that for weak bases, the concentration of OH- ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Let's think about ammonia again. If I have a solution of ammonia, NH3, it will react with water to form NH4+ and OH-. But the reaction is reversible and reaches equilibrium. At equilibrium, the concentration of OH- ions will depend on the base's concentration and its base dissociation constant (Kb). Generally, in a weak base solution, the concentration of OH- ions is less than the original concentration of the base because only a portion of the base molecules react to produce OH-. So, I think this statement is false.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A: Not all bases directly donate OH- ions; some produce them by accepting protons.\n\n- Option B: Both strong and weak bases produce OH- ions, but strong ones do it more completely.\n\n- Option C: Strong bases are good conductors due to complete ionization.\n\n- Option D: In weak base solutions, [OH-] is less than the original base concentration.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement for all bases is Option C: Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\n\nWait, but Option C says \"only strong bases,\" which implies that weak bases are not good conductors, which is generally true because they ionize incompletely. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
