                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to understand this argument by Little about abortion and when a fetus becomes a person. It says that we should accept a prerogative on the part of mothers to end a pregnancy until the fetus is a person because... and then there are four options. Let me read them again to make sure I get it right.\n\nOption A says: we should accept a prerogative to decline radical changes to one's practical identity.\n\nOption B: abortion is absolutely morally wrong.\n\nOption C: abortion is presumptively morally wrong but can become permissible in certain extreme cases.\n\nOption D: there is no clear answer about the moral status of abortion.\n\nAnd the question is, Little argues that we should accept this prerogative because... and then these options. But actually, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. It says, \"Little argues that we should accept a prerogative on the part of mothers to end a pregnancy until the fetus is a person because...\" and then lists these options. So, it seems like it's asking for the reason behind Little's argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"prerogative\" means in this context. A prerogative generally means a special right or privilege that someone has. In this case, it's about mothers having the right to end a pregnancy up until the point where the fetus is considered a person.\n\nNow, the argument is that we should accept this prerogative because... one of these options. Let's consider each one.\n\nOption A: declining radical changes to one's practical identity. Hmm, practical identity sounds a bit philosophical. Maybe it's about how having a child can significantly alter a person's life plans or identity. So, perhaps the argument is that mothers should have the right to choose not to go through with a pregnancy if it would drastically change their life in ways they don't want.\n\nOption B: abortion is absolutely morally wrong. If this is the case, then why would we accept a prerogative to have an abortion? This seems contradictory. If abortion is absolutely morally wrong, then why would Little argue that we should accept the right to have one? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nOption C: abortion is presumptively morally wrong but can become permissible in certain extreme cases. This seems more nuanced. It suggests that generally, abortion is wrong, but there might be exceptions where it's acceptable. So, perhaps Little is arguing that up until the point where the fetus is a person, mothers have the prerogative to choose abortion in extreme circumstances.\n\nOption D: there is no clear answer about the moral status of abortion. This seems like a position of uncertainty or agnosticism. If there's no clear answer, then maybe Little is arguing that since we don't know for sure what's right or wrong in this case, it's better to allow women to make their own decisions about abortion until the fetus reaches personhood.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these options aligns with Little's argument. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure what Little's specific argument is, so I might need to recall or look up some context.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently. Perhaps the question is trying to say that Little argues for accepting a prerogative for mothers to end a pregnancy until the fetus is a person, and the reason is one of these options. I need to see which option logically supports that conclusion.\n\nLet's consider Option A again: accepting a prerogative to decline radical changes to one's practical identity. If a pregnancy would cause significant changes to a mother's life, and she doesn't want that, then perhaps she should have the right to terminate the pregnancy. This seems like a pro-choice argument, emphasizing the mother's rights and well-being over the potential life of the fetus.\n\nOption B: abortion is absolutely morally wrong. If this is the case, then it would seem that Little is against abortion under any circumstances. But if that's the case, why would he argue for a prerogative to end a pregnancy up until a certain point? It doesn't make much sense to argue that abortion is always wrong but also that there's a window where it's acceptable. Unless there's a shift in moral status at the point where the fetus becomes a person, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nOption C: abortion is presumptively morally wrong but can become permissible in certain extreme cases. This suggests that generally, abortion is not morally acceptable, but there are exceptions. So, perhaps Little is arguing that up until the point where the fetus is a person, there are extreme cases where abortion should be permissible, and thus mothers should have that prerogative.\n\nOption D: there is no clear answer about the moral status of abortion. This seems like a position of moral uncertainty. If we don't know whether abortion is right or wrong, then perhaps the best approach is to allow individuals to make their own decisions, at least up until the point where the fetus has personhood.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to think about which option best supports the idea that mothers should have a prerogative to end a pregnancy until the fetus is a person.\n\nIf I choose Option A, it emphasizes the mother's rights and well-being, which aligns with the idea that she should have the prerogative to choose abortion if the pregnancy would cause undesirable radical changes to her life.\n\nOption B seems contradictory because if abortion is absolutely morally wrong, then there shouldn't be any prerogative to do it, regardless of when the fetus becomes a person.\n\nOption C allows for abortion in extreme cases, which might include situations where the mother's health is at risk or in cases of rape or incest. So, perhaps Little is arguing that up until the point of personhood, mothers should have the prerogative to choose abortion in such extreme cases.\n\nOption D, the position of uncertainty, might lead to a conclusion that individuals should make their own decisions about abortion, at least until the fetus reaches a certain stage of development.\n\nSo, which one is the most fitting reason for accepting the prerogative?\n\nMaybe Option C is the best fit because it acknowledges that abortion is generally morally wrong but can be permissible in extreme cases. So, up until the fetus is a person, mothers should have the prerogative to choose abortion in those extreme circumstances.\n\nBut Option A also seems plausible because it focuses on the mother's rights and well-being, which is a key aspect of the pro-choice argument.\n\nOption D, the position of uncertainty, might also lead to supporting the prerogative, as if we're unsure about the moral status, it's better to leave the decision to the individual.\n\nOption B seems incompatible with accepting the prerogative, unless there's a specific reason why the prerogative should be accepted despite abortion being absolutely wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about it in terms of when the fetus becomes a person. If the fetus isn't considered a person yet, then perhaps the moral weight isn't as heavy, and thus mothers should have the prerogative to choose abortion. Once the fetus is a person, then the moral considerations change, and the prerogative no longer holds.\n\nSo, if Little is arguing that the prerogative exists until the fetus is a person, it's likely because before that point, the mother's rights take precedence, or because abortion is only permissible in certain extreme cases before personhood.\n\nGiven that, Option C seems particularly relevant because it suggests that abortion is presumptively morally wrong but can be permissible in extreme cases. So, up until the fetus is a person, if there are extreme circumstances, abortion should be allowed.\n\nOption A, declining radical changes to one's practical identity, also supports the idea that mothers should have the right to choose abortion if continuing the pregnancy would cause significant alterations to their lives.\n\nOption D, uncertainty about the moral status, might lead to supporting the prerogative as a way to respect individual choice in the face of moral ambiguity.\n\nBut if I had to choose one, I think Option C is the most directly supportive of the prerogative. It acknowledges that abortion is generally wrong but can be permissible in extreme cases, which justifies allowing mothers to have the prerogative to choose abortion up until the fetus is a person.\n\nSo, my answer would be Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
