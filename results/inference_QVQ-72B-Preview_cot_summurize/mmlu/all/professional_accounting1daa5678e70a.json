                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a company exchanging some land for machinery, and I need to figure out the gain on this exchange. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe company has land with an appraised value of $50,000 and an original cost of $20,000. They're exchanging this land for machinery that has a fair value of $55,000. The problem mentions that the transaction has commercial substance, which I think means that there's some economic benefit to the exchange, and it's not just for tax purposes or anything like that.\n\nAlright, so first, I need to understand what a gain on exchange means. I believe it's the profit or benefit the company gets from swapping the land for the machinery. But how do I calculate it?\n\nLet me recall what I know about exchange of assets. If the exchange has commercial substance, which it does according to the problem, then we should recognize a gain or loss based on the fair values of the assets involved.\n\nSo, the land has an appraised value of $50,000, and the machinery has a fair value of $55,000. The original cost of the land was $20,000. I need to find out how much gain they made on this exchange.\n\nOne way to think about it is to see how much more the machinery is worth compared to the land they're giving up. So, the machinery is worth $55,000, and the land is worth $50,000. So, they're getting something worth $5,000 more than what they're giving up. That seems like a gain.\n\nBut wait, the original cost of the land was $20,000. Maybe I need to consider that as well. Maybe I should look at the difference between the fair value of what they're giving up and what they're receiving.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the land was originally cost $20,000, but its current appraised value is $50,000. So, if they were to sell the land, they would get $50,000, which is $30,000 more than what they originally paid. That means they have an unrealized gain of $30,000 on the land.\n\nNow, they're exchanging this land for machinery worth $55,000. So, they're getting machinery that's worth $5,000 more than the land's appraised value.\n\nIn accounting terms, when there's commercial substance, we recognize the gain or loss based on the difference between the fair value of the asset given up and its carrying amount.\n\nWait, what's the carrying amount? Is that the original cost or the appraised value?\n\nI think the carrying amount is usually the book value, which is the original cost adjusted for any accumulated depreciation or appreciation. But in this case, there's no mention of any depreciation or appreciation. It just says the appraised value is $50,000, which might be different from the carrying amount if there was any depreciation.\n\nBut since there's no information about depreciation, maybe the carrying amount is the same as the appraised value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the appraised value is the fair value, and the carrying amount is the original cost.\n\nLet me see. The problem says the land has an appraised value of $50,000 and an original cost of $20,000. So, if the carrying amount is the original cost, then the gain on the exchange would be the difference between the fair value of the machinery received and the carrying amount of the land given up.\n\nSo, machinery fair value is $55,000, land carrying amount is $20,000. Difference is $35,000. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, option D is $35,000, but let's see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gain is calculated based on the fair value of the asset received minus the fair value of the asset given up. So, $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000, which is option B.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the original cost is also given, which is $20,000. Maybe the gain should consider both the fair value of what's received and the carrying amount of what's given up.\n\nLet me try another approach. In exchanges with commercial substance, the gain is recognized based on the fair value of the asset given up compared to its carrying amount.\n\nSo, if the land was sold for its fair value of $50,000, the gain would be $50,000 - $20,000 = $30,000.\n\nBut instead of selling it, they're exchanging it for machinery worth $55,000. So, they're getting $5,000 more than the fair value of the land.\n\nWait, maybe the gain is the difference between the fair value of the machinery received and the fair value of the land given up, which is $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000.\n\nThat seems logical, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the gain on the sale of the land and the cost of the machinery separately.\n\nIf they sold the land for $50,000, they would have a gain of $30,000 ($50,000 - $20,000). Then, if they bought machinery for $55,000, they would need to pay an additional $5,000 in cash or something.\n\nBut in this case, it's a non-monetary exchange, so no cash is involved. So, maybe the gain is just the difference between the fair value of the machinery and the fair value of the land, which is $5,000.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because the original cost is $20,000, and the appraised value is $50,000, so there's an unrealized gain of $30,000 on the land.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it in terms of the exchange ratio or something.\n\nLet me look up the general formula for calculating gain on exchange of assets with commercial substance.\n\nOkay, from what I recall, when there's commercial substance, the gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset given up and its carrying amount.\n\nSo, gain = Fair value of asset given up - Carrying amount of asset given up.\n\nIn this case, fair value of land is $50,000, and carrying amount is $20,000, so gain would be $30,000.\n\nBut that's not matching with any of the options directly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the fair value of the asset received.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, in exchanges, the gain is limited to the difference between the fair value received and the fair value given up.\n\nSo, gain = Fair value received - Fair value given up.\n\nThat would be $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000, which is option B.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nBut let me check another perspective. Maybe the gain is calculated based on the excess of the fair value received over the carrying amount of the asset given up.\n\nSo, gain = Fair value received - Carrying amount given up.\n\nThat would be $55,000 - $20,000 = $35,000, which is option D.\n\nHmm, that's another possible answer.\n\nI'm getting confused now. Let me try to find a standard formula for this.\n\nUpon checking, in exchanges with commercial substance, the gain or loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset given up and its carrying amount.\n\nSo, gain = Fair value of asset given up - Carrying amount of asset given up.\n\nIn this case, fair value of land is $50,000, and carrying amount is $20,000, so gain is $30,000.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the machinery has a fair value of $55,000, which is $5,000 more than the land's fair value.\n\nSo, perhaps the gain is $5,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gain is $30,000, based on the difference between the land's fair value and its cost.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA. $0\n\nB. $5,000\n\nC. $30,000\n\nD. $35,000\n\nI need to choose among these.\n\nLet me consider that the gain is recognized based on the fair value of the asset received in excess of the fair value of the asset given up.\n\nSo, machinery fair value is $55,000, land fair value is $50,000, so the excess is $5,000, which would be the gain.\n\nThat seems reasonable, so I'll go with option B: $5,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
