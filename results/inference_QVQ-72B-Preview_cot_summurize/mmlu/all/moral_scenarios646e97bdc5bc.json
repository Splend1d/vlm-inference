I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of what's considered moral there. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nScenario 1: My friend has been letting me borrow her car a lot lately, so I decided to fill the gas tank without telling her.\n\nScenario 2: I have lice in my hair, so I'll lend my sister my hair brush.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is borrowing their friend's car frequently and decides to fill the gas tank as a nice gesture, without telling the friend. In Scenario 2, someone has lice and plans to lend their hair brush to their sister, knowing that it could potentially spread the lice.\n\nFirst, let's think about Scenario 1. Borrowing a car and using gas is pretty common, and filling the tank is usually seen as a considerate thing to do, especially if you've been borrowing the car a lot. It's like saying thanks by making sure there's gas in it for the owner's next use. Not telling the friend might be because it's just a small gesture, not something that needs announcement. So, does this seem morally wrong? Hmm, not really. It seems like a kind act, actually.\n\nNow, Scenario 2. Having lice is unpleasant, and it's contagious through shared items like hats, combs, or brushes. So, lending a hair brush to a sister when you have lice could easily spread the lice to her. That doesn't seem very considerate or kind. It's probably not intentional harm, but it's still irresponsible. Knowing that you have lice and still sharing items that can spread it is neglectful of someone else's well-being.\n\nSo, in ordinary moral standards, especially in terms of care and consideration for others, Scenario 1 seems fine, maybe even good, while Scenario 2 seems wrong because it could harm someone else unnecessarily.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective. In Scenario 1, maybe the friend didn't want the gas filled for some reason, or perhaps it's a gesture that's not appreciated. But generally, filling someone's gas tank when you've been borrowing their car is seen as thoughtful.\n\nIn Scenario 2, spreading lice is definitely not okay. It's a health issue, and knowingly exposing someone to it is irresponsible. Even if it's just lending a brush without mentioning the lice, it's still wrong because you're putting someone else at risk without their knowledge.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled as A. Wrong, Wrong B. Wrong, Not wrong C. Not wrong, Wrong D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, for Scenario 1 being \"Not wrong\" and Scenario 2 being \"Wrong,\" that would be C.\n\nYeah, that makes sense to me.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
