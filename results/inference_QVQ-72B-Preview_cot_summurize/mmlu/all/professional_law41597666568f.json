                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out who owns what in this situation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, a father deeds a piece of real estate to his three daughters using a warranty deed. The deed says that the title is conveyed to them \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" Okay, so joint tenancy is a type of ownership where each owner has an equal share in the property, and when one owner dies, their share passes directly to the surviving owners, not through their will.\n\nNow, one of the sisters decides to convey an \"undivided one-third interest\" in the property to a third party while all three sisters are still alive. Then, this third party dies and leaves her one-third interest to her son through her will. The question is whether the son's ownership interest is enforceable, considering that the two non-selling sisters claim they own 100% of the property based on the joint tenancy laws.\n\nAlright, so let's consider the options:\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit confusing. In joint tenancy, each tenant does own an undivided interest in the whole property, but they can generally convey their interest to someone else if they choose to. So, if one sister sells her one-third interest, that should be valid, right? But the problem says she conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest,\" which is the same as her share in the joint tenancy. So, I think this option might be misleading. Maybe not the correct answer.\n\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\n\nWait a minute, this seems off. I thought that a deed can certainly create a joint tenancy if it specifies \"joint tenants with right of survivorship.\" So, if the deed says that, it should create a joint tenancy. Maybe this option is incorrect because it's asserting that only a will can create a joint tenancy, which isn't true. Deeds can do that too.\n\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\n\nThis seems plausible. When one joint tenant conveys her interest to a third party, it typically severs the joint tenancy as to her share. So, in this case, the third party would hold the one-third interest as a tenant in common with the remaining sisters. Then, when she dies, she can leave her one-third interest to her son through her will, which would be enforceable.\n\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. My understanding is that severance of a joint tenancy can happen by voluntary conveyance of one's interest without necessarily needing a court order. So, if the sister simply sold her interest, that should be sufficient to sever her share.\n\nLet me think this through again. The father deeded the property to the three daughters as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, initially, each sister has a one-third undivided interest in the property, and upon any sister's death, her share passes to the survivors.\n\nThen, one sister conveys her one-third interest to a third party. This act of conveying her interest to someone outside the joint tenancy typically severs her interest, turning it into a tenancy in common for that share. So, now, the third party holds a one-third tenancy in common interest, and the remaining two sisters still hold their joint tenancy interests.\n\nWhen the third party dies, she leaves her one-third interest to her son via her will. Since her interest was a tenancy in common, it doesn't pass by survivorship but through her will. Therefore, her son should be able to inherit that one-third interest.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C seems correct: yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\n\nOption A is likely incorrect because it suggests that the sister couldn't convey her one-third interest, but she can.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a deed can create a joint tenancy, as in this case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a court order isn't necessary to sever a joint tenancy through conveyance.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
