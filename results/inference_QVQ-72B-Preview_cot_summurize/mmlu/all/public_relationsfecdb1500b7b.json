                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of these adjectives does NOT describe business writing? A. Formal, B. Abstract, C. Personal, D. Objective.\" Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that business writing is a specific type of writing used in professional settings, like in offices, companies, or other formal environments. It's usually meant to convey information clearly and efficiently, often with the purpose of making decisions or solving problems.\n\nLet me consider each adjective one by one.\n\nStarting with \"Formal.\" I think business writing is generally formal because it's intended for a professional audience. You wouldn't use slang or casual language in a business report or an email to your boss, right? So, formal seems like a fitting description.\n\nNext is \"Abstract.\" Hmm, abstract means dealing with general ideas rather than specific instances. In business writing, is that the case? Well, sometimes, but often business writing is about specific data, facts, or situations. For example, a financial report would present concrete numbers and analyses, not just vague concepts. Maybe abstract isn't the best description for business writing.\n\nThen there's \"Personal.\" Business writing is typically impersonal, focusing on facts and information rather than personal opinions or feelings. While it's true that some business writing might include personal touches, like in a cover letter or a thank-you note, generally, it's not considered personal in the way, say, a diary entry or a personal letter would be. So, personal probably doesn't describe business writing accurately.\n\nLastly, \"Objective.\" Objectivity means being fair and unbiased, based on facts rather than personal feelings. This seems very much in line with business writing, which aims to present information clearly and neutrally, allowing readers to make informed decisions. So, objective is likely a good descriptor for business writing.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these adjectives does NOT describe business writing. From my thoughts above, it seems that \"Personal\" might be the one that doesn't fit. Let me double-check.\n\nFormal: Yes, business writing is usually formal.\n\nAbstract: While some business writing might be abstract, especially theoretical or strategic documents, a lot of it is very concrete, dealing with specific data and scenarios.\n\nObjective: Definitely, business writing strives for objectivity.\n\nPersonal: No, business writing is generally impersonal, focusing on professional communication.\n\nTherefore, the adjective that does NOT describe business writing is Personal.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are exceptions or particular types of business writing that could be personal. For example, a recommendation letter might include personal insights about a person, but even then, it's presented in a professional and objective manner. A thank-you note might have a more personal tone, but it's still within the bounds of professional communication.\n\nSo, overall, I think \"Personal\" is the adjective that doesn't fit when describing business writing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Personal}} \\]"
