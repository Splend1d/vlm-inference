There are two groups: Group A, where everyone is initially opposed to the death penalty, and Group B, where two are opposed and two are in favor. After an intense discussion within each group, we have to predict what would happen to their positions.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Both groups would moderate their positions.\n\nB. Group A members would moderate their positions, but Group B members would retain their original positions.\n\nC. Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions.\n\nD. Group A members would retain their original positions, but Group B members would moderate their positions.\n\nHmm. I need to think about group dynamics and how discussions affect people's opinions, especially in the context of controversial topics like the death penalty.\n\nFirst, I recall something called group polarization. That's when, after discussing an issue, group members' opinions become stronger in the direction they were already leaning. So, if a group is mostly opposed to something, after discussing it, they might become even more opposed.\n\nIn Group A, everyone is opposed to the death penalty. So, if group polarization applies here, after discussing it, they might become even more opposed, which would mean their positions aren't moderating; they're extreme.\n\nWait, but option A says both groups would moderate their positions. That seems to contradict group polarization.\n\nOption B says Group A would moderate, but Group B would retain their original positions. But according to group polarization, Group A should become more extreme in their opposition, not moderate.\n\nOption C says Group A would become more entrenched, which sounds like group polarization, and Group B would moderate. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says Group A would retain their original positions, but Group B would moderate. But again, group polarization suggests that Group A might become more extreme.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to consider the composition of the groups.\n\nIn Group A, everyone is opposed to the death penalty. So, they're all on the same side. In Group B, there's an even split: two opposed and two in favor.\n\nPerhaps in Group A, since everyone agrees, they might reinforce each other's views, leading to stronger opposition\u2014group polarization.\n\nIn Group B, with differing opinions, they might have a more balanced discussion, leading to moderation of views.\n\nSo, Group A becomes more extreme in their opposition, and Group B moderates.\n\nThat would make option C correct.\n\nWait, but option C says Group A would become more firmly entrenched, which aligns with group polarization, and Group B members would moderate their positions, which aligns with my thought.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any chance that Group A might moderate their positions? Maybe if they hear arguments from within their group that are not as extreme, but since everyone is opposed, it's likely that they'll reinforce each other's opposition.\n\nIn Group B, with mixed opinions, they might hear arguments from both sides, which could lead to moderation of their initial extreme positions.\n\nSo, yes, Group A becomes more entrenched in their opposition, while Group B moderates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
