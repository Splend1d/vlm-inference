                    "text": "So I have this problem here: A point \\((x,y)\\) is randomly picked from inside the rectangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((3,0)\\), \\((3,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\). I need to find the probability that \\(x < y\\). The options are \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the area from which the point is being picked. The rectangle has vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((3,0)\\), \\((3,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\). So, it spans from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\) and from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\). The total area of this rectangle is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the region within this rectangle where \\(x < y\\). To visualize this, I can plot the line \\(x = y\\). This line will pass through the points \\((0,0)\\) and \\((2,2)\\) within the bounds of the rectangle.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n- The rectangle goes from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\).\n\n- The line \\(x = y\\) will start at \\((0,0)\\) and go up to \\((2,2)\\), since for \\(x > 2\\), \\(y\\) can't go beyond 2 in this rectangle.\n\nSo, the region where \\(x < y\\) is the area below the line \\(x = y\\) within the rectangle.\n\nTo find the area where \\(x < y\\), I can consider the triangle formed by the points \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's think about it again.\n\nActually, the line \\(x = y\\) starts at \\((0,0)\\) and goes to \\((2,2)\\). Within the rectangle, the area where \\(x < y\\) is the region below this line.\n\nSo, the area where \\(x < y\\) is the area of the triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,0)\\), and \\((2,2)\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me try to visualize this again.\n\nThe line \\(x = y\\) intersects the rectangle at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and since \\(x\\) can go up to 3 but \\(y\\) only goes up to 2, there's a restriction.\n\nActually, the line \\(x = y\\) starts at \\((0,0)\\) and goes up to \\((2,2)\\), and then horizontally to \\(x = 3\\) at \\(y = 2\\). But for the condition \\(x < y\\), we need the area where \\(x\\) is less than \\(y\\).\n\nSo, within the rectangle, \\(x < y\\) means that for any point, its \\(x\\)-coordinate is less than its \\(y\\)-coordinate.\n\nLooking at the rectangle:\n\n- For \\(y\\) from 0 to 2, and \\(x\\) from 0 to 3.\n\nBut within that, \\(x < y\\).\n\nAt \\(y = 0\\), \\(x\\) can't be less than 0, so nothing there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider \\(y\\) as fixed and find the range of \\(x\\) for each \\(y\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe integrating over the region would help.\n\nLet me try to find the area where \\(x < y\\).\n\nFirst, find where the line \\(x = y\\) intersects the rectangle.\n\nThe line \\(x = y\\) starts at \\((0,0)\\) and goes to \\((2,2)\\).\n\nThen, for \\(y\\) from 0 to 2, \\(x\\) goes from 0 to \\(y\\), because \\(x < y\\).\n\nSo, the area where \\(x < y\\) is the integral from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\) of \\(x\\) from 0 to \\(y\\), which is the area of the triangle bounded by \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 2\\), and \\(x = y\\).\n\nThis is a right triangle with base 2 and height 2, so its area is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2\\).\n\nWait, but the rectangle has an area of 6, as previously determined.\n\nSo, the probability that \\(x < y\\) would be the area where \\(x < y\\) divided by the total area of the rectangle, which is 2 divided by 6, which simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the line \\(x = y\\), and find the area below it within the rectangle.\n\nThe rectangle goes from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\), and \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\).\n\nThe line \\(x = y\\) intersects the rectangle at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and then the rectangle extends to \\(x = 3\\) at \\(y = 2\\).\n\nSo, for \\(y\\) from 0 to 2, \\(x\\) goes from 0 to \\(y\\), because \\(x < y\\).\n\nTherefore, the area where \\(x < y\\) is indeed the integral from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\) of \\(x\\) from 0 to \\(y\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{y=0}^{2} y \\, dy = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} y^2 \\right]_{0}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(4) - \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, area is 2, and total area is 6, so probability is \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nWait, but the answer \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is one of the options. However, I feel like I might be missing something.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the area where \\(x \\geq y\\) and subtract that from the total area to find the area where \\(x < y\\).\n\nBut that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the line \\(x = y\\) and find the area above it and below it.\n\nBut since the rectangle extends beyond \\(y = 2\\) to \\(x = 3\\), there might be some area where \\(x > y\\) in the rectangle.\n\nWait, no. In the rectangle, \\(y\\) only goes up to 2, while \\(x\\) goes up to 3.\n\nSo, for \\(y = 2\\), \\(x\\) can be from 0 to 3.\n\nBut for \\(y = 2\\), \\(x < y\\) would mean \\(x < 2\\), so the area where \\(x < y\\) at \\(y = 2\\) is from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 2\\).\n\nSimilarly, at \\(y = 0\\), \\(x < 0\\) would mean no area, since \\(x\\) starts at 0.\n\nSo, integrating from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\), and for each \\(y\\), \\(x\\) goes from 0 to \\(y\\), which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider \\(x\\) as a function of \\(y\\).\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the area where \\(x < y\\) as a triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\).\n\nThe area of this triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2\\).\n\nTotal area of rectangle is 6, so probability is \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't any other area where \\(x < y\\) that I'm missing.\n\nLooking back, the rectangle is bounded by \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\).\n\nThe line \\(x = y\\) goes from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((2,2)\\), and then horizontally to \\((3,2)\\).\n\nThe area where \\(x < y\\) is indeed below the line \\(x = y\\) within the rectangle.\n\nSo, from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\), \\(x\\) goes from 0 to \\(y\\), which forms a triangle with area 2.\n\nTotal area is 6, so probability is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider uniform distribution of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) within their respective ranges and compute the probability accordingly.\n\nThe probability density functions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are uniform over their ranges.\n\nSo, \\(x\\) is uniformly distributed from 0 to 3, and \\(y\\) is uniformly distributed from 0 to 2.\n\nWe need \\(x < y\\).\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(x < y) = \\int_{y=0}^{2} \\int_{x=0}^{y} \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\, dx \\, dy\n\\]\n\nWait, no. The joint probability density is the product of the individual densities, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent.\n\nThe density for \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), and for \\(y\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so joint density is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nThen, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(x < y) = \\int_{y=0}^{2} \\int_{x=0}^{y} \\frac{1}{6} \\, dx \\, dy\n\\]\n\nEvaluating the inner integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{x=0}^{y} \\frac{1}{6} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{6} y\n\\]\n\nThen, integrating with respect to \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_{y=0}^{2} \\frac{1}{6} y \\, dy = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} y^2 \\right]_{0}^{2} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{2} (4) = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, again, I get \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other region where \\(x < y\\) that I might have missed.\n\nLooking back at the rectangle, from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\), and \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\), and the line \\(x = y\\) from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((2,2)\\), then horizontally to \\((3,2)\\).\n\nThe area where \\(x < y\\) is indeed the triangle below the line \\(x = y\\) from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\), which has an area of 2, as previously calculated.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, perhaps I should consider the area where \\(x < y\\) in the context of the entire rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the area where \\(x \\geq y\\) and subtract that from the total area.\n\nThe area where \\(x \\geq y\\) would be the area above the line \\(x = y\\).\n\nIn the rectangle, for \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\), \\(x\\) goes from \\(y\\) to 3.\n\nSo, the area where \\(x \\geq y\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{y=0}^{2} (3 - y) \\, dy = \\left[ 3y - \\frac{1}{2} y^2 \\right]_{0}^{2} = (6 - 2) - 0 = 4\n\\]\n\nTotal area is 6, so area where \\(x < y\\) is \\(6 - 4 = 2\\), hence probability is \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider switching the variables.\n\nLet me consider \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\).\n\nFor each \\(x\\), \\(y\\) goes from \\(x\\) to 2, since \\(x < y\\).\n\nWait, no. If \\(x < y\\), then for a given \\(x\\), \\(y\\) goes from \\(x\\) to 2.\n\nBut in this case, \\(x\\) can only go up to 2, because for \\(x > 2\\), \\(y\\) can't be greater than 2.\n\nSo, \\(x\\) goes from 0 to 2, and for each \\(x\\), \\(y\\) goes from \\(x\\) to 2.\n\nTherefore, the area where \\(x < y\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{x=0}^{2} (2 - x) \\, dx = \\left[ 2x - \\frac{1}{2} x^2 \\right]_{0}^{2} = (4 - 2) - 0 = 2\n\\]\n\nAgain, area is 2, total area is 6, so probability is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the region where \\(x < y\\) as a triangle with base 2 and height 2, area \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2\\), as before.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nI think this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
