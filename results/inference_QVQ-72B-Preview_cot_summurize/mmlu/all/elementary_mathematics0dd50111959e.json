                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that Joe and Mike both ran the same race, and that Joe finished the race 4 minutes before Mike. Mike finished the race at 4:02 p.m., and I need to figure out what time Joe finished the race. There are four options to choose from: A. 3:58 p.m., B. 4:06 p.m., C. 8:02 p.m., or D. 12:02 p.m.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The key points are:\n\n1. Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike.\n\n2. Mike finished at 4:02 p.m.\n\nSo, if Mike finished at 4:02 p.m., and Joe finished 4 minutes before that, I need to subtract 4 minutes from 4:02 p.m. to find Joe's finishing time.\n\nSubtracting 4 minutes from 4:02 p.m.:\n\nFirst, let's look at the minutes. 2 minutes minus 4 minutes can't be done without adjusting the hours, so I'll think of 4:02 p.m. as 3:62 p.m. (since 4 hours is 60 minutes plus 2 minutes is 62 minutes). Now, subtracting 4 minutes from 62 minutes gives me 58 minutes. So, it would be 3:58 p.m.\n\nWait, but there's another way to think about it. Maybe I can subtract the 4 minutes directly from the time. Starting at 4:02 p.m., if I go back 4 minutes, I would go back to 3:58 p.m.\n\nLet me double-check that. Starting from 4:02 p.m., subtracting 4 minutes:\n\n- From 4:02 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. is 2 minutes.\n\n- From 4:00 p.m. to 3:58 p.m. is another 2 minutes.\n\nSo, total of 4 minutes back to 3:58 p.m.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 3:58 p.m.\n\nB. 4:06 p.m.\n\nC. 8:02 p.m.\n\nD. 12:02 p.m.\n\nOption A seems to be the correct answer based on my calculations.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike, does that mean Joe is faster or slower? Well, if Joe finished before Mike, that means Joe had a shorter time, so yes, subtracting is the right way to go.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of Mike finishing at 4:02 p.m., and Joe finishing 4 minutes earlier, it still points to 3:58 p.m.\n\nI don't think it's 4:06 p.m., because that would be adding time, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\n8:02 p.m. and 12:02 p.m. seem way off, unless there's some other factor involved, like the race starting in the morning and lasting all day, but that doesn't fit with the information given.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is 3:58 p.m.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret \"Joe finished the race 4 minutes before Mike.\" Maybe the race started at a certain time, and their finishing times are being compared relative to the start time. But the problem states that they both ran the same race, and Mike finished at 4:02 p.m., so subtracting 4 minutes from Mike's finish time should give Joe's finish time.\n\nUnless there's some trick, like the race starting at a specific time and lasting a certain duration, but the problem doesn't provide any information to suggest that.\n\nTherefore, the straightforward interpretation is that Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike, so subtracting 4 minutes from Mike's finish time gives Joe's finish time of 3:58 p.m.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A. 3:58 p.m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 3:58\\ \\text{p.m.}} \\]"
