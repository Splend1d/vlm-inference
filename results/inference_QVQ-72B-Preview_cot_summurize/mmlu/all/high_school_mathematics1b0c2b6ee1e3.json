                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 4 white balls and 4 black balls in a box, and I need to draw them out one by one. The question is asking for the probability that all of my draws alternate colors. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the draws to alternate colors. That means the sequence should be something like black, white, black, white, and so on, or white, black, white, black, etc. So, there are two possible starting points: starting with a black ball or starting with a white ball.\n\nNow, there are a total of 8 balls, so the number of possible ways to draw them out is 8 factorial, which is 8! = 40320 ways. But that seems too big for what I need here. Maybe I don't need to consider every single permutation.\n\nWait, actually, since the order matters here, and we're dealing with sequences where colors alternate, I should think about how many such alternating sequences are possible and then divide that by the total number of possible sequences.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many alternating sequences there are.\n\nThere are two cases: sequences starting with a black ball and sequences starting with a white ball.\n\nLet's consider sequences starting with a black ball first.\n\nIf the first ball is black, then the second should be white, the third black, and so on, alternating until the eighth draw.\n\nSo, the sequence would be: black, white, black, white, black, white, black, white.\n\nSimilarly, if the first ball is white, then the sequence would be: white, black, white, black, white, black, white, black.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of such sequences for each case and then sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the sequence starting with a black ball: B, W, B, W, B, W, B, W.\n\nI have 4 black balls and 4 white balls.\n\nFor this specific sequence, I need to arrange the balls in the order: B, W, B, W, B, W, B, W.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the black balls in the positions designated for black is the number of permutations of 4 black balls taken 4 at a time, which is 4! = 24.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to arrange the white balls in the positions designated for white is also 4! = 24.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences starting with black and alternating is 24 (for black positions) multiplied by 24 (for white positions), which is 576.\n\nWait a minute, but I think I might be overcomplicating this.\n\nActually, since the positions are fixed (B, W, B, W, etc.), and I have to choose which black balls go into which positions, and similarly for white balls, but since all black balls are identical and all white balls are identical, maybe the number of distinct sequences is just 1 for each type.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nTotal number of ways to arrange 4 black and 4 white balls is 8! / (4!4!) = 70.\n\nNow, the number of alternating sequences is 2 (for starting with B or W) times the number of ways to arrange the remaining balls in their respective positions.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for each starting color, the arrangement is fixed in terms of positions.\n\nSo, for starting with black: positions 1,3,5,7 are black, and positions 2,4,6,8 are white.\n\nSince all black balls are identical and all white balls are identical, the number of distinct sequences starting with black is 1 (since all black positions are filled by any black ball, and similarly for white).\n\nSimilarly, starting with white would also give 1 distinct sequence.\n\nTherefore, total number of alternating sequences is 2.\n\nBut that seems too small. I must be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it in terms of permutations where colors alternate.\n\nFor sequences starting with black: the number of ways is the number of ways to choose which black balls go into positions 1,3,5,7, and which white balls go into positions 2,4,6,8.\n\nSince all black balls are identical, the specific arrangement doesn't matter as long as positions 1,3,5,7 are black and positions 2,4,6,8 are white.\n\nSimilarly for starting with white.\n\nWait, but actually, if all black balls are identical and all white balls are identical, then there is only one way to arrange them in an alternating sequence starting with black or white.\n\nSo, total number of alternating sequences is 2.\n\nBut that can't be right because intuitively, there should be more than one way to arrange them in an alternating fashion if the balls are distinguishable, but since they are identical, maybe it's just 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that even though the balls are identical in color, they are distinct in some other way, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAssuming all balls of the same color are identical, then the number of distinct sequences is indeed 2: one starting with black and alternating, and one starting with white and alternating.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 2.\n\nThe total number of possible sequences is the number of ways to arrange 4 black and 4 white balls, which is 8! / (4!4!) = 70.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/70 = 1/35.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. \\frac{1}{35} seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the probability step by step.\n\nThe first ball can be either black or white, so probability 1.\n\nIf the first ball is black, then the second must be white. The probability of drawing a white ball second is 4/7 (since there are 4 white balls left out of 7 total).\n\nThen, the third ball must be black, with probability 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nThe fourth ball must be white, probability 3/5.\n\nThe fifth ball must be black, probability 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nThe sixth ball must be white, probability 2/3.\n\nThe seventh ball must be black, probability 1/2.\n\nThe eighth ball must be white, probability 1/1.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is (4/7) * (1/2) * (3/5) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (1/2) * 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the first ball is white, then the sequence is white, black, white, black, etc., with similar probabilities.\n\nSo, total probability is 2 * [(4/7) * (1/2) * (3/5) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (1/2) * 1].\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, compute (4/7) * (1/2) = 4/14 = 2/7.\n\nThen, 2/7 * (3/5) = 6/35.\n\nThen, 6/35 * (1/2) = 6/70 = 3/35.\n\nThen, 3/35 * (2/3) = 6/105 = 2/35.\n\nThen, 2/35 * (1/2) = 2/70 = 1/35.\n\nThen, 1/35 * 1 = 1/35.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/35.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider both sequences, starting with black and starting with white, each with probability 1/35, then total probability would be 2*(1/35) = 2/35.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step approach, I considered both sequences separately, but actually, since there are two possible starting colors, and each sequence has its own probability, I should sum the probabilities for both sequences.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I multiplied the probabilities for one sequence and then doubled it for the other sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recalculate.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nThe probability for the sequence starting with black: B, W, B, W, B, W, B, W.\n\nThe probability for this specific sequence is:\n\nP(B first) = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nThen, P(W second | B first) = 4/7.\n\nP(B third | B first, W second) = 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nP(W fourth | previous) = 3/5.\n\nP(B fifth | previous) = 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nP(W sixth | previous) = 2/3.\n\nP(B seventh | previous) = 1/2.\n\nP(W eighth | previous) = 1/1.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n(1/2) * (4/7) * (1/2) * (3/5) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (1/2) * 1.\n\nLet's compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, 1/2 * 4/7 = 4/14 = 2/7.\n\nThen, 2/7 * 1/2 = 2/14 = 1/7.\n\nThen, 1/7 * 3/5 = 3/35.\n\nThen, 3/35 * 1/2 = 3/70.\n\nThen, 3/70 * 2/3 = 6/210 = 1/35.\n\nThen, 1/35 * 1/2 = 1/70.\n\nThen, 1/70 * 1 = 1/70.\n\nSo, the probability for the sequence starting with black is 1/70.\n\nSimilarly, the probability for the sequence starting with white: W, B, W, B, W, B, W, B.\n\nFollowing similar steps:\n\nP(W first) = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nP(B second | W first) = 4/7.\n\nP(W third | W first, B second) = 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nP(B fourth | previous) = 3/5.\n\nP(W fifth | previous) = 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nP(B sixth | previous) = 2/3.\n\nP(W seventh | previous) = 1/2.\n\nP(B eighth | previous) = 1/1.\n\nSo, the probability for this sequence is:\n\n(1/2) * (4/7) * (1/2) * (3/5) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (1/2) * 1.\n\nAgain, computing step by step:\n\n1/2 * 4/7 = 4/14 = 2/7.\n\n2/7 * 1/2 = 2/14 = 1/7.\n\n1/7 * 3/5 = 3/35.\n\n3/35 * 1/2 = 3/70.\n\n3/70 * 2/3 = 6/210 = 1/35.\n\n1/35 * 1/2 = 1/70.\n\n1/70 * 1 = 1/70.\n\nSo, the probability for the sequence starting with white is also 1/70.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of both sequences, which is 1/70 + 1/70 = 2/70 = 1/35.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 1/35.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\frac{1}{8}\n\nB. \\frac{1}{7}\n\nC. \\frac{1}{40}\n\nD. \\frac{1}{35}\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \\frac{1}{35}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ \\dfrac{1}{35}} \\]"
