The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the excerpt above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the U.S. presidential election of 1864 between Abraham Lincoln and George McClellan. The excerpt provides some detailed information about the election results and the demographics that supported each candidate. My task is to determine which conclusion is best supported by this excerpt.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given:\n\n- Lincoln was reelected with 78% of the Union electorate casting ballots.\n\n- He won the Electoral College by a landslide: 212 to McClellan's 21.\n\n- Lincoln received 55% of the popular vote, which was the third-largest in the 19th century.\n\n- McClellan only won New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky.\n\n- Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel.\n\n- Democrats were strongest in cities and among Irish- and German-Americans.\n\n- Lincoln received an estimated 78% of the vote from Union soldiers and sailors.\n\n- Republicans gained seats in Congress, retaining control with 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate.\n\n- Republicans took back several state legislatures and lost only the governorship of New Jersey.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states.\n\nHmm, this seems plausible. New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky are mentioned as states McClellan won, and these were likely less populated compared to other Northern states. But I need to verify this.\n\nWait, New Jersey was a relatively populous state, especially in urban areas. Delaware is smaller, and Kentucky was a border state with a significant population. So, maybe this isn't entirely accurate. Plus, the excerpt doesn't provide specific population data for each state.\n\nB. Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.\n\nThis seems like a strong possibility. Given that the election took place during the Civil War, and Lincoln was the incumbent president leading the Union, his reelection could be linked to Union military successes.\n\nMoreover, the support from Union soldiers and sailors\u201478% of their votes going to Lincoln\u2014suggests that those directly involved in the war effort strongly backed him. This could indicate that they approved of his leadership and the progress being made in the war.\n\nC. The Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in the Election of 1864.\n\nThis option raises some questions. The Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, declaring that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were free. However, in 1864, the South was still in rebellion, and it's unlikely that newly freed slaves in Confederate states were able to vote, as those areas were not under Union control.\n\nAdditionally, the excerpt doesn't mention African American voters or their impact on the election. While the Emancipation Proclamation was a significant factor in the war and likely influenced Northern support for Lincoln, it's not directly addressed in this excerpt.\n\nD. Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf.\n\nThis option suggests that Lincoln actively campaigned for Republican candidates in Congress, which helped them gain seats and retain control.\n\nHowever, the excerpt states that Republicans gained seats in Congress and retained unassailable control, but it doesn't explicitly mention Lincoln campaigning on their behalf. While it's possible that Lincoln supported Republican candidates, the excerpt doesn't provide direct evidence of his campaigning efforts.\n\nGiven this information, option B seems the most directly supported by the excerpt. The strong support from Union military personnel and the general Northern population suggests that Lincoln's handling of the war was viewed positively, leading to his reelection.\n\nBut let's double-check. The excerpt mentions that Republicans drew support from various groups, including native-born farmers, skilled workers, professionals, New Englanders, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were stronger in cities and among Irish and German immigrants.\n\nThis demographic breakdown aligns with the idea that Lincoln had broad-based support from those who likely supported the Union cause and his leadership in the war.\n\nOption A, while tempting, isn't as strongly supported because the specific states McClellan won weren't necessarily less populated; New Jersey, for example, had significant urban centers.\n\nOption C lacks support because the excerpt doesn't mention African American voters or the Emancipation Proclamation's direct impact on voting in the South.\n\nOption D assumes that Lincoln campaigned for Republican candidates, which isn't directly stated in the excerpt. While it's plausible, we don't have enough information to confirm it.\n\nTherefore, the best-supported conclusion is option B: Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
