                    "text": "So I've got this situation here where a property owner wrote up an agreement to sell a piece of real estate to his neighbor for $200,000, signed it, and gave it to the neighbor. The neighbor came back with a bank check for the full amount, demanding the deed, but the property owner changed his mind, returned the money, and refused to hand over the deed. Now, the neighbor is suing for specific performance, which means they want the court to force the property owner to go through with the sale as agreed.\n\nThe property owner is defending by saying that the neighbor didn't accept the agreement's terms and didn't sign the document. So, the question is, is the court likely to rule in favor of the neighbor?\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in contract law, for a contract to be binding, there needs to be an offer and an acceptance of that offer, along with consideration, which is something of value exchanged between the parties.\n\nIn this case, the property owner wrote up an agreement of sale for $200,000 and signed it. That sounds like an offer to sell the property. The neighbor then provided a bank check for the full sale price. That seems like an acceptance of the offer and the consideration being paid.\n\nHowever, the property owner is arguing that the neighbor didn't expressly accept the terms and didn't sign the document. So, maybe there was no formal acceptance.\n\nBut, the neighbor's action of tendering the full sale price could be seen as an acceptance through conduct. In contract law, acceptance can sometimes be implied by actions, not just by signing a document.\n\nLet me consider that. If the neighbor brought the full amount of money as specified in the agreement, that action shows that they agree to the terms of the sale. It's like saying, \"Yes, I agree to buy the property for $200,000, here's the money.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the neighbor's conduct was sufficient to create a binding contract, even without a signed document from them.\n\nAdditionally, the property owner prepared the agreement containing the agreed terms and signed it, which shows their intention to be bound by those terms.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA. No, because the neighbor did not expressly state that he accepted the agreement.\n\nB. No, because the neighbor had to put his signature on the document to make it a binding contract.\n\nC. Yes, because the neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\nD. Yes, because the property owner created a binding contract when he prepared an agreement containing the agreed terms.\n\nFrom my understanding, option C seems correct. The neighbor's action of tendering the full sale price is a manifestation of their assent to the terms of the agreement, creating a binding contract.\n\nBut let's look at each option more carefully.\n\nOption A: No, because the neighbor did not expressly state that he accepted the agreement.\n\nWell, the neighbor didn't say in words, \"I accept,\" but their action of bringing the full amount can be seen as an express acceptance through conduct. So, this option might not be accurate.\n\nOption B: No, because the neighbor had to put his signature on the document to make it a binding contract.\n\nWhile signatures are often required for contracts involving real estate due to the Statute of Frauds, which generally requires certain contracts to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged, in this case, it's the neighbor who is seeking enforcement, not the property owner. Moreover, the property owner signed the document, which is the one being enforced against. So, perhaps the lack of the neighbor's signature isn't fatal to the contract's enforceability, especially since the neighbor has acted in a way that indicates acceptance.\n\nOption C: Yes, because the neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\nThis seems solid. Tendering the full sale price is a clear indication that the neighbor agrees to the terms and is ready to perform their part of the bargain.\n\nOption D: Yes, because the property owner created a binding contract when he prepared an agreement containing the agreed terms.\n\nWait a minute. The property owner prepared and signed the agreement, but it was an offer. The neighbor needed to accept that offer for a contract to be formed. So, just because the property owner prepared it doesn't automatically make it a binding contract unless there was acceptance.\n\nTherefore, option D might be incomplete because it doesn't consider the neighbor's acceptance.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to be the most accurate.\n\nBut let's think about the Statute of Frauds again. In real estate transactions, contracts for the sale of land typically must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. Here, the property owner is the one being asked to perform (i.e., to convey the deed), and he signed the agreement. The neighbor, as the buyer, is seeking to enforce the agreement against the seller.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the requirement of a signed writing is to protect the seller from being held to a contract that they didn't agree to. Since the property owner signed the agreement, that protection is met.\n\nThe fact that the neighbor didn't sign might be relevant if the neighbor were being sued, but in this case, it's the neighbor who is seeking enforcement, and the property owner is the one who signed the agreement.\n\nMoreover, the neighbor's tender of the full purchase price can be seen as consideration and as an acceptance of the offer.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the court is likely to rule in favor of the neighbor, enforcing the contract through specific performance.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Yes, because the neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
