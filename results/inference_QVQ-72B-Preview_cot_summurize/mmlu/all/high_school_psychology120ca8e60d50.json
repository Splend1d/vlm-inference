                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a pigeon that's been trained to peck at a green light, but then it also pecks at a yellow light. And I need to figure out which psychological concept this illustrates. The options are generalization, discrimination, extinction, or spontaneous recovery. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of learning, probably operant conditioning since we're dealing with a pigeon pecking at lights.\n\nStarting with generalization: I think this is when an organism responds similarly to different stimuli that are similar to the originally trained stimulus. So, if the pigeon was trained to peck at green, and now it's pecking at yellow, which is a different color but still a light, maybe it's generalizing the response from green to yellow.\n\nDiscrimination seems like the opposite of generalization. It's when an organism learns to respond differently to similar stimuli. So, if the pigeon was supposed to peck only at green and not at yellow, but it's pecking at yellow anyway, that doesn't sound like discrimination. Maybe it's failing to discriminate between green and yellow, but that's not the same as learning to discriminate.\n\nExtinction is when a learned response decreases in frequency because the reinforcement is no longer presented. But in this case, the pigeon is still pecking, just at a different light. So, I don't think extinction applies here.\n\nSpontaneous recovery is when a response that has been extinguished reappears after some time without any further training. But again, that doesn't seem to fit the scenario here. The pigeon was trained to peck at green and is now pecking at yellow, which doesn't involve extinction and recovery.\n\nLet me think about this again. If the pigeon was reinforced for pecking at green, and now it's pecking at yellow, which is similar to green, maybe it's generalizing the response to similar stimuli. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the pigeon is being tested to see if it can distinguish between green and yellow, and it's not able to do so. In that case, it might be a failure in discrimination. But the question says \"this illustrates,\" meaning it's showing an example of one of these concepts.\n\nI need to consider the context. The pigeon was trained to peck at green, and now it's pecking at yellow. Is this an example of generalization or discrimination?\n\nLet me look up the definitions to make sure.\n\nUpon checking, generalization in learning refers to the tendency to respond similarly to stimuli that are similar to the trained stimulus. So, if the pigeon was trained to peck at green and now pecks at yellow, it might be because yellow is similar enough to green that it triggers the same response.\n\nDiscrimination, on the other hand, is the ability to distinguish between different stimuli and respond differently to them. If the pigeon was trained to peck at green but not at yellow, and it refrains from pecking at yellow, that would be discrimination. But in this case, it's pecking at yellow, which suggests it's not discriminating between the two colors.\n\nExtinction would involve the pigeon stopping its response to the green light because reinforcement is no longer provided. Spontaneous recovery would be the re-emergence of that response after a period without reinforcement.\n\nGiven that, the scenario seems to align most closely with generalization. The pigeon is responding to a stimulus that is similar to the trained stimulus.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a twist. Perhaps the pigeon was trained to peck at green and was reinforced for that, and then without any additional training, it starts pecking at yellow. That might suggest that the reinforcement for pecking at green generalized to yellow.\n\nAlternatively, if the pigeon was punished for pecking at yellow or not reinforced, it should learn to discriminate between green and yellow. But in this case, it's pecking at yellow anyway.\n\nI think the most straightforward explanation is generalization. The pigeon has learned to associate pecking with the green light and is now extending that behavior to a similar stimulus, yellow light.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the pigeon was in a Skinner box, and pecking at the green light was reinforced with food. Then, if the color is changed to yellow and it still pecks, it might be because the yellow light is similar enough to green that it triggers the same response.\n\nIf it were discrimination, the pigeon would be trained to peck only at green and not at yellow. But in this scenario, it's not mentioned that it was trained to avoid pecking at yellow.\n\nExtinction would involve the pigeon stopping its pecking behavior at green because reinforcement is no longer provided, which isn't the case here.\n\nSpontaneous recovery would involve the pigeon starting to peck again after a period of extinction, which also doesn't fit the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be A. generalization.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the process again:\n\n- The pigeon was trained to peck at green.\n\n- Now, it pecks at yellow.\n\n- Yellow is similar to green.\n\n- The pigeon is responding to yellow in the same way as green.\n\nThis suggests that the pigeon is generalizing its response to a similar stimulus.\n\nSo, I conclude that the correct answer is A. generalization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ generalization}} \\]"
