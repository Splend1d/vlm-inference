                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about an author who wrote a screenplay based on his novel called \"Quiet Winter.\" He gave 25% of any future royalties from this screenplay to his friend, who had helped him out financially when he was starting as a writer. Then, unfortunately, the author died in a car accident after finishing the screenplay. After that, a movie studio bought the screenplay from the author's estate and made a movie called \"Quiet Winter,\" which became really successful. Now, the friend is trying to get her 25% of the movie royalties from the author's estate. The question is, in this situation, will the friend most likely win or lose?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, there's an assignment of future royalties. The author promised his friend 25% of any royalties from the screenplay, whether it's made into a movie or a stage play. This was in writing, which is important because assignments of future rights often require some form of written agreement to be enforceable.\n\nThen, the author dies, and his estate sells the screenplay to a movie studio, which makes a successful movie. Now, the friend is suing the estate to get her share of the royalties.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Lose, because under the circumstances, an assignment of future rights is unenforceable.\n\nB. Lose, because the attempted gift of royalties failed for non-delivery.\n\nC. Win, because she was an intended beneficiary.\n\nD. Win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n\nAlright, let's consider each option.\n\nStarting with option A: lose because the assignment of future rights is unenforceable under the circumstances. Hmm, but the assignment was in writing, which seems pretty solid. Generally, assignments of contract rights, including future royalties, are enforceable if they're made in good faith and don't violate any laws or the terms of the original contract. So, unless there's something specific about this situation that makes the assignment unenforceable, this option doesn't seem too strong.\n\nOption B: lose because the attempted gift of royalties failed for non-delivery. Okay, so this seems to suggest that the author tried to give the royalties to his friend but didn't actually deliver them before he died. But, in this case, the assignment was in writing, which might be sufficient to transfer the rights, especially if the law recognizes written assignments as effective without further delivery. So, again, unless there's a specific requirement for delivery beyond the written agreement, this might not hold up.\n\nNow, option C: win because she was an intended beneficiary. This is interesting. In contract law, third parties who are intended beneficiaries of a contract can sometimes enforce the contract. So, if the friend was specifically named to receive the royalties, she might have standing to enforce the assignment. However, I think this might be a bit simplistic. In some jurisdictions, assignments of future rights need to follow certain procedures to be enforceable, and just being an intended beneficiary might not be enough if there are other legal requirements not met.\n\nFinally, option D: win because the assignment of future rights is enforceable. This seems straightforward. If the assignment was properly made in writing and doesn't violate any laws or the terms of the original agreement, then it should be enforceable. The friend should be entitled to her 25% of the royalties.\n\nBut wait, there might be more to this. Since the author died before the royalties were paid, does that affect anything? Probably not, because the assignment was made during his lifetime, and it should bind his estate unless there's something in his will or estate plan that says otherwise.\n\nAlso, the screenplay was sold to the movie studio by the estate. Did the estate know about the assignment to the friend? If it was in writing, they should have been aware of it. If they ignored it and sold the screenplay without accounting for the assignment, that could be a problem for them.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the assignment was revocable or irrevocable. If it was irrevocable, then even if the author wanted to change it later, he couldn't. If it was revocable, then he could have changed it, but in this case, he died before revoking it, so it should still hold.\n\nAlso, was the friend required to do anything to accept the assignment? Sometimes, assignments are conditional, but in this scenario, it seems straightforward: the author assigns 25% of future royalties to his friend, no conditions attached.\n\nI think the key here is that the assignment was in writing, which makes it enforceable. Unless there's some other factor at play that's not mentioned in the scenario, the friend should be entitled to her share of the royalties.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, I would say the friend will most likely win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
