Dione.\" Okay, I need to figure out which one of these isn't a Galilean moon. I remember that the Galilean moons are moons of Jupiter that were discovered by Galileo Galilei. I think there are four of them, but I might be wrong. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that Ganymede is one of the Galilean moons. I think it's the largest moon in the solar system, bigger even than Mercury. So, that should be one of them.\n\nNext, Callisto is another one. It's also a large moon, and it's known for having a lot of craters. So, that should be part of the Galilean moons too.\n\nThen there's Europa. I've heard about Europa because it's thought to have an ocean under its icy surface, which could potentially harbor life. So, that's another one of the Galilean moons.\n\nNow, Dione. I know that Dione is a moon, but I think it's a moon of Saturn, not Jupiter. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I think Saturn has several moons, like Titan, Enceladus, and Dione. So, if Dione is a moon of Saturn, then it shouldn't be considered a Galilean moon of Jupiter.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should make sure about the definition of Galilean moons. As far as I know, the Galilean moons are the four largest moons of Jupiter\u2014Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto\u2014and they were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. So, those are the ones that are commonly referred to as the Galilean satellites.\n\nTherefore, since Dione is a moon of Saturn, it's not one of the Galilean moons of Jupiter. So, the answer should be D. Dione.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other moons of Jupiter that are sometimes considered Galilean moons. No, I don't think so. The canonical Galilean moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Anything else is not a Galilean moon.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Dione is not one of the Galilean moons. It's a moon of Saturn, not Jupiter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
