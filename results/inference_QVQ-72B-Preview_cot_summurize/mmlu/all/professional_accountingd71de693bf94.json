                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving Mentor Co., a U.S. corporation that owns 100% of a Swiss corporation. The functional currency for the Swiss subsidiary is the Swiss franc. At the end of the year, there's a remeasurement gain of $25,000 and a translation gain of $40,000. The question is asking how much of this should be recognized as a foreign currency gain in Mentor's income statement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between remeasurement and translation of foreign currency financial statements. Remeasurement is typically done for foreign operations that are an integral part of the reporting entity, and it involves converting foreign currency financial statements into the reporting currency using current exchange rates for assets and liabilities and historical rates for equity items. On the other hand, translation is used for foreign operations that are considered self-sustaining and involves converting foreign currency financial statements into the reporting currency using historical exchange rates for assets and liabilities and current rates for equity items.\n\nIn this case, since the Swiss franc is the functional currency, it suggests that the Swiss subsidiary is operating in an environment where the Swiss franc is the primary currency, and thus, the translation method might be applicable.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions both remeasurement and translation gains, which implies that both processes are being applied, possibly because there are different elements being treated differently under U.S. GAAP.\n\nNow, according to U.S. GAAP, specifically ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the treatment of translation gains and losses depends on whether the foreign entity's functional currency is the same as the reporting currency or different.\n\nIn this scenario, the functional currency is the Swiss franc, which is different from the reporting currency of Mentor Co., presumably the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the financial statements of the Swiss subsidiary need to be translated into U.S. dollars.\n\nThe choice of translation method (temporal method or current rate method) depends on the functional currency. Since the functional currency is the local currency (Swiss franc), the temporal method would not be applicable. Instead, the current rate method should be used, where assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate, and shareholders' equity items are translated at historical exchange rates.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions both remeasurement and translation gains, which suggests that there might be elements being remeasured and others being translated.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's some confusion here. Let me think again.\n\nRemeasurement is typically used when the functional currency is the reporting currency, meaning that the foreign entity's operations are integrated with those of the parent company, and its financial statements are expressed in the parent's reporting currency. In such cases, assets and liabilities are remeasured at current exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates during the period.\n\nBut in this case, the functional currency is the Swiss franc, not the U.S. dollar, so remeasurement wouldn't be the primary method. Maybe the remeasurement gain is related to specific monetary items or transactions denominated in foreign currencies within the Swiss subsidiary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remeasurement gain is related to the parent company's books when dealing with intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me look up the relevant accounting standards.\n\nAccording to ASC 830, when the functional currency is the local currency (in this case, the Swiss franc), the financial statements should be translated using the current rate method. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are generally recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in shareholders' equity, not in the income statement.\n\nHowever, remeasurement gains or losses on transactions denominated in a foreign currency that is not the functional currency are recognized in the income statement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the $25,000 gain is from remeasuring specific monetary items, while the $40,000 gain is from translating the entire financial statements.\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount to be recognized in the income statement as a foreign currency gain.\n\nGiven that translation gains are typically recognized in other comprehensive income, not in the income statement, the $40,000 gain would likely be recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe $25,000 remeasurement gain, on the other hand, would be recognized in the income statement.\n\nTherefore, the amount to be recognized in the income statement as a foreign currency gain would be the remeasurement gain of $25,000.\n\nWait, but the options include $0, $25,000, $40,000, and $65,000. So, option B is $25,000.\n\nBut let's make sure. Maybe there's a scenario where both gains are recognized in the income statement.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem likely based on ASC 830. Translation gains are generally excluded from the income statement and instead reported in other comprehensive income.\n\nTherefore, only the remeasurement gain of $25,000 should be recognized in the income statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total foreign currency gain is the sum of both gains, which would be $65,000, but that doesn't align with standard accounting practices.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the remeasurement gain is from the parent company's perspective, while the translation gain is from consolidating the subsidiary's financial statements.\n\nIn that case, the translation gain would still go to other comprehensive income, and the remeasurement gain would be recognized in the income statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be $25,000.\n\nI think the answer is B. $25,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
