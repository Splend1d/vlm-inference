                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1, given that points (x, y) in R\u00b2 are chosen uniformly at random within the region defined by 0 < |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the region where points can be chosen. The inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 defines a set of points inside the square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1), but excluding the points on the axes where x=0 or y=0, because of the condition 0 < |x| + |y|.\n\nSo, the region is like a diamond shape centered at the origin, excluding the origin itself and the points where x or y is zero.\n\nWait, actually, |x| + |y| < 1 is the standard form for a diamond (or square rotated 45 degrees) centered at the origin with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1). The condition 0 < |x| + |y| just excludes the points on the axes where x=0 or y=0, including the origin.\n\nBut actually, |x| + |y| < 1 is the inequality for the interior of this diamond, excluding the boundary. The condition 0 < |x| + |y| means we exclude the axes where x=0 or y=0, including the origin.\n\nSo, the region in question is the interior of the diamond but without the axes.\n\nNow, since it's a uniform distribution, the probability that 2(x + y) > 1 is the area where 2(x + y) > 1 divided by the total area of the region where 0 < |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the total area of the region where 0 < |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nThe area inside |x| + |y| < 1 is a square with side length sqrt(2), but actually, no, it's a diamond shape, which is a square rotated by 45 degrees, and its area can be calculated.\n\nActually, the area inside |x| + |y| < 1 is a square with side length sqrt(2), but no, that's not right.\n\nWait, |x| + |y| = 1 is a square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1). The area inside this square (|x| + |y| < 1) is a square with side length sqrt(2)? Wait, no.\n\nActually, the distance from the origin to any side of the square is 1 along the axes. Since it's a square rotated by 45 degrees, its side length can be found using the formula for the side length given the diagonal.\n\nThe diagonal of the square is 2 (from (-1,0) to (1,0)), so the side length s of the square is s = d/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, actually, the area inside |x| + |y| < 1 is a square with side length sqrt(2), but the area should be (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nHowever, I think there's a mistake here. The area inside |x| + |y| < 1 is actually the area of a square with side length sqrt(2), but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1). The distance from the origin to each vertex is 1, and the side length between (1,0) and (0,1) can be found using the distance formula: sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut actually, the area inside |x| + |y| < 1 is the area of this square, which is indeed 2.\n\nHowever, the condition is 0 < |x| + |y| < 1, which excludes the points on the axes where x=0 or y=0.\n\nBut since these axes have zero area, excluding them doesn't change the total area, so the total area remains 2.\n\nWait, but actually, the axes have zero area because they have zero width, so the total area is still 2.\n\nNow, I need to find the area where 2(x + y) > 1 within this region.\n\nLet's first express 2(x + y) > 1 as x + y > 1/2.\n\nSo, I need to find the area where x + y > 1/2 within the region defined by |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nFirst, plot the region |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nThis is a square centered at the origin, rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\n\nNow, the inequality x + y > 1/2 defines a half-plane above the line x + y = 1/2.\n\nI need to find the area of the intersection of this half-plane with the interior of the square |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nSince the distribution is uniform, the probability is the ratio of this area to the total area of the square, which is 2.\n\nBut wait, actually, the total area is 2, as we calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to find the area where x + y > 1/2 within |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nLet's consider the square |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nThis square is symmetric about both axes, and the line x + y = 1/2 intersects this square.\n\nTo visualize this, let's find the points where the line x + y = 1/2 intersects the boundary of the square |x| + |y| = 1.\n\nThe boundary of the square is |x| + |y| = 1.\n\nThere are four cases to consider, depending on the signs of x and y:\n\n1. x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0: x + y = 1\n\n2. x \u2265 0, y < 0: x - y = 1\n\n3. x < 0, y \u2265 0: -x + y = 1\n\n4. x < 0, y < 0: -x - y = 1\n\nNow, the line x + y = 1/2 intersects the square |x| + |y| = 1 in the first quadrant.\n\nLet's find the intersection points.\n\nIn the first quadrant (x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0), the boundary is x + y = 1.\n\nSet x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1.\n\nThese two equations intersect at x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1, but they are parallel lines.\n\nWait, no, x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1 are two parallel lines.\n\nThe boundary of the square in the first quadrant is x + y = 1.\n\nThe line x + y = 1/2 is parallel and lies below it.\n\nSo, in the first quadrant, x + y > 1/2 is the region between x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1.\n\nWait, no, the square's boundary is x + y = 1, so x + y < 1 is inside the square.\n\nTherefore, the region where x + y > 1/2 within the square is the area between x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1 in the first quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, we need to consider other quadrants.\n\nBut since the square is symmetric, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since the region |x| + |y| < 1 is symmetric about both axes, and the inequality x + y > 1/2 is also symmetric in a certain way, perhaps we can find the area in one quadrant and then multiply by 4.\n\nWait, but x + y > 1/2 is not symmetric about the axes; it's symmetric about the line y = -x.\n\nBut perhaps considering symmetry isn't the easiest approach here.\n\nLet me try to find the area where x + y > 1/2 within |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nFirst, note that |x| + |y| < 1 is the interior of the square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\n\nThe inequality x + y > 1/2 defines a half-plane above the line x + y = 1/2.\n\nI need to find the area of the intersection of this half-plane with the interior of the square.\n\nTo find this area, perhaps I can integrate over the region where x + y > 1/2 and |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nAlternatively, since the square is symmetric and the inequality x + y > 1/2 is symmetric about the line y = -x, perhaps I can divide the region into parts where the inequality holds.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find the points where the line x + y = 1/2 intersects the boundary of the square |x| + |y| = 1.\n\nLet's consider the four quadrants separately.\n\nFirst quadrant (x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0):\n\nHere, the boundary is x + y = 1.\n\nThe line x + y = 1/2 intersects this boundary when x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1, but since x + y = 1 is the boundary, the line x + y = 1/2 is entirely inside the square in this quadrant, except for the part where x + y > 1/2.\n\nWait, no, the boundary is x + y = 1, and x + y < 1 is inside the square.\n\nThe line x + y = 1/2 is parallel to x + y = 1 and lies entirely within the square in this quadrant.\n\nTherefore, in the first quadrant, the region where x + y > 1/2 is the area between x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1.\n\nThis is a triangular region.\n\nTo find the area of this triangle, we can find its base and height.\n\nThe line x + y = 1/2 intersects the x-axis at (1/2, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 1/2).\n\nSimilarly, x + y = 1 intersects the axes at (1,0) and (0,1).\n\nTherefore, the triangle in question has vertices at (1/2, 0), (1,0), and (1,1/2).\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, the region where x + y > 1/2 within |x| + |y| < 1 in the first quadrant is bounded by x + y = 1/2, x + y = 1, x = 0, and y = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set up the integral.\n\nIn the first quadrant, x and y are both positive, and |x| + |y| < 1 implies x + y < 1.\n\nThe inequality x + y > 1/2 defines the region where x + y > 1/2 and x + y < 1.\n\nSo, in this quadrant, the region of interest is bounded by x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1.\n\nTo find the area, we can integrate dy dx or dx dy over this region.\n\nLet's set up the integral:\n\nArea = \u222b (from x = 1/2 to x = 1) \u222b (from y = 1/2 - x to y = 1 - x) dy dx\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to y:\n\n\u222b (from x = 1/2 to x = 1) [(1 - x) - (1/2 - x)] dx\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\n(1 - x) - (1/2 - x) = 1 - x - 1/2 + x = 1/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b (from x = 1/2 to x = 1) 1/2 dx = (1/2)(1 - 1/2) = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the area in the first quadrant is 1/4.\n\nSince the square is symmetric about both axes, the area where x + y > 1/2 in the second, third, and fourth quadrants can be found similarly.\n\nHowever, in the second quadrant (x < 0, y \u2265 0), the boundary is -x + y = 1, or y = 1 + x.\n\nThe inequality x + y > 1/2 becomes x + y > 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, in the third quadrant (x < 0, y < 0), the boundary is -x - y = 1, or y = -1 - x.\n\nAnd in the fourth quadrant (x \u2265 0, y < 0), the boundary is x - y = 1, or y = x - 1.\n\nWe need to find the area where x + y > 1/2 within these regions.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the square is symmetric, perhaps the area where x + y > 1/2 is equal in all four quadrants.\n\nBut in the first quadrant, we have 1/4 area.\n\nIn the second quadrant, x < 0, y \u2265 0.\n\nThe boundary is y = 1 + x.\n\nThe inequality x + y > 1/2 becomes x + y > 1/2.\n\nSo, y > 1/2 - x.\n\nBut since x < 0 and y \u2265 0, we need to see where y > 1/2 - x within y \u2265 0 and x < 0.\n\nThis seems a bit messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the entire region |x| + |y| < 1 and subtract the area where x + y \u2264 1/2.\n\nBut that might not be simpler.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use symmetry to find the area where x + y > 1/2.\n\nSince the region |x| + |y| < 1 is symmetric about both axes, and the inequality x + y > 1/2 is symmetric about the line y = -x, perhaps I can find the area in one quadrant and multiply by 4.\n\nBut in the first quadrant, we have the area as 1/4, so total area would be 1, but that can't be right because the total area is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area where x + y > 1/2 is only in certain quadrants.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in some quadrants, x + y > 1/2 doesn't intersect the square |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nFor example, in the third quadrant where x < 0 and y < 0, x + y is negative, so x + y > 1/2 is impossible since x + y < 0 < 1/2.\n\nTherefore, in the third quadrant, there is no area where x + y > 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, in the second quadrant (x < 0, y \u2265 0), x + y > 1/2 implies y > 1/2 - x.\n\nBut since x < 0 and y \u2265 0, and the boundary is y = 1 + x, we need to see where y > 1/2 - x within y \u2265 0 and x < 0.\n\nSimilarly, in the fourth quadrant (x \u2265 0, y < 0), x + y > 1/2 implies y > 1/2 - x.\n\nBut since y < 0, y > 1/2 - x only if 1/2 - x < 0, i.e., x > 1/2.\n\nBut in the fourth quadrant, the boundary is y = x - 1, and x + y > 1/2 becomes x + y > 1/2.\n\nSo, perhaps in the second and fourth quadrants, there are areas where x + y > 1/2.\n\nLet me check the second quadrant.\n\nIn the second quadrant, x < 0, y \u2265 0.\n\nThe boundary is y = 1 + x.\n\nThe inequality x + y > 1/2 becomes y > 1/2 - x.\n\nSo, we need y > 1/2 - x within y \u2265 0 and x < 0.\n\nLet's find the intersection points.\n\nSet y = 1 + x and y = 1/2 - x.\n\nSo, 1 + x = 1/2 - x => 2x = -1/2 => x = -1/4.\n\nThen y = 1 + (-1/4) = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the line y = 1/2 - x intersects the boundary y = 1 + x at (-1/4, 3/4).\n\nSimilarly, in the second quadrant, y \u2265 0 and x < 0.\n\nThe region where y > 1/2 - x is above the line y = 1/2 - x.\n\nSo, the area where x + y > 1/2 in the second quadrant is the area bounded by y = 1 + x, y = 1/2 - x, and y = 0.\n\nThis forms a triangular region with vertices at (-1,0), (-1/4, 3/4), and (0,1).\n\nWait, but in the second quadrant, x < 0 and y \u2265 0.\n\nThe boundary is y = 1 + x.\n\nThe line y = 1/2 - x intersects y = 1 + x at (-1/4, 3/4).\n\nAlso, y = 1/2 - x intersects y = 0 when x = 1/2.\n\nBut in the second quadrant, x < 0, so x = -1/2 is not in the second quadrant.\n\nWait, x = 1/2 is in the first quadrant.\n\nTherefore, in the second quadrant, the region where y > 1/2 - x is bounded by y = 1 + x, y = 1/2 - x, and y = 0.\n\nSo, the area is the area of the triangle with vertices at (-1,0), (-1/4, 3/4), and (0,1).\n\nWait, but (0,1) is on the boundary y = 1"
