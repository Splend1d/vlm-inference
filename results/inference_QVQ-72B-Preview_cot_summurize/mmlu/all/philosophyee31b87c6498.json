The question is: \"Gauthier claims that there is nothing for practical rationality to be besides:\n\nA. moral justification.\n\nB. deliberative justification.\n\nC. epistemic justification.\n\nD. an illusion.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to know who Gauthier is and what he thinks about practical rationality. I recall that David Gauthier is a philosopher known for his work in ethics and social contract theory. He wrote a book called \"Morals by Agreement\" where he develops a contractarian approach to morality.\n\nNow, practical rationality refers to the reasoning we use when making decisions about what to do, as opposed to theoretical rationality, which is about believing what is true. So, practical rationality is about action and choice.\n\nThe question is asking what Gauthier thinks practical rationality amounts to. The options are:\n\nA. Moral justification.\n\nB. Deliberative justification.\n\nC. Epistemic justification.\n\nD. An illusion.\n\nI need to understand what each of these terms means in this context.\n\nStarting with moral justification: this seems to involve justifying actions based on moral principles or norms. So, if an action is morally justified, it means it's the right thing to do according to some moral theory.\n\nDeliberative justification seems to be about justifying choices based on one's desires, preferences, or reasons for action. It's about what makes sense given one's goals and beliefs.\n\nEpistemic justification is more about belief formation. It's about having reasons to believe something is true, not about acting on those beliefs.\n\nAn illusion would suggest that practical rationality doesn't really exist or doesn't have any substantive content.\n\nGiven that Gauthier is a moral philosopher working in contractarianism, it's likely that he sees practical rationality as connected to moral justification. His project in \"Morals by Agreement\" is to show that moral norms can be derived from self-interested rationality through a process of agreement among individuals.\n\nSo, perhaps he views practical rationality as being co-extensive with moral justification, meaning that what is rationally required is also morally required, and vice versa.\n\nBut wait, let's think carefully. Gauthier is a contractualist, and his approach is to show that moral norms are those that rational individuals would agree to in a hypothetical bargaining situation. So, in his view, moral norms are justified by the rational agreements of self-interested parties.\n\nDoes this mean that practical rationality is nothing but moral justification? Or is it the other way around: moral justification is a part of practical rationality?\n\nI think it's the latter. Gauthier argues that moral norms are grounded in practical rationality, meaning that moral norms are justified by practical rationality. But that doesn't necessarily mean that practical rationality is identical to moral justification.\n\nMaybe practical rationality encompasses more than just moral considerations. It could include self-interest, prudential concerns, and so on.\n\nWait, but Gauthier's project is to show that moral norms are required by practical rationality, even for self-interested agents. So, in his view, practical rationality leads inevitably to moral norms.\n\nBut does he claim that practical rationality is nothing but moral justification? That seems strong. Maybe he thinks that practical rationality requires moral justification, but it's not exhausted by it.\n\nLet me consider the other options.\n\nDeliberative justification: this seems more about individual decision-making based on one's preferences and beliefs. Gauthier might see this as a part of practical rationality, but his focus is more on interpersonal agreements and the derivation of moral norms.\n\nEpistemic justification: this is about justified belief, not about action. So, it seems separate from practical rationality, which is about action.\n\nAn illusion: this would suggest that practical rationality doesn't exist or doesn't have any real content. But Gauthier is known for defending the objectivity and rational basis of moral norms, so this doesn't seem consistent with his position.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, I need to choose which one best fits Gauthier's view.\n\nGiven that his work is primarily about deriving moral norms from practical rationality, it's plausible that he sees practical rationality as essentially involving moral justification.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Maybe practical rationality includes both moral and non-moral components, and Gauthier only claims that the moral component is essential.\n\nHowever, based on his emphasis on moral agreements as the foundation of practical rationality, I'm leaning towards A. moral justification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he sees practical rationality as involving deliberative justification, but his focus is on how such deliberation leads to moral norms.\n\nBut if that's the case, then why not say that practical rationality is deliberative justification, and moral justification is a subset of that?\n\nWait, maybe practical rationality is broader, encompassing both moral and non-moral deliberation, but Gauthier is claiming that the moral component is essential or primary.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look back at the question.\n\n\"Gauthier claims that there is nothing for practical rationality to be besides:\n\nA. moral justification.\n\nB. deliberative justification.\n\nC. epistemic justification.\n\nD. an illusion.\"\n\nPerhaps the key is understanding what \"to be\" means here. Is it asking for the essence of practical rationality, or for its primary function?\n\nIf it's asking for the essence, then saying it's nothing but moral justification would be a strong claim, suggesting that practical rationality is identical to moral justification.\n\nIf it's asking for its primary function, then perhaps practical rationality is primarily about moral justification.\n\nBut the wording is \"there is nothing for practical rationality to be besides,\" which seems to suggest that practical rationality is co-extensive with whatever is being proposed.\n\nGiven that, and considering Gauthier's focus on moral norms, I'm going to go with A. moral justification.\n\nI think the answer is A. moral justification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
