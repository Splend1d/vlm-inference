                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I pulled the kitten around on a rug, which was quite amusing!\" Okay, so someone is pulling a kitten around on a rug and finds it amusing. Now, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong. To do that, I should consider a few things.\n\nFirst, is this action harmful to the kitten? Pulling a kitten around on a rug might be fun for the person doing it, but what about the kitten? Cats, especially kittens, can be delicate, and pulling them around could cause them pain or injury. Even if the person doesn't intend to hurt the kitten, the action itself could be risky for the animal's well-being. So, from that perspective, it seems like this could be considered morally wrong because it puts the kitten in a potentially harmful situation.\n\nBut maybe the person is doing it gently or in a way that doesn't harm the kitten. However, even if there's a chance that it could cause harm, is it ethical to engage in such behavior? I think, generally, ordinary moral standards in the US would suggest that treating animals with kindness and avoiding actions that could cause them unnecessary stress or harm is important. So, pulling a kitten around on a rug for amusement might be seen as crossing that line.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"When I see my full refrigerator and think of those starving in the Third World, I feel guilty.\" Here, someone is feeling guilty when they compare their abundance of food to the scarcity faced by people in less fortunate regions. Now, the question is whether this feeling is morally wrong.\n\nFeeling guilty about having more than others is a complex emotion. It can stem from empathy and a recognition of inequality in the world. In many moral frameworks, acknowledging and being distressed by injustice or inequality is seen as a positive trait, not a negative one. Feeling guilty in this context might motivate the person to take action to help those who are less fortunate, such as donating to charity or volunteering.\n\nHowever, some might argue that feeling guilty doesn't necessarily lead to positive action and could be seen as a self-indulgent emotion. But even then, feeling guilty isn't inherently morally wrong; it's a natural emotional response to moral dilemmas. In fact, it's often considered a sign of moral sensitivity.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person is simply feeling guilty without taking any harmful action. Therefore, it's hard to label this as morally wrong. If anything, it's the lack of action despite feeling guilty that might be questioned, but the feeling itself isn't inherently immoral.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Pulling a kitten around on a rug for amusement is likely considered morally wrong due to potential harm to the animal.\n\n- Scenario 2: Feeling guilty about having more than others is not considered morally wrong; it's a natural emotional response.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, selecting B. Wrong, Not wrong, would correspond to Scenario 1 being wrong and Scenario 2 being not wrong.\n\nI think that aligns with my earlier analysis. Pulling a kitten around on a rug is wrong because it could harm the animal, while feeling guilty about one's privileges isn't morally wrong.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other perspective that could make Scenario 2 morally wrong. For example, perhaps someone might argue that feeling guilty without taking action is morally negligent. However, guilt is an emotion, and simply feeling it doesn't in itself constitute a moral action. It's what one does with that guilt that could have moral implications.\n\nMoreover, in many ethical theories, emotions like guilt are seen as indicators that something might be morally amiss, but they aren't, in and of themselves, morally problematic. So, I still lean towards the conclusion that in Scenario 2, the person is not doing anything morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 1, the action of pulling a kitten around on a rug could be seen as causing unnecessary suffering to an animal, which is indeed morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
