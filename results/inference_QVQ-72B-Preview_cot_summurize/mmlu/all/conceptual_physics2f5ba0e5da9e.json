                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about two charged particles that are released from rest and both start to accelerate, and I need to figure out whether their charges are the same or opposite. The options are A. The same, B. Opposite, C. Either of these, or D. Need more information.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how charged particles interact. I know that like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. So, if both particles are accelerating, that means there's some force acting on them, right? And since they're released from rest, the only force acting on them should be the electric force due to each other.\n\nNow, if both particles are accelerating, and both are increasing in acceleration, that suggests that the force between them is increasing over time. Because acceleration is proportional to the net force via Newton's second law, F = ma.\n\nSo, if both particles are accelerating more and more, that means the force between them is getting stronger over time.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether this would happen if the charges are the same or opposite.\n\nLet's consider the case where the charges are the same. That means they repel each other. When they're released from rest, they start moving apart due to the repulsive force. As they move apart, the distance between them increases, and since the electric force follows Coulomb's law, which states that F = k * q1 * q2 / r^2, where r is the distance between them, the force should decrease as r increases.\n\nBut the problem says that both particles are increasing in acceleration, which would imply that the force is increasing over time, not decreasing.\n\nThat seems contradictory. If they're moving apart and the force is supposed to decrease, but the acceleration is increasing, which suggests the force is increasing. So, maybe having like charges isn't consistent with the observed behavior.\n\nLet me think about the opposite case, where one particle has a positive charge and the other has a negative charge. In this case, they attract each other.\n\nWhen they're released from rest, they move towards each other due to the attractive force. As they move closer, the distance r decreases, and according to Coulomb's law, the force increases as r decreases.\n\nSo, as they get closer, the force gets stronger, which would cause their acceleration to increase over time.\n\nThis seems to match the scenario described in the problem.\n\nTherefore, if the charges are opposite, the force between them increases as they move closer, leading to increasing acceleration.\n\nOn the other hand, if the charges are the same, the force decreases as they move apart, which would lead to decreasing acceleration, contrary to what's observed.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, it seems that the charges must be opposite for both particles to experience increasing acceleration.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this.\n\nSuppose both particles have the same charge, say both positive. They repel each other, so they move away from each other. As r increases, the force decreases, which should cause their acceleration to decrease, not increase. But the problem states that both increase in acceleration. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nSimilarly, if one is positive and the other is negative, they attract each other, move towards each other, r decreases, force increases, leading to increasing acceleration. That fits the description.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect this? For example, are there any external fields or other charges around that might influence the particles?\n\nThe problem says \"immediately after release from rest,\" so probably in an isolated system with only these two charges interacting.\n\nTherefore, the only force acting on them is the electric force between them.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the charges must be opposite for both particles to experience increasing acceleration.\n\nWait, but option C says \"either of these.\" That would mean it could be either the same or opposite charges. But from my reasoning, it seems that only opposite charges would lead to increasing acceleration.\n\nOption D is \"need more information,\" but I think the information given is sufficient to determine the answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Opposite.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that with the same charges, acceleration could increase.\n\nIf both charges are the same, they repel each other, move apart, and as r increases, force decreases, which should lead to decreasing acceleration, not increasing.\n\nUnless there's some other force acting on them, which the problem doesn't mention.\n\nTherefore, I don't see how having the same charges would lead to increasing acceleration.\n\nHence, the answer must be B. Opposite.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
