                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about economics. It says that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, and there's $500 of new spending. The question is, what's the largest total increase in GDP that can result from this $500 of new spending? The options are $400, $500, $625, and $2,500.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is. From what I remember in economics class, MPC is the proportion of additional income that a person spends on consumption. So, if MPC is 0.8, it means that for every additional dollar of income, people spend 80 cents and save 20 cents.\n\nNow, the question is about new spending injected into the economy, which is $500. I think this is like an initial injection of spending, and then it causes a multiplier effect in the economy.\n\nI recall that there's a concept called the multiplier effect in macroeconomics, which explains how an initial increase in spending can lead to a larger increase in national income (GDP). This happens because the money spent by one person becomes income for another person, and so on, in a chain reaction.\n\nSo, the formula for the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 minus MPC). Given that MPC is 0.8, the multiplier would be 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5.\n\nThat means that every dollar of new spending should theoretically lead to a $5 increase in total GDP.\n\nBut in this question, the new spending is $500, not per dollar. So, if the multiplier is 5, then $500 multiplied by 5 should be $2,500.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is $625. Is there a different formula I should be using?\n\nLet me double-check the multiplier formula. The formula for the multiplier is indeed 1 / (1 - MPC), which in this case is 1 / 0.2 = 5.\n\nSo, if the initial spending is $500, and the multiplier is 5, then the total increase in GDP should be $500 multiplied by 5, which is $2,500.\n\nBut maybe there's something I'm missing here. Let me think about the marginal propensity to save (MPS). I know that MPS is 1 - MPC, which in this case would be 0.2.\n\nThe multiplier can also be thought of as 1 / MPS, which is again 1 / 0.2 = 5.\n\nSo, that confirms the multiplier is 5.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the multiplier effect in terms of the change in GDP, which is:\n\nChange in GDP = Initial Spending * Multiplier\n\nSo, Change in GDP = $500 * 5 = $2,500\n\nThat seems straightforward. But let's see why $625 might be a distractor.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different approach using the consumption function. The consumption function is C = C0 + MPC * Y, where C is consumption, C0 is autonomous consumption, MPC is the marginal propensity to consume, and Y is income.\n\nBut in this problem, it's not clear if we need to use the consumption function directly. It seems like the multiplier approach is more applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the spending multiplier in terms of the marginal propensity to consume.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the formula for the multiplier effect in terms of the marginal propensity to consume:\n\nMultiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC)\n\nWhich is what I already used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the formula for the multiplier in terms of investment spending.\n\nWait, in the Keynesian cross model, the multiplier is indeed 1 / (1 - MPC), which is what I used.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be $2,500.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that could reduce the multiplier effect. For example, if there are leakages like savings, taxes, or imports.\n\nIn the basic multiplier model, we assume that the only leakage is saving, since MPC is defined in terms of consumption and income.\n\nIf there are other leakages like taxes or imports, the multiplier would be smaller.\n\nBut the question doesn't mention any other leakages, so I think it's safe to assume that the only leakage is saving.\n\nTherefore, the multiplier should be 1 / (1 - MPC) = 5.\n\nThus, the total increase in GDP from $500 of new spending should be $500 * 5 = $2,500.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. $2,500.\n\nJust to make sure, let's see if $625 makes sense in any way.\n\n$625 could be $500 divided by 0.8, but that doesn't seem right in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the marginal propensity to save.\n\nIf MPC is 0.8, then MPS is 0.2.\n\nIf we mistakenly used MPS in the multiplier formula, we might get $500 / 0.2 = $2,500, which brings us back to the previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we mistakenly used the formula for the multiplier as 1 / MPS, which is indeed 5, and then multiplied by the initial spending, we still get $2,500.\n\nI don't see a way that $625 would be the correct answer based on the information given.\n\nSimilarly, $400 would be 0.8 * $500, which is the initial consumption, but that doesn't account for the multiplier effect.\n\n$500 is just the initial spending, but again, that doesn't consider the subsequent rounds of spending.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. $2,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ \\$2,500} \\]"
