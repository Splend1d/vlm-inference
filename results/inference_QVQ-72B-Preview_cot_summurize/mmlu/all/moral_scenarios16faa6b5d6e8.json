                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I yanked the toddler by the arm when he was playing.\n\nScenario 2: Before I left for the trip, I lit a candle in order to make the house smell nicer and let it continue after I left.\n\nOkay, so both scenarios involve some action by the main character, and I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: Yanking a toddler by the arm while they're playing.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a physical action towards a young child. Toddlers are small and not very strong, so pulling them by the arm could potentially hurt them or cause them to fall and injure themselves. In general, causing harm or potential harm to a child is considered morally wrong. But was this action intentional harm, or was it perhaps a corrective measure?\n\nThe way it's phrased, \"I yanked the toddler by the arm when he was playing,\" it seems like it might have been a reactive action, maybe to prevent the toddler from doing something dangerous or to get their attention. However, even in those cases, yanking a toddler by the arm could be seen as inappropriate because it might cause injury.\n\nI recall that in child care and parenting advice, it's generally recommended to avoid pulling or yanking children by their arms because of the risk of injury, such as pulling a finger or joint out of place. So, from a safety perspective, this action seems questionable.\n\nMoreover, from a moral standpoint, treating a child in a rough manner could be seen as abusive or at least neglectful of their well-being. Abuse can be physical, emotional, or neglectful, and any action that could cause physical harm would fall under physical abuse.\n\nBut, I should consider the context. If the toddler was in immediate danger, say about to run into the street, and the person yanked them to prevent that, it might be seen as a necessary action to prevent harm, even if it was a bit rough. However, the scenario just says \"when he was playing,\" which doesn't necessarily imply immediate danger.\n\nSo, without more context, it's hard to judge the intention behind the action. But based on ordinary moral standards in the US, especially those related to child care and protection, yanking a toddler by the arm seems like a morally wrong action because of the potential for causing harm.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Leaving a candle burning when you leave the house.\n\nThis scenario involves lighting a candle to make the house smell nicer and then letting it continue burning after you've left for a trip.\n\nFirst off, I know that candles can be fire hazards. If left unattended, they can tip over, ignite nearby materials, or burn out of control, leading to house fires. In fact, statistics show that candles are a common cause of home fires.\n\nSo, from a safety perspective, leaving a candle burning when you're not at home is risky because there's no one there to monitor it or respond if something goes wrong. It's like playing with fire, literally.\n\nBut, was this done with malicious intent, or was it just a thoughtless action?\n\nThe scenario says the person lit the candle to make the house smell nicer and then let it continue after leaving. It seems like they didn't consider the potential dangers or forgot to extinguish it before departing.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, it depends on whether the person was aware of the risks and chose to ignore them, or if they were simply unaware of the dangers.\n\nIf they knew that leaving a candle burning could lead to a fire but decided to do it anyway, that would be morally wrong because they're knowingly putting their property and possibly their neighbors at risk.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were unaware of the risks and had no intention of causing harm, it might be seen as a mistake rather than a morally wrong action.\n\nHowever, in many moral frameworks, ignorance doesn't excuse responsibility for the consequences of one's actions, especially if the risk was reasonably foreseeable.\n\nMoreover, in the US, there are fire safety codes and common-sense guidelines that emphasize never leaving candles unattended, especially when leaving the house.\n\nGiven that, it's reasonable to assume that an adult should know better than to leave a candle burning when they're not home.\n\nTherefore, even if the person didn't intend to cause harm, the action is still morally wrong because of the foreseeable risks involved.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\nScenario 1: Yanking a toddler by the arm is likely morally wrong due to the potential harm to the child.\n\nScenario 2: Leaving a candle burning when you leave the house is also morally wrong due to the potential fire hazard.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but the options are labeled as A. Wrong, Wrong B. Wrong, Not wrong C. Not wrong, Wrong D. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, option A is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to both scenarios being morally wrong.\n\nBut I should double-check if there's any possibility that one of these actions could be considered not wrong under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Scenario 1, even if the action was intended to prevent immediate danger, yanking a toddler by the arm is generally considered unsafe and potentially harmful, so it's hard to justify it as not wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, while leaving a candle burning might seem like a harmless act, the potential risks are too significant to disregard it as morally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
