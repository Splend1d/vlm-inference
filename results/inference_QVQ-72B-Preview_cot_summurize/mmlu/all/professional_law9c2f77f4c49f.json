                    "text": "So I've got this problem about property conveyance, and it's a bit tricky with all the conditions and life estates. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a grantor who conveys his apartment building to his son for life. So, the son gets a life estate in the property. Then, it goes to the grantor's uncle for life, but there's a condition: if the uncle moves to another state, then it goes to the grantor's brother for the life of the uncle. Okay, that's a bit confusing.\n\nSo, if the uncle doesn't move to another state, then after his life estate, it goes to the heirs of the uncle. But if he does move to another state, then after his life estate, it goes to the grantor's brother for the life of the uncle, and then to the heirs of the brother.\n\nWait, no. Let's read it again carefully: \"to my son for life, then to my uncle for life, but if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle, then to the heirs of my uncle if my uncle does not move to another state, and to the future interests of my brother if my uncle does move to another state.\"\n\nHmm, that's still a bit unclear. Let's try to rephrase it.\n\nThe primary conveyance is to the son for life. Then, it's to the uncle for life, but with a condition that if the uncle moves to another state, then it goes to the brother for the life of the uncle. After that, there are further provisions depending on whether the uncle moves or not.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If the uncle does not move to another state, then after his life estate, it goes to the heirs of the uncle.\n\n- If the uncle does move to another state, then after the brother's interest, it goes to the heirs of the brother.\n\nAlright, so we have a conditional conveyance here, depending on whether the uncle moves to another state or not.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime. So, the son has a life estate, and the brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving to another state.\n\nLet's recall some basic property law concepts:\n\n- A life estate is an interest in property that lasts for the lifetime of a particular person.\n\n- A remainder is an interest that follows a life estate.\n\n- A contingent remainder is one that depends on the occurrence of a specified event.\n\n- A vested remainder is one where the person is certain to take possession at some point in the future, without any conditions.\n\n- An executory interest is an interest that will become possessory upon the occurrence of a specified event.\n\n- A shifting executory interest is one where the interest shifts to another party if a condition is met.\n\nGiven that, let's analyze the brother's interest.\n\nThe brother's interest is triggered if the uncle moves to another state. So, it's contingent on that event happening.\n\nDuring the son's lifetime, the son has a life estate, and then it's supposed to go to the uncle for life, unless he moves to another state, in which case it goes to the brother for the life of the uncle.\n\nSo, the brother's interest is not certain; it depends on the uncle moving to another state.\n\nTherefore, it's a contingent remainder, because it's a future interest that depends on a condition happening.\n\nBut let's look at the options again:\n\nA. estate pur autre vie.\n\nI believe this refers to an estate for the life of another person. So, an estate pur autre vie is an estate that lasts for the life of someone other than the person holding the estate. In this case, the brother's interest is for the life of the uncle, so it could be considered an estate pur autre vie.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime. So, the son has a life estate, and then it's to the uncle for life, with the condition about moving.\n\nSo, during the son's lifetime, the brother doesn't have any interest yet, because the son is still alive. The brother's interest would come into play after the son's life estate, and only if the uncle has moved to another state.\n\nTherefore, during the son's lifetime, the brother's interest is a contingent remainder pur autre vie, because it's contingent on the uncle moving to another state, and it's an estate for the life of the uncle.\n\nWait, but option B says \"contingent remainder pur autre vie,\" which seems to fit.\n\nOption C is \"vested remainder pur autre vie.\" That would require the brother's interest to be certain, which it's not, because it depends on the uncle moving to another state.\n\nOption D is \"shifting executory interest pur autre vie.\" An executory interest is one that will become possessory upon the occurrence of a specified event. In this case, the brother's interest would become possessory if the uncle moves to another state, so it could be considered an executory interest. However, \"shifting\" typically means that the interest shifts from one party to another without anyone actually taking possession. I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is B. contingent remainder pur autre vie.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nDuring the son's lifetime, the brother has no present interest; it's a future interest that depends on the uncle moving to another state.\n\nSo, it's a contingent remainder, and since it's for the life of another person (the uncle), it's pur autre vie.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think it's A, because that just refers to the type of estate, not considering the contingency.\n\nOption C, vested remainder, would require the brother's interest to be certain, which it's not, due to the condition about the uncle moving.\n\nOption D, shifting executory interest, might be a possibility, but I think contingent remainder is more accurate in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. contingent remainder pur autre vie.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
