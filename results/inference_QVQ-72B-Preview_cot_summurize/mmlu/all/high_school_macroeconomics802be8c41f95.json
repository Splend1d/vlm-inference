                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which option would increase the spending multiplier. I remember that the spending multiplier is related to how much additional income leads to more spending in the economy. So, it's about consumption and saving, right?\n\nFirst, let's recall what the spending multiplier is. I think it's the ratio of the change in total spending to the initial change in spending. Like, if someone gets extra income, they spend some of it, and that spending creates more income for others, and so on. The multiplier captures how much the total spending increases as a result of that initial change.\n\nSo, the formula for the spending multiplier is 1 divided by (1 minus the marginal propensity to consume). Or, in other words, 1 over the marginal propensity to save. Wait, is that right? Let me think.\n\nActually, the standard formula for the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 - MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. So, MPC is the fraction of additional income that people spend. The higher the MPC, the larger the multiplier, because more of the additional income is being spent rather than saved.\n\nSo, option A says an increase in the marginal propensity to consume. If MPC increases, the denominator in the multiplier formula gets smaller (since you're subtracting a larger number from 1), so the overall multiplier gets larger. That makes sense. So, option A seems like it would increase the spending multiplier.\n\nOption B mentions a decreased velocity of money. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands in the economy. If velocity decreases, does that mean people are holding onto their money longer, maybe saving more? If so, that might imply a decrease in spending, which would suggest a decrease in the multiplier. But the question is asking which option increases the multiplier, so decreased velocity of money probably doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is an increase in the marginal propensity to save. Since MPS is 1 minus MPC, if MPS increases, MPC decreases. So, if MPS goes up, MPC goes down, and that would make the multiplier smaller, right? Because the formula is 1 over (1 - MPC). So, if MPC decreases, the multiplier decreases. Therefore, option C would decrease the multiplier, not increase it.\n\nOption D is an increase in the real interest rate. Higher interest rates typically encourage saving and discourage spending. So, if interest rates go up, people might save more and spend less. That would mean a lower MPC and a higher MPS, which would lead to a smaller multiplier. So, this option also seems to decrease the multiplier.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option A\u2014an increase in the marginal propensity to consume\u2014seems to be the one that would increase the spending multiplier.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I should look up the formula for the multiplier to make sure I have it right. Okay, searching for \"spending multiplier formula.\"\n\nOh, here it is. The formula for the simple spending multiplier is indeed 1 / (1 - MPC). So, yes, if MPC increases, the denominator gets smaller, and the whole fraction gets larger. So, higher MPC leads to a higher multiplier.\n\nRegarding option B, decreased velocity of money. Velocity is defined as the number of times money changes hands in a given period. If velocity decreases, it might indicate that transactions are slowing down, possibly because people are saving more or spending less. If people are saving more, that would increase MPS and decrease MPC, leading to a smaller multiplier. So, yes, decreased velocity would likely correspond to a decrease in the multiplier.\n\nOption C is straightforward: increasing MPS directly decreases MPC, which in turn decreases the multiplier.\n\nOption D, increasing real interest rates, generally leads to increased saving and reduced consumption. So, again, MPC decreases, and MPS increases, resulting in a smaller multiplier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: an increase in the marginal propensity to consume.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect the multiplier in a different way. For example, changes in government spending or taxes could influence the multiplier, but those aren't listed in the options. So, based on the given choices, option A is indeed the one that would increase the spending multiplier.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
