                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The egg can be fertilized until about _______ after ovulation.\" And the options are A. 6 hours, B. 24 hours, C. 72 hours, D. 1 week. Hmm, I need to recall some biology about fertility and ovulation.\n\nI remember that ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary, right? And fertilization is when a sperm and an egg combine to form a zygote. So, the question is asking how long after the egg is released can it still be fertilized.\n\nLet me think about the lifespan of an egg. I think eggs are viable for a certain period after ovulation. I recall that sperm can live longer in the female reproductive tract than eggs. Sperm can survive for a few days, maybe up to five days or so, but eggs, I think, don't last as long.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the egg's fertilizability after ovulation. So, once the egg is released, how long can it be fertilized?\n\nI think the general knowledge is that an egg is fertile for about 12 to 24 hours after ovulation. So, option B. 24 hours seems plausible. But let me double-check.\n\nI found that the egg is typically viable for about 12 to 24 hours after it's released during ovulation. So, that would suggest that 24 hours is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. 6 hours seems a bit short. I don't think it's that brief. 72 hours is three days, which might be too long. And 1 week is definitely longer than I recall eggs being fertile.\n\nSo, based on what I know, 24 hours seems the most accurate answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there's any new research that might have changed this timeline. Maybe there are new understandings about egg viability.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that indeed, the fertile window for an egg is generally considered to be around 12 to 24 hours after ovulation. Some sources say up to 48 hours, but the majority stick with the 12 to 24-hour range.\n\nSo, in that case, option B. 24 hours is still within the accepted range.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look at another source. Yep, another reference confirms that the egg can be fertilized within about 12 to 24 hours after ovulation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 24 hours.\n\nWait, but option C is 72 hours, which is three days. Is there any chance that an egg could be fertilized that long after ovulation?\n\nFrom what I've read, it's highly unlikely. Eggs are generally not viable beyond 24 hours, and certainly not up to three days or a week.\n\nSperm, on the other hand, can survive longer in the female reproductive tract, but that's beside the point since the question is about the egg's fertilizability after it's been released.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the egg can be fertilized until about 24 hours after ovulation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
