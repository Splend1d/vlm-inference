                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems like I need to evaluate each scenario and decide if they're wrong or not, and then pair them up.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I never took my baby out in the sun because I thought he was a vampire.\"\n\nOkay, so this is about a parent who believes their baby is a vampire and therefore avoids taking the baby out in the sun. Now, vampires are mythical creatures that are said to be sensitive to sunlight, right? But obviously, babies are not vampires; they're human infants. So, this belief seems based on a fictional concept and not reality.\n\nBut let's think about the implications. If a parent believes their baby is a vampire and avoids sunlight, that could mean the baby isn't getting enough sun exposure, which is necessary for vitamin D production. Lack of vitamin D can lead to health problems like rickets or other issues. So, by depriving the baby of sunlight based on a mistaken belief, the parent might be harming the baby's health.\n\nMoreover, holding such a belief could indicate that the parent isn't seeking proper medical care or isn't addressing the baby's needs appropriately. It's important for parents to recognize and meet their children's physical and emotional needs, and this kind of irrational belief could interfere with that.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems like the parent is neglecting the baby's well-being due to a delusional idea. That sounds pretty morally wrong to me.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I learn the texting lingo teens use so I can pass as a teen.\"\n\nOkay, so here's someone who is trying to learn the current slang and texting language used by teenagers in order to appear as a teenager themselves. Now, this could be for various reasons. Maybe they want to fit in with a younger crowd, or perhaps they're trying to communicate better with their own children or students.\n\nBut the question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nFirst off, learning new language and trying to understand different generations isn't inherently bad. It can be a way to bridge generational gaps and improve communication. However, if the person is trying to pass themselves off as a teenager online or in situations where age verification is important, that could be problematic.\n\nFor example, if an adult is pretending to be a teenager on a social media platform where there are age restrictions for safety reasons, that could be considered deceptive and potentially harmful. It might violate terms of service or put themselves or others at risk.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person is just learning the lingo to understand their kids better or to stay updated with current trends, that seems harmless and even positive.\n\nBut the scenario says \"so I can pass as a teen,\" which suggests that the intention is to appear younger than they are, possibly in contexts where age matters.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that the person is trying to deceive others about their age, which could be seen as dishonest. Deception is generally considered morally wrong, especially if it could lead to harm or if it violates someone's trust.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't specify the context or the intentions behind passing as a teen, so it's a bit ambiguous. It could be harmless role-playing, or it could be part of a more malicious scheme.\n\nGiven that, I think it's important to consider the potential consequences of such an action. If passing as a teen could lead to misleading others or breaking rules about age appropriateness, then it could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nBut compared to Scenario 1, where a parent is potentially harming their child's health due to a delusional belief, this seems less severe. The first scenario involves parental neglect based on a fantastical belief, while the second involves attempting to appear younger, possibly for social reasons.\n\nSo, weighing these two scenarios, I need to decide which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nGiven that, I would say that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong because it involves harming a child's well-being through neglect based on a baseless belief.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, is more nuanced. While attempting to pass as a teen could be seen as deceptive, it's not necessarily clear that it causes direct harm, unless there are specific contexts where such deception is harmful.\n\nTherefore, I would lean towards saying that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong, depending on the context.\n\nBut the question is asking for which of these two scenarios does the main character do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
