                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Ray and Dorothy and their abilities to cook and pull weeds. It says that both can do both tasks on a Saturday afternoon, but there are differences in how many weeds they can pull for every hour of cooking. Specifically, for every hour Ray spends cooking, he can pull 50 weeds, and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds for every hour she spends cooking. And based on this information, I need to choose which statement is correct regarding their comparative advantages.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what absolute and comparative advantages are. Absolute advantage is when someone can produce more of something with the same amount of resources, or in the same time, better than another person. Comparative advantage is a bit different; it's about who can produce something at a lower opportunity cost, meaning who has to give up less of something else to produce that something.\n\nSo, in this scenario, Ray and Dorothy both have absolute advantages in something, but I need to figure out their comparative advantages in cooking and pulling weeds.\n\nLet's list out what we know:\n\n- For every hour Ray spends cooking, he can pull 50 weeds.\n\n- For every hour Dorothy spends cooking, she can pull 100 weeds.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Usually, we'd have information about how much they can cook in a certain amount of time, but here it's phrased differently. It seems like it's saying that for every hour Ray spends cooking, he can pull 50 weeds, which might imply that pulling weeds is his alternative activity. Similarly for Dorothy.\n\nMaybe I need to rephrase it to understand better. Perhaps it's saying that if Ray spends an hour cooking, he could alternatively have spent that hour pulling weeds, and in that hour, he could pull 50 weeds. Similarly, if Dorothy spends an hour cooking, she could have spent that hour pulling weeds and pulled 100 weeds.\n\nSo, essentially, the number of weeds they can pull per hour of cooking represents their opportunity cost of cooking.\n\nWait, actually, opportunity cost is the benefit you give up when you choose one option over another. So, in this case, if Ray chooses to cook for an hour, he gives up the opportunity to pull 50 weeds. Similarly, if Dorothy chooses to cook for an hour, she gives up the opportunity to pull 100 weeds.\n\nSo, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's opportunity cost of cooking is 100 weeds.\n\nNow, comparative advantage is about who has the lower opportunity cost in producing a good or service.\n\nSo, in terms of cooking, Ray has a lower opportunity cost (50 weeds) compared to Dorothy (100 weeds). Therefore, Ray has a comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nSimilarly, if we look at pulling weeds, we need to find out their opportunity costs in terms of cooking.\n\nIf Ray pulls weeds for an hour, what does he give up? Well, if he spent that hour cooking instead, he could have pulled 50 weeds, so his opportunity cost of pulling weeds is the cooking he gives up.\n\nWait, no. The statement says that for every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds. I think I need to interpret this differently.\n\nMaybe it's saying that for every hour Ray spends cooking, he can pull 50 weeds if he chose to pull weeds instead. So, his opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds.\n\nTherefore, Ray has a comparative advantage in cooking because his opportunity cost is lower.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the opportunity costs more formally.\n\nLet's assume that both Ray and Dorothy have a certain number of hours they can work. Say, both work for 1 hour.\n\nIn that hour, if Ray cooks, he could have pulled 50 weeds.\n\nIf Dorothy cooks, she could have pulled 100 weeds.\n\nSo, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds.\n\nTherefore, Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, meaning he has a comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nSimilarly, for pulling weeds, Ray's opportunity cost is the cooking he gives up, which is some amount, and similarly for Dorothy.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many weeds they can pull per hour of cooking.\n\nIf Ray can pull 50 weeds for every hour of cooking, that means that for every hour he spends cooking, he gives up pulling 50 weeds.\n\nSimilarly, Dorothy gives up pulling 100 weeds for every hour she spends cooking.\n\nTherefore, Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, so he has a comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nConversely, Dorothy has a higher opportunity cost in cooking, meaning she has a comparative advantage in pulling weeds.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems correct: Ray cooks, since he has a comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A says: Ray pulls weeds, since he has absolute advantage in cooking.\n\nWait, absolute advantage is about who can produce more with the same resources. Here, Dorothy can pull more weeds per hour of cooking (100 vs. 50), so she has an absolute advantage in pulling weeds, I think.\n\nBut absolute advantage isn't the same as comparative advantage, which is what determines who should specialize in what.\n\nOption B says: Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has absolute advantage in cooking.\n\nAgain, absolute advantage might not determine comparative advantage.\n\nOption C: Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, Ray has the comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nOption D: Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nThis seems to align with my earlier conclusion.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe create a table of their production possibilities.\n\nLet's assume both work 1 hour.\n\nIf Ray cooks for 1 hour, he could have pulled 50 weeds.\n\nIf he pulls weeds for 1 hour, I don't know how many weeds he can pull in total, but from the information given, it seems like for every hour of cooking, he can pull 50 weeds. Maybe pulling weeds is his alternative activity.\n\nSimilarly, if Dorothy cooks for 1 hour, she could have pulled 100 weeds.\n\nSo, their production possibilities could be:\n\n- Ray:\n\n- Cooks: pulls 50 weeds\n\n- Pulls weeds: ? (unknown, but presumably more than 50 weeds since he can pull 50 weeds for every hour of cooking.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that for every hour of cooking, he can pull 50 weeds. So, if he spends the hour pulling weeds, how many does he pull?\n\nActually, the problem doesn't specify how many weeds Ray can pull in an hour if he chooses to pull weeds, only that for every hour of cooking, he can pull 50 weeds.\n\nSimilarly, Dorothy can pull 100 weeds for every hour of cooking.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps I need to interpret it as their opportunity costs.\n\nSo, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds.\n\nTherefore, Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, meaning he has a comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nHence, Ray should cook, and Dorothy should pull weeds.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nWait, but option C says Dorothy cooks because she has a comparative advantage in cooking, which contradicts my conclusion.\n\nBut according to my reasoning, Ray has the comparative advantage in cooking, so option D is correct.\n\nMaybe I should consider the rates.\n\nLet's assume that Ray can pull 50 weeds per hour of cooking, meaning if he spends an hour pulling weeds, how many does he pull?\n\nIf for every hour of cooking he can pull 50 weeds, then perhaps his pulling weeds rate is higher than that.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to rephrase.\n\nSuppose Ray spends 1 hour cooking, he could have spent that hour pulling weeds and pulled 50 weeds.\n\nSimilarly, Dorothy spends 1 hour cooking, she could have spent that hour pulling weeds and pulled 100 weeds.\n\nTherefore, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds.\n\nSince Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, he has a comparative advantage in cooking, and Dorothy has a comparative advantage in pulling weeds.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
