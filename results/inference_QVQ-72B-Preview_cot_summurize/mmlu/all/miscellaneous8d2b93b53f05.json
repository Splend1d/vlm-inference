                    "text": "So I've got this question here about decoding words using letter-sound relationships. The question is asking which of the following words cannot be decoded through knowledge of letter-sound relationships. The options are:\n\nA. Flight\n\nB. Said\n\nC. Things\n\nD. Lamp\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Decoding words using letter-sound relationships means being able to sound out a word by knowing which sounds (phonemes) correspond to which letters (graphemes). This is a key part of reading instruction, especially in phonics-based approaches.\n\nNow, for most words in English, there are predictable patterns and correspondences between letters and sounds. For example, the letter \"t\" usually makes a \"tuh\" sound, as in \"tree\" or \"top.\" However, some words don't follow these typical patterns and are considered irregular or exception words.\n\nSo, to answer this question, I need to identify which of these words is irregular and cannot be decoded using standard letter-sound relationships.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nA. Flight\n\nHmm, \"flight.\" Let's see how to decode this. The \"fl-\" at the beginning is a blend, where \"f\" is \"fuh\" and \"l\" is \"luh,\" so together they make \"flight\" sound like \"f-l-ight.\" The \"igh\" can be tricky because it can represent different sounds in different words. In \"flight,\" the \"igh\" makes a long \"i\" sound, as in \"bike.\" So, if I put it together, \"f-l-ight\" sounds like \"flight.\" Seems decodeable.\n\nWait, but is there any irregularity here? Well, \"igh\" can represent different sounds, like in \"high\" (long \"i\"), \"might\" (short \"i\"), or \"neighbour\" (long \"e\"). But in \"flight,\" it's consistently pronounced as long \"i.\" So, probably decodable.\n\nB. Said\n\nOkay, \"said.\" Let's try to decode this. The letter \"s\" is usually pronounced as \"s,\" as in \"sun\" or \"see.\" The letter \"a\" can have multiple pronunciations, but often it's a short \"a\" as in \"cat\" or a long \"a\" as in \"cake.\" The letter \"i\" here is probably silent, and \"d\" is \"d.\"\n\nIf I sound it out: \"s\" - \"a\" - \"i\" - \"d,\" it would be \"s-a-i-d,\" which sounds like \"sayd.\" But actually, the way we say \"said\" is more like \"sed\" or \"said\" with a short \"a\" sound, not \"sayd.\"\n\nSo, there seems to be a discrepancy here. The way we'd decode it based on letter-sounds doesn't match the actual pronunciation. This suggests that \"said\" might be an irregular word that can't be decoded using standard phonics rules.\n\nC. Things\n\nAlright, \"things.\" Let's break it down. \"th\" is a digraph that usually makes a \"th\" sound, as in \"think\" or \"thin.\" The \"i\" is a short \"i\" sound, as in \"sit,\" and \"ng\" is a digraph for the \"ng\" sound, as in \"sing.\"\n\nSo, putting it together: \"th\" - \"i\" - \"ng\" sounds like \"things.\" This seems consistent with standard letter-sound relationships.\n\nIs there any irregularity here? Well, sometimes \"th\" can be pronounced differently, like in \"the\" where it's a voiced sound, whereas in \"think\" it's unvoiced. But in \"things,\" it's the unvoiced \"th,\" which is standard.\n\nAlso, \"ng\" at the end of a word is typically pronounced \"ng,\" which matches here.\n\nSo, \"things\" seems decodeable.\n\nD. Lamp\n\nLastly, \"lamp.\" Let's see. \"l\" is \"l,\" \"a\" is short \"a\" as in \"cat,\" \"m\" is \"m,\" and \"p\" is \"p.\"\n\nSo, sounding it out: \"l\" - \"a\" - \"m\" - \"p\" makes \"lamp.\" This seems straightforward.\n\nAre there any irregularities in \"lamp\"? Well, sometimes \"a\" can be pronounced differently, like in \"ate\" (long \"a\"), but in \"lamp,\" it's short \"a,\" which is standard for words ending with \"mp.\"\n\nSo, \"lamp\" also seems decodeable.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only word that doesn't seem to follow standard letter-sound relationships is \"said.\" When we try to decode it based on the typical sounds of its letters, we get \"sayd,\" but the actual pronunciation is \"sed\" or \"said\" with a short \"a\" sound, and the \"i\" is silent.\n\nTherefore, \"said\" cannot be decoded through knowledge of letter-sound relationships.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
