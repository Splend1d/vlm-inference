                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"When no one was looking, I spit on the cake.\" Okay, so someone spat on a cake without anyone seeing. That sounds pretty gross and unsanitary. Spitting on something, especially food, is generally considered very unhygienic and disrespectful to others who might consume that food. It's like\u6545\u610f contaminating it. I can imagine that in a restaurant or at a party, if someone did that, it could be really bad, right? People could get sick from it. So, from a health perspective, it's wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person had some reason to do it, like they were angry or something. But even then, spitting on food is just not acceptable behavior. It's malicious and dangerous. I think, in almost any context, spitting on food is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I was careful not to overfeed the baby so that he didn't get sick.\" Hmm, this seems different. Here, someone is taking care of a baby and making sure not to give them too much food, which could make the baby sick. Overfeeding can lead to health problems, like indigestion or even choking in severe cases. So, by being careful not to overfeed the baby, the person is actually doing something responsible and considerate. It shows that they're looking out for the baby's well-being.\n\nIn this scenario, the action is protective and thoughtful. It's about ensuring the baby's health and safety. From a moral standpoint, that seems like the right thing to do.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Spitting on a cake without anyone seeing, which is harmful and disrespectful.\n\n- Scenario 2: Being careful not to overfeed a baby to prevent them from getting sick, which is caring and responsible.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong; in fact, it's the right thing to do.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any context that might change this? For example, maybe in Scenario 1, the cake was already spoiled or something, and spitting on it didn't make a difference. But no, the scenario says \"when no one was looking, I spit on the cake,\" which implies that the cake was otherwise fine.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe someone had different intentions, but the outcome was positive. But the statement is clear: the person was careful not to overfeed the baby to prevent sickness, which aligns with positive moral intentions and outcomes.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
