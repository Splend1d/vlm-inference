                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Ramanujan and Hardy are playing a game where they pick complex numbers, and I need to find out what number Ramanujan picked. The product of their numbers is 32 - 8i, and Hardy picked 5 + 3i. The options are A. 32-8i, B. 5+3i, C. 4-i, D. 4-4i.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. If Ramanujan picked a number, let's call it R, and Hardy picked H = 5 + 3i, and their product is R * H = 32 - 8i, then I can set up the equation:\n\nR * (5 + 3i) = 32 - 8i.\n\nI need to solve for R. To do that, I can divide both sides by (5 + 3i). So,\n\nR = (32 - 8i) / (5 + 3i).\n\nOkay, now I need to divide these complex numbers. To divide complex numbers, I usually multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 5 + 3i is 5 - 3i.\n\nSo, R = [(32 - 8i) * (5 - 3i)] / [(5 + 3i) * (5 - 3i)].\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the numerator:\n\n(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) = 32*5 + 32*(-3i) + (-8i)*5 + (-8i)*(-3i)\n\n= 160 - 96i - 40i + 24i\u00b2.\n\nWait, I need to remember that i\u00b2 = -1. So, plugging that in:\n\n= 160 - 96i - 40i + 24*(-1)\n\n= 160 - 136i - 24\n\n= 136 - 136i.\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to 136 - 136i.\n\nNow, the denominator:\n\n(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 25 - (3i)\u00b2\n\n= 25 - 9*(-1)\n\n= 25 + 9\n\n= 34.\n\nSo, the denominator is 34.\n\nTherefore, R = (136 - 136i) / 34.\n\nNow, I can simplify this by dividing both real and imaginary parts by 34.\n\nReal part: 136 / 34 = 4.\n\nImaginary part: -136 / 34 = -4.\n\nSo, R = 4 - 4i.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 4-4i.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the conjugate method is correct for dividing complex numbers.\n\nThen, multiplying the numerator:\n\n32*5 = 160\n\n32*(-3i) = -96i\n\n-8i*5 = -40i\n\n-8i*(-3i) = 24i\u00b2 = 24*(-1) = -24\n\nAdding them up: 160 - 96i - 40i - 24 = 136 - 136i\n\nDenominator: 5*5 - (3i)\u00b2 = 25 - (-9) = 34\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nDividing both real and imaginary parts by 34: 136/34 = 4, -136/34 = -4\n\nSo, R = 4 - 4i\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 4-4i\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D}\\ ]"
