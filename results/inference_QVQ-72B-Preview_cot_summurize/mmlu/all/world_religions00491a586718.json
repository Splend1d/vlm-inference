                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what \"janam-sakhis\" refers to in Sikh literature. The options are spiritual narratives, redemption narratives, birth narratives, and theological narratives. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Sikhism is a religion that originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region, which is now divided between India and Pakistan. The founder of Sikhism is Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and there were nine other Gurus who succeeded him, each contributing to the development of the faith.\n\nNow, the term \"janam-sakhis\" seems to be in Gurmukhi script, which is the script used for writing Punjabi, the language spoken in Punjab. \"Janam\" means birth, and \"sakhis\" means accounts or stories. So literally, \"janam-sakhis\" would translate to \"birth accounts\" or \"stories of birth.\"\n\nThat makes me think that these are narratives related to the births of the Sikh Gurus. Maybe they detail the circumstances surrounding their births, miracles, or significant events that happened around that time.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA. Spiritual narratives\n\nB. Redemption narratives\n\nC. Birth narratives\n\nD. Theological narratives\n\n\"Birth narratives\" seems the most straightforward choice based on the literal translation of \"janam-sakhis.\" But I should consider if there's more to it.\n\nSpiritual narratives could be a possibility, but that seems a bit vague. Redemption narratives might involve stories of forgiveness or salvation, which might not directly relate to births. Theological narratives would probably involve discussions about God, doctrine, or religious beliefs.\n\nBut the term \"janam-sakhis\" specifically refers to accounts of births, so I think \"birth narratives\" is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there's any chance that \"janam-sakhis\" could encompass more than just birth stories. Maybe they include other aspects of the Gurus' lives beyond their births.\n\nLet me think about it. In many religions, birth stories of prophets or holy figures are often part of a larger narrative that includes their lives and teachings. So perhaps \"janam-sakhis\" do include some spiritual or theological elements alongside the birth accounts.\n\nHowever, the primary focus seems to be on the births, so \"birth narratives\" still seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in Sikh tradition, the birth of a Guru is a significant event, often accompanied by miraculous occurrences and prophecies about the Guru's future mission.\n\nThese stories might serve to inspire faith and provide insights into the Guru's divinity and purpose. So, while they could be considered spiritual narratives, the specific emphasis on birth suggests that \"birth narratives\" is the genre being referred to here.\n\nI should also consider the historical context. The \"janam-sakhis\" likely originated soon after the birth of Guru Nanak and were passed down through oral tradition before being written down.\n\nOver time, these accounts might have been compiled and expanded to include more than just the birth stories, perhaps incorporating teachings or other significant events from the Gurus' lives.\n\nBut again, the term itself points towards birth accounts being the main focus.\n\nTo cross-verify this, I can look up some references or scholarly articles on \"janam-sakhis.\"\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that \"janam-sakhis\" are indeed birth narratives, primarily focusing on the birth and early life of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.\n\nThey are a genre of Sikh literature that provides detailed accounts of the Guru's birth, childhood, and early spiritual experiences.\n\nSo, this aligns perfectly with the option \"birth narratives.\"\n\nWhile \"spiritual narratives\" and \"theological narratives\" might be related to Sikh literature in general, they don't specifically correspond to the term \"janam-sakhis.\"\n\n\"Redemption narratives\" might involve stories of transformation or salvation, which could be part of Sikh teachings, but again, they aren't directly associated with \"janam-sakhis.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the literal translation and the available information, I can confidently say that \"janam-sakhis\" denote \"birth narratives\" in Sikh literature.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
