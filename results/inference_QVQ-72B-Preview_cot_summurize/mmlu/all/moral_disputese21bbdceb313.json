                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this question about Corvino and the \"unnaturalness\" charge. It says that this charge can carry moral weight only if those who level it can do two things. And there are four options: A, B, C, and D. I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unnaturalness\" means in this context. I think it's about behaviors or traits that are considered not natural, maybe not occurring in nature or not aligned with human nature in some way. But the question is about why this matters morally.\n\nOption A says that the person needs to (i) explain the harms of anal sex and (ii) establish that all homosexuals will inevitably suffer those harms. Hmm, this seems specific to anal sex and assumes that all homosexuals engage in it, which might not be the case. Also, it's focusing on harm, but the charge is about unnaturalness. Maybe there's a connection, but this seems too narrow.\n\nOption B suggests that the person needs to (i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnaturalness\" and (ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally. This seems logical. If someone is using the term \"unnaturalness\" as a moral criticism, they should first define what they mean by it and then explain why that definition has moral significance. Without a clear definition, the term is vague and meaningless, and without explaining why it matters morally, even if defined, it doesn't carry moral weight.\n\nOption C proposes that one needs to (i) establish that one's sexual orientation is a matter of choice and (ii) that people who choose homosexuality have an intrinsic desire for self-harm. This seems off track. First, whether sexual orientation is a choice is a separate debate, and second, linking it to self-harm seems like a stretch. The focus should be on the concept of unnaturalness, not on the choices or motivations of individuals.\n\nOption D says that one needs to (i) explain the value of naturalness and (ii) why nothing \"unnatural\" can be of value. This is interesting. It shifts the focus to the value of naturalness itself. If naturalness is valued, then anything unnatural would lack that value. But this seems to assume that naturalness is inherently good or valuable, which is a premise that needs to be justified.\n\nComparing B and D, B seems more straightforward. It requires defining unnaturalness and then explaining why that specific definition has moral significance. Option D, on the other hand, is making a stronger claim about the value of naturalness and the worthlessness of the unnatural.\n\nI think B is the more solid choice here. It's about clarity in definition and moral reasoning. If someone claims that something is unnatural and therefore bad, they need to first tell us what they mean by unnatural and then\u8bf4\u670d\u6211\u4eec why that property makes something bad.\n\nSo, according to Corvino, the \"unnaturalness\" charge can carry moral weight only if those who level it can do two things:\n\nB. (i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnaturalness\" and (ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.\n\nThis makes sense because without a clear definition and a reason why that definition should matter morally, the charge is empty and lacks any substantive moral weight.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
