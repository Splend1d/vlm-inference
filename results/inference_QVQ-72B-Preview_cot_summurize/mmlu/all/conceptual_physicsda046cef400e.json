                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"The average speed of a gazelle traveling a distance of 2 km in a time of one-half hour is...\" and then there are options from A to D. Okay, I need to find the average speed of the gazelle. I remember that speed is distance over time, right? So, if I have the distance and the time, I can just divide them to get the speed.\n\nThe distance is 2 kilometers, and the time is one-half hour. So, speed equals distance divided by time, which is 2 km divided by 0.5 hours. Let me calculate that: 2 divided by 0.5 is... well, 2 divided by 0.5 is the same as 2 multiplied by 2, because 0.5 is half of 1, so it's 4 km/h. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider for average speed? I think average speed is just the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, regardless of direction or any variations in speed during that time. So, if the gazelle traveled 2 km in half an hour, the average speed is indeed 4 km/h.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1 km/h\n\nB. 2 km/h\n\nC. 4 km/h\n\nD. greater than 4 km/h\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it should be C. 4 km/h. But let me double-check if there's any trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility of misinterpretation of units? The distance is in kilometers, and time is in hours, which matches the units for km/h. So, no issue there.\n\nWait, maybe the time is not exactly half an hour. But the problem says \"one-half hour,\" which should be 0.5 hours. Alternatively, one could think of it as 30 minutes, but since the options are in km/h, it's better to keep it in hours.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the gazelle didn't travel in a straight line. If it took a winding path, the actual distance covered could be more than 2 km, but the problem states it traveled a distance of 2 km, so I assume it's the total distance covered, not the displacement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gazelle was accelerating or decelerating, but average speed is still total distance over total time, so it should still be 4 km/h.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe the question is testing whether I remember that speed is distance over time, and it's a straightforward calculation. Sometimes, problems can be tricky with units, like mixing kilometers and miles, but here it's all in kilometers and hours.\n\nWait, maybe the gazelle rested part of the time, but the problem says it traveled a distance of 2 km in half an hour, so I assume it was moving the whole time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gazelle was going back and forth, but again, the problem specifies it traveled a distance of 2 km.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward approach is correct: average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 2 km divided by 0.5 hours, equaling 4 km/h.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the units:\n\nAverage speed = total distance / total time = 2 km / 0.5 h = 4 km/h.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 4 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
