                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is about the Democratic Party pursuing liberal social policies and which of its traditional bases it's most likely to alienate. The options are:\n\nA. People holding advanced academic degrees\n\nB. Northeastern city dwellers\n\nC. Southerners\n\nD. Jewish Americans\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what \"liberal social policies\" mean. Generally, liberal social policies tend to favor individual freedom, equality, and social justice. This could include things like supporting LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive rights, immigration reform, and perhaps more government involvement in social programs.\n\nNow, the Democratic Party is traditionally associated with liberal policies, but there might be some groups within its base that are more conservative on social issues. So, the question is asking which of these groups might feel alienated by the party's shift towards more liberal social policies.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. People holding advanced academic degrees\n\nI would think that people with advanced degrees are generally more liberal in their views, especially on social issues. They might be more inclined towards accepting new ideas and diverse perspectives. So, they probably wouldn't be alienated by liberal social policies. In fact, they might support them.\n\nB. Northeastern city dwellers\n\nThe Northeast is known for its liberal leanings, especially in urban areas like New York City and Boston. City dwellers in these areas are likely to be supportive of liberal social policies. So, again, not likely to be alienated by such policies.\n\nC. Southerners\n\nThis is an interesting one. The American South has a complex political history. Historically, the Democratic Party was strong in the South, but over the past few decades, the South has become more Republican, especially at the presidential level. There are still many Democrats in the South, but there's a mix of conservative and liberal views.\n\nSome Southern Democrats might be more conservative on social issues, perhaps due to cultural and religious influences. So, if the national Democratic Party adopts more liberal social policies, it's possible that some Southern Democrats might feel alienated because their values don't align as closely with the party's new direction.\n\nD. Jewish Americans\n\nJewish Americans have traditionally been strong supporters of the Democratic Party, often aligning with liberal social and economic policies. They tend to be progressive on issues like civil rights and social justice. So, liberal social policies would likely resonate with them rather than alienate them.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C, Southerners, seems the most plausible answer. Let me think about this a bit more.\n\nI recall that the Democratic Party has been shifting leftward in recent years, especially on social issues. This shift might not sit well with all members of the party, particularly those in regions like the South, where cultural values might be more conservative.\n\nFor example, issues like gun control, abortion rights, and LGBTQ+ rights can be divisive, with Southern Democrats possibly holding more conservative views on these topics compared to their counterparts in other regions.\n\nIn contrast, people with advanced degrees, Northeastern city dwellers, and Jewish Americans are more likely to support liberal positions on these issues.\n\nTherefore, the Democratic Party's pursuit of liberal social policies is most likely to alienate Southerners among its traditional bases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
