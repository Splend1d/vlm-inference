The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.

                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from Zora Neale Hurston's \"Their Eyes Were Watching God,\" and I need to understand the last three sentences and choose the best way to describe them. The sentences are: \"They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.\"\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the context. The passage talks about people sitting on porches beside the road at sundown, which is a time for hearing things and talking. During the day, these people were like animals, working hard, but now that the sun and the bossman are gone, they feel powerful and human again.\n\nSo, these sitters are coming alive in the evening, after a day of labor. They're regaining their humanity and starting to engage in conversation and perhaps gossip.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The sentences emphasize the weariness the sitters feel after a long day's work.\n\nHmm, but the way the passage is written, it seems like the sitters are feeling energized and powerful in the evening, not weary. They're becoming \"lords of sounds and lesser things,\" which sounds like they're taking control of their environment and their conversations. So, this option doesn't seem to fit.\n\nB. The sentences are used to paint a picture of the way in which the sitters wish they spent their evenings.\n\nBut the passage doesn't indicate that this is a wish or a fantasy. It seems like this is actually what happens; they do sit and talk and pass judgments. So, it's not just a wish; it's reality for them during this time.\n\nC. The sentences are a vivid way of describing the ease and authority the sitters feel during the evening.\n\nThis seems promising. They feel powerful and human, and the phrases like \"lords of sounds and lesser things\" and \"passed nations through their mouths\" suggest that they feel authoritative and perhaps influential in their conversations. They're not just chatting; they're discussing important things, maybe even making judgments about events or people.\n\nD. The sentences highlight the contrast between the feelings of the sitters and the feelings of the bossman.\n\nWell, the bossman is mentioned as being gone, but there's no information about how he feels. The focus is on the sitters and their transformation from being like animals during the day to feeling human and powerful in the evening. So, this option doesn't seem to capture the essence of the sentences.\n\nLet me think again about the phrases:\n\n- \"Lords of sounds and lesser things\": This sounds like they dominate the auditory landscape, maybe through their conversations or storytelling.\n\n- \"Passed nations through their mouths\": This could mean that they discuss\u5927\u4e8bs of nations or spread news and rumors.\n\n- \"They sat in judgment\": This implies that they make judgments or evaluations, perhaps about others or about events.\n\nSo, they are active participants in their social environment during this time, engaging in meaningful and possibly influential discussions.\n\nOption C seems to capture this best by describing it as a time of ease and authority for the sitters.\n\nI should also consider the tone of the passage. Hurston often explores themes of community and the oral tradition in African American culture. So, this gathering and talking could be a celebration of community and the sharing of stories and knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the best way to describe these sentences is that they vividly depict the sense of ease and authority the sitters feel during their evening conversations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
