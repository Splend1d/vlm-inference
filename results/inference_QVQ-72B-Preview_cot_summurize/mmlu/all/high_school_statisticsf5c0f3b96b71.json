                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here. A university sent out a survey to 120 recent graduates to get their thoughts on the education they received. Out of those 120, 32 didn't respond. Now, I need to figure out the best way to proceed from the options given.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening. The university wanted feedback from 120 graduates, but only 88 responded. That means 32 people didn't give their input. This is a common issue in surveys\u2014non-response bias can be a problem because if certain people are less likely to respond, it might skew the results.\n\nOption A suggests using the 88 who did respond and treating that as the sample size in the analysis. So, basically, just work with the data you have from the respondents and ignore the non-respondents. This seems straightforward, but I wonder if that's accurate. What if the non-respondents have different opinions from those who did respond? That could introduce bias into the results.\n\nOption B says to use the 88 who did respond but use 120 as the sample size in the analysis. Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. If you're only using data from 88 people, but considering the sample size as 120, how does that work? Would you be imputing values for the non-respondents or something? I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption C proposes attempting to contact the 32 who did not respond and get information from them. This seems like a good idea. If you can get responses from those who initially didn't respond, that could help reduce bias. Maybe sending a follow-up email or making a phone call could encourage more responses. This seems like a proactive approach to improving the response rate and getting a more representative sample.\n\nOption D suggests selecting 32 more graduates at random to replace the non-respondents. So, essentially, you'd be adding new people to the sample to make up for those who didn't respond. This might help in increasing the response rate, but I'm not sure if it's the best approach. The new graduates might not be identical to the original sample, which could introduce selection bias.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. In survey research, non-response is a common issue, and there are different strategies to handle it. One approach is to simply analyze the respondents as they are, which is option A. However, this assumes that the respondents are representative of the entire sample, which may not be the case if non-respondents differ systematically in some way.\n\nOption B seems like it might be using the total sample size of 120 but only analyzing data from 88. This could lead to confusion in statistical analyses, as most methods require actual data points for the subjects included.\n\nOption C, attempting to contact the non-respondents again, is a standard practice in survey research to improve response rates. This is often referred to as a follow-up or reminder. It can help in reducing non-response bias by encouraging more people to participate, thereby making the sample more representative.\n\nOption D, replacing non-respondents with new participants, could be problematic because the new graduates might not be similar to the original sample in important ways. For example, they might have different experiences or demographics that could affect their responses.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the response rate. In this case, 88 out of 120 responded, which is about 73%. Depending on the context, that might be acceptable, but generally, higher response rates are better to minimize bias.\n\nAlso, there might be ways to adjust for non-response bias statistically. For example, weighting the responses based on certain characteristics if you have information about the non-respondents. However, without knowing more about the population, that might not be feasible.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems like the most straightforward and effective approach. By trying to contact the non-respondents again, the university might be able to increase the response rate and get a more accurate picture of the graduates' opinions.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about whether it's possible to collect data from the non-respondents. If they didn't respond to the first survey, perhaps they're not interested or too busy. Reaching out again might not yield many additional responses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the university could offer an incentive for responding, like entering them into a prize drawing or something. That might motivate more people to participate.\n\nBut, considering the options provided, option C is still the best course of action. It's worth trying to get data from the non-respondents before giving up and analyzing only the initial responses.\n\nI should also consider that in some cases, it's acceptable to analyze only the respondents, especially if the response rate is reasonably high and there's no reason to believe that non-respondents differ systematically from respondents in ways that affect the survey questions.\n\nHowever, without knowing more about the situation, it's hard to make that judgment. It's always safer to try to increase the response rate if possible.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the university can use both options C and D. That is, first try to contact the non-respondents again, and if that doesn't yield enough additional responses, then consider selecting new graduates to reach the desired sample size.\n\nBut again, based on the options given, only one can be chosen, and I think option C is the best initial step.\n\nLet me see if there's any other perspective I should consider. Maybe thinking about the time and resources involved. Reaching out to the non-respondents might require additional effort, such as sending emails, making phone calls, or even sending physical letters, which all cost time and possibly money.\n\nOn the other hand, selecting new graduates to replace the non-respondents might be quicker, but as I thought earlier, it could introduce bias.\n\nOverall, I still believe that option C is the best way to proceed. It's a standard practice in survey research to follow up with non-respondents, and it's likely to yield the most representative data.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Option A: Analyze only the 88 respondents with a sample size of 88. This could introduce non-response bias.\n\n- Option B: Analyze the 88 respondents but use a sample size of 120. This seems confusing and might not be statistically sound.\n\n- Option C: Try to contact the non-respondents and get their information. This is a proactive approach to reduce bias.\n\n- Option D: Replace the non-respondents with new graduates. This could introduce selection bias.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is option C: attempt to contact the 32 who did not respond and get the information from them.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
