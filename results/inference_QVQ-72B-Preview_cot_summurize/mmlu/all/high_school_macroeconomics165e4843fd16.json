                    "text": "So I have this economics problem here, and I need to figure out how much is spent on investments. Let's see what information they've given me.\n\nThe GDP is $10 million. I remember that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a certain period. So, GDP is basically the sum of all spending in an economy.\n\nNow, they've given me several components of GDP:\n\n- Consumer spending is $6 million.\n\n- Government spending is $3 million.\n\n- Exports are $2 million.\n\n- Imports are $3 million.\n\nAnd I need to find out how much is spent on investments.\n\nI think back to the components of GDP. In economics, GDP can be broken down into a few main components:\n\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C is consumer spending.\n\n- I is investment spending.\n\n- G is government spending.\n\n- X is exports.\n\n- M is imports.\n\nThe term (X - M) is the net exports, which is exports minus imports.\n\nSo, if I plug in the numbers I have:\n\n$10 million = $6 million + I + $3 million + ($2 million - $3 million)\n\nWait, but imports are $3 million, and exports are $2 million, so (X - M) would be $2 million - $3 million = -$1 million.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n$10 million = $6 million + I + $3 million - $1 million\n\nNow, I need to solve for I, which is investment spending.\n\nLet's add up the known amounts on the right side:\n\n$6 million + $3 million = $9 million\n\nThen minus $1 million: $9 million - $1 million = $8 million\n\nSo:\n\n$10 million = $8 million + I\n\nNow, to find I, I can subtract $8 million from both sides:\n\n$10 million - $8 million = I\n\nSo, I = $2 million\n\nTherefore, the amount spent on investments is $2 million.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $0 million\n\nB. $1 million\n\nC. $2 million\n\nD. $3 million\n\nThe correct answer is C. $2 million.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might confuse investments with savings or other components, but in the standard GDP formula, I is indeed investment spending, which includes things like business spending on capital goods, residential housing construction, and changes in inventories.\n\nSo, according to the standard formula, my calculation should be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, perhaps there's a different approach or some trick to the question, but based on the information given and the standard GDP identity, it seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $2 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
