                    "text": "So I have this problem about capacitors connected in series, and I need to find the total energy stored in them when a certain voltage is applied. Let me see... I'm a bit rusty on capacitors in series, but I remember that when capacitors are connected in series, their equivalent capacitance is not just the sum of their individual capacitances, unlike resistors in parallel. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for capacitors in series. I think it's similar to resistors in parallel, where the equivalent resistance is 1/(1/R1 + 1/R2), but for capacitors in series, it's the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. So, the formula should be:\n\n1/Ceq = 1/C1 + 1/C2\n\nGiven that, I have C1 = 3 \u03bcF and C2 = 6 \u03bcF. Plugging into the formula:\n\n1/Ceq = 1/3\u03bcF + 1/6\u03bcF = (2 + 1)/6\u03bcF = 3/6\u03bcF = 1/2\u03bcF\n\nTherefore, Ceq = 2 \u03bcF\n\nNow, the problem states that a 300-volt potential difference is applied across this combination. I need to find the total energy stored in the two capacitors.\n\nI recall that the energy stored in a capacitor is given by the formula:\n\nE = (1/2) * C * V\u00b2\n\nBut this formula is for a single capacitor. Since I have two capacitors in series, and I've found their equivalent capacitance, I can use this formula directly with Ceq.\n\nSo, E_total = (1/2) * Ceq * V\u00b2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nE_total = (1/2) * 2\u03bcF * (300V)\u00b2\n\nFirst, 2\u03bcF is 2 * 10^-6 F\n\nAnd (300V)\u00b2 = 90000 V\u00b2\n\nSo, E_total = (1/2) * 2 * 10^-6 F * 90000 V\u00b2 = 1 * 10^-6 F * 90000 V\u00b2 = 90 * 10^-6 J = 90 \u03bcJ\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the answer options are in joules, not microjoules. Let me check my units.\n\n1 \u03bcF = 10^-6 F\n\n1 J = 10^6 \u03bcJ\n\nSo, 90 \u03bcJ is equal to 90 * 10^-6 J = 9 * 10^-5 J\n\nThat doesn't match any of the options: 0.09 J, 0.18 J, 0.27 J, or 0.41 J. Clearly, I've made a mistake somewhere.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't have used the equivalent capacitance directly. Perhaps I need to find the energy stored in each capacitor individually and then sum them up.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, I need to find the voltage across each capacitor when they are connected in series.\n\nIn a series circuit, the voltage divides between the capacitors inversely proportional to their capacitances.\n\nSo, the voltage across each capacitor can be found using:\n\nV1 = V * (C2 / (C1 + C2))\n\nV2 = V * (C1 / (C1 + C2))\n\nWait, actually, for capacitors in series, the voltage division is proportional to the reciprocal of their capacitances.\n\nSo, V1 = V * (1/C1) / ( (1/C1) + (1/C2) )\n\nSimilarly, V2 = V * (1/C2) / ( (1/C1) + (1/C2) )\n\nGiven C1 = 3 \u03bcF and C2 = 6 \u03bcF.\n\nLet's calculate V1 and V2.\n\nFirst, find the reciprocal of the capacitances:\n\n1/C1 = 1/3 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9 = 0.333 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9\n\n1/C2 = 1/6 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9 = 0.1667 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9\n\nTotal reciprocal: 0.333 + 0.1667 \u2248 0.5 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9\n\nTherefore,\n\nV1 = V * (1/C1) / Total reciprocal = 300 V * (0.333 / 0.5) = 300 V * (0.666) = 199.8 V\n\nSimilarly,\n\nV2 = V * (1/C2) / Total reciprocal = 300 V * (0.1667 / 0.5) = 300 V * (0.333) = 99.9 V\n\nNow, the energy stored in each capacitor is:\n\nE1 = (1/2) * C1 * V1\u00b2 = (1/2) * 3\u03bcF * (199.8 V)\u00b2\n\nE2 = (1/2) * C2 * V2\u00b2 = (1/2) * 6\u03bcF * (99.9 V)\u00b2\n\nLet me compute E1:\n\nFirst, convert 3\u03bcF to farads: 3 * 10^-6 F\n\nV1\u00b2 = (199.8 V)\u00b2 \u2248 399200 V\u00b2\n\nSo, E1 = (1/2) * 3 * 10^-6 F * 399200 V\u00b2 \u2248 1.5 * 10^-6 F * 399200 V\u00b2 \u2248 0.598 J\n\nNow, E2:\n\n6\u03bcF = 6 * 10^-6 F\n\nV2\u00b2 \u2248 (99.9 V)\u00b2 \u2248 998001 V\u00b2 \u2248 998000 V\u00b2\n\nE2 = (1/2) * 6 * 10^-6 F * 998000 V\u00b2 \u2248 3 * 10^-6 F * 998000 V\u00b2 \u2248 2.994 J\n\nTotal energy E_total = E1 + E2 \u2248 0.598 J + 2.994 J \u2248 3.592 J\n\nHmm, that's not matching any of the options either. I must be making a calculation error.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for energy in terms of charge and voltage.\n\nI recall that for capacitors in series, the charge is the same on both capacitors because no charge is lost in a series circuit.\n\nSo, Q = Ceq * V_total\n\nThen, E_total = (Q\u00b2)/(2*Ceq)\n\nBut I already tried that and got 90 \u03bcJ, which is 0.00009 J, which is way off from 3.592 J.\n\nAlternatively, E_total = (Q*V_total)/2\n\nUsing Q = Ceq * V_total = 2 \u03bcF * 300 V = 600 \u03bcC\n\nThen, E_total = 600 \u03bcC * 300 V / 2 = 600 * 300 / 2 * 10^-6 J = 90 * 10^-3 J = 0.09 J\n\nWait, that's 0.09 J, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the energy stored in each capacitor individually, I got around 3.592 J, which is different from 0.09 J. There must be something wrong with my individual calculations.\n\nLet me check the voltage across each capacitor again.\n\nGiven that in series capacitors, the voltage divides inversely proportional to their capacitances.\n\nSo, V1 = V * (C2)/(C1 + C2)\n\nAnd V2 = V * (C1)/(C1 + C2)\n\nWait, is that correct? I thought for capacitors in series, the voltage division is proportional to the reciprocal of their capacitances.\n\nLet me look this up in my notes.\n\nAh, yes, for capacitors in series, the voltage across each capacitor is indeed proportional to the reciprocal of its capacitance.\n\nSo, V1 = V * (1/C1) / ( (1/C1) + (1/C2) )\n\nSimilarly, V2 = V * (1/C2) / ( (1/C1) + (1/C2) )\n\nGiven C1 = 3 \u03bcF and C2 = 6 \u03bcF,\n\n1/C1 = 1/3 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 0.333 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9\n\n1/C2 = 1/6 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 0.1667 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9\n\nTotal reciprocal: 0.333 + 0.1667 \u2248 0.5 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9\n\nTherefore,\n\nV1 = 300 V * (0.333 / 0.5) = 300 V * 0.666 \u2248 199.8 V\n\nV2 = 300 V * (0.1667 / 0.5) = 300 V * 0.333 \u2248 99.9 V\n\nNow, charge Q on both capacitors is the same.\n\nQ = C1 * V1 = 3 \u03bcF * 199.8 V \u2248 599.4 \u03bcC\n\nSimilarly, Q = C2 * V2 = 6 \u03bcF * 99.9 V \u2248 599.4 \u03bcC\n\nSo, both methods give consistent charge values.\n\nNow, total energy E_total = (Q*V_total)/2 = (599.4 \u03bcC * 300 V)/2 = (599.4 * 300)/2 * 10^-6 J = (179820)/2 * 10^-6 J = 89910 * 10^-6 J = 0.08991 J \u2248 0.09 J\n\nThat matches option A.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the energy stored in each capacitor individually and summed them up, I got approximately 3.592 J, which is different. There must be an error in that approach.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the energy stored in individual capacitors doesn't simply add up in a series configuration because some energy is lost in the process of charging the capacitors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the individual energies.\n\nLet me recalculate E1 and E2 more carefully.\n\nE1 = (1/2) * C1 * V1\u00b2 = (1/2) * 3 \u03bcF * (199.8 V)\u00b2\n\nFirst, 3 \u03bcF = 3 * 10^-6 F\n\nV1\u00b2 = (199.8 V)\u00b2 \u2248 399200 V\u00b2\n\nSo, E1 = 0.5 * 3 * 10^-6 F * 399200 V\u00b2 = 1.5 * 10^-6 F * 399200 V\u00b2 \u2248 0.5988 J\n\nE2 = (1/2) * C2 * V2\u00b2 = (1/2) * 6 \u03bcF * (99.9 V)\u00b2\n\n6 \u03bcF = 6 * 10^-6 F\n\nV2\u00b2 \u2248 (99.9 V)\u00b2 \u2248 998001 V\u00b2 \u2248 998000 V\u00b2\n\nE2 = 0.5 * 6 * 10^-6 F * 998000 V\u00b2 = 3 * 10^-6 F * 998000 V\u00b2 \u2248 2.994 J\n\nTotal energy E_total = E1 + E2 \u2248 0.5988 J + 2.994 J \u2248 3.5928 J\n\nBut according to the other method, E_total \u2248 0.09 J.\n\nThere is a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the issue is that when calculating the energy stored in each capacitor individually, I assumed that both capacitors are charged to their respective voltages independently, which isn't accurate in a series configuration.\n\nIn reality, when you connect the capacitors in series and apply a voltage, the energy stored isn't simply the sum of the individual energies calculated separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error lies in not considering that some energy is stored in the electric fields between the capacitors or something like that.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. The energy should be conserved; the energy supplied by the voltage source should equal the total energy stored in the capacitors.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should use the formula for energy in terms of charge and voltage.\n\nTotal energy E_total = (Q_total * V_total)/2\n\nBut in this case, Q_total is zero because it's a series circuit with no net charge accumulation.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I need to consider the charge on one capacitor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is E_total = (Q\u00b2)/(2*Ceq)\n\nWhere Q is the charge on each capacitor, and Ceq is the equivalent capacitance.\n\nGiven that, Q = Ceq * V_total = 2 \u03bcF * 300 V = 600 \u03bcC\n\nThen, E_total = (600 \u03bcC)\u00b2 / (2 * 2 \u03bcF) = (360000 \u03bcC\u00b2) / (4 \u03bcF) = 90000 \u03bcJ = 0.09 J\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nBut why does summing the individual energies give a different result? I think it's because when you calculate the energy stored in each capacitor individually using E = (1/2)CV\u00b2, you're assuming that each capacitor is being charged independently to its respective voltage, which isn't the case in a series configuration.\n\nIn reality, when you connect the capacitors in series and apply the voltage, the charges on the capacitors adjust simultaneously, and the energy stored is less than the sum of the individual energies calculated separately.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the equivalent capacitance to find the total energy stored.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 0.09 J\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.09\\ \\text{J}} \\]"
