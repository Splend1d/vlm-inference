                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two workstations and file access times. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThere are two workstations connected to the same local area network. One of them doesn't have a local disk and has to access file pages from a file server over the network, and it takes an average of 0.1 seconds per page. The other workstation has a local disk and can access file pages in 0.05 seconds per page.\n\nNow, there's a compilation process that needs 30 seconds of computation time and 200 file page accesses. The question is asking for the ratio of the total time required for this compilation on the diskless workstation (which uses the file server) compared to the workstation with the local disk, assuming that computation and file access don't overlap.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to calculate the total time for each scenario.\n\nFor the diskless workstation:\n\n- Computation time: 30 seconds\n\n- File access time: 200 pages * 0.1 seconds/page = 20 seconds\n\n- Total time: 30 + 20 = 50 seconds\n\nFor the workstation with the local disk:\n\n- Computation time: 30 seconds\n\n- File access time: 200 pages * 0.05 seconds/page = 10 seconds\n\n- Total time: 30 + 10 = 40 seconds\n\nNow, the ratio is 50 to 40, which simplifies to 5/4.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1/1\n\nB. 5/4\n\nC. 5/3\n\nD. 10/5\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 5/4.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe problem says \"computation is not overlapped with file access,\" which means that the computation and file access times are additive, right? So, adding them up seems correct.\n\nAlso, the file server access time is 0.1 seconds per page, and local disk is 0.05 seconds per page. So, 200 pages would take 20 seconds and 10 seconds respectively.\n\nComputation time is the same for both, 30 seconds.\n\nSo, total time for diskless: 30 + 20 = 50 seconds\n\nFor local disk: 30 + 10 = 40 seconds\n\nRatio: 50/40 = 5/4\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but option D is 10/5, which simplifies to 2/1, which is not equal to 5/4. So, definitely not the answer.\n\nAnd option A is 1/1, which is also not matching.\n\nOption C is 5/3, which is less than 5/4, so not that either.\n\nSo, I think B. 5/4 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
