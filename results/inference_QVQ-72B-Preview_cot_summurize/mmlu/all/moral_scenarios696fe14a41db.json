                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails and then evaluate whether it's morally wrong or not. The first scenario is about giving money to a homeless person. The second is about sneaking a peek at an opponent's cards before wagering in what I assume is a card game like poker or something similar.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1: Giving money to a homeless person.\n\nFrom what I know, helping others, especially those who are less fortunate, is generally considered a moral and kind act. Homeless people often face difficult circumstances, and offering them assistance can be seen as an act of compassion and empathy. In many ethical frameworks, this kind of behavior is encouraged. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, I don't think giving money to a homeless person is considered wrong. In fact, it's quite the opposite\u2014it's often viewed positively.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Sneaking a peek at my opponent's cards before wagering.\n\nThis scenario seems a bit trickier. Cheating in games, whether it's card games or any other kind of competition, is generally frowned upon. It's about fairness and playing by the rules. If I'm playing a card game with someone and I secretly look at their cards before making a bet, that gives me an unfair advantage. It's not playing fair, and it can be seen as dishonest.\n\nIn many cultures, including the US, cheating is considered morally wrong. It goes against the principles of integrity and respect for others. So, according to ordinary moral standards, sneaking a peek at someone's cards in a game would be considered wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Giving money to a homeless person \u2013 Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Sneaking a peek at opponent's cards before wagering \u2013 Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it a bit more deeply. Maybe there are some nuances I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any context that might change whether giving money to a homeless person is considered wrong? For example, maybe if the person giving the money was in a dangerous area and could be putting themselves at risk, but even then, the act of giving itself is still generally seen as positive. Or perhaps if the person giving the money was themselves in dire financial straits, but even in that case, it's still often viewed as a selfless act.\n\nIn Scenario 2, is there any context that might make sneaking a peek at the opponent's cards not wrong? Well, if the game being played allows for such actions, maybe in certain variants of card games where checking opponents' cards is permitted under specific rules, but generally, without that context, it's considered cheating.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether the opponent consented to the rules of the game, assuming standard rules where cheating is prohibited. Assuming that's the case, then yes, cheating is wrong.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the act of cheating could have consequences beyond just the game itself. For example, if the game involved money or had significant stakes, cheating could have real-world impacts on the opponent. That would only reinforce the idea that it's morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in low-stakes or friendly games, cheating might not be as morally reprehensible, but even then, it's still generally considered wrong to cheat, as it undermines trust and fairness.\n\nOverall, I think my initial assessment holds up. Giving money to a homeless person is not wrong, while sneaking a peek at an opponent's cards before wagering is wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
