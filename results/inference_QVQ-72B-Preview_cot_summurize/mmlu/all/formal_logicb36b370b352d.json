                    "text": "So I have this statement: \"Some athletes don't get injured.\" And I need to translate it into predicate logic. The options are:\n\nA. ~Ia\n\nB. (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix)\n\nC. ~Ai\n\nD. (\u2203x)(Ix \u2228 ~Ax)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the symbols mean. I assume that:\n\n- A stands for \"is an athlete\"\n\n- I stands for \"gets injured\"\n\n- x is a variable representing individuals\n\n- \u2203 is the existential quantifier (there exists)\n\n- \u2022 is conjunction (and)\n\n- \u2228 is disjunction (or)\n\n- ~ is negation (not)\n\nSo, the statement is saying that there are some athletes who do not get injured.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. ~Ia\n\nThis seems like it's saying \"it is not the case that a gets injured.\" But this refers to a specific individual 'a', not to some athletes in general. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nB. (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix)\n\nThis says \"there exists an x such that x is an athlete and x does not get injured.\" This seems to capture the idea that some athletes don't get injured. It's saying that at least one athlete does not get injured.\n\nC. ~Ai\n\nThis looks similar to option A. It seems to be saying \"it is not the case that all athletes get injured.\" But this is a universal statement, negating the idea that every athlete gets injured. While it's true that \"some athletes don't get injured\" implies \"not all athletes get injured,\" it's not the same as saying \"some don't get injured.\" The negation of \"all athletes get injured\" is \"not all athletes get injured,\" which includes the possibility that some do and some don't. So, this doesn't directly capture the idea of \"some don't.\"\n\nD. (\u2203x)(Ix \u2228 ~Ax)\n\nThis says \"there exists an x such that x gets injured or x is not an athlete.\" This seems a bit off. It's saying that there's at least one thing that either gets injured or is not an athlete. That doesn't directly relate to the idea that some athletes don't get injured.\n\nSo, comparing options B and C:\n\n- B directly says that there is at least one athlete who does not get injured.\n\n- C says that it's not the case that all athletes get injured, which is a different way of saying that at least one athlete does not get injured. However, it's more about denying the universality rather than asserting the existence of some athletes who don't get injured.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to be the most straightforward and accurate translation of \"some athletes don't get injured.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In logic, the statement \"some do not\" can be expressed in two ways:\n\n1. Existential with negation: (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix) \u2014 there exists an x that is an athlete and does not get injured.\n\n2. Negation of universal: ~\u2200x(Ax \u2192 Ix) \u2014 it is not the case that all athletes get injured.\n\nBut the second form is more about denying that every athlete gets injured, whereas the first form specifically asserts that there is at least one athlete who does not get injured.\n\nIn this context, \"some athletes don't get injured\" is best captured by the existential with negation, which is option B.\n\nOption C, ~Ai, would be read as \"it is not the case that all athletes get injured,\" which is logically equivalent to \"there exists at least one athlete who does not get injured,\" but it's not as direct as option B.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option B: (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
