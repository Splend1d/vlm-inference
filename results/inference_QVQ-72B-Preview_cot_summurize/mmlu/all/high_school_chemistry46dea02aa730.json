                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question: \"All of the following ions have the same electron configuration except...\" and the options are Rb+, Se2-, As5+, and Sr2+. Okay, so I need to figure out which one of these doesn't share the same electron configuration as the others.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what electron configuration means. It's basically how the electrons are arranged in different energy levels around the nucleus of an atom. For ions, it's similar, but the number of electrons can be different if the atom has gained or lost electrons to form the ion.\n\nSo, the question is asking which of these ions has a different arrangement of electrons compared to the others. To answer this, I should probably find out the electron configurations of each ion and then compare them.\n\nBut wait, that sounds time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Since they're all ions, maybe they all have the same electron configuration, except one. That seems like a common type of question in chemistry.\n\nLet me start by determining the electron configurations of each ion.\n\nFirst, Rb+, which is rubidium ion. Rubidium is element 37 in the periodic table. Its neutral atom has 37 electrons. The electron configuration for rubidium is 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2076 5s\u00b9. When it forms Rb+, it loses one electron from the 5s orbital, so the configuration becomes 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2076, which is the same as the noble gas krypton (Kr).\n\nNext, Se2-, which is selenium dioxide ion. Selenium is element 34, with 34 electrons in its neutral state. Its electron configuration is 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2074. When it forms Se2-, it gains two electrons, making the configuration 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2076, which is also the same as krypton (Kr).\n\nThen, As5+, which is arsenic pentaion. Arsenic is element 33, with 33 electrons in its neutral state. Its electron configuration is 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u00b3. When it forms As5+, it loses five electrons. Let's see: starting from the outermost shell, which is the 4p orbitals. So, losing the 4p electrons first, then the 4s, then 3d, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, when an atom loses electrons, it loses them from the highest energy orbitals first, which are the outermost orbitals. So, for As5+, starting from the neutral atom configuration:\n\n1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u00b3\n\nLosing five electrons:\n\nFirst, lose the three 4p electrons: 4p\u00b3 \u2192 empty 4p orbitals.\n\nThen, lose two 4s electrons: 4s\u00b2 \u2192 4s\u2070.\n\nSo, the configuration for As5+ should be 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 3d\u00b9\u2070, which is the same as the noble gas argon (Ar).\n\nWait a minute, that's different from the previous two ions, which had the configuration of krypton (Kr).\n\nFinally, Sr2+, which is strontium ion. Strontium is element 38, with 38 electrons in its neutral state. Its electron configuration is 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2076 5s\u00b2. When it forms Sr2+, it loses two electrons from the 5s orbital, so the configuration becomes 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2076, which is again the same as krypton (Kr).\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Rb+: [Kr]\n\n- Se2-: [Kr]\n\n- As5+: [Ar]\n\n- Sr2+: [Kr]\n\nFrom this, it's clear that Rb+, Se2-, and Sr2+ all have the electron configuration of krypton (Kr), while As5+ has the configuration of argon (Ar). Therefore, As5+ is the exception among these ions.\n\nI think that's the answer: As5+.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps by considering the number of electrons each ion has.\n\nRb+ has 36 electrons (37 -1), Se2- has 36 electrons (34 +2), As5+ has 28 electrons (33 -5), and Sr2+ has 36 electrons (38 -2). So, Rb+, Se2-, and Sr2+ all have 36 electrons, while As5+ has 28 electrons. That matches my earlier conclusion that As5+ has a different electron configuration.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the noble gas configurations:\n\n- [Ar] corresponds to 18 electrons\n\n- [Kr] corresponds to 36 electrons\n\n- [Xe] corresponds to 54 electrons\n\n- [Rn] corresponds to 86 electrons\n\nSo, in this case, As5+ has [Ar] configuration (18 electrons), but actually, it should have 28 electrons, which is [Ar] plus 10 more. Wait, no, As5+ has 28 electrons, but [Ar] is 18 electrons. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that As5+ has 28 electrons, but the noble gas configuration it matches is [Ar], which is 18 electrons. So, there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the electrons for As5+.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nNeutral arsenic: Z=33, electron configuration: 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u00b3 \u2192 total electrons: 33.\n\nForming As5+: lose five electrons.\n\nLose the 4p electrons first: 4p\u00b3 \u2192 4p\u2070 (losing three electrons), then lose two 4s electrons: 4s\u00b2 \u2192 4s\u2070.\n\nSo, remaining electrons: 33 - 5 = 28.\n\nBut [Ar] is 18 electrons, so there's a mismatch. Maybe I need to look at the full electron configuration for As5+:\n\nAs5+: 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 3d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 total 28 electrons.\n\nWait, but [Ar] is 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076, which is 18 electrons. So, As5+ has an additional 10 electrons beyond [Ar]: 3d\u00b9\u2070.\n\nTherefore, its configuration is [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070.\n\nSimilarly, the others have [Kr], which is 36 electrons.\n\nSo, As5+ has [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070 (28 electrons), while the others have [Kr] (36 electrons).\n\nHence, As5+ is the exception.\n\nI think that confirms it.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the electronic structures again:\n\n- Rb+: [Kr] \u2192 36 electrons\n\n- Se2-: [Kr] \u2192 36 electrons\n\n- As5+: [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 28 electrons\n\n- Sr2+: [Kr] \u2192 36 electrons\n\nYes, all except As5+ have the [Kr] configuration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. As5+.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
