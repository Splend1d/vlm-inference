The teacher is worried and wants to encourage Kerry to be more cooperative. There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that's most likely to work.\n\nOption A says preventing Kerry from participating in play or recess activities as a consequence of hostile behavior. Hmm, that sounds like a punishment. Maybe it could make Kerry realize that if they behave badly, they miss out on fun stuff. But I wonder if that could also make Kerry feel more isolated or angry, which might worsen the situation.\n\nOption B is about having Kerry memorize rules of behavior and write examples of how they apply in the classroom. This seems like a more educational approach, teaching Kerry what's expected of them. But does memorizing rules really change behavior? Maybe it's a step, but I'm not sure if it's enough on its own.\n\nOption C mentions withholding attention or approval from Kerry in response to hostile behavior. This sounds a bit tricky. On one hand, ignoring bad behavior can sometimes prevent it from escalating because the child isn't getting the reaction they might be seeking. But Kerry might feel neglected or not valued, which could lead to more problems.\n\nOption D suggests implementing social skills training to teach Kerry appropriate replacement behaviors for hostile behaviors. This seems really targeted and helpful. It's not just about punishing Kerry for bad behavior but actually teaching them better ways to interact with others.\n\nI think option D is probably the best approach. It's proactive rather than reactive. Instead of just responding to bad behavior with punishment, it tries to equip Kerry with the tools they need to behave better. Social skills training can help Kerry understand how to express themselves appropriately, resolve conflicts, and cooperate with others.\n\nPlus, at this age, kids are still learning a lot about social interactions. Sometimes, they might not realize how their actions affect others. By teaching Kerry alternative behaviors, the teacher is giving them new options for how to act in social situations.\n\nI also think that combining social skills training with positive reinforcement could be effective. Maybe praising Kerry when they exhibit cooperative behavior would encourage them to continue acting that way.\n\nBut looking back at the question, it's asking for the strategy most likely to encourage Kerry to be more cooperative. Preventing participation (option A) might have some effect, but it's more of a negative consequence rather than teaching positive behaviors. Memorizing rules (option B) might help Kerry understand what's expected, but it doesn't necessarily change their behavior in practice. Withholding attention (option C) could backfire by making Kerry feel unsupported.\n\nSocial skills training (option D), on the other hand, directly addresses the issue by teaching Kerry better ways to interact with peers. It's a more comprehensive approach that aims to modify behavior positively.\n\nSo, I would say that option D is the most likely strategy to encourage Kerry to be more cooperative with classmates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
