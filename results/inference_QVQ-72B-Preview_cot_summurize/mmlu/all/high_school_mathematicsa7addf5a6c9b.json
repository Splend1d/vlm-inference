                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"What interval consists of all \\( u \\) such that neither \\( 2u \\) nor \\( -20u \\) is in the interval \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\)?\"\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what it's asking. I need to find all values of \\( u \\) where both \\( 2u \\) and \\( -20u \\) are not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\). So, for each \\( u \\) in the interval I'm looking for, both \\( 2u \\) and \\( -20u \\) should either be in \\( [-1, \\infty) \\) or exactly at \\( -1 \\).\n\nLet me rephrase that: for a given \\( u \\), both \\( 2u \\) and \\( -20u \\) should not fall into \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\). That means both should be greater than or equal to \\( -1 \\).\n\nSo, I can set up two inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 2u \\geq -1 \\)\n\n2. \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\)\n\nI need to find \\( u \\) such that both inequalities hold simultaneously.\n\nLet's solve each inequality for \\( u \\):\n\n1. \\( 2u \\geq -1 \\) \u21d2 \\( u \\geq -\\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\n2. \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\) \u21d2 \\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\)\n\nSo, combining these, \\( u \\) must satisfy \\( u \\geq -\\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\). Therefore, the interval for \\( u \\) is \\( [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}] \\).\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. [-\\frac{1}{2}, 0]\n\nB. [-1,1]\n\nC. [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}]\n\nD. [0,2]\n\nSo, option C seems to match exactly what I've found.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check if there are any values of \\( u \\) outside this interval that might satisfy the conditions.\n\nSuppose \\( u = 0 \\), then \\( 2u = 0 \\) and \\( -20u = 0 \\), both of which are greater than \\( -1 \\), so it satisfies the conditions.\n\nIf \\( u = \\frac{1}{20} \\), then \\( 2u = \\frac{1}{10} \\) and \\( -20u = -1 \\), both are greater than or equal to \\( -1 \\), so it's included.\n\nIf \\( u = -\\frac{1}{2} \\), then \\( 2u = -1 \\) and \\( -20u = 10 \\), both satisfy the condition.\n\nNow, if \\( u > \\frac{1}{20} \\), then \\( -20u < -1 \\), which would violate the condition that \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, if \\( u < -\\frac{1}{2} \\), then \\( 2u < -1 \\), violating the first condition.\n\nTherefore, the interval is indeed \\( [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}] \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let's see why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: [-\\frac{1}{2}, 0]\n\nThis is part of the correct interval, but it doesn't include \\( u > 0 \\) up to \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\), which should also be included.\n\nOption B: [-1,1]\n\nThis includes values beyond \\( u = \\frac{1}{20} \\), which we've determined would lead to \\( -20u < -1 \\), violating the condition.\n\nOption D: [0,2]\n\nThis definitely includes values beyond \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\), which would not satisfy the condition for \\( -20u \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}].\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
