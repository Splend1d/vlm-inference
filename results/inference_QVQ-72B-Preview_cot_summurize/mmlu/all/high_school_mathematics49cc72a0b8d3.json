I'm a bit rusty on Taylor series, but I remember that the general formula for the Taylor series expansion of a function around a point \\(a\\) is:\n\n\\[f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \\frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x - a)^3 + \\cdots\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of the \\((x - a)^2\\) term is \\(\\frac{f''(a)}{2!}\\).\n\nGiven that, I need to compute the second derivative of \\(y = x^{2/3}\\) at \\(x = 8\\) and then divide by \\(2!\\).\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of \\(y = x^{2/3}\\):\n\n\\[y' = \\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}\\]\n\nNow, the second derivative:\n\n\\[y'' = -\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}x^{-4/3} = -\\frac{2}{9}x^{-4/3}\\]\n\nNow, evaluate the second derivative at \\(x = 8\\):\n\n\\[y''(8) = -\\frac{2}{9}(8)^{-4/3} = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(8^{1/3})^4} = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(2)^4} = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = -\\frac{2}{144} = -\\frac{1}{72}\\]\n\nNow, the coefficient of the \\((x - 8)^2\\) term is \\(\\frac{y''(8)}{2!}\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{-1/72}{2!} = \\frac{-1/72}{2} = -\\frac{1}{144}\\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -1/144\n\nB. -1/72\n\nC. 1/144\n\nD. 1/6\n\nSo, the correct coefficient is \\(-\\frac{1}{144}\\), which corresponds to option A.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with \\(y = x^{2/3}\\):\n\n- First derivative: \\(y' = \\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}\\)\n\n- Second derivative: \\(y'' = -\\frac{2}{9}x^{-4/3}\\)\n\nEvaluating \\(y''\\) at \\(x = 8\\):\n\n\\[y''(8) = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8^{4/3}} = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(2^3)^{4/3}} = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^4} = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = -\\frac{2}{144} = -\\frac{1}{72}\\]\n\nThen, the coefficient is \\(\\frac{-1/72}{2!} = -\\frac{1}{144}\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{144}} \\]"
