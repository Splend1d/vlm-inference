                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the speed of light in water moving relative to a lab frame. It says a tube of water is traveling at half the speed of light, and a beam of light is entering it in the same direction. I need to find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame. The index of refraction of water is 4/3.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts. I know that the speed of light in a medium is given by \\(v = \\frac{c}{n}\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light in vacuum and \\(n\\) is the index of refraction. So, in water, the speed of light should be \\(v = \\frac{c}{4/3} = \\frac{3c}{4}\\).\n\nBut here's the twist: the water is moving relative to the lab frame at \\(1/2 c\\), and the light is traveling in the same direction as the water's motion. So, I need to consider how the speed of light in the moving water relates to the lab frame.\n\nI think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for this. The formula is:\n\n\\[v_{lab} = \\frac{v_{water} + v_{water\\ relative\\ to\\ lab}}{1 + \\frac{v_{water} v_{water\\ relative\\ to\\ lab}}{c^2}}\\]\n\nWait, let me make sure I have this right. In this case, \\(v_{water}\\) is the speed of light in the water, which is \\(\\frac{3c}{4}\\), and \\(v_{water\\ relative\\ to\\ lab}\\) is the velocity of the water tube relative to the lab, which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} c\\), and both are in the same direction.\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\\[v_{lab} = \\frac{\\frac{3c}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}c}{1 + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{3c}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}c\\right)}{c^2}}\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[\\frac{3c}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}c = \\frac{3c + 2c}{4} = \\frac{5c}{4}\\]\n\nAnd the denominator:\n\n\\[1 + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{3c}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}c\\right)}{c^2} = 1 + \\frac{3c^2}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{c^2} = 1 + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{11}{8}\\]\n\nSo overall:\n\n\\[v_{lab} = \\frac{\\frac{5c}{4}}{\\frac{11}{8}} = \\frac{5c}{4} \\times \\frac{8}{11} = \\frac{5c \\times 8}{4 \\times 11} = \\frac{5 \\times 2c}{11} = \\frac{10c}{11}\\]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So according to this, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is \\(\\frac{10c}{11}\\), which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let me double-check if I've applied the velocity addition formula correctly. The formula for relativistic velocity addition when two velocities are in the same direction is:\n\n\\[v_{lab} = \\frac{v_{water} + u}{1 + \\frac{v_{water} u}{c^2}}\\]\n\nWhere \\(v_{water}\\) is the speed of light in water relative to the water frame, and \\(u\\) is the speed of the water frame relative to the lab frame.\n\nI have \\(v_{water} = \\frac{3c}{4}\\) and \\(u = \\frac{1}{2}c\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[v_{lab} = \\frac{\\frac{3c}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}c}{1 + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{3c}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}c\\right)}{c^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{5c}{4}}{1 + \\frac{3c^2}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{c^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{5c}{4}}{1 + \\frac{3}{8}} = \\frac{\\frac{5c}{4}}{\\frac{11}{8}} = \\frac{5c \\times 8}{4 \\times 11} = \\frac{10c}{11}\\]\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer should be D. 10/11 c.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the concept of Doppler effect or something else, but I think the relativistic velocity addition is the right approach here since we're dealing with speeds comparable to the speed of light.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the water frame and the lab frame and see how the speeds transform, but I think I've covered that already.\n\nWait, actually, I recall that according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant in all inertial frames, but in a medium, it's different because the light is interacting with the medium.\n\nBut in this problem, the medium (water) is moving, so I need to consider the relative motion between the lab frame and the water frame.\n\nI think I've got it right with the velocity addition formula. So, I'll go with option D. 10/11 c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D. \\ 10/11 \\ c}\\]"
