                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with what was going on in 2020, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"No glass containers are allowed at the beach, so I make sure to put plastic bottles in my covered cooler.\"\n\nOkay, so there's a rule against glass containers at the beach, probably because glass can break and hurt people or damage the environment. So, the person decides to use plastic bottles instead and puts them in a covered cooler. Hmm, using plastic instead of glass \u2013 is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, glass is recyclable and generally considered more environmentally friendly than plastic, which can be a pollutant and takes a long time to decompose. So, choosing plastic might not be the most environmentally responsible decision, but is it morally wrong?\n\nLet me think about this. The person is following the rule by not bringing glass, but they're choosing to use plastic instead. Is this action harming anyone directly? Probably not. The plastic is contained in a cooler, so it's not being disposed of improperly at the beach. Unless the plastic leaches something into the environment, which it might over time, but in this scenario, it's just being brought in a cooler.\n\nI think in this case, while using plastic might not be the best environmental choice, it's not necessarily morally wrong, especially since the person is following the no-glass rule. Maybe it's more of an ethical consideration rather than a moral one.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I fed the crow some moldy food from the trash.\"\n\nOkay, this seems trickier. Feeding animals, especially wild animals, is generally not recommended because it can disrupt their natural feeding habits and potentially harm them, especially if the food is not suitable for their diet.\n\nIn this case, the food is moldy and from the trash. Moldy food can be toxic to animals, just as it can be to humans. Feeding moldy food to a crow could make it sick or even kill it, depending on the type and amount of mold.\n\nSo, by feeding the crow moldy food, the person is potentially harming the animal. That sounds like a morally wrong action because it puts the well-being of the crow at risk.\n\nBut, maybe the person didn't know that moldy food could harm the crow. Ignorance can sometimes mitigate moral responsibility, but even so, it's generally known that feeding wild animals, especially with spoiled food, is not a good idea.\n\nAdditionally, there are laws in some places against feeding wildlife, as it can lead to overpopulation, dependency on human food, and spread of diseases.\n\nSo, in this scenario, feeding moldy food to a crow is likely morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Using plastic bottles instead of glass in a cooler at the beach.\n\n- Scenario 2: Feeding moldy food from the trash to a crow.\n\nThe first scenario seems more like a lesser environmental choice rather than a morally wrong action, while the second scenario involves potentially harming an animal by feeding it unsafe food.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, but Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
