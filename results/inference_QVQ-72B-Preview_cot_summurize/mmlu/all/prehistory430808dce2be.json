                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about Neandertals and how they're physically different from modern Homo sapiens. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's correct. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that Neandertals had wide, squat torsos and short extremities. Hmm, I remember learning something about Neandertals having a stocky build, maybe because they lived in cold environments. Maybe that's part of it. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of their body shape.\n\nOption B mentions that Neandertals had smaller brains and larger noses compared to modern Homo sapiens. Wait a minute, I thought Neandertals actually had larger brains on average than modern humans, didn't they? But maybe I'm mistaken. And I've heard that they had prominent nasal cavities, maybe to warm and moisten the air in cold climates. So, maybe the larger nose part is correct, but I'm confused about the brain size.\n\nOption C says that Neandertal skeletons have more bones than modern Homo sapiens. That seems odd. I thought all humans and Neandertals have the same number of bones in their bodies. Let me double-check that. Adult humans have 206 bones, and I believe Neandertals did too. So, maybe this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D says both A and B. But if I think option C is incorrect, then D can't be right because it includes B, which might be incorrect if A is correct. Wait, no, I need to think logically. If A and B are both correct, then D would be right. But I'm unsure about B, especially the brain size part.\n\nLet me try to recall more accurately. Neandertals did have a robust build, with short limbs and a wide torso, which is adapted to colder climates. So, option A seems to align with that. As for brain size, I think Neandertals had slightly larger brains on average than modern humans, but their overall brain structure might have been different. So, option B might be incorrect regarding brain size.\n\nRegarding option C, I'm pretty confident that Neandertals and modern humans have the same number of bones in their skeletons. So, that option is likely incorrect.\n\nTherefore, between the given options, option A seems to be the most accurate description of a physical difference between Neandertals and modern Homo sapiens.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there are any other significant physical differences that aren't listed here. For example, Neandertals had a different skull shape, with a prominent brow ridge and a receding chin, compared to modern humans. But those aren't mentioned in the options.\n\nSo, based on the options provided, I think the best answer is option A: Neandertals had wide, squat torsos and short extremities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
