                    "text": "So I've got this question here about comprehensive annual financial reports and their statistical tables. It's asking which characteristic of the information in these tables differentiates it from the information contained in the financial statements. The options are \"data covering financial trends\" and \"fiscal years,\" and there are four possible combinations of \"yes\" and \"no\" for these characteristics.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) is and how its statistical tables differ from the financial statements themselves. A CAFR is a detailed report that provides an overview of a government's financial condition and operations. It includes not only the financial statements but also other information like management's discussion and analysis, and notes to the financial statements.\n\nWithin the CAFR, the statistical tables often provide historical data and trends over multiple years, which can be useful for analyzing the government's financial health over time. These tables might include things like revenue trends, expenditure trends, debt levels over time, and other multi-year data.\n\nNow, let's look at the two characteristics mentioned:\n\n1. **Data covering financial trends:** This refers to the historical data provided in the statistical tables that show how financial figures have changed over several years. This can help identify patterns and trends in the government's finances.\n\n2. **Fiscal years:** This refers to the accounting period that the government uses for its financial reporting. The fiscal year can be different from the calendar year and is consistent from one reporting period to another.\n\nThe question is asking which of these characteristics differentiate the information in the statistical tables from the information in the financial statements.\n\nFirst, considering **data covering financial trends:** Typically, financial statements present data for the current period and sometimes compare it with the previous period. However, statistical tables in the CAFR provide multi-year data, offering a longer-term perspective on financial trends. So, in this sense, the statistical tables offer more extensive trend data compared to the financial statements.\n\nSecond, considering **fiscal years:** The financial statements themselves are prepared for a specific fiscal year, and the statistical tables also refer to the same fiscal years for consistency. So, the fiscal years covered in the statistical tables are the same as those in the financial statements. Therefore, fiscal years aren't a differentiating characteristic between the two.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer should be the one that indicates:\n\n- Data covering financial trends: Yes (because statistical tables provide multi-year data which offers a trend view)\n\n- Fiscal years: No (because both statistical tables and financial statements refer to the same fiscal years)\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No Yes\n\nD. No No\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct choice: Yes for trends and No for fiscal years.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nPerhaps the fiscal years in the statistical tables include multiple years, whereas the financial statements focus on a single fiscal year. However, even then, the fiscal years referenced in the statistical tables are still the same as those in the financial statements; it's just that the tables cover multiple years.\n\nOn the other hand, the data covering financial trends is indeed a distinguishing feature of the statistical tables, as they provide a longer-term perspective that isn't as prominently featured in the financial statements.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that \"data covering financial trends\" is a differentiating characteristic, while \"fiscal years\" is not, since both the statistical tables and the financial statements pertain to the same fiscal years.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Yes No.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any possibility that fiscal years could be different in statistical tables. No, that doesn't seem likely. The statistical tables use the same fiscal years as the financial statements but provide data over multiple years.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B. Yes No.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
