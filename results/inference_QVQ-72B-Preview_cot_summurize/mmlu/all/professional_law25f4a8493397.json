Shortly thereafter and prior to the July commencement date of employment, the school elected to terminate its varsity football program. The school publicly attributed the decision to economic factors. Upon hearing this news, the man sought out the headmaster of the school to inquire as to the effect, if any, of this decision on his salary and responsibilities. In order to resolve the matter, the headmaster arranged a meeting among various school officials to discuss the man's situation. Afterward, the school sent written notice to the man of its intent to terminate his employment contract. The man then commenced suit to recover the full balance of his salary calculated on the basis of the contract. At trial, the headmaster was called to testify. On direct examination, he testified that six people (including himself) attended the meeting where it was decided to terminate the man's employment contract. When asked to identify the attendees, the headmaster gave the names of four but, despite trying, was unable to remember the name of the fifth person. The attorney who called the headmaster to testify now seeks to show him her handwritten notes that the attorney prepared during her pretrial interview with the headmaster, in which he provided all five names. The trial court is likely to consider the showing of the notes taken as\n\nA. a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection.\nB. a proper attempt to introduce recorded recollection.\nC. an improper attempt to support the headmaster's credibility.\nD. an improper attempt to lead the witness.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this situation in a trial. There's a headmaster who's testifying, and he can't remember one of the five people who attended a meeting. The lawyer who called him to testify has handwritten notes from a pretrial interview where the headmaster provided all five names. Now, the lawyer wants to show him those notes to help him remember the fifth person's name. The question is, how is the trial court likely to view this action?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules of evidence related to refreshing a witness's recollection. I recall that under the rules of evidence, a witness can be shown materials to refresh their memory before testifying. This is called refreshing the recollection. The idea is to help the witness recall information that they might have forgotten.\n\nSo, option A says it's a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection. That sounds like what's happening here. The lawyer is trying to help the headmaster remember the name of the fifth person by showing him her notes from a previous conversation where he did remember.\n\nOption B mentions introducing recorded recollection. I think that's different from refreshing recollection. Recorded recollection involves introducing a past record to prove what was said before, whereas refreshing recollection is about helping the witness recall information for their current testimony.\n\nOption C says it's an improper attempt to support the headmaster's credibility. Credibility relates to whether the witness is telling the truth or not. Here, it seems like the issue is more about the witness's memory rather than their honesty.\n\nOption D refers to leading the witness, which is generally not allowed during direct examination except under certain circumstances. Leading questions are those that suggest the answer.\n\nGiven this, it seems like option A is the most appropriate choice. The lawyer is trying to refresh the witness's memory, not introduce a past record, support credibility, or lead the witness.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Is there any chance that showing the notes could be considered leading the witness? Leading the witness involves suggesting the answer, but in this case, the lawyer is just showing the notes for the witness to look at and recall the information himself.\n\nAlso, could this be considered as introducing recorded recollection? Well, recorded recollection typically involves introducing a past record to prove what was said before, but in this case, the notes are being used to refresh the witness's memory for current testimony, not to prove the content of the past statement.\n\nSupporting credibility seems unrelated here because the issue is about memory, not truthfulness.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the trial court is likely to consider showing the notes as a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure about the rules regarding refreshing a witness's recollection. I recall that for a witness to have their recollection refreshed, they must be shown the document or record before they testify, and they must adopt it as their own to refresh their memory.\n\nIn this scenario, the notes were taken by the lawyer during a pretrial interview with the headmaster, so they are the lawyer's notes, not the headmaster's. Does that make a difference?\n\nI think that as long as the headmaster recognizes the information in the notes as something he previously stated, they can be used to refresh his memory. It's not necessary that the witness wrote the notes themselves, but they must adopt them as accurate.\n\nSo, if the lawyer shows the headmaster her notes and he confirms that yes, that's what he said before and that it helps him recall the fifth person's name, then it should be allowed.\n\nTherefore, I still think option A is the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other rule or exception that might apply here.\n\nIs there any hearsay issue involved? Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the notes are being used to refresh the witness's memory, not to prove the content of the statement. So, it's not hearsay.\n\nCould there be any privilege attached to the notes? Maybe attorney-client privilege, but that's between the lawyer and her client, not necessarily the witness. Unless the headmaster was the client, which isn't clear from the scenario.\n\nAssuming there's no privilege issue, and the notes are being used solely to refresh the witness's memory, I don't see any problem with it.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the trial court is likely to consider showing the notes as a proper attempt to refresh the headmaster's recollection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
