                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two types of whales: humpback and gray. Both have traveled certain distances in certain time periods, and we need to find out how much farther humpback whales would have traveled if they had traveled for the same 32 days as the gray whales, at their respective speeds.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to compare the distances traveled by both types of whales if humpbacks also traveled for 32 days at their constant speed. So, we need to find:\n\n1. The speed of humpback whales.\n\n2. The speed of gray whales.\n\n3. Calculate how far humpbacks would go in 32 days at their speed.\n\n4. Compare that distance to the distance traveled by gray whales.\n\n5. Find the difference in distances.\n\nAlright, let's start with the humpback whales. They traveled 2,240 miles in 28 days. To find their daily travel speed, we can divide the total distance by the number of days.\n\nSpeed of humpbacks = total distance / number of days = 2,240 miles / 28 days.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2,240 \u00f7 28 = 80 miles per day.\n\nSo, humpbacks travel 80 miles per day.\n\nNext, the gray whales traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days. Similarly, their speed would be:\n\nSpeed of gray whales = 2,368 miles / 32 days.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n2,368 \u00f7 32 = 74 miles per day.\n\nSo, gray whales travel 74 miles per day.\n\nNow, if humpbacks traveled for 32 days at their speed of 80 miles per day, how far would they go?\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time = 80 miles/day \u00d7 32 days = 2,560 miles.\n\nSo, humpbacks would travel 2,560 miles in 32 days.\n\nThe gray whales traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days.\n\nTo find out how many more miles humpbacks would have traveled compared to gray whales, we subtract:\n\n2,560 miles - 2,368 miles = 192 miles.\n\nTherefore, humpback whales would have traveled 192 miles farther than gray whales if both traveled for 32 days at their respective speeds.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 128\n\nB. 192\n\nC. 280\n\nD. 408\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 192.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nFirst, humpbacks: 2,240 miles in 28 days.\n\nSpeed: 2,240 \u00f7 28 = 80 miles/day. That seems correct.\n\nGray whales: 2,368 miles in 32 days.\n\nSpeed: 2,368 \u00f7 32.\n\nLet me verify that:\n\n32 \u00d7 70 = 2,240\n\n32 \u00d7 74 = 2,368. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, humpbacks traveling for 32 days at 80 miles/day: 80 \u00d7 32.\n\n80 \u00d7 30 = 2,400\n\n80 \u00d7 2 = 160\n\nTotal 2,560. Correct.\n\nSubtract gray whales' distance: 2,560 - 2,368 = 192.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 192.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
