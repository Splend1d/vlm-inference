                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there's a woman who mailed a letter on May 2, but the letter is dated May 1. In the letter, she's offering to sell two concert tickets for $60 each, which is $10 above the face value. She mentions that the concert has been sold out for months and gives the man 15 days from the date of the letter to decide whether to accept her offer. The man received the letter on May 4 but didn't read it until May 6. Then, on May 18, he goes to her home to accept the offer, but she tells him it's too late because she already sold the tickets for $75 each the previous week.\n\nThe question is whether the man's power to accept the offer was terminated by the lapse of time before he went to her home on May 17.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a valid offer and how acceptance works, especially considering the timing of the communication.\n\nSo, the woman's letter is dated May 1 and mailed on May 2. The man receives it on May 4 but reads it on May 6. He tries to accept on May 18, but she says she already sold the tickets.\n\nThe letter says the offer is valid for 15 days from the above date, which is May 1. So, 15 days from May 1 would be May 16. But she sold the tickets the previous week, which would be around May 11 or so, depending on when \"last week\" is. Assuming \"last week\" means the week before May 18, so roughly May 11 to May 17.\n\nBut the key point is whether the offer was revoked before the man tried to accept it on May 18.\n\nNow, the question assumes that the woman's letter created a valid power of acceptance in the man. So, the offer is clear and meets the requirements for a valid offer.\n\nBut offers can be terminated by lapse of time or by revocation by the offeror.\n\nThe offer specifies a time limit of 15 days from May 1, so the offer expires on May 16. However, the woman says she sold the tickets \"last week,\" which would be before May 18. If \"last week\" means the week before May 18, that would be May 11 to May 17.\n\nBut the offer was supposed to be valid until May 16. So, if she sold the tickets on, say, May 15, that would still be within the 15-day period.\n\nWait, but she says she sold them \"last week,\" which could be any time from May 11 to May 17, assuming the current date is May 18.\n\nBut the offer was valid until May 16. So, if she sold them on May 15, which is within the offer period, then the revocation is invalid because it's during the specified offer period.\n\nBut if she sold them on May 17 or later, that would be after the offer period ended on May 16.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nFirst, the offer was made on May 1 (the date of the letter), mailed on May 2, received on May 4, read on May 6, and the man tried to accept on May 18.\n\nThe offer was for 15 days from May 1, so it expires on May 16.\n\nBut the woman says she sold the tickets \"last week,\" which is presumably before May 18.\n\nSo, did she revoke the offer before May 16?\n\nIf she sold the tickets on May 15, that's within the offer period, so the revocation would be invalid, and the offer should still be open until May 16.\n\nBut if she sold them on May 17, that's after the offer period ended, so the offer was already terminated by lapse of time.\n\nWait, but she says she sold them \"last week,\" which would be before May 18.\n\nIf \"last week\" means the week before May 18, that would be May 11 to May 17.\n\nBut the offer expired on May 16.\n\nSo, if she sold them on May 16, that's the day the offer expired.\n\nBut she says \"last week,\" which could include May 16.\n\nBut in terms of revocation, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance, but not during a specified irrevocable period.\n\nIn this case, the offer specifies a time limit of 15 days, but it doesn't say whether it's irrevocable during that period.\n\nGenerally, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance unless there's an agreement not to revoke it.\n\nBut in this case, the offer specifies a time limit, which typically makes the offer irrevocable during that period unless otherwise stated.\n\nSo, if the woman tried to revoke the offer before May 16, that revocation might be invalid because the offer specified a 15-day period.\n\nBut she says she sold the tickets \"last week,\" which would be before May 18.\n\nSo, assuming she sold them on, say, May 15, which is within the offer period, the revocation is invalid, and the offer should still be open until May 16.\n\nBut the man tried to accept on May 18, which is after the offer period ended.\n\nSo, even if the revocation was invalid, the offer still expired on May 16, and his acceptance on May 18 is too late.\n\nWait, but the question is whether the power to accept was terminated by lapse of time before May 17.\n\nThe man went to her home on May 18, but the question mentions May 17.\n\nWait, in the problem, it says \"on May 17, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer.\"\n\nWait, in the initial problem, it says:\n\n\"On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer.\"\n\nBut in the question, it says \"on May 17.\"\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer.\"\n\nBut in the question, it says:\n\n\"Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?\"\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent.\n\nIn the problem, it's May 18, but in the question, it's May 17.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAssuming it's a typo, and it should be May 18.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about May 17, but the man went on May 18.\n\nGiven that, let's assume the man went on May 18, but the question is about May 17.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused.\n\nLet me rephrase the question to myself.\n\nThe woman mailed a letter on May 2, dated May 1, offering tickets for $60 each, with a 15-day acceptance period from May 1. So, the offer expires on May 16.\n\nThe man received the letter on May 4, read it on May 6, and tried to accept on May 18.\n\nBut she says she sold the tickets \"last week,\" meaning before May 18.\n\nThe question is whether the man's power to accept was terminated by lapse of time before he went to her home on May 17.\n\nWait, but he went on May 18, according to the problem.\n\nAssuming it's a typo, and it should be May 18.\n\nSo, the question is whether his power to accept was terminated by lapse of time before May 18.\n\nThe offer was valid until May 16, so by May 18, it had already lapsed.\n\nTherefore, the power to accept was terminated by lapse of time before May 18.\n\nBut the question says \"before the man went to the woman's home on May 17.\"\n\nWait, but he went on May 18.\n\nAssuming it's a typo, and it should be May 18.\n\nSo, the answer is yes, the power to accept was terminated by lapse of time before May 18.\n\nBut let's see the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.\n\nWell, the letter was mailed on May 2, but the offer period is from May 1, the date of the letter.\n\nSo, mailing on May 2 doesn't directly affect the offer period.\n\nB. Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.\n\nWell, the offer period is from May 1, so this seems relevant.\n\nC. No, because the man received the letter on May 4.\n\nBut the offer period starts from May 1, not from when he received it.\n\nD. No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.\n\nAgain, the offer period is from May 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A, B, C, or D.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose among these options.\n\nOption A says \"Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.\"\n\nBut mailing date doesn't affect the offer period, which is based on the date of the letter.\n\nOption B says \"Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.\"\n\nWell, the offer period is 15 days from May 1, so the offer expired on May 16.\n\nMay 18 is after that, so yes, the power to accept was terminated by lapse of time.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"before the man went to the woman's home on May 17.\"\n\nWait, but according to the problem, he went on May 18.\n\nAssuming it's a typo, and it should be May 18.\n\nSo, the power was terminated by lapse of time before May 18.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.\n\nBut among the options, B seems the most relevant because the offer period starts from the date of the letter, which is May 1.\n\nOption C and D suggest no, but based on the analysis, it should be yes.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider when the offer was communicated.\n\nIn contract law, the offer is effective when it's communicated to the offeree, which in this case is when he received it on May 4.\n\nBut the offer specifies a time period from the date of the letter, which is May 1.\n\nSo, the offer was made on May 1, to be accepted within 15 days, i.e., until May 16.\n\nThe man tried to accept on May 18, which is after the offer period.\n\nTherefore, his acceptance is invalid.\n\nSo, the power to accept was terminated by lapse of time before May 18.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.\n\nThis doesn't directly relate to the offer period.\n\nB. Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.\n\nThis is the date from which the offer period starts, so this seems correct.\n\nC. No, because the man received the letter on May 4.\n\nReceiving the letter doesn't affect the offer period.\n\nD. No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.\n\nReading the letter is irrelevant to the offer period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
