In July 1990, the investor acquired title to a 100-acre tract located just outside the city limits in a rural area. In 1997, the investor decided to sell his vast ranching and oil interests in the Rocky Mountains. In July, the investor conveyed the tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my nephew, his heirs, and assigns, but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns. \"After taking possession of the 100-acre tract, the nephew discovered considerable oil reserves on the property. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the chef of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the chef learned that the nephew was selling oil from the drilling operations. The chef has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal. If the nephew's wife died without issue before the beginning of the nephew's oil drilling operations, would this improve the likelihood of the chef's success than if the wife were still alive?\n\nA. No, because the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\nB. No, because the nature of the nephew's estate would not be altered by the wife's death.\nC. Yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.\nD. Yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal conundrum. So, we have an investor who owned a 100-acre tract in the Rocky Mountains. In 1997, the investor gave this land to his nephew, but with a condition: if the nephew's wife dies without having any children, then the land should go to the investor's chef and her heirs.\n\nNow, the nephew found out there's oil on the property and started drilling and selling it, without telling the chef. The chef found out eventually and is now suing for an accounting of the oil's value and to stop any further oil removal.\n\nThe question is whether the chef's chances of success are better if the nephew's wife died without having kids before the nephew started drilling oil.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the type of estate the nephew received. The deed says: \"to my nephew, his heirs, and assigns, but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns.\"\n\nThis sounds like a fee simple determinable estate for the nephew, with a possibility of forfeiture if the nephew's wife dies without issue. In that case, the estate would pass to the chef.\n\nBut wait, the language is a bit tricky. It says \"but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns.\" This seems like a fee simple determinable, where the estate can terminate upon a specified event (nephew's wife dying without issue), and the estate would revert to the grantor or pass to someone else.\n\nBut who holds the estate after the nephew's wife dies without issue? It says \"to my chef and her heirs and assigns.\" So, it appears that upon the nephew's wife dying without issue, the estate passes to the chef.\n\nBut hold on, the initial grant is to the nephew, his heirs, and assigns, subject to the condition. So, the nephew has a fee simple determinable estate, and upon the condition happening (nephew's wife dying without issue), the estate passes to the chef.\n\nNow, the chef is claiming that the nephew shouldn't be able to drill oil without accounting to her, especially if the condition hasn't occurred yet.\n\nIf the nephew's wife is still alive, then the nephew holds the estate subject to the condition subsequent. Wait, no, it's a condition subsequent because it's a condition that, if met, would cause the estate to terminate.\n\nBut actually, it's more precise to call it a fee simple determinable with a possibility of forfeiture, because the termination is automatic upon the specified event.\n\nWait, but the language says \"but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns.\" That sounds more like a fee simple determinable, where the estate terminates upon the happening of the condition, and the estate passes to the chef.\n\nSo, until the nephew's wife dies without issue, the nephew has full rights over the property, including the right to drill oil.\n\nBut the chef is claiming that she should have some say in this, especially if the condition has been met.\n\nIf the nephew's wife has died without issue, then the estate should have passed to the chef, according to the deed.\n\nBut the nephew is still drilling oil, unaware or\u4e0d\u987e of the chef's interest.\n\nNow, the chef is seeking an accounting of the oil's value and an injunction to stop further oil removal.\n\nThe question is whether the chef's chances of success are better if the nephew's wife died without issue before the nephew started drilling.\n\nOption A says no, because the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n\nWell, yes, the right to remove oil is generally an incident of ownership, but in this case, the estate may have been transferred to the chef upon the nephew's wife's death without issue.\n\nOption B says no, because the nature of the nephew's estate wouldn't be altered by the wife's death.\n\nBut according to the deed, it should pass to the chef upon the wife's death without issue.\n\nOption C says yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.\n\nHmm, not sure about that. If the estate passes to the chef upon the wife's death without issue, then the nephew's interest terminates, and the chef gets the estate.\n\nOption D says yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\n\nWait, if the wife has died without issue, the condition has been met, and the estate should have passed to the chef.\n\nSo, in that case, the nephew no longer has any interest in the property, and the chef holds the estate.\n\nTherefore, the nephew's oil drilling operations would be unauthorized, and the chef could seek an accounting for the oil he's already taken and an injunction to stop further drilling.\n\nWhereas, if the wife is still alive, the nephew holds the estate and has the right to drill oil.\n\nSo, it seems that if the wife has died without issue, the chef's chances of success are better because the nephew no longer has any rights to the property.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes, the chef's likelihood of success is improved if the wife died without issue before the nephew started drilling.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C or D.\n\nBut C says \"because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.\"\n\nI'm not sure about that. When the condition is met, the estate passes to the chef, so the nephew's interest terminates, and there's a reversion to the chef, but it's more accurate to say that the estate passes to the chef.\n\nOption D says \"because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\"\n\nBut in reality, if the wife has died without issue, the nephew's interest has already terminated, and the estate has passed to the chef.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is better, but I need to clarify.\n\nA reversionary interest is the interest that remains in the grantor (or someone else) after a fee simple determinable estate.\n\nIn this case, the reversionary interest is in the chef upon the wife's death without issue.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is correct.\n\nBut option D seems to suggest that the nephew still has a fee, but it's certain to terminate.\n\nBut if the wife has already died without issue, the termination has already occurred.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is not accurate.\n\nTherefore, option C is better.\n\nBut I need to make sure.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf the wife has died without issue, the nephew's estate terminates, and the estate passes to the chef.\n\nSo, the nephew no longer has any interest in the property.\n\nTherefore, any oil drilling operations he conducts are unauthorized, and the chef can seek relief.\n\nIf the wife is still alive, the nephew holds the estate and can drill oil.\n\nTherefore, the chef's chances are better if the wife has died without issue.\n\nSo, the answer is yes, and option C seems to capture that.\n\nOption D says \"because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\"\n\nBut in reality, if the wife has died without issue, the nephew's fee has already terminated.\n\nSo, option D is not accurate.\n\nTherefore, option C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
