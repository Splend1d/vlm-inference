                    "text": "Let's see what we've got here. There are two equations:\n\n725x + 727y = 1500\n\nAnd\n\n729x + 731y = 1508\n\nAnd I need to find the value of x - y. Hmm, it seems like a system of linear equations. I think I can solve for x and y separately and then subtract them, but that might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations again for clarity:\n\nEquation 1: 725x + 727y = 1500\n\nEquation 2: 729x + 731y = 1508\n\nI notice that the coefficients of x and y are very close to each other in both equations. Like, 725 and 729 are close, and 727 and 731 are close. Maybe I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate some terms.\n\nLet me try subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(729x + 731y) - (725x + 727y) = 1508 - 1500\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n(729x - 725x) + (731y - 727y) = 8\n\nSo, 4x + 4y = 8\n\nI can simplify that by dividing both sides by 4:\n\nx + y = 2\n\nOkay, now I have x + y = 2. That's progress.\n\nNow, I need to find x - y. Maybe I can find another equation that involves x - y.\n\nLet me look back at the original equations. Maybe I can manipulate them to get an expression for x - y.\n\nAlternatively, since I have x + y = 2, maybe I can express y in terms of x and substitute back.\n\nFrom x + y = 2, y = 2 - x\n\nNow, I can substitute y = 2 - x into one of the original equations to solve for x.\n\nLet's pick Equation 1: 725x + 727y = 1500\n\nSubstituting y:\n\n725x + 727(2 - x) = 1500\n\nThat becomes:\n\n725x + 1454 - 727x = 1500\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(725x - 727x) + 1454 = 1500\n\n-2x + 1454 = 1500\n\nNow, subtract 1454 from both sides:\n\n-2x = 1500 - 1454\n\n-2x = 46\n\nNow, divide both sides by -2:\n\nx = -23\n\nNow, plug x back into y = 2 - x:\n\ny = 2 - (-23) = 2 + 23 = 25\n\nSo, x = -23 and y = 25\n\nTherefore, x - y = -23 - 25 = -48\n\nLooking back at the options, -48 is one of the choices, so that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a quicker way to get to x - y without solving for x and y individually.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I have x + y = 2 and I want x - y.\n\nI can add these two expressions: (x + y) + (x - y) = 2 + (x - y)\n\nThat would give me 2x = 2 + (x - y)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, subtract (x - y) from (x + y):\n\n(x + y) - (x - y) = 2y\n\nSo, 2 = 2y, which gives y = 1, but that can't be right because earlier I found y = 25.\n\nWait, that can't be. Oh, I see. I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nLet me try another way. Maybe multiply the two equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the sum and difference directly.\n\nWait, actually, going back to the original equations:\n\n725x + 727y = 1500  (Equation 1)\n\n729x + 731y = 1508  (Equation 2)\n\nI already found x + y = 2.\n\nNow, maybe I can find another equation involving x - y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve for x - y directly without finding x and y separately.\n\nLet me try adding the two original equations:\n\n725x + 727y + 729x + 731y = 1500 + 1508\n\nWhich is:\n\n(725x + 729x) + (727y + 731y) = 3008\n\nSo, 1454x + 1458y = 3008\n\nI can simplify this:\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 727x + 729y = 1504\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract the two original equations again to confirm what I already have.\n\nWe did that earlier and got x + y = 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider multiplying one of the equations by a certain factor to eliminate one variable.\n\nBut perhaps the way I did it initially is efficient enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use matrices or determinants to solve the system, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the difference between the two equations in terms of x - y.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that:\n\nEquation 2 - Equation 1: 729x + 731y - 725x - 727y = 1508 - 1500\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4x + 4y = 8, which is x + y = 2, as I had before.\n\nNow, if I have x + y = 2 and I want x - y, maybe I can solve these two equations together.\n\nWait, I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that x = 2 - y, and substitute into one of the original equations.\n\nWait, I did that earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the average of the two equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern or a relationship between the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the difference between the coefficients of x and y in both equations is constant.\n\nWait, in Equation 1: 725x + 727y = 1500\n\nIn Equation 2: 729x + 731y = 1508\n\nThe difference between coefficients: 729 - 725 = 4, and 731 - 727 = 4.\n\nInteresting, so the differences are the same, 4.\n\nMaybe that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficients of x and y are almost the same, differing by 4 each.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the equations in terms of averages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the difference between the equations is related to the difference between x and y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the sum of the equations gives me 1454x + 1458y = 3008, which simplifies to 727x + 729y = 1504.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the difference between the equations is 8, and the difference in coefficients is 4 for both x and y.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a relationship there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the difference in the equations is 4x + 4y = 8, which is x + y = 2.\n\nWhich is what I had earlier.\n\nNow, with x + y = 2 and x - y = ?\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom x + y = 2, and x - y = d (where d is the difference I want to find).\n\nI can add these two equations: (x + y) + (x - y) = 2 + d \u21d2 2x = 2 + d \u21d2 d = 2x - 2\n\nBut I need another equation involving x to solve for d.\n\nAlternatively, subtract (x - y) from (x + y): (x + y) - (x - y) = 2 - d \u21d2 2y = 2 - d \u21d2 d = 2 - 2y\n\nBut again, without knowing y, that doesn't help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express x in terms of d.\n\nFrom x + y = 2, x = 2 - y\n\nAnd x - y = d \u21d2 (2 - y) - y = d \u21d2 2 - 2y = d \u21d2 2y = 2 - d \u21d2 y = (2 - d)/2\n\nBut this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can substitute x = 2 - y into one of the original equations.\n\nWait, I did that earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that x + y = 2 and x - y = d, and perhaps find another equation involving d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that x = (2 + d)/2 and y = (2 - d)/2, from solving the system x + y = 2 and x - y = d.\n\nThen, plug these expressions for x and y back into one of the original equations.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTake Equation 1: 725x + 727y = 1500\n\nSubstitute x = (2 + d)/2 and y = (2 - d)/2:\n\n725*(2 + d)/2 + 727*(2 - d)/2 = 1500\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n725(2 + d) + 727(2 - d) = 3000\n\nExpand:\n\n1450 + 725d + 1454 - 727d = 3000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1450 + 1454) + (725d - 727d) = 3000 \u21d2 2904 - 2d = 3000\n\nSubtract 2904 from both sides:\n\n-2d = 3000 - 2904 \u21d2 -2d = 96 \u21d2 d = -48\n\nSo, x - y = -48\n\nThat matches my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -48.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 725\n\nB. -2\n\nC. 2\n\nD. -48\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. -48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-48} \\]"
