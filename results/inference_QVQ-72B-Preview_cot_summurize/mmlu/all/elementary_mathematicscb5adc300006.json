                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this equation: 3 + p = 15. I need to find out what p equals. The options are A. 3, B. 5, C. 12, D. 18.\n\nHmm, I remember that in an equation like this, I need to isolate the variable, which is p in this case. So, if I have 3 plus p equals 15, I can subtract 3 from both sides to find p.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n3 + p - 3 = 15 - 3\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\np = 12\n\nOkay, so p equals 12. Let me just double-check that.\n\nIf I add 3 and 12, do I get 15?\n\n3 plus 12 is 15. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait a minute, what if I plug in the other options to see if they work.\n\nOption A is 3:\n\n3 + 3 = 6, which is not equal to 15.\n\nOption B is 5:\n\n3 + 5 = 8, not equal to 15.\n\nOption D is 18:\n\n3 + 18 = 21, which is more than 15.\n\nSo, only option C. 12, gives me the correct sum of 15.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about using my fingers to count up from 3 to 15. Let's see:\n\nStart at 3, and count up: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.\n\nHmm, that's 12 steps from 3 to 15. So, again, that confirms that p is 12.\n\nI might also consider using a number line. If I imagine a number line, and I start at 3, and then add p to get to 15, the distance from 3 to 15 is 12 units.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there any chance that p could be negative? Well, in this context, since we're dealing with addition and positive numbers, p being negative doesn't make sense because adding a negative would decrease the sum, not increase it.\n\nSo, p has to be positive, and the only positive number that makes 3 + p = 15 is 12.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about if there's any other operation involved. But the problem clearly says 3 + p = 15, so it's just addition, no subtraction or multiplication here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 12.\n\nI think that's solid. No doubts here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
