Hmm, I need to figure out where the Fashion Institute of Technology is located.\n\nFirst off, I know that there are many fashion institutes around the world, but I think the Fashion Institute of Technology is a specific school. I think it's in New York City. Let me see if I can confirm that.\n\nI recall that New York is a major fashion capital, home to fashion weeks and many design houses. So, it makes sense that the Fashion Institute of Technology would be there. Plus, I think I've heard of FIT being in New York.\n\nLet me consider if any of the other cities have a Fashion Institute of Technology. Paris is also a big fashion city, but I don't think the Fashion Institute of Technology is located there. Maybe there are similar schools in Paris, but I think FIT is specifically in New York.\n\nLos Angeles is known for fashion and design as well, but again, I don't think the Fashion Institute of Technology is there. Maybe there are other fashion schools, but FIT seems to be a New York institution.\n\nMelbourne is a vibrant city with a growing fashion scene, but I'm pretty sure the Fashion Institute of Technology isn't located there. Maybe there are affiliate programs or something, but the main campus is probably in New York.\n\nI should probably trust my initial thought here. New York is a hub for fashion and design, and I'm pretty confident that the Fashion Institute of Technology is located there.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can try to recall if I've ever seen anything official about the Fashion Institute of Technology's location. I think their address is in Manhattan, maybe in the Garment District, which is known for fashion and textiles.\n\nAlso, I remember that many famous fashion designers studied at FIT in New York, which further reinforces that it's located there.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The other cities are also important in the fashion world, but the Fashion Institute of Technology is specifically in New York City.\n\nSo, my answer is B. New York.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. New York}} \\]"
