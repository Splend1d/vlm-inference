                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about banking and lending. It says that the reserve ratio is 0.1, which I believe means that banks have to keep 10% of deposits as reserves. So, if a bank gets $200 in deposits, how much can it lend?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a reserve ratio is. The reserve ratio is the portion of depositor funds that a bank cannot lend out and must keep as reserves. So, if the reserve ratio is 0.1, that means the bank has to keep 10% of deposits as reserves.\n\nSo, for $200 in deposits, the bank has to keep 10% of that as reserves. Let me calculate that:\n\nReserves = 10% of $200 = 0.10 * $200 = $20.\n\nSo, the bank has to keep $20 as reserves. That means the remaining amount can be lent out. Right?\n\nWait, but in reality, is that all they can lend? Or is there more to it?\n\nI think that in the banking system, banks can lend out a multiple of their excess reserves, right? Because when they lend money, that money can be deposited into another bank, which can then lend out a portion of that, and so on. This is called the money multiplier effect.\n\nSo, the initial lending isn't just the excess reserves, but it can lead to a larger amount of money being created in the economy through this multiplier process.\n\nBut the question is asking for the maximum amount the bank can lend, not the total money created through the multiplier effect.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the question is just about the initial lending decision of the bank, not the entire money creation process.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"If a bank gets $200 in deposits, what is the maximum amount it can lend?\"\n\nSo, it's about one bank's lending capacity given new deposits.\n\nGiven that the reserve ratio is 0.1, the bank has to keep 10% of $200 as reserves, which is $20, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the bank can lend out the remaining $180.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. $180.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Is there something more to this?\n\nI recall that in fractional reserve banking, the money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio. So, in this case, the money multiplier would be 1 / 0.1 = 10.\n\nBut again, the question is about the initial lending by the bank that receives the deposit, not the total potential money creation in the banking system.\n\nSo, for this single bank, it can lend out its excess reserves, which are total deposits minus required reserves.\n\nTotal deposits are $200.\n\nRequired reserves are 10% of $200, which is $20.\n\nTherefore, excess reserves are $200 - $20 = $180.\n\nSo, the bank can lend out $180.\n\nBut let's confirm this.\n\nSuppose the bank lends $180. Now, its balance sheet would look like this:\n\nAssets: Loans $180, Reserves $20.\n\nLiabilities: Deposits $200.\n\nIs this correct? Yes, because $200 in deposits minus $20 in reserves equals $180, which is lent out.\n\nIf the bank lends more than $180, say $190, then its reserves would be $200 - $190 = $10, which is exactly the required reserves of 10% of deposits. But in practice, banks typically aim to keep some buffer beyond the required reserves to avoid running out of reserves intraday or to meet regulatory requirements.\n\nHowever, in this theoretical scenario, assuming the bank lends exactly the excess reserves, it would lend $180.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. $180.\n\nBut let's see why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A is $20. That's the required reserves. The bank cannot lend that; it has to keep it as reserves.\n\nOption C is $2,000. That seems too high. If the bank has $200 in deposits and has to keep $20 as reserves, lending $2,000 would mean creating money beyond its reserves, which isn't allowed in fractional reserve banking.\n\nOption D says greater than $200 but less than $500. Well, $180 is less than $200, but it's more than $200? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the option says \"greater than $200 but less than $500.\" If the bank has only $200 in deposits and has to keep $20 as reserves, lending more than $200 would require it to lend out more than its total deposits, which isn't possible unless there's some creative financing or off-balance-sheet activities, which isn't what this question is likely referring to.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $180.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could allow the bank to lend more than $180.\n\nSuppose the bank expects future deposits or has other sources of funds. But the question specifies that it gets $200 in deposits, so we should consider only that amount.\n\nAlso, if the bank borrows from other banks or from the central bank, it could lend more, but again, that's beyond the scope of the question.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the maximum amount the bank can lend is $180.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 180} \\]"
