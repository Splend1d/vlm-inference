                    "text": "So I've got this table here that shows the labor hours needed to produce a unit of wine and cheese in two countries: France and Belgium. The numbers are:\n\n- France:\n\n- Wine: 40 hours\n\n- Cheese: 80 hours\n\n- Belgium:\n\n- Wine: 15 hours\n\n- Cheese: 60 hours\n\nAnd there are four statements to choose from, and I need to figure out which one is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says: \"France has the absolute advantage in both products.\"\n\nOkay, so absolute advantage means that a country can produce a good with fewer resources than another country. In this case, it's about labor hours.\n\nLooking at wine:\n\n- France needs 40 hours\n\n- Belgium needs 15 hours\n\nSo Belgium needs fewer hours to produce wine. That means Belgium has the absolute advantage in wine, not France.\n\nFor cheese:\n\n- France needs 80 hours\n\n- Belgium needs 60 hours\n\nAgain, Belgium needs fewer hours, so Belgium also has the absolute advantage in cheese.\n\nTherefore, France does not have the absolute advantage in both products. So, option A is false.\n\nNext, option B: \"France should specialize in and export wine while Belgium should specialize in and export cheese.\"\n\nThis seems to be based on the concept of comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. Comparative advantage is about producing goods for which a country has the lowest opportunity cost.\n\nTo determine comparative advantage, I need to calculate the opportunity cost for each country in producing each good.\n\nFirst, let's find the opportunity cost for France:\n\n- Wine: 40 hours\n\n- Cheese: 80 hours\n\nSo, the opportunity cost of producing one unit of wine is the amount of cheese that could have been produced with those 40 hours.\n\nSince 40 hours are used for wine, how much cheese could have been produced in those 40 hours?\n\nWell, since cheese takes 80 hours per unit, in 40 hours, France can produce 40/80 = 0.5 units of cheese.\n\nSo, the opportunity cost of wine is 0.5 units of cheese.\n\nSimilarly, the opportunity cost of cheese is the amount of wine that could have been produced in those 80 hours.\n\n80 hours divided by 40 hours per unit of wine is 80/40 = 2 units of wine.\n\nSo, the opportunity cost of cheese is 2 units of wine.\n\nNow, for Belgium:\n\n- Wine: 15 hours\n\n- Cheese: 60 hours\n\nOpportunity cost of wine: how much cheese could be produced in 15 hours.\n\n15 hours divided by 60 hours per unit of cheese is 15/60 = 0.25 units of cheese.\n\nSo, the opportunity cost of wine is 0.25 units of cheese.\n\nOpportunity cost of cheese: how much wine could be produced in 60 hours.\n\n60 hours divided by 15 hours per unit of wine is 60/15 = 4 units of wine.\n\nSo, the opportunity cost of cheese is 4 units of wine.\n\nNow, to determine comparative advantage:\n\nA country has a comparative advantage in the good with the lower opportunity cost.\n\nFor France:\n\n- Opportunity cost of wine: 0.5 units of cheese\n\n- Opportunity cost of cheese: 2 units of wine\n\nSo, wine has a lower opportunity cost for France compared to cheese.\n\nTherefore, France should specialize in wine.\n\nFor Belgium:\n\n- Opportunity cost of wine: 0.25 units of cheese\n\n- Opportunity cost of cheese: 4 units of wine\n\nHere, cheese has a lower opportunity cost for Belgium compared to wine.\n\nTherefore, Belgium should specialize in cheese.\n\nSo, option B seems to suggest that, which aligns with the comparative advantage theory.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure.\n\nAccording to comparative advantage, countries should produce and export the good in which they have a comparative advantage and import the other good.\n\nSo, France has a comparative advantage in wine, so it should produce and export wine.\n\nBelgium has a comparative advantage in cheese, so it should produce and export cheese.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nBut let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption C: \"France has the comparative advantage in cheese.\"\n\nBut according to our calculations, France has a comparative advantage in wine, not cheese.\n\nSo, this is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"France has the absolute advantage in cheese.\"\n\nWe already saw that Belgium has the absolute advantage in cheese, since it takes fewer hours for Belgium to produce cheese (60 hours vs. 80 hours for France).\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, the only true statement among the options is B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the opportunity costs to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nFor France:\n\n- Wine: 40 hours per unit\n\n- Cheese: 80 hours per unit\n\nSo, per unit of wine, France gives up 0.5 units of cheese (since 40 hours can produce 0.5 units of cheese).\n\nFor Belgium:\n\n- Wine: 15 hours per unit\n\n- Cheese: 60 hours per unit\n\nSo, per unit of wine, Belgium gives up 0.25 units of cheese (15 hours can produce 0.25 units of cheese).\n\nSo, indeed, France has a lower opportunity cost in wine compared to Belgium, meaning France should specialize in wine.\n\nSimilarly, for cheese, France gives up 2 units of wine per unit of cheese, while Belgium gives up 4 units of wine per unit of cheese.\n\nSo, Belgium has a lower opportunity cost in cheese compared to France, meaning Belgium should specialize in cheese.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
