                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 2,817 homes in West Valley, and each home uses an average of 380 gallons of water each day. We need to find the total number of gallons of water all these homes use together in a day. The expression given is 2,817 multiplied by 380. Okay, so mathematically, that's 2,817 \u00d7 380.\n\nFirst off, I need to calculate this multiplication to find the total water usage. Now, multiplying such large numbers can be a bit daunting at first, but there are ways to make it manageable. One way is to use the standard algorithm for multiplication, which I learned in school. But another way that sometimes makes it easier is to break down the numbers into smaller parts and multiply them separately, then add up the results. This is called the distributive property.\n\nLet me consider both methods.\n\n**Method 1: Standard Multiplication Algorithm**\n\nI'll set up the multiplication vertically to make it easier to manage.\n\nSo, 2,817 \u00d7 380.\n\nFirst, I need to align the numbers by their place values.\n\nLet's write it like this:\n\n```\n\n  2817\n\n\u00d7  380\n\n------\n\n```\n\nNow, I'll multiply 2,817 by 0 in the units place. That gives 0, so I'll write that down.\n\nNext, multiply 2,817 by 8 in the tens place. But remember, because it's the tens place, I need to shift the result one place to the left (which is equivalent to multiplying by 10).\n\nSo, 2,817 \u00d7 8 = 22,536. Then, shifting one place to the left makes it 225,360.\n\nFinally, multiply 2,817 by 3 in the hundreds place. Again, shift the result two places to the left (multiplying by 100).\n\nSo, 2,817 \u00d7 3 = 8,451. Shifting two places to the left makes it 845,100.\n\nNow, add all these up:\n\n0 + 225,360 + 845,100 = 1,070,460\n\nSo, the total water usage is 1,070,460 gallons.\n\n**Method 2: Distributive Property**\n\nAlternatively, I can break down 2,817 into smaller parts that are easier to multiply by 380.\n\nFor example:\n\n2,817 = 2,000 + 800 + 17\n\nNow, multiply each part by 380 and add them up.\n\nFirst, 2,000 \u00d7 380.\n\n2,000 \u00d7 300 = 600,000\n\n2,000 \u00d7 80 = 160,000\n\nSo, 600,000 + 160,000 = 760,000\n\nNext, 800 \u00d7 380.\n\n800 \u00d7 300 = 240,000\n\n800 \u00d7 80 = 64,000\n\nSo, 240,000 + 64,000 = 304,000\n\nThen, 17 \u00d7 380.\n\n10 \u00d7 380 = 3,800\n\n7 \u00d7 380 = 2,660\n\nSo, 3,800 + 2,660 = 6,460\n\nNow, add all these results together:\n\n760,000 + 304,000 + 6,460 = 1,070,460\n\nSame result as before, 1,070,460 gallons.\n\n**Checking the Answer**\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 860,460 gallons\n\nB. 870,460 gallons\n\nC. 1,060,460 gallons\n\nD. 1,070,460 gallons\n\nMy calculation leads me to choose option D. But just to be thorough, let me double-check my work.\n\n**Double-Checking with Estimation**\n\nMaybe I can estimate to see if my answer makes sense.\n\nRound 2,817 to 2,800 and 380 to 400.\n\nThen, 2,800 \u00d7 400 = 1,120,000 gallons.\n\nBut this is an overestimation because both numbers were rounded up.\n\nLet's see another estimate.\n\n2,800 \u00d7 380.\n\n2,800 \u00d7 400 = 1,120,000\n\n2,800 \u00d7 20 = 56,000 (since 380 is 400 - 20)\n\nSo, 1,120,000 - 56,000 = 1,064,000\n\nBut this is still higher than my original calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate 2,800 \u00d7 380 more carefully.\n\n2,800 \u00d7 300 = 840,000\n\n2,800 \u00d7 80 = 224,000\n\nTotal: 840,000 + 224,000 = 1,064,000\n\nSo, my earlier calculation was 1,070,460, but this estimate gives 1,064,000.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in estimating.\n\nActually, 2,800 \u00d7 380 should be calculated as:\n\n2,800 \u00d7 400 = 1,120,000\n\nBut 380 is 400 - 20, so:\n\n2,800 \u00d7 (400 - 20) = 2,800 \u00d7 400 - 2,800 \u00d7 20 = 1,120,000 - 56,000 = 1,064,000\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut my earlier calculation gave 1,070,460.\n\nWait a minute, there's a difference between 1,070,460 and 1,064,000.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me re-examine my steps.\n\n**Re-examining the Calculation**\n\nGoing back to the standard multiplication:\n\n2,817 \u00d7 380\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n2,817 \u00d7 0 = 0\n\n2,817 \u00d7 80 = 225,360\n\n2,817 \u00d7 300 = 845,100\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 225,360 + 845,100 = 1,070,460\n\nBut according to my estimation, 2,800 \u00d7 380 = 1,064,000, which is less than 1,070,460.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that 2,817 is larger than 2,800, so the actual total should be higher than 1,064,000.\n\nIndeed, 2,817 - 2,800 = 17\n\nSo, the difference is 17 homes.\n\nEach of these 17 homes uses 380 gallons, so 17 \u00d7 380 = 6,460 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the total water usage should be 1,064,000 + 6,460 = 1,070,460 gallons.\n\nAh, now it makes sense. My estimation was 1,064,000, and the actual calculation adds 6,460 to account for the extra 17 homes, totaling 1,070,460.\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed 1,070,460 gallons, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully calculating and cross-verifying using different methods, I am confident that the total number of gallons of water the homes in West Valley use on average each day is 1,070,460 gallons. Therefore, the correct choice is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
