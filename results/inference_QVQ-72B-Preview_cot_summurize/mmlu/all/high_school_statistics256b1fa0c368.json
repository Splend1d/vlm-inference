                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. So, Semir rolls a six-sided die every morning to decide his breakfast, and depending on that, there's a chance he might be late for school. I need to find the probability that he'll be on time any given day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. There's a die with six sides, numbered 1 through 6. If he rolls a 1 or 2, he cooks a big breakfast. If he rolls a 3 or higher (which would be 3, 4, 5, or 6), he grabs a quick, lighter breakfast.\n\nNow, when he cooks a big breakfast, there's a 15% chance he'll be late for school. If he has a lighter breakfast, there's a 6% chance he'll be late.\n\nI need to find the overall probability that he will be on time for school.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the probability of each breakfast scenario and then the corresponding probability of being on time in each case.\n\nStarting with the big breakfast:\n\n- The probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on a six-sided die is 2 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\n- Given that he cooks a big breakfast, there's a 15% chance he's late, which means there's an 85% chance he's on time.\n\nSo, the probability of being on time given he cooks a big breakfast is 85% of 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, for the lighter breakfast:\n\n- The probability of rolling a 3, 4, 5, or 6 is 4 out of 6, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\n- Given that he has a lighter breakfast, there's a 6% chance he's late, so there's a 94% chance he's on time.\n\nTherefore, the probability of being on time given he has a lighter breakfast is 94% of 2/3.\n\nTo find the overall probability that he's on time, I need to add these two probabilities together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(on time) = P(big breakfast) * P(on time | big breakfast) + P(light breakfast) * P(on time | light breakfast)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(on time) = (1/3) * 0.85 + (2/3) * 0.94\n\nNow, I need to calculate this.\n\nFirst, calculate (1/3) * 0.85:\n\n1/3 is approximately 0.333...\n\n0.333 * 0.85 =\n\nLet's see, 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255\n\n0.033 * 0.85 = approximately 0.02805\n\nSo total is approximately 0.255 + 0.02805 = 0.28305\n\nNow, calculate (2/3) * 0.94:\n\n2/3 is approximately 0.666...\n\n0.666 * 0.94 =\n\n0.6 * 0.94 = 0.564\n\n0.066 * 0.94 = approximately 0.06204\n\nTotal is approximately 0.564 + 0.06204 = 0.62604\n\nNow, add both results:\n\n0.28305 + 0.62604 = 0.90909\n\nSo, approximately 0.909, which is about 90.9%, but looking at the options, 0.91 is the closest.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA. 0.09\n\nB. 0.21\n\nC. 0.8\n\nD. 0.91\n\nSo, 0.91 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, probability of big breakfast is indeed 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nProbability of light breakfast is 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nGiven big breakfast, probability of being on time is 100% - 15% = 85%, or 0.85.\n\nGiven light breakfast, probability of being on time is 100% - 6% = 94%, or 0.94.\n\nThen, P(on time) = (1/3)*0.85 + (2/3)*0.94.\n\nCalculating (1/3)*0.85:\n\n1/3 \u2248 0.33333...\n\n0.33333 * 0.85 = 0.2833275\n\nThen, (2/3)*0.94:\n\n2/3 \u2248 0.66666...\n\n0.66666 * 0.94 = 0.626664\n\nAdding both: 0.2833275 + 0.626664 \u2248 0.9099915, which rounds to 0.91.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 0.91.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in the reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 0.91} \\]"
