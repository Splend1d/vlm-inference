Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. So, I can look at the rows or the columns to determine the rank.\n\nLet me look at the rows first. The first row is [1, 1, 1], the second is [1, 1, 1], and the third is [1, 1, 1]. So, all rows are the same. That means they are not linearly independent because if I add or subtract them, I get zero rows. So, the rank can't be 3. Option D is out.\n\nNow, could the rank be 2? For the rank to be 2, there would need to be two linearly independent rows. But since all rows are identical, any two rows are dependent on each other. So, no, the rank can't be 2. That means options A, B, and C are still possible.\n\nWait a minute, option A is 0. Is the rank 0? That would mean there are no linearly independent rows. But in this matrix, all rows are the same, but they are not zero rows. So, there is at least one non-zero row, which means the rank has to be at least 1. So, option A is out.\n\nSo now, between options B and C, which one is correct? Option B is 1, and option C is 2. Since all rows are identical, the rank is 1 because there is only one unique row. So, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should look at the columns instead. The first column is [1, 1, 1], the second is [1, 1, 1], and the third is [1, 1, 1]. Again, all columns are identical. So, they are not linearly independent. Therefore, the rank based on columns would also be 1.\n\nWait, but what if I try to reduce the matrix to row echelon form? Maybe that will help confirm.\n\nLet's try row reduction:\n\nStart with\n\nA = [[1, 1, 1],\n\n     [1, 1, 1],\n\n     [1, 1, 1]]\n\nSubtract the first row from the second and third rows:\n\n[[1, 1, 1],\n\n [0, 0, 0],\n\n [0, 0, 0]]\n\nNow, the row echelon form has one non-zero row. So, the rank is 1.\n\nThat seems straightforward. So, the rank is 1, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the definition of rank again. Rank is the dimension of the row space or the column space. Since all rows are identical, the row space is spanned by a single vector [1, 1, 1], so its dimension is 1.\n\nSimilarly, the column space is spanned by the same vector repeated three times, so its dimension is also 1.\n\nTherefore, the rank of matrix A is indeed 1.\n\nI think that's it. The answer is option B. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
