                    "text": "So I've got this question here about molecular geometry based on the number of sigma bonds and nonbonding pairs of electrons. The question says that there are five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons. I need to figure out which geometry corresponds to this arrangement: tetrahedron, square planar, octahedron, or square pyramid.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what these terms mean. Sigma bonds are the single covalent bonds between atoms, and nonbonding pairs are lone pairs of electrons that aren't involved in bonding. The geometry of a molecule is determined by the arrangement of these bonds and lone pairs around the central atom.\n\nI think back to the VSEPR theory, which helps predict the molecular shape based on the repulsion between valence electrons. The number of sigma bonds and lone pairs determines the electron domain geometry, and from there, the molecular geometry.\n\nSo, let's list out what each option typically looks like:\n\nA. Tetrahedron: This is a four-sided pyramid shape, with bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees. It's common for molecules with four regions of electron density around the central atom.\n\nB. Square planar: This is a flat shape where the central atom is surrounded by four atoms or groups at 90-degree angles. It's often seen in coordination complexes or certain molecules with six electron domains.\n\nC. Octahedron: This is a three-dimensional shape with eight faces, and the central atom is surrounded by six atoms or groups at 90 and 180-degree angles.\n\nD. Square pyramid: This is a shape where the base is a square and the apex is offset above the center of the base. It has five regions of electron density around the central atom, with one of them being a lone pair in this case.\n\nGiven that there are five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair, the total number of electron domains around the central atom is six (five bonds + one lone pair). According to VSEPR theory, six electron domains arrange themselves in an octahedral fashion.\n\nHowever, the presence of a lone pair can distort the geometry. In an octahedral arrangement, if one of the positions is occupied by a lone pair, the molecular geometry becomes square pyramidal.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. In an octahedral electron domain geometry, if all six domains are bonding pairs, the molecular geometry is octahedral. If one domain is a lone pair, then the molecular geometry is square pyramidal, because one of the positions is not occupied by an atom.\n\nSo, in this case, with five sigma bonds and one lone pair, that should correspond to a square pyramidal geometry.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be any exceptions or if another geometry might also fit this description.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Tetrahedron: Typically for four electron domains, which doesn't match our six domains.\n\nB. Square planar: This is usually for molecules with six electron domains but only four bonding pairs, often seen in certain transition metal complexes.\n\nC. Octahedron: Six bonding pairs, which isn't the case here since we have one lone pair.\n\nD. Square pyramid: Five bonding pairs and one lone pair, which matches our scenario.\n\nSo, based on this, the square pyramid seems to be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but I thought in octahedral geometry with one lone pair, it's square pyramidal. Is that accurate?\n\nLet me think about sulfur dioxide chloride (SFCl\u2082). It has six electron domains around sulfur: five sigma bonds (to two fluorines and two chlorines) and one lone pair. Its geometry is described as square pyramidal.\n\nSimilarly, in iodine pentachloride (ICl\u2085), iodine has five sigma bonds to chlorine and one lone pair, also adopting a square pyramidal geometry.\n\nSo, yes, in these cases, it's square pyramidal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of another geometry fitting the description.\n\nIf we had five sigma bonds and one lone pair, that's a total of six electron domains, which should indeed be octahedral in electron domain geometry. However, since one of them is a lone pair, the molecular geometry is square pyramidal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Square pyramid.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look at the other options again:\n\nA. Tetrahedron: This would require four electron domains, not six.\n\nB. Square planar: This typically involves six electron domains but with two lone pairs, leading to a square planar shape with the lone pairs occupying axial positions.\n\nC. Octahedron: Six bonding pairs, which isn't the case here.\n\nD. Square pyramid: Matches the description of five bonding pairs and one lone pair.\n\nHence, D. Square pyramid is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
