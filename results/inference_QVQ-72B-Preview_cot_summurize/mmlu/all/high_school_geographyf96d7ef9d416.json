                    "text": "So I have this question about agricultural practices, and it's asking what it's called when farmers plant and harvest the same crop more than once a year on the same land. The options are swidden, double cropping, pastoralism, and intertillage. I need to figure out which one fits this description.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each term means. Starting with swidden, I think it's a type of farming where forests are cleared, usually by burning, and then crops are planted. But I'm not sure if that involves planting the same crop multiple times a year. Maybe it's more about rotating areas being farmed over time.\n\nDouble cropping sounds like it might involve planting two crops in a year on the same land. That seems to match the description of planting and harvesting the same crop more than once a year. But is it the same crop, or could it be different crops? I need to check that.\n\nPastoralism, I believe, is more about raising livestock, like sheep or cattle, rather than growing crops. So, that probably doesn't fit the description of planting and harvesting crops.\n\nIntertillage sounds a bit unfamiliar. I think tillage is the preparation of soil by plowing or similar methods. Intercropping is when you plant different crops in the same area at the same time, like planting corn and beans together. But intertillage might refer to some specific farming technique involving soil preparation between rows or something. Not sure if that's about planting the same crop multiple times a year.\n\nGoing back to double cropping, I recall that it involves growing two distinct crops on the same land in a single growing season. So, for example, you might plant a spring crop and then a fall crop on the same piece of land in the same year. This seems to align with the idea of planting and harvesting more than once a year.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"the same crop\" more than once a year. Double cropping often involves different crops, not necessarily the same one. For instance, you might plant wheat in the spring and soybeans in the fall, but not necessarily wheat twice in the same year.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a distinction here. If it's the same crop being planted multiple times a year, that might be different from double cropping, which typically involves different crops.\n\nLet me do a quick search to confirm. Oh, interesting. It seems that double cropping can sometimes involve the same crop, especially in certain contexts like rice farming in some regions where they have multiple rice plantings in a year due to favorable climate and water availability.\n\nBut generally, double cropping is considered growing two different crops in a year on the same land. So, maybe it's not the perfect fit for the description provided in the question.\n\nIs there another term that might fit better? The question mentions \"intensive agricultural practice,\" which suggests that it's a method aimed at maximizing production from the land.\n\nSwidden, also known as slash-and-burn agriculture, is more of a shifting cultivation practice where land is cleared, farmed for a few years, and then allowed to regenerate. It doesn't involve multiple plantings of the same crop in a single year.\n\nPastoralism is indeed about raising animals, not planting crops, so that doesn't fit.\n\nIntertillage seems to refer to the practice of cultivating the soil between rows of crops, perhaps to control weeds or improve soil aeration. It's more about soil management than about planting multiple crops in a year.\n\nGiven that, perhaps double cropping is still the closest option, even if it typically involves different crops. Maybe in some contexts, it can involve the same crop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific term for planting the same crop multiple times a year. Let me think about rice farming in places like Southeast Asia, where they might have multiple rice paddies with different planting times to allow for multiple harvests in a year. Is there a term for that?\n\nI recall something called \"multiple cropping\" or \"serial cropping,\" but I'm not sure if that's the exact term.\n\nWait, maybe it's continuous cropping, but that sounds more like farming the same land without a fallow period, not necessarily planting the same crop multiple times a year.\n\nAnother thought: in some areas, farmers practice relay cropping, where they plant a second crop before the first one is harvested, but that might not necessarily involve the same crop.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to look up the definition of double cropping to see if it can involve the same crop.\n\nUpon checking, double cropping is defined as the practice of growing two distinct crops on the same field in a single growing season. It doesn't specify that they have to be different crops, but in practice, it's often different crops to manage soil nutrients better.\n\nHowever, in some cases, especially with crops like rice or vegetables, farmers might plant the same crop twice in a year if the climate and soil conditions allow it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps double cropping could encompass both planting different or the same crops twice a year.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"the same crop more than once a year,\" I need to choose the option that best fits this description.\n\nOption B is double cropping, which, as I've learned, can include planting the same crop multiple times a year in some contexts.\n\nOption A, swidden, is a different type of agriculture involving clearing and burning forested land, which isn't directly related to multiple plantings in a year.\n\nOption C, pastoralism, is about livestock farming, not crop cultivation.\n\nOption D, intertillage, seems to be related to soil cultivation practices between rows of crops, not about planting multiple crops in a year.\n\nTherefore, between the given options, double cropping is the most appropriate choice for describing the practice of planting and harvesting the same crop more than once a year.\n\nI think the answer is B. double cropping.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
