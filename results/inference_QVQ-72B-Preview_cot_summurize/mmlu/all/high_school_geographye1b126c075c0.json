                    "text": "So I have this question here about migration types, and I need to figure out which form of migration farm workers from another country are most likely practicing during the year. The options are chain migration, cluster migration, circular migration, and international migration. Let me try to understand each one.\n\nFirst, chain migration sounds familiar. I think it's when families or social networks follow one another to a new area. Like, one person moves, and then they bring or encourage others they know to come too. So, it's kind of like a chain, where each link pulls the next person along. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit for farm workers who come seasonally.\n\nCluster migration seems a bit similar but maybe more about groups staying together in one area. Maybe like communities that settle in a particular neighborhood or region. But again, for farm workers who move around a lot, this might not be the perfect description.\n\nCircular migration\u2014that sounds interesting. It makes me think of people moving back and forth between places, maybe seasonally or periodically. Farm workers often move to different regions during harvest times and then return home after the season ends. So, this seems possible.\n\nInternational migration is just moving across international borders, which could apply to farm workers coming from another country. But it's a pretty broad term and doesn't specify the pattern of movement.\n\nGiven that, I think circular migration is the most appropriate choice here because it describes a pattern of movement where people regularly move between places, often in response to economic opportunities like seasonal work in agriculture. Farm workers might come to a particular area for the harvest season and then return home afterward, repeating this cycle yearly.\n\nLet me double-check. Chain migration involves networks of people moving one after another, which might happen with farm workers to some extent, but it doesn't capture the seasonal nature of their movement. Cluster migration seems more about grouping in specific areas, which might not necessarily apply to farm workers who are more mobile.\n\nInternational migration is a general term for moving between countries, so while farm workers coming from another country are indeed international migrants, the question is asking about their movement pattern during the year, which suggests a more specific type of migration.\n\nTherefore, circular migration is the best answer here because it specifically refers to the repetitive and temporary movement of individuals between different locations, often driven by labor demands, which perfectly fits the description of farm workers' movements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
