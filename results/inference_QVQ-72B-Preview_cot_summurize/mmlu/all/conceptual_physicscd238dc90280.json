                    "text": "So I have this question about colors: \"The complementary color of blue is...\" and the options are A. magenta, B. yellow, C. cyan, D. white. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the complementary color of blue.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what a complementary color is. I think complementary colors are pairs of colors that, when combined, produce white light or grayish color depending on the context. They're opposite each other on the color wheel. So, if I can visualize the color wheel, blue is usually opposite to orange, isn't it?\n\nWait, but none of the options are orange. The options are magenta, yellow, cyan, and white. So maybe my understanding of the color wheel isn't accurate, or perhaps there's a different way to look at this.\n\nLet me think about color theory. There are different models for colors, like the RGB model and the CMYK model. RGB is additive color mixing, primarily used for screens, where red, green, and blue lights are combined to produce white. CMYK is subtractive color mixing, used in printing, where cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks are combined to produce colors.\n\nSo, in the RGB model, blue is one of the primary colors. Its complementary color would be the color that, when added to blue, produces white light. What color is that?\n\nLet me consider the color yellow. In the RGB model, yellow is a combination of red and green. Blue is the third primary color. So, if I add blue and yellow (which is red and green), that should give me white light because red, green, and blue together make white.\n\nWait, but yellow is not one of the options besides A, C, and D. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption A is magenta. Magenta is a combination of red and blue in the RGB model, I believe. So, if blue is already in magenta, then adding more blue wouldn't make white; it would make a darker shade of blue or something.\n\nOption B is yellow, which seems promising based on my earlier thought.\n\nOption C is cyan, which in the RGB model is a combination of green and blue. So, adding blue to cyan would add more blue, making it a deeper blue or something, but not necessarily white.\n\nOption D is white. Well, white is already the combination of all colors in the RGB model, so adding blue to white wouldn't change it, which doesn't seem right for a complementary color.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like yellow is the complementary color of blue because adding blue and yellow (red and green) in the RGB model produces white light.\n\nBut wait, in the CMYK model, cyan, magenta, and yellow are the primary colors, and red, green, and blue are the secondary colors. So, maybe from that perspective, the complementary color of blue would be different.\n\nLet me check online or recall if I can find any specific information about complementary colors.\n\nI remember that in art classes, complementary colors are colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel and, when paired together, can create a strong contrast or, when mixed, create a neutral tone.\n\nIn the traditional color wheel, blue is opposite to orange. However, in the RGB color model, the complementary color of blue is yellow, since blue and yellow (red and green) add up to white light.\n\nBut looking back at the options, magenta is also a possibility in some color models, but I think in the RGB model, yellow is the complementary color of blue.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the subtractive color model as well. In CMYK, cyan, magenta, and yellow are the primary colors, and red, green, and blue are the secondary colors produced by mixing them.\n\nSo, in CMYK, blue would be represented by a combination of cyan and magenta. To find its complementary color, I'd need to look for the color that, when combined with blue, produces white.\n\nIn CMYK, the complementary color of blue (cyan + magenta) would be yellow, because yellow is the opposite of blue in the CMYK color wheel.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with the RGB model as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the complementary color of blue is cyan, but that doesn't make much sense because cyan is already a shade of blue-green.\n\nNo, in the RGB model, cyan is green and blue, so adding blue to cyan would just make it more blue, not white.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach. In the RGB color model, the complementary color of blue is yellow because blue has the hex code #0000FF, and yellow is #FFFF00. When you mix blue and yellow light, they produce white light.\n\nIn the CMYK color model, blue is represented by cyan and black, and its complementary color is yellow.\n\nSo, in both major color models, the complementary color of blue is yellow.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. yellow.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider the properties of complementary colors.\n\nComplementary colors are pairs that add up to white light in the additive color model (RGB) and to black in the subtractive color model (CMYK).\n\nIn RGB:\n\n- Red and cyan are complementary.\n\n- Green and magenta are complementary.\n\n- Blue and yellow are complementary.\n\nIn CMYK:\n\n- Cyan and red are complementary.\n\n- Magenta and green are complementary.\n\n- Yellow and blue are complementary.\n\nSo, consistently, blue and yellow are complementary colors.\n\nTherefore, the complementary color of blue is yellow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. yellow}} \\]"
