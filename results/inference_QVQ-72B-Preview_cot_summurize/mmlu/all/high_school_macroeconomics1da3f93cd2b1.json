                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an economy that only produces two goods: cheese and crackers. We need to calculate the GDP of this economy. GDP, as I recall, stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all final goods and services produced by a country in a given period. Since we're dealing with only two goods, it should be straightforward.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Cheese retails for $3 per pound, and 10 pounds are produced.\n\n- Crackers sell for $2 per pound, and 20 pounds are produced.\n\nOur goal is to find the total GDP from these two products.\n\nI think the key here is to calculate the total value of each good produced and then sum them up to get the total GDP.\n\nSo, for cheese:\n\nPrice per pound = $3\n\nQuantity produced = 10 pounds\n\nTotal value of cheese = price \u00d7 quantity = $3 \u00d7 10 = $30\n\nFor crackers:\n\nPrice per pound = $2\n\nQuantity produced = 20 pounds\n\nTotal value of crackers = price \u00d7 quantity = $2 \u00d7 20 = $40\n\nNow, total GDP from these two goods = value of cheese + value of crackers = $30 + $40 = $70\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $35\n\nB. $1,200\n\nC. $70\n\nD. $150\n\nIt seems like $70 is one of the options, so maybe the answer is C. But let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this problem? Well, sometimes GDP calculations can be tricky, especially with concepts like market prices, but in this case, it's pretty straightforward since we're dealing with final goods directly.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other factors that might affect the GDP calculation here. For example, if there were intermediate goods or services involved, but no, the problem states that only cheese and crackers are produced, and they are final goods ready for consumption.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether these prices include taxes or are they market prices. The question says \"retails for $3 a pound,\" which suggests these are the prices at which they are sold to the final consumers, including any taxes. But to keep it simple, maybe we can assume these are just the market prices without considering taxes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the units. GDP is typically expressed in terms of dollars, and here we have prices per pound and quantities in pounds. So multiplying price per pound by quantity gives the total value in dollars, which seems correct.\n\nLet me see if there's any trick or additional complexity here. Perhaps the problem wants the GDP in terms of total revenue or something else, but no, it clearly asks for GDP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want us to consider the value added, but again, with final goods, the value added should be equal to the market price.\n\nHmm, another thought: maybe the problem is trying to test understanding of real vs. nominal GDP, but since no time period is specified, that might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"produced,\" which implies a specific period, but it doesn't specify, so perhaps it's for one year.\n\nAlso, since it's an economy producing only these two goods, there are no other sectors contributing to GDP, like services or anything else.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the straightforward approach is correct: calculate the total value of cheese and the total value of crackers, and sum them up to get $70.\n\nBut let's check the other options to see if any of them make sense.\n\nOption A is $35. That's half of what I calculated. Maybe someone thought to add the quantities instead of the values, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B is $1,200. That's way higher than my calculation. Maybe someone multiplied the quantities and prices incorrectly or considered multiple periods.\n\nOption D is $150. That's three times the value of crackers ($60) plus the value of cheese ($30), but I don't see a logical reason for that.\n\nTherefore, the only sensible answer seems to be C. $70.\n\nTo confirm, let's re-calculate:\n\nCheese: $3/pound \u00d7 10 pounds = $30\n\nCrackers: $2/pound \u00d7 20 pounds = $40\n\nTotal GDP = $30 + $40 = $70\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
