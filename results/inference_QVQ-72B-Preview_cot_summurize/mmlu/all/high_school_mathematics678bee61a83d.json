                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a number's prime factors are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31. And I need to figure out which of the given options\u20144, 6, 10, or 15\u2014must be a factor of this number. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that the prime factors of a number are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. So, if the prime factors are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31, that means the number is some product of these primes, possibly raised to powers. But the problem specifies that these are the prime factors, so I think I can assume that the number is something like 2^a * 5^b * 7^c * 13^d * 31^e, where a, b, c, d, and e are positive integers.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these options must be a factor of this number. To do that, I should probably look at each option and see if its prime factors are all contained within the prime factors of the number.\n\nLet's list out the prime factors of each option:\n\nA. 4: 2^2\n\nB. 6: 2 * 3\n\nC. 10: 2 * 5\n\nD. 15: 3 * 5\n\nOkay, so for each option, I need to check if its prime factors are all present in the number's prime factors.\n\nLooking at the number's prime factors: 2, 5, 7, 13, 31.\n\nOption A is 4, which is 2^2. So, it requires two 2's. But in the number's prime factors, there's at least one 2 (since 2 is listed), but maybe more or less depending on the exponents. Wait, actually, the problem just says the prime factors are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31. It doesn't specify the exponents. Hmm.\n\nOption B is 6, which is 2 * 3. But 3 isn't among the number's prime factors, so 6 can't be a factor of the number. So, option B is out.\n\nOption C is 10, which is 2 * 5. Both 2 and 5 are among the number's prime factors. So, it seems possible.\n\nOption D is 15, which is 3 * 5. But 3 isn't among the number's prime factors, so 15 can't be a factor of the number. So, option D is out.\n\nNow, between options A and C, option A is 4 (2^2), and option C is 10 (2 * 5).\n\nLet me think about the exponents. The number is 2^a * 5^b * 7^c * 13^d * 31^e, where a, b, c, d, e are positive integers.\n\nFor 4 to be a factor, which is 2^2, the number must have at least two 2's in its prime factorization. Since the number has 2 as one of its prime factors, but we don't know the exponent, it's possible that a is 1 or greater. So, if a is at least 2, then 4 would be a factor. But the problem says \"must be a factor,\" so I need to consider if it's necessarily true that a >= 2.\n\nSimilarly, for 10 to be a factor, which is 2 * 5, the number must have at least one 2 and one 5 in its prime factorization. Since both are present, and their exponents are at least 1, 10 must be a factor.\n\nWait a minute. If a is 1 and b is 1, then the number is 2 * 5 * 7^c * 13^d * 31^e, which would include 2 and 5, so 10 is a factor. If a is greater than 1, then 10 is still a factor. So, regardless of the exponents, as long as a >= 1 and b >= 1, which they are since they're positive integers, 10 must be a factor.\n\nOn the other hand, for 4 to be a factor, we need a >= 2. But a could be 1; for example, if the number is 2 * 5 * 7, which is possible, then 4 wouldn't be a factor because there's only one 2. So, in that case, 4 isn't necessarily a factor.\n\nTherefore, 10 must be a factor of the number, whereas 4 may or may not be, depending on the exponent of 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 10.\n\nLet me double-check. If the number is 2^a * 5^b * 7^c * 13^d * 31^e, with a, b, c, d, e >=1.\n\nThen, 10 is 2 * 5, which are both factors of the number, so 10 must divide the number.\n\nWhereas 4 is 2^2, and if a=1, then 4 doesn't divide the number.\n\nHence, 10 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
