                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Carson owns 40% of a C corporation. The corporation made $400,000 in taxable income and distributed $70,000 in dividends to all shareholders. Carson reported $28,000 in gross income on their individual tax return. Now, the question is asking what Carson would have reported if the corporation had been an S corporation instead, assuming distributions were proportionate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between C corporations and S corporations in terms of taxation.\n\nA C corporation is subject to corporate tax on its taxable income. Then, when it distributes dividends to shareholders, those dividends are taxed again at the shareholder level. So, there's double taxation here: once at the corporate level and again at the individual level.\n\nOn the other hand, an S corporation is not subject to corporate tax. Instead, its taxable income passes through to the shareholders, who then report their share of the corporation's income on their individual tax returns. So, there's only one level of taxation.\n\nGiven that, in the original scenario, the corporation is a C corporation. It made $400,000 in taxable income and distributed $70,000 in dividends. Carson, owning 40%, would receive 40% of the dividends distributed.\n\nLet me confirm Carson's dividend income:\n\nDividends total: $70,000\n\nCarson's share: 40% of $70,000 = $28,000\n\nYes, that matches what's stated.\n\nNow, if the corporation were an S corporation, things would change.\n\nFirst, the $400,000 in taxable income would pass through to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership.\n\nCarson owns 40%, so their share of the taxable income would be 40% of $400,000.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n40% of $400,000 = $160,000\n\nSo, Carson would report $160,000 in taxable income from the S corporation on their individual tax return.\n\nBut wait, in the C corporation scenario, Carson only reported $28,000 in dividends. So, switching to an S corporation would result in Carson reporting much more income.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any other factors at play.\n\nIs there any chance that Carson's basis in the stock affects the income reporting? Or are there any other adjustments I need to consider?\n\nI think, for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the only difference is the change in the corporate tax status from C to S.\n\nSo, under S corporation rules, Carson would report their pro-rata share of the corporation's income, which is $160,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $160,000.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf the corporation is an S corporation, and it makes $400,000 in taxable income, and Carson owns 40%, then yes, Carson reports $160,000 in income.\n\nIn contrast, under C corporation rules, the corporation pays tax on the $400,000, and then Carson pays tax on the dividends received, which were $28,000.\n\nSo, the switch to an S corporation means Carson reports more income but avoids the double taxation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $160,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
