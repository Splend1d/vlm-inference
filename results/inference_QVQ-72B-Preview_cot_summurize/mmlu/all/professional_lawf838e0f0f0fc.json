                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out how many counts of murder the girlfriend can be guilty of under the agency theory of felony murder. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening. The boyfriend and girlfriend plan a robbery. The boyfriend asks the girlfriend to drive the getaway car, and she agrees, but with the condition that no loaded weapons are used during the robbery. On the day of the robbery, they drive to the grocery store. The girlfriend doesn't know that the boyfriend has a loaded gun. He goes into the store, robs it, and in the process, kills two people\u2014one by shooting and the other from a heart attack. The police are called, there's a shootout outside, and the boyfriend is killed by the police.\n\nNow, the question is about the agency theory of felony murder. From what I recall, the agency theory holds that in a felony murder case, the defendant can be held liable for murders committed by co-felons during the commission of the felony, but only if those co-felons are acting as agents of the defendant.\n\nSo, in this case, the girlfriend is involved in the planning and execution of the robbery by driving the getaway car. She didn't know about the loaded gun, but she agreed to participate in the robbery.\n\nLet's consider the two murders that occurred:\n\n1. The boyfriend shot and killed the first cashier when he refused to fill the bag with money.\n\n2. The second cashier suffered a heart attack and died due to the stress of the situation.\n\nNow, under the agency theory, the girlfriend can be held liable for murders committed by the boyfriend during the felony if he was acting as her agent.\n\nBut here's the thing: the girlfriend didn't know that the boyfriend had a loaded gun. She agreed to the robbery on the condition that no loaded weapons were used. So, did the boyfriend exceed the scope of his agency by bringing a loaded gun and using it to kill someone?\n\nI think this is a crucial point. In many jurisdictions, if a co-felon uses a weapon in a way that was not agreed upon or foreseeable, the other co-felons may not be liable for the resulting deaths.\n\nHowever, under the agency theory, it's about whether the co-felon was acting as an agent of the principal during the commission of the felony.\n\nLet me see: the boyfriend was acting on behalf of the robbery plan, which the girlfriend was part of. But the use of a loaded gun was outside the agreed terms of their plan.\n\nI need to find out how the agency theory handles situations where a co-felon exceeds the scope of the agency.\n\nAfter some research, I recall that in some jurisdictions, the agency theory limits felony murder liability to deaths caused by the defendant or their agents, not by victims or police officers.\n\nIn this case, the first death was caused by the boyfriend shooting the cashier. Under agency theory, since the boyfriend was acting as the girlfriend's agent during the robbery, she could be held liable for that death.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend didn't know about the gun, and she explicitly conditioned her participation on no loaded weapons being used. Does that mean that the boyfriend was exceeding his agency when he used the gun?\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe the court would consider whether the use of a weapon was foreseeable.\n\nIf the girlfriend should have known that the boyfriend might use a weapon, even if she didn't know about the specific gun, she might still be liable.\n\nBut the problem states that she didn't know about the loaded gun.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second death: the cashier who suffered a heart attack.\n\nThis death was a result of the stress of the robbery situation. In some jurisdictions, felony murder can extend to deaths that are a foreseeable result of the felony.\n\nBut under the agency theory, it might be limited to deaths caused by the agent themselves.\n\nSo, since the heart attack was a result of the robbery, and the boyfriend was the agent committing the robbery, perhaps the girlfriend can be held liable for this death as well.\n\nBut again, considering that the use of a gun was outside the agreed plan, maybe there's a limit to her liability.\n\nWait, but the heart attack was a direct result of the robbery, not necessarily of the gun being used. The stress of having a gun pointed at you could cause a heart attack, but the gun wasn't fired in this instance.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider the general principles of felony murder under the agency theory.\n\nAgency theory holds that the principal (the girlfriend) is liable for murders committed by the agent (the boyfriend) during the commission of the felony.\n\nSo, the first death was caused by the boyfriend shooting the cashier. Since the boyfriend was acting as the agent during the robbery, the girlfriend can be held liable for that murder, even if she didn't know about the gun.\n\nBut, there's a caveat: if the use of the gun was outside the scope of the agreed plan, and not foreseeable, perhaps her liability is limited.\n\nSimilarly, the second death was caused by the stress of the robbery, which is an inherent risk of robbery, regardless of whether a gun is used or not.\n\nSo, perhaps she can be held liable for both deaths under the agency theory.\n\nBut let's think about it more carefully.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the agency theory limits felony murder liability to deaths caused by the defendant or their agents, and not by victims or police officers.\n\nIn this case, both deaths were caused by the boyfriend: one by shooting and one by causing a heart attack through his actions.\n\nTherefore, under the agency theory, the girlfriend can be held liable for both deaths.\n\nSo, that would mean she's guilty of two counts of murder.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the boyfriend was killed by the police in a shootout. Does that have any relevance here?\n\nNo, because the question is about the girlfriend's liability for the deaths of the two cashiers, not for the boyfriend's death.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\n- First cashier: shot by the boyfriend.\n\n- Second cashier: died of a heart attack due to the stress of the robbery.\n\nUnder the agency theory, the girlfriend can be held liable for both murders because they were caused by the boyfriend, who was acting as her agent during the commission of the felony.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 2.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of only one count or none.\n\nIf the girlfriend didn't know about the gun, and conditioned her participation on no loaded weapons being used, might the court find that the shooting was outside the scope of the agency?\n\nPossibly, but in most felony murder doctrines, the use of a weapon during the commission of a felony is foreseeable, even if not explicitly agreed upon.\n\nMoreover, the heart attack death is directly attributable to the stress of the robbery, which is a foreseeable risk of committing a robbery.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the girlfriend can be held liable for both deaths.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
