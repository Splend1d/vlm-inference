Z\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 4Z and 2Z are. I know that Z is the set of all integers, and for any integer n, nZ is the set of all multiples of n. So, 4Z is the set of all multiples of 4, which is {0, \u00b14, \u00b18, \u00b112, ...}, and 2Z is the set of all multiples of 2, which is {0, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b16, ...}.\n\nNow, I need to find the cosets of 4Z in 2Z. A coset of a subgroup H in a group G is a set of the form g + H for some g in G. In this case, G is 2Z and H is 4Z.\n\nSo, I need to find all elements g in 2Z such that the set g + 4Z is distinct. Since 2Z is a subgroup of Z, and 4Z is a subgroup of 2Z, I need to consider the index of 4Z in 2Z, which is the number of distinct cosets.\n\nFirst, let's find the index [2Z : 4Z]. Since 4Z is a subgroup of 2Z, and every element of 4Z is in 2Z, the index is the number of distinct cosets.\n\nThe order of 4Z in 2Z can be thought of in terms of the quotient group 2Z / 4Z. The order of 4Z in 2Z is |2Z| / |4Z|, but since these are infinite groups, I need another way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the smallest positive elements in each coset. In 2Z, the elements are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.\n\nNow, let's consider the coset 0 + 4Z, which is just 4Z itself.\n\nNext, consider 2 + 4Z. This is {2 + 4n | n \u2208 Z}, which is {..., -6, -2, 2, 6, 10, ...}.\n\nIs there another coset? Let's try 4 + 4Z. Wait, 4 + 4Z is {4 + 4n | n \u2208 Z}, which is {..., -4, 0, 4, 8, 12, ...}. But 0 is already in 4Z, so 4 + 4Z is the same as 4Z.\n\nWait, no. 4 + 4Z is {4 + 4n | n \u2208 Z}, which is {4, 8, 12, ... for n \u2265 0, and 0, -4, -8, ... for n < 0}. But 4Z is {0, 4, 8, ...}, so 4 + 4Z is actually the same as 4Z. Therefore, it's not a distinct coset.\n\nNow, let's try 6 + 4Z. 6 + 4Z is {6 + 4n | n \u2208 Z}, which is {..., -2, 2, 6, 10, 14, ...}. Wait, 2 is already in 2 + 4Z, and 6 is in 2 + 4Z as well because 6 = 2 + 4*1. So, 6 + 4Z is the same as 2 + 4Z.\n\nSimilarly, 8 + 4Z is {8 + 4n | n \u2208 Z}, which is {8, 12, 16, ...} for n \u2265 0, and {4, 0, -4, ...} for n < 0. But 8 is in 4Z (since 8 = 4*2), so 8 + 4Z is the same as 4Z.\n\nIt seems like the only distinct cosets are 4Z and 2 + 4Z.\n\nLet me check with another element. Take 0 + 4Z, which is 4Z.\n\nTake 2 + 4Z, which is distinct.\n\nTake 4 + 4Z, which is the same as 4Z.\n\nTake 6 + 4Z, which is the same as 2 + 4Z.\n\nTake 8 + 4Z, same as 4Z.\n\nTake 10 + 4Z, which is {10 + 4n | n \u2208 Z}, which is {10, 14, 18, ...} for n \u2265 0, and {6, 2, -2, ...} for n < 0. So, 10 + 4Z is the same as 2 + 4Z.\n\nSimilarly, 12 + 4Z is {12, 16, 20, ...} for n \u2265 0, and {8, 4, 0, ...} for n < 0, which is the same as 4Z.\n\nIt seems consistent that there are only two distinct cosets: 4Z and 2 + 4Z.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of indices. The index [2Z : 4Z] is equal to the order of 2Z modulo 4Z.\n\nSince 2Z is the set of even integers, and 4Z is the set of multiples of 4, the quotient group 2Z / 4Z consists of cosets that are the even integers modulo multiples of 4.\n\nIn other words, the cosets are 0 + 4Z and 2 + 4Z, because every even integer is congruent to either 0 or 2 modulo 4.\n\nFor example:\n\n0 mod 4 is in 4Z.\n\n2 mod 4 is in 2 + 4Z.\n\n4 mod 4 is 0 mod 4, which is in 4Z.\n\n6 mod 4 is 2 mod 4, which is in 2 + 4Z.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTherefore, there are only two distinct cosets.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4Z\n\nB. 4Z, 2 + 4Z\n\nC. 2Z\n\nD. Z\n\nOption B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but option C is 2Z. Is 2Z a coset of 4Z in 2Z? Well, 2Z is the entire group here, so it's like taking the whole group as a coset, which is not typically considered as a distinct coset in the context of finding cosets of a subgroup.\n\nOption D is Z, which is even larger than 2Z, so that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption A is just 4Z, which is one coset, but we've established that there are two cosets: 4Z and 2 + 4Z.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: 4Z, 2 + 4Z.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the general theory. If G is a group and H is a subgroup, the number of distinct left cosets of H in G is equal to the index [G : H], which is |G| / |H| when G and H are finite.\n\nIn this case, G is 2Z and H is 4Z. Both are infinite, but we can think about their indices.\n\nThe index [2Z : 4Z] is the number of distinct cosets. Since every element of 2Z is either a multiple of 4 or 2 more than a multiple of 4, there are indeed two cosets.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of cyclic groups, 2Z is isomorphic to Z, and 4Z is isomorphic to 2Z, and the quotient group 2Z / 4Z is isomorphic to Z / 2Z, which has two elements.\n\nThis reinforces that there are two distinct cosets.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 4Z, 2 + 4Z.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
