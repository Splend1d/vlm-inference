                    "text": "So I've got this case here about an elderly couple shopping in a retail store. The husband slips on something sticky on the floor, manages to catch himself by holding onto a counter, and his wife, who's following behind, sees this happen. She gets disoriented by seeing her husband slip and grip the counter, and then she steps forward and falls on the wet floor, breaking her hip. She had to have complicated surgeries and then she sued the store for negligent maintenance. During the discovery process, she found out that the store didn't clean up the mess soon enough and didn't put up any warning signs.\n\nNow, the store filed a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, claiming that the wife voluntarily assumed the risk as a matter of law. The trial court agreed and ruled that there was no issue of material fact for the jury to decide. The wife is appealing this decision, and the question is whether the appellate court is likely to reverse and remand for a new trial.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because the wife proceeded to encounter a known danger voluntarily, thereby assuming the risk of injury as a matter of law, and there were no material issues of fact for a jury to decide.\n\nB. No, because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party under Rule 56, it is nonetheless clear that she knew there was a danger and she accepted the risk.\n\nC. Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward.\n\nD. Yes, because the store was strictly liable to the wife, who was a customer invited on the premises to do business, and the store had to protect her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of assumption of risk. Generally, assumption of risk is a defense where the plaintiff knew of the risk and voluntarily chose to encounter it. So, if the wife knew there was something sticky or wet on the floor and she chose to step there anyway, she might be assumed to have accepted the risk of falling.\n\nHowever, in this case, the wife claims that she was disoriented by seeing her husband slip and grip the counter, and with other shoppers behind her, she stepped forward and fell. So, maybe she didn't have time to think about the risk or fully realize the danger.\n\nOption C suggests that there might be evidence that she was in an emergency situation and didn't have time to deliberate about the risk. If that's the case, then perhaps she didn't voluntarily assume the risk.\n\nOn the other hand, options A and B seem to suggest that the risk was known to her because she saw the sticky substance and the wet floor, and she chose to proceed anyway.\n\nBut wait, the wife saw something sticky on a wide part of the floor but became disoriented by seeing her husband slip and grip the counter. So, she might have seen the sticky substance but was disoriented and didn't fully comprehend the risk.\n\nAlso, with other shoppers behind her, maybe she felt pressured to move forward without having the time to assess the situation properly.\n\nSo, perhaps there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she voluntarily assumed the risk or was in a situation where she couldn't avoid the danger due to the disorientation and the presence of other shoppers.\n\nNow, option D mentions strict liability. Strict liability is generally applied in certain situations, like product liability or abnormally dangerous activities, but not typically in slip-and-fall cases like this one. Usually, in premises liability cases, the store has a duty to maintain a safe environment for its customers, and if they fail to do so, they can be liable for negligence.\n\nSo, strict liability might not be the right approach here. Negligence seems more applicable.\n\nTherefore, option D might not be the best answer.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, it seems that the key issue is whether the wife voluntarily assumed the risk or not.\n\nOption A says no, the appellate court won't reverse because she voluntarily assumed the risk as a matter of law, with no material issues of fact.\n\nOption B also says no, because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to her, it's clear she knew the danger and accepted the risk.\n\nOption C says yes, because there's evidence that raises a material issue of fact about whether she was in an emergency and didn't have time to deliberate.\n\nGiven that the wife was disoriented by seeing her husband slip and grip the counter, and with other shoppers behind her, it's possible that she didn't have the presence of mind to avoid the danger. So, perhaps there is a factual dispute about whether she voluntarily assumed the risk.\n\nIn that case, the appellate court might find that there is a genuine issue of material fact that should be decided by a jury, and thus reverse and remand for a new trial.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut let me think again. The store is arguing that she assumed the risk as a matter of law, and the trial court agreed. The appellate court would review this decision to see if there is indeed no genuine issue of material fact.\n\nIf there is evidence that she was disoriented and didn't have time to deliberate, that could be a material fact in dispute, making summary judgment inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the appellate court would reverse and remand for a new trial, because there is a factual issue about her state of mind and whether she voluntarily assumed the risk.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
