                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on magnetic fields and particle motion, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nSo, we have a proton entering a region with a constant magnetic field. The initial speed is 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, and the magnetic field strength is 1.5 T (Tesla). The angle between the proton's velocity and the magnetic field is 30 degrees. We need to find the proton's speed 4 seconds after it enters the magnetic field.\n\nFirst, I should recall how a charged particle moves in a magnetic field. I know that a magnetic field exerts a force on a moving charged particle, and this force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field. This is given by the Lorentz force law:\n\nF = qvB sin\u03b8\n\nWhere:\n\n- q is the charge of the particle\n\n- v is the velocity of the particle\n\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n\n- \u03b8 is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field\n\nFor a proton, the charge q is equal to the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C (Coulombs).\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nF = (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C)(1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s)(1.5 T) sin(30\u00b0)\n\nI need to find sin(30\u00b0), which is 0.5.\n\nSo, F = (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19)(1.5 \u00d7 10^6)(1.5)(0.5)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply the numerical values: 1.602 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 0.5 = let's see:\n\n1.602 \u00d7 1.5 = 2.403\n\n2.403 \u00d7 1.5 = 3.6045\n\n3.6045 \u00d7 0.5 = 1.80225\n\nSo, F = 1.80225 \u00d7 10^-19 \u00d7 10^6 = 1.80225 \u00d7 10^-13 N (Newtons)\n\nNow, this force causes the proton to accelerate perpendicular to its velocity, which typically makes the proton move in a circular path. But since the velocity is not perpendicular to the field, it's a general case where the motion is a helix.\n\nWait, actually, the force is always perpendicular to both v and B, so if the velocity has a component parallel to B, that component won't be affected by the magnetic field. Only the perpendicular component causes the particle to move in a circle.\n\nSo, the general motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field is a combination of straight-line motion along the field lines and circular motion perpendicular to the field lines.\n\nLet's break down the initial velocity into components:\n\n1. Parallel to the magnetic field: v_parallel = v * cos\u03b8\n\n2. Perpendicular to the magnetic field: v_perpendicular = v * sin\u03b8\n\nGiven \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, cos(30\u00b0) = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866 and sin(30\u00b0) = 0.5.\n\nSo:\n\nv_parallel = (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s) * 0.866 \u2248 1.299 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nv_perpendicular = (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s) * 0.5 = 0.75 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nNow, the parallel component is not affected by the magnetic field, so it remains constant.\n\nThe perpendicular component causes the proton to move in a circle with a frequency called the cyclotron frequency, given by:\n\nf = (qB)/(2\u03c0m)\n\nWhere:\n\n- q is the charge\n\n- B is the magnetic field\n\n- m is the mass of the proton\n\nThe mass of a proton is approximately 1.67 \u00d7 10^-27 kg.\n\nSo, f = (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C)(1.5 T)/(2\u03c0)(1.67 \u00d7 10^-27 kg)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 \u00d7 1.5 = 2.403 \u00d7 10^-19 C\u00b7T\n\nDenominator: 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1.67 \u00d7 10^-27 kg \u2248 2 \u00d7 3.1416 \u00d7 1.67 \u00d7 10^-27 \u2248 1.047 \u00d7 10^-26 kg\n\nSo, f = (2.403 \u00d7 10^-19)/(1.047 \u00d7 10^-26) \u2248 2.29 \u00d7 10^7 Hz\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward, but I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the angular frequency \u03c9 is used, which is \u03c9 = qB/m, and f = \u03c9/(2\u03c0).\n\nBut in this problem, we might not need the frequency explicitly.\n\nWhat we need is the speed of the proton after 4 seconds.\n\nSince the parallel component is constant, and the perpendicular component is changing due to the magnetic field, perhaps we can find the new velocity components after 4 seconds.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the speed, which is the magnitude of the velocity vector.\n\nI need to find |v(t=4s)|.\n\nLet me think about the motion.\n\nThe perpendicular component causes circular motion with radius r = (mv_perp)/(qB)\n\nBut since we have both parallel and perpendicular components, the proton moves in a helix.\n\nIn a helix, the speed along the field lines is constant (v_parallel), and the perpendicular component is changing, describing a circle with angular frequency \u03c9 = qB/m.\n\nSo, the perpendicular velocity components oscillate with time, but their magnitude remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the speed of the proton is the vector sum of the constant parallel velocity and the time-varying perpendicular velocity.\n\nBut since the perpendicular velocity has constant magnitude (just rotating), the overall speed should remain constant.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me double-check.\n\nIn a helical path, the speed should be constant because the magnetic field only changes the direction of the velocity, not its magnitude.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the speed of the proton remains constant, equal to its initial speed.\n\nTherefore, after 4 seconds, the speed is still 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nBut let's confirm this reasoning.\n\nThe magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity, so it doesn't do any work on the particle, meaning the kinetic energy remains constant. Since kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2, if that's constant, then the speed v must remain constant.\n\nTherefore, the speed of the proton 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field is still 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5.0 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nB. 7.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nC. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nD. 3.0 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nThe correct answer should be C. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a catch. Let's consider if there's any acceleration that could change the speed.\n\nIf the particle were moving purely perpendicular to the field, it would move in a circle with constant speed. But here, it has both parallel and perpendicular components.\n\nThe parallel component is constant, and the perpendicular component rotates in a circle, maintaining its speed.\n\nTherefore, the total speed should indeed remain constant.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
