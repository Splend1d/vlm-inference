                    "text": "Okay, so I have this economics problem here. It says that a business wants to increase its revenue, and it knows that the demand price elasticity of its product is 0.78. I need to choose what the business should do with its price based on the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what price elasticity of demand means. Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. The formula is usually percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price.\n\nThe value given is 0.78, which is less than 1. I remember that if the elasticity is less than 1, demand is inelastic. That means that when the price changes, the quantity demanded doesn't change by as much percentage-wise.\n\nNow, the question is about increasing revenue. Revenue is price multiplied by quantity demanded (R = P * Q).\n\nI need to think about how changing the price will affect total revenue given the elasticity.\n\nThere's a rule of thumb:\n\n- If demand is elastic (elasticity > 1), increasing price will decrease revenue because the percentage decrease in quantity demanded will be larger than the percentage increase in price.\n\n- If demand is unit elastic (elasticity = 1), revenue doesn't change with a price change.\n\n- If demand is inelastic (elasticity < 1), increasing price will increase revenue because the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage increase in price.\n\nGiven that the elasticity is 0.78, which is less than 1, demand is inelastic. So, according to this, if the business increases the price, revenue should increase because the quantity demanded decreases by a smaller percentage.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Decrease price because demand is elastic\n\nB. Decrease price because demand is unit elastic\n\nC. Decrease price because demand is inelastic\n\nD. Increase price because demand is inelastic\n\nOption A suggests decreasing price because demand is elastic, but in this case, elasticity is 0.78, which is inelastic, not elastic.\n\nOption B suggests decreasing price because demand is unit elastic, but elasticity is 0.78, which is not unit elastic.\n\nOption C suggests decreasing price because demand is inelastic. But according to the rule, if demand is inelastic, increasing price should increase revenue, not decrease it.\n\nOption D suggests increasing price because demand is inelastic, which aligns with what I just thought.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Let's think about it again.\n\nIf demand is inelastic (elasticity < 1), then a increase in price will lead to a smaller percentage decrease in quantity demanded, so total revenue R = P * Q should increase.\n\nConversely, if price is decreased, quantity demanded increases by a smaller percentage, so total revenue might decrease.\n\nTherefore, to increase revenue, the business should increase price when demand is inelastic.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nMaybe I should consider the relationship between elasticity and revenue more carefully.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the formula for elasticity:\n\nElasticity (\u03b7) = (% change in Qd) / (% change in P)\n\nIf \u03b7 < 1, demand is inelastic.\n\nTo increase revenue, we need dR/dP > 0.\n\nR = P * Q\n\ndR/dP = Q + P * (dQ/dP)\n\nBut dQ/dP = (\u03b7 * Q)/P\n\nSo, dR/dP = Q + P * (\u03b7 * Q)/P = Q + \u03b7 * Q = Q (1 + \u03b7)\n\nFor dR/dP > 0, Q (1 + \u03b7) > 0\n\nSince Q is positive, 1 + \u03b7 > 0 \u21d2 \u03b7 > -1\n\nSince \u03b7 = 0.78 > -1, increasing price should increase revenue.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider a small increase in price, what happens to quantity demanded.\n\nWith \u03b7 = 0.78, if price increases by 1%, quantity demanded decreases by 0.78%.\n\nSo, revenue changes by (1% increase in P) * Q - (0.78% decrease in Q) * P\n\nWhich is (1% * Q) + (0.78% * P * (-1)) = 1% Q - 0.78% P Q = Q (1% - 0.78%) = 0.22% increase in R\n\nSo, yes, increasing price increases revenue when demand is inelastic.\n\nI think the answer is D: increase price because demand is inelastic.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where this might not hold.\n\nFor example, if the product is a necessity with no close substitutes, demand might be very inelastic, and increasing price could increase revenue up to a point, but eventually, at very high prices, quantity demanded might drop significantly.\n\nHowever, in the context of this problem, since we're given a specific elasticity value of 0.78, which is still positive and less than 1, increasing price should increase revenue.\n\nAnother consideration could be the law of demand, which states that as price increases, quantity demanded decreases, but in this case, since elasticity is less than 1, the percentage decrease in quantity is less than the percentage increase in price, leading to higher revenue.\n\nI don't think there's more to it. The straightforward answer should be D.\n\nWait, but option C says decrease price because demand is inelastic. That contradicts what I've concluded.\n\nIf demand is inelastic, decreasing price would lead to a smaller percentage increase in quantity demanded, but since price is decreased, the revenue might still decrease.\n\nFor example, if price decreases by 1%, quantity demanded increases by 0.78%, so revenue changes by (1% decrease in P) * Q + (0.78% increase in Q) * P = -1% Q + 0.78% P Q = Q (-1% + 0.78%) = -0.22% decrease in R\n\nSo, decreasing price decreases revenue when demand is inelastic, which makes sense because the percentage increase in quantity demanded is less than the percentage decrease in price.\n\nTherefore, to increase revenue, the business should increase price, not decrease it.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D is the correct choice.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the options.\n\nA. Decrease price because demand is elastic \u2013 But demand is inelastic.\n\nB. Decrease price because demand is unit elastic \u2013 Demand is inelastic.\n\nC. Decrease price because demand is inelastic \u2013 This would decrease revenue.\n\nD. Increase price because demand is inelastic \u2013 This aligns with what I've determined.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
