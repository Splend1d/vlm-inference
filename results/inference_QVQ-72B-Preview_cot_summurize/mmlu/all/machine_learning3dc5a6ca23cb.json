                    "text": "So I have these two statements about support vector machines (SVMs), and I need to figure out which ones are true or false. I'm not super confident with SVMs yet, but I'll try to work through this.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"Support vector machines, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example.\"\n\nHmm, I know that SVMs are primarily used for classification, and they find a hyperplane that separates different classes. But do they directly provide probability distributions like logistic regression does?\n\nI recall that logistic regression outputs probabilities for each class, and these can be interpreted as the likelihood of an input belonging to each class. But for SVMs, I think it's different.\n\nSVMs focus on maximizing the margin between different classes, and they identify support vectors that lie closest to the decision boundary. The decision function in SVMs is based on the sign of the weighted sum of the kernel evaluations, which gives a confidence score, but not necessarily a probability.\n\nI think SVMs can be modified to estimate probabilities, but by default, they don't provide probability distributions. So, maybe this statement is false.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\"\n\nSupport vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and are crucial for defining the boundary. In SVMs, the choice of kernel can affect which data points are considered support vectors.\n\nWith a linear kernel, the SVM tries to find a straight line (or hyperplane) that separates the classes. But with higher order polynomial kernels, the SVM can model more complex decision boundaries.\n\nI suspect that changing the kernel from linear to a higher order polynomial could change which points are considered support vectors because the decision boundary becomes more complex. So, the support vectors might not remain the same.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure about this. Maybe in some cases, the support vectors stay the same, but in general, they might change.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it this way: the support vectors are determined by the optimization process, which depends on the kernel function. So, if I change the kernel, the optimization might select different points as support vectors.\n\nTherefore, in general, we wouldn't expect the support vectors to remain the same when moving from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nSo, for Statement 1, I think it's false because SVMs don't directly provide probability distributions like logistic regression does. For Statement 2, I think it's true that we would expect the support vectors to change when moving to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nBut looking back, the statement says \"we would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general,\" and I think that's false because they generally do change.\n\nWait, no. The statement is phrased as \"we would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general,\" and I think that's false because, in reality, they don't remain the same; they change depending on the kernel.\n\nSo, to rephrase, I believe that support vectors do change when moving from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels, so the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is false. So, the answer should be B. False, False.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nFor Statement 1, I found that SVMs don't naturally provide probability estimates, whereas logistic regression does. But I recall that there are ways to estimate probabilities from SVM outputs, like using Platt scaling or isotonic regression. However, by default, SVMs don't output probabilities, so the statement is still false.\n\nFor Statement 2, I think my initial reasoning holds. Changing the kernel changes the decision boundary, which in turn can change which points are support vectors.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
