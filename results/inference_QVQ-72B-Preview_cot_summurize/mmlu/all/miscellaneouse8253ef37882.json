                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Where is the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house known as Falling Water?\" and the options are Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and New York. I need to pick the correct one. I think I know the answer, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing it up with another building or location.\n\nFirst off, I know that Frank Lloyd Wright was a famous architect who designed many iconic buildings, including Falling Water. This house is supposed to be really famous because it's built over a waterfall, right? So, it's also known as Kaufmann House, I think, because it was commissioned by Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr.\n\nNow, I need to recall where this house is located. I remember that it's in Pennsylvania. Let me see if I can confirm that. Pennsylvania is known for having a lot of historical sites, and since Frank Lloyd Wright was an American architect, it makes sense that some of his works would be in various parts of the United States.\n\nWait, but New York is also a big state with lots of architectural wonders. Is there a possibility that Falling Water is located in New York? No, I don't think so. I pretty sure it's in Pennsylvania.\n\nIllinois is another option. Frank Lloyd Wright designed many houses in Illinois, especially around Chicago. In fact, his home and studio are in Oak Park, Illinois. But again, I don't think Falling Water is there.\n\nConnecticut is also an option. Connecticut is known for its historic homes and landscapes, but I don't recall any Frank Lloyd Wright buildings there. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.\n\nLet me try to visualize the house. It's perched on the edge of a cliff with waterfalls beneath it. That sounds like a unique location. I think it's in a rural area, maybe in the mountains. Pennsylvania has the Appalachian Mountains, which could be a possible location for such a house.\n\nI should also consider the history of the house. It was built in the 1930s, I believe. Frank Lloyd Wright was commissioned by the Kaufmann family, who were prominent in the retail industry. They likely wanted a weekend retreat in a scenic location.\n\nAnother thing that comes to mind is that the house is near Bear Run, which is a stream that has a waterfall. So, the name Falling Water refers to the location and the design that incorporates the waterfall.\n\nTo make sure I'm not mistaken, I can think about the actual address or the specific town where Falling Water is located. I think it's in Mill Run, Pennsylvania. Mill Run is a small town in Fayette County, which is in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that many of Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings are spread out across the United States, but Falling Water is particularly famous and I believe it's uniquely located in Pennsylvania.\n\nI don't think it's in Connecticut, Illinois, or New York. Connecticut doesn't have the same kind of rugged landscape that would feature a prominent waterfall. Illinois is more known for prairie-style architecture, which is another style that Frank Lloyd Wright pioneered.\n\nNew York has its share of architectural masterpieces, but I can't recall any specific Frank Lloyd Wright buildings there, at least not residential ones like Falling Water.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, the correct answer should be Pennsylvania.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
