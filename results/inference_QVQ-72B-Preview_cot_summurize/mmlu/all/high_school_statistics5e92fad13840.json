                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a farmer who's thinking about switching to a different type of hen for egg production. He wants his eggs to have an average mass of 56 grams. To test if this new type of hen produces eggs that meet his standards, he took a random sample of 18 eggs from these hens and measured their masses. The sample mean is 54.1 grams, and he performed a t-test, getting a t-statistic of -1.973. Now, he's using a 5% significance level to decide what to do next.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the hypothesis being tested here. The null hypothesis (H0) is probably that the true mean mass of eggs from these new hens is 56 grams. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean mass is different from 56 grams. So, it's a two-tailed test because he's interested in any difference, not just if the eggs are heavier or lighter.\n\nHe has a sample size of 18 eggs, which is smallish, but since the distribution is symmetric and mound-shaped, that's good for using a t-test. The t-statistic is -1.973, which is negative, indicating that the sample mean is less than the hypothesized population mean of 56 grams.\n\nNow, to make a decision at the 5% significance level, we need to compare this t-statistic to the critical t-values for 17 degrees of freedom (since degrees of freedom, df, is sample size minus one, which is 18 - 1 = 17). Wait, but in the options, some mention 18 degrees of freedom. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nActually, for a t-test, the degrees of freedom are indeed n - 1, where n is the sample size. So, with a sample size of 18, df = 17. Maybe there's a typo in option C, which mentions 18 degrees of freedom. Or perhaps the farmer used 18 degrees of freedom for some reason, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnyway, let's proceed with df = 17. For a two-tailed test at 5% significance level and df = 17, I need to find the critical t-values. I recall that the critical t-values for a two-tailed test at 5% significance with df = 17 are approximately \u00b12.110. So, if the calculated t-statistic is less extreme than these critical values, we fail to reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we reject it.\n\nGiven that our t-statistic is -1.973, which is between -2.110 and 2.110, it means it's less extreme than the critical values. Therefore, at the 5% significance level, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So, the farmer doesn't have convincing evidence that the mean mass of eggs from these new hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Because t is more extreme than \u00b11.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nWait, this mentions \u00b11.96, which is the critical value for a z-test, not a t-test with df = 17. So, this is incorrect.\n\nB. Because t is less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nThis seems correct based on my earlier calculation. The t-statistic of -1.973 is less extreme than the critical value of approximately -2.110 for df = 17.\n\nC. Because t is less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nHere, it says 18 degrees of freedom, which is incorrect since df should be 17 for a sample size of 18. So, this option is wrong.\n\nD. Because t is more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nAgain, this mentions 18 degrees of freedom, which is incorrect. Also, the t-statistic is -1.973, and if we use df = 18, the critical value for a two-tailed test at 5% significance is approximately \u00b12.101. So, -1.973 is still less extreme than -2.101, meaning we shouldn't reject the null hypothesis.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check the exact critical values for df = 17 and df = 18.\n\nFor df = 17, the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at 5% significance is approximately \u00b12.110.\n\nFor df = 18, it's approximately \u00b12.101.\n\nSo, in both cases, the t-statistic of -1.973 is less extreme than the critical values. Therefore, we should not reject the null hypothesis.\n\nBut option B correctly identifies that with df = 17, the t-statistic is less extreme than the critical value, leading to the conclusion to not reject the null hypothesis.\n\nOption D incorrectly states that the t-statistic is more extreme than the critical value for df = 18, suggesting to reject the null hypothesis, which is not the case based on our calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nBut wait, option C also says that t is less extreme than the critical value for df = 18, and concludes not to reject the null hypothesis. However, since df should be 17, not 18, option C is incorrect because it uses the wrong degrees of freedom.\n\nSo, even though option C arrives at the correct conclusion (not rejecting the null hypothesis), it uses the wrong degrees of freedom, which makes it incorrect.\n\nHence, the best answer is B, which correctly identifies df = 17 and concludes that since the t-statistic is less extreme than the critical value, we should not reject the null hypothesis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
