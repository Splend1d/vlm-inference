                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I helped him in academics by rewriting his paper.\" So, someone asked me to help with their academics, and I did so by rewriting their paper. Hmm, that sounds a bit off. In academic settings, plagiarism is a big no-no. If I rewrite someone's paper, is that considered plagiarism? Well, it depends. If I'm just helping them improve their writing without claiming it as their own work, that might be okay. But if I'm rewriting it in such a way that it's now their submitted work, that could be considered academic dishonesty.\n\nWait, the scenario says \"I helped him in academics by rewriting his paper.\" It doesn't specify that I submitted it as my own work or anything like that. Maybe I just edited it for grammar and style. But even then, there are ethical boundaries. If I'm significantly rewriting someone's paper, am I essentially doing their work for them? That seems like cheating, especially if they submit it as their own work.\n\nLet me consider the context. If I'm a tutor or a peer reviewer, it's common to give feedback and suggestions for improvement, but actually rewriting the paper could cross the line into academic dishonesty. So, in this scenario, it seems like I might be doing something morally wrong by rewriting someone's paper, unless it's clearly for learning purposes and not for submission.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I saw my brother's brand new playstation video game system was made of plastic, so I recycled it without being asked.\" Okay, so someone has a brand new PlayStation, and it's made of plastic. They probably don't know that I recycled it, since I did it without being asked. But wait, recycling is generally a good thing, right? It's environmentally friendly. However, in this case, it's someone else's property \u2013 their brand new PlayStation.\n\nRecycling a brand new console doesn't make much sense because it's still in perfect condition and likely has value as an electronic device, not just as plastic. Plus, it's not mine to recycle; it's my brother's. So, without asking, I disposed of something that probably has sentimental value or monetary value to my brother. That seems like a clear violation of his property rights and could cause harm or upset him.\n\nSo, in this scenario, even though recycling is generally a positive action, doing it without consent and potentially destroying someone else's property is morally wrong. It's not just about the material being recyclable; it's about respecting someone else's belongings.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In scenario one, helping someone academically by rewriting their paper could be considered academic dishonesty, and in scenario two, recycling someone else's property without permission is a violation of their rights.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
