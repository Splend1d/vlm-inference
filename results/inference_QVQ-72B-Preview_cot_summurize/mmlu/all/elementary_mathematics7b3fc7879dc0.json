Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I need to solve for x in the equation 5x - 5 = -10. I can start by adding 5 to both sides to isolate the term with x. So, adding 5 to both sides:\n\n5x - 5 + 5 = -10 + 5\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n5x = -5\n\nNow, to find x, I need to divide both sides by 5:\n\n5x / 5 = -5 / 5\n\nSo, x = -1\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. But let's double-check if there's another way to approach this or if I've missed anything.\n\nAlternatively, I could plug in each option to see which one satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's try option A: x = -1\n\nPlug it into the equation:\n\n5*(-1) - 5 = -5 - 5 = -10\n\nYes, that matches the right side of the equation.\n\nNow, option B: x = -6\n\nPlug in:\n\n5*(-6) - 5 = -30 - 5 = -35 \u2260 -10\n\nSo, not this one.\n\nOption C: x = -4\n\nPlug in:\n\n5*(-4) - 5 = -20 - 5 = -25 \u2260 -10\n\nNot this one either.\n\nOption D: x = -3\n\nPlug in:\n\n5*(-3) - 5 = -15 - 5 = -20 \u2260 -10\n\nSo, none of these except for option A satisfy the equation.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there are any other possible solutions. Maybe I made a mistake in my initial steps.\n\nLet me solve the equation again to be sure.\n\nStarting with 5x - 5 = -10\n\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n\n5x = -5\n\nDivide by 5:\n\nx = -1\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if the equation has any other properties or if there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the equation again: 5x - 5 = -10\n\nI can also think about the left side as 5 times x minus 5 equals -10.\n\nSo, 5x - 5 = -10\n\nIf I rearrange it, 5x = -10 + 5\n\nWait, that's the same as before: 5x = -5, so x = -1.\n\nI think I'm confirming the same solution repeatedly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is x = -1.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other solutions based on the properties of equations.\n\nIn algebra, a linear equation like this should have exactly one solution, which I've found to be x = -1.\n\nMoreover, plugging in x = -1 satisfies the equation, as I showed earlier.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the solution is x = -1, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-1} \\]"
