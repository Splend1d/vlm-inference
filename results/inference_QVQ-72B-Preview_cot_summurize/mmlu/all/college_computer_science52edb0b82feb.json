                    "text": "So I have this problem here about adding 109 and -42 using different 8-bit number representations: one's complement, two's complement, and sign and magnitude. I need to figure out in which of these systems the addition of these numbers doesn't cause an overflow, meaning it stays within the range that 8 bits can represent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the range of each representation with 8 bits.\n\nFor sign and magnitude:\n\n- The highest positive number is 01111111 (127)\n\n- The lowest negative number is 11111111 (-127)\n\n- Zero is represented as 00000000 and 10000000\n\nFor one's complement:\n\n- Highest positive is 01111111 (127)\n\n- Lowest negative is 10000000 (-127)\n\n- Zero is 00000000 and 11111111\n\nFor two's complement:\n\n- Highest positive is 01111111 (127)\n\n- Lowest negative is 10000000 (-128)\n\n- Zero is 00000000\n\nNow, I need to represent 109 and -42 in each of these systems and then add them, checking if the result stays within the representable range.\n\nFirst, let's represent 109 and -42 in each system.\n\nStarting with sign and magnitude:\n\n- Positive 109 is 0 followed by the binary of 109.\n\n- 109 in binary is 1101101\n\n- So, 109 is 01101101\n\n- Negative 42 is 1 followed by the binary of 42.\n\n- 42 in binary is 101010\n\n- So, -42 is 1101010\n\nNow, add them:\n\n01101101 (109)\n\n1101010 (need to pad with a leading 1 to make it 8 bits: 1101010 \u2192 11101010)\n\nAdd them:\n\n01101101\n\n+11101010\n\n------\n\n01010111\n\n------\n\nThe sum is 01010111, which is positive. Let's check if this is correct.\n\n109 + (-42) should be 67.\n\n01010111 in binary is 67 in decimal. So, it's correct.\n\nNo overflow here.\n\nNext, one's complement:\n\nRepresent 109:\n\nPositive 109: 01101101 (same as sign and magnitude)\n\nNegative 42: Invert all bits of 42's binary.\n\n42 is 101010\n\nInvert: 010101\n\nAdd the leading 1 to make it 8 bits: 1010101\n\nSo, -42 is 1010101\n\nNow, add 109 and -42:\n\n01101101 (109)\n\n+1010101 (-42)\n\n------\n\n00010110\n\n------\n\nThe sum is 00010110, which is 22 in decimal.\n\nBut 109 - 42 should be 67.\n\nWait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that in one's complement, negative numbers are represented differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in representing -42.\n\nIn one's complement, to represent -42:\n\n1. Find the positive 42: 00101010\n\n2. Invert all bits: 11010101\n\nSo, -42 is 11010101\n\nNow, add 109 and -42:\n\n01101101 (109)\n\n+11010101 (-42)\n\n------\n\n01000100\n\n------\n\nThis is 68 in decimal, which is incorrect since 109 - 42 = 67.\n\nWait, that's not 67.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if there's an end-around carry.\n\nIn one's complement, if there's a carry out, you need to add it back to the least significant bit.\n\nLet's see:\n\n01101101\n\n+11010101\n\n= 01000100, with a carry out of 1.\n\nSo, add this carry to the least significant bit:\n\n01000100\n\n+1\n\n= 01000101\n\nWhich is 69, still not 67.\n\nHmm, maybe one's complement isn't working here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in one's complement, the representation of -42 is indeed 11010101, and the addition seems to be giving 69, which is not correct.\n\nMaybe one's complement isn't suitable for this addition without overflow.\n\nLet me try two's complement next.\n\nIn two's complement:\n\nPositive 109: 01101101\n\nNegative 42: Invert bits and add 1.\n\nPositive 42: 00101010\n\nInvert: 11010101\n\nAdd 1: 11010110\n\nSo, -42 is 11010110\n\nNow, add 109 and -42:\n\n01101101 (109)\n\n+11010110 (-42)\n\n= 01000101\n\nWhich is 69 in decimal.\n\nBut 109 - 42 should be 67.\n\nSo, there's an overflow here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check for overflow in two's complement.\n\nIn two's complement, overflow occurs if there's a carry into the sign bit but not out of it, or vice versa.\n\nWait, more precisely, overflow occurs if there's a carry into the sign bit and a carry out of it, or no carry into it and a carry out of it.\n\nWait, actually, in two's complement, overflow occurs when:\n\n- The operands have the same sign and the result has a different sign.\n\nIn this case, 109 is positive, -42 is negative, so they have different signs. Therefore, there shouldn't be overflow.\n\nBut according to the addition, I got 69 instead of 67.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition.\n\nLet me add them again:\n\n01101101\n\n+11010110\n\n= 01000101\n\nWait, that's 69 in decimal, but 109 - 42 is 67.\n\nSo, there's an inconsistency here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in two's complement, the highest bit is the sign bit, and the rest are magnitude bits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the result should be 67.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in representing -42.\n\nLet me double-check the two's complement of 42.\n\nPositive 42: 00101010\n\nInvert: 11010101\n\nAdd 1: 11010110\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, add to 109:\n\n01101101\n\n+11010110\n\n= 01000101\n\nWhich is 69.\n\nBut it should be 67.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in two's complement, adding a negative number is equivalent to subtracting its positive counterpart.\n\nSo, 109 + (-42) should indeed be 67.\n\nBut according to the addition, it's coming out as 69.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check the binary addition step by step.\n\n01101101\n\n+11010110\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0, carry 1\n\n0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0, carry 1\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\n0 + 1 = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0, carry 1\n\n0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0, carry 1\n\nSo, the final carry is 1, which is discarded in two's complement addition.\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n01000101, which is 69 in decimal.\n\nBut it should be 67.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an error in the representation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that in two's complement, when adding numbers with different signs, the result should be correct if there's no overflow.\n\nBut in this case, there seems to be an inconsistency.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in two's complement, the range for 8 bits is from -128 to 127.\n\n109 and -42 are both within this range.\n\nAdding 109 and -42 should give 67, which is also within the range.\n\nBut according to the addition, I'm getting 69, which suggests an error.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition.\n\nLet me try adding them again:\n\n01101101 (109)\n\n+11010110 (-42)\n\n= 01000101 (69)\n\nBut 109 - 42 = 67, not 69.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in two's complement, the most significant bit is negative, and the rest are positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in two's complement, the negative number is correctly represented, but the addition is causing an overflow.\n\nWait, in two's complement, overflow occurs when the sum of two numbers with the same sign results in a number with the opposite sign.\n\nIn this case, the numbers have different signs, so overflow shouldn't occur.\n\nBut according to the addition, it seems like there's an overflow.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if there's a carry into the sign bit and a carry out of it.\n\nIn two's complement, overflow occurs if there's a carry into the sign bit and not out of it, or vice versa.\n\nIn this addition:\n\n01101101 (sign bit is 0)\n\n+11010110 (sign bit is 1)\n\n= 01000101 (sign bit is 0)\n\nThere is no carry into the sign bit (since the sign bits are different), and there is no carry out of it.\n\nSo, according to the overflow detection, there is no overflow.\n\nBut the result is 69, which should be 67.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in two's complement, the result is indeed 69, but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the representation of -42.\n\nLet me double-check the two's complement of 42.\n\nPositive 42: 00101010\n\nInvert: 11010101\n\nAdd 1: 11010110\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, add to 109:\n\n01101101\n\n+11010110\n\n= 01000101\n\nWhich is 69.\n\nBut it should be 67.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in two's complement, when adding a negative number, it's equivalent to subtracting the positive counterpart, and the result should be correct.\n\nBut according to the addition, it's coming out as 69 instead of 67.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in two's complement, the result is correct, and 69 is indeed the correct binary representation.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n69 in binary should be:\n\n64 + 4 + 1 = 69\n\nSo, 1000101\n\nBut according to the addition, 01000101 is 69.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the binary.\n\nLet me write 01000101:\n\nBit 7: 0\n\nBit 6: 1\n\nBit 5: 0\n\nBit 4: 0\n\nBit 3: 0\n\nBit 2: 1\n\nBit 1: 0\n\nBit 0: 1\n\nSo, 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 69.\n\nBut 67 should be 1000011, which is 64 + 2 + 1 = 67.\n\nSo, according to the addition, I'm getting 69 instead of 67.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the addition.\n\nLet me add them again carefully:\n\n01101101 (109)\n\n+11010110 (-42)\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0, carry 1\n\n0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0, carry 1\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\n0 + 1 = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0, carry 1\n\n0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0, carry 1\n\nDiscard the final carry.\n\nSo, the result is 01000101, which is indeed 69.\n\nBut it should be 67.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in two's complement, when adding a negative number, the result should be correct, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in two's complement, the negative number is correctly represented, but the addition is causing an overflow.\n\nBut according to the overflow detection, there shouldn't be an overflow since the numbers have different signs.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try sign and magnitude again to confirm.\n\nIn sign and magnitude:\n\n109 is 01101101\n\n-42 is 1101010 (padded to 11101010)\n\nAdd them:\n\n01101101\n\n+11101010\n\n= 01010111\n\nWhich is 67 in decimal.\n\nSo, in sign and magnitude, it works correctly.\n\nIn one's complement:\n\n109 is 01101101\n\n-42 is 11010101\n\nAdd them:\n\n01101101\n\n+11010101\n\n= 01000100, with a carry out of 1.\n\nAdd the carry back: 01000100 + 1 = 01000101, which is 69.\n\nBut it should be 67.\n\nSo, in one's complement, there's an overflow.\n\nIn two's complement, as we saw earlier, it's also coming out as 69.\n\nSo, only sign and magnitude gives the correct result of 67 without overflow.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that only sign and magnitude can represent this addition without overflow.\n\nBut according to the options, that's not listed.\n\nOption D says I, II, and III.\n\nOption C says I and II.\n\nOption B says II only.\n\nOption A says I only.\n\nBut according to my calculations, only sign and magnitude works.\n\nWait, but in two's complement, the addition seems to give 69 instead of 67, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the numbers in two's complement.\n\nLet me try adding them again:\n\n01101101 (109)\n\n+11010110 (-42)\n\n= 01000101\n\nWait, but 01000101 is 65, not 69.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 69, but let's calculate it again.\n\n01000101:\n\nBit 7: 0 (64)\n\nBit 6: 1 (32)\n\nBit 5: 0 (0)\n\nBit 4: 0 (0)\n\nBit 3: 0 (0)\n\nBit 2: 1 (4)\n\nBit 1: 0 (0)\n\nBit 0: 1 (1)\n\nSo, 64 + 32 + 4 + 1 = 101, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the binary.\n\nLet me write 01000101 correctly:\n\nBit 7: 0\n\nBit 6: 1\n\nBit 5: 0\n\nBit 4: 0\n\nBit 3: 0\n\nBit 2: 1\n\nBit 1: 0\n\nBit 0: 1\n\nSo, 64 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 101.\n\nBut 101 is not 67.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 69, but actually, it's 101.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the numbers.\n\nLet me add them again carefully:\n\n01101101 (109)\n\n+11010110 (-42)\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0, carry 1\n\n0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0, carry 1\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\n0 + 1 = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0,
