                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about price ceilings on leather garments. So, if the government sets a price ceiling below the equilibrium price, what will happen? The options are a shortage, a surplus, the demand curve shifting leftward, or the supply curve shifting rightward.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a price ceiling is. I think it's when the government sets a maximum price that can be charged for a good or service. So, if the ceiling is below the equilibrium price, that means the price can't go up to where supply and demand naturally balance out.\n\nIn class, we learned that when you have a price ceiling below equilibrium, it leads to a shortage. Let me recall why that is. At a price below equilibrium, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied because consumers want to buy more at the lower price, but producers are willing to supply less at that price. So, there's not enough product to meet the demand, which results in a shortage.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance of a surplus. A surplus happens when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, usually when the price is above equilibrium. But in this case, the price is below equilibrium, so I don't think a surplus would occur.\n\nWhat about the demand curve shifting leftward? A leftward shift in the demand curve would indicate a decrease in demand. There's no reason to think that demand would decrease just because there's a price ceiling. In fact, if anything, keeping the price low might increase demand, but that's more likely to lead to a shortage, not a decrease in demand.\n\nAnd for the supply curve, a rightward shift would indicate an increase in supply. But again, with the price being kept low, producers might not be motivated to supply more, so I don't see why the supply curve would shift rightward.\n\nLet me double-check this with an example. Suppose the equilibrium price for leather garments is $100, and the government sets a price ceiling of $80. At $80, consumers might want to buy more, say 10,000 garments, but producers are only willing to supply 5,000 garments at that price. So, there's a shortage of 5,000 garments.\n\nAlternatively, if the price ceiling was above the equilibrium price, say $120, then the quantity supplied would exceed the quantity demanded, leading to a surplus. But that's not the case here.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The correct choice is A. There will be a shortage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
