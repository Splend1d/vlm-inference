                    "text": "Alright, I've got this legal scenario to analyze. Let's break it down step by step. So, there's a farmer who owns a 40-acre tract of farmland. He leased this property to a tenant for seven years, from February 15, 2000, to February 15, 2007. The lease required the tenant to pay $5,000 per month on the 15th of each month and to maintain the building on the premises in good repair until the lease ended.\n\nAdditionally, there was an option in the lease that allowed the tenant to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was signed, the farmer orally promised to have the 10-acre tract surveyed. Now, during the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to buy those 10 acres. But here's the catch: without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant started building an irrigation ditch across the northern part of the property. When the tenant told the farmer about exercising the option, the farmer refused to go through with it and also mentioned that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed.\n\nNow, the question is, if the tenant sues for specific performance to enforce the option to purchase the 10 acres, what's the farmer's best defense among the options provided?\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:** The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\n\nOkay, so the parol evidence rule generally states that oral agreements that contradict or modify the terms of a written contract are not admissible in court. In this case, the lease had a written option to purchase, but there was an oral promise by the farmer to survey the 10-acre tract. The question is whether this oral promise can be considered as modifying the written contract.\n\nBut, the parol evidence rule typically applies to prevent the introduction of prior oral agreements that contradict the written terms of a contract. Here, the oral promise to survey the 10-acre tract seems to be additional to the written option agreement, not necessarily contradicting it. So, it might not be directly covered by the parol evidence rule.\n\nMoreover, the tenant is seeking specific performance based on the written option, not on the oral promise to survey. The farmer's failure to survey might be a breach of an oral agreement, but it's not directly related to the enforceability of the written option itself.\n\nSo, I'm not sure if this is the strongest defense.\n\n**Option B:** The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit confusing. The farmer orally promised to have the tract surveyed, but this was before the lease was executed. The lease itself contains the option to purchase, but doesn't specify that the farmer must survey the property. The survey was an oral promise, not part of the written lease agreement.\n\nMoreover, the tenant's obligation to purchase is triggered by exercising the option at the expiration of the lease term, assuming the conditions are met. The farmer's failure to survey doesn't directly impact the enforceability of the option itself, unless the survey was a condition precedent to the option's exercise.\n\nBut, since the survey was an oral agreement and not part of the written lease, it might not excuse the farmer from his obligation to sell if the tenant exercises the option. The farmer's failure to survey might be a separate issue.\n\nSo, again, this doesn't seem like the best defense against specific performance.\n\n**Option C:** The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\n\nThis is interesting. The option allows the tenant to purchase \"10 acres of the tract\" for $150,000. But, the exact boundaries of these 10 acres aren't specified in the lease. The farmer had orally promised to survey the tract, but never did so.\n\nIn contract law, for a contract to be enforceable, the subject matter must be sufficiently described to allow for specific performance. If the property description is too vague or indefinite, a court might not order specific performance because it can't determine exactly what property is being sold.\n\nIn this case, \"10 acres of the tract\" is quite vague. Without a survey or specific boundaries defined, it's unclear which 10 acres the tenant is entitled to purchase. This could be a significant issue because the value of different parts of the tract might vary, especially if some parts are more suitable for farming or have better soil, water access, etc.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the tenant started building an irrigation ditch across the northern section without the farmer's knowledge could complicate things further, as this might affect the value or usability of the property.\n\nSo, this seems like a plausible defense. If the court can't determine with certainty which 10 acres are being referred to, it might not grant specific performance.\n\n**Option D:** The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n\nConsideration is a crucial element of a contract; it's the something of value exchanged between parties that makes a promise enforceable. In the context of an option to purchase, there should be consideration for the option itself, separate from the lease consideration.\n\nIn this scenario, the lease included an option to purchase 10 acres at the end of the lease term. However, there's no mention of any additional consideration paid for this option beyond the lease payments.\n\nGenerally, if an option is part of a lease, the consideration for the lease (i.e., the rent payments) might be considered as sufficient consideration for the option, especially if the option is exercisable at the end of the lease term.\n\nBut, there might be exceptions or specific legal doctrines that require separate consideration for the option.\n\nHowever, given that the option is exercisable at the end of the lease term, and considering that the tenant has performed their obligations under the lease (paying rent and maintaining the building), it might be argued that the consideration for the option is implied in the tenant's performance of the lease terms.\n\nTherefore, arguing that there's no separate consideration for the option might not be the strongest defense.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter considering all the options, I think the best defense for the farmer is Option C: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\n\nThe lack of a clear description of the 10 acres to be purchased makes it difficult for the court to enforce specific performance. Without a survey or specific boundaries, determining exactly which portion of the tract is being optioned is unclear, which could render the option unenforceable.\n\nSo, the answer is C."
