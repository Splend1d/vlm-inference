                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Chlorine gas reacts most readily with which of the following: A. toluene, B. ethylene, C. ethanoic acid, D. ethane?\" I need to figure out which one chlorine gas will react with most easily. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's see what I can recall.\n\nFirst off, chlorine gas (Cl\u2082) is a diatomic molecule and is a halogen. It's known for its reactivity, especially in substitution and addition reactions with organic compounds. Now, looking at the options:\n\nA. Toluene: Toluene is like benzene but with a methyl group attached. Benzene is aromatic and generally resists addition reactions, preferring substitution. So, chlorine might react with toluene via a substitution reaction, maybe replacing a hydrogen in the methyl group or the benzene ring. But how readily does that happen?\n\nB. Ethylene: Ethylene is an alkene, with a carbon-carbon double bond. Alkenes are known for their reactivity, especially undergoing addition reactions. Chlorine can add across the double bond to form a dichloro compound. That sounds pretty straightforward.\n\nC. Ethanoic acid: Ethanoic acid is also known as acetic acid. It has a carboxylic acid group. Carboxylic acids have a polar carbonyl group and an hydroxyl group. Chlorine might react with the hydrogen in the acid group, maybe forming a chloro derivative, but I'm not too sure about the reactivity here.\n\nD. Ethane: Ethane is an alkane, a saturated hydrocarbon. Alkanes are generally less reactive than alkenes or aromatics. Chlorine can react with alkanes via substitution, replacing hydrogen atoms with chlorine atoms, but this reaction usually requires initiation, like heat or light.\n\nFrom what I remember, alkenes like ethylene are particularly reactive towards chlorine because of their double bonds. Chlorine adds across the double bond in a process called chlorination, forming dichloro derivatives. This reaction is relatively easy and doesn't require as much energy as substituting hydrogens in alkanes or aromatics.\n\nToluene, being aromatic, would likely undergo a substitution reaction, but that's generally less favorable than an addition reaction in ethylene. Ethanoic acid has a polar group that might complicate things, and ethane is just a simple alkane, which is less reactive.\n\nSo, my initial thought is that ethylene would react most readily with chlorine gas. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that in the presence of ultraviolet light, chlorine can react with alkanes via free-radical substitution. However, without the initiation step, this reaction is slower compared to the addition to alkenes.\n\nIn the case of toluene, the aromatic ring makes it less reactive towards addition reactions, and substitution would be the preferred pathway, but again, this is less facile than addition to a double bond.\n\nEthanoic acid has a carboxylic acid group, which might react differently. Maybe chlorine could substitute for one of the hydrogens in the methyl group, but I think this would still be less reactive than ethylene.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. ethylene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
