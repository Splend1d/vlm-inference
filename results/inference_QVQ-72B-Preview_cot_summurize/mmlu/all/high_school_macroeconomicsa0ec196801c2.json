                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about Big Mac prices in different countries, and I need to figure out where it's the most expensive after converting all the prices to U.S. dollars. The exchange rates are given, and so are the prices in each currency. I need to convert each price to dollars and then compare them.\n\nFirst, the exchange rates:\n\n- 0.5 British Pound per dollar\n\n- 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar\n\n- 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar\n\nAnd the Big Mac prices:\n\n- America: $3\n\n- England: 2 pounds\n\n- Mexico: 50 pesos\n\n- China: 200 yuan\n\nI need to convert the prices from pounds, pesos, and yuan to dollars to compare with the American price.\n\nStarting with England: 2 pounds.\n\nThe exchange rate is 0.5 pound per dollar, which means that for each dollar, you get 0.5 pound. So, to find out how many dollars 2 pounds is, I should divide 2 by 0.5.\n\n2 / 0.5 = 4 dollars.\n\nSo, in England, the Big Mac costs $4.\n\nNext, Mexico: 50 pesos.\n\nThe exchange rate is 10 pesos per dollar, so each dollar gets 10 pesos. To find out how many dollars 50 pesos is, I divide 50 by 10.\n\n50 / 10 = 5 dollars.\n\nSo, in Mexico, the Big Mac costs $5.\n\nNow, China: 200 yuan.\n\nThe exchange rate is 100 yuan per dollar, so each dollar gets 100 yuan. To find out how many dollars 200 yuan is, I divide 200 by 100.\n\n200 / 100 = 2 dollars.\n\nSo, in China, the Big Mac costs $2.\n\nFinally, in America, it's already in dollars: $3.\n\nNow, comparing the prices:\n\n- America: $3\n\n- England: $4\n\n- Mexico: $5\n\n- China: $2\n\nFrom these figures, Mexico has the highest price at $5, and China has the lowest at $2.\n\nWait a minute, the options given are:\n\nA. America ($3).\n\nB. England ($4).\n\nC. Mexico ($5).\n\nD. China ($2).\n\nSo, according to this, Mexico has the most expensive Big Mac at $5.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because I've heard of something called the Big Mac index, where the price of a Big Mac is used to compare currency values. But in this problem, I just need to convert all prices to dollars and see which one is highest.\n\nIs there anything I'm missing here? Maybe I should double-check the exchange rates and my calculations.\n\nLet me verify the exchange rate for British Pound: 0.5 pound per dollar. So, for $1, you get 0.5 pound. Therefore, for 2 pounds, it should be 2 / 0.5 = 4 dollars. That seems correct.\n\nFor Mexican Pesos: 10 pesos per dollar. So, 50 pesos would be 50 / 10 = 5 dollars. That also seems right.\n\nFor Chinese Yuan: 100 yuan per dollar. So, 200 yuan is 200 / 100 = 2 dollars. Correct.\n\nAnd the American price is directly given as $3.\n\nSo, indeed, Mexico has the highest price at $5.\n\nWait, but the question says \"in which country is a Big Mac most expensive?\" and the options are listed as A. America ($3), B. England ($4), C. Mexico ($5), D. China ($2). So, based on this, the answer should be Mexico.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Maybe I need to consider the actual exchange rates and see if there's a discrepancy or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I understand that even though Mexico has the highest dollar price, considering the exchange rates, it might be different.\n\nBut no, the calculations seem straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Mexico ($5).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Mexico (\\$5)}} \\]"
