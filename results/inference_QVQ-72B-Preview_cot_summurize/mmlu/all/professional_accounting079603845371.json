                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these scenarios illustrates the doctrine of substantial performance. I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I think I have a basic understanding of what substantial performance means. Basically, it's when one party to a contract performs most of the obligations under the contract, but there's some minor part that's not quite perfect or maybe even completely missed, but the overall goal of the contract is still achieved.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Blair ordered a dozen blue chairs from Kyle but Kyle delivered a dozen red chairs.\n\nHmm, here Kyle delivered the chairs, but they were the wrong color. Blue and red are pretty different, especially since Blair specifically ordered blue chairs. I think color is a significant part of what Blair was expecting. If Kyle delivered red chairs instead of blue ones, that seems like a pretty substantial deviation from the contract, not just a minor issue. So, I don't think this is an example of substantial performance.\n\nOption B: Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on.\n\nOkay, so Leslie painted the whole room, which is the main part of the job, but forgot to put the outlet covers back on. That seems like a minor oversight. The painting is done, which is the primary obligation under the contract. Not putting the outlet covers back is an inconvenience, but it's something that can be easily fixed. It's not the main part of the job. So, in this case, Leslie has substantially performed the contract because the main task\u2014painting the room\u2014was completed as agreed.\n\nOption C: A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied with the completed result.\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. It says the contract required styling to Toby's satisfaction, but he was dissatisfied in good faith. So, even if the stylist did their best, if Toby isn't satisfied, does that mean there was a failure to perform substantially? I think in contracts where performance is subjective and depends on the client's satisfaction, especially when it's explicitly stated to be to the client's satisfaction, the performance is measured by whether the client is satisfied. Since Toby was dissatisfied, even in good faith, it might mean that the stylist didn't substantially perform as required by the contract.\n\nOption D: A dentist competently completed the extraction of Lee's tooth but mistakenly pulled the wrong one.\n\nThis is a serious mistake. The dentist was supposed to extract a specific tooth but extracted the wrong one. Even if the extraction was competently done, the fact that the wrong tooth was extracted is a major issue. This seems like a breach of the contract because the dentist didn't perform the correct procedure. It's not just a minor issue; it's a significant error that could cause harm or require additional treatment.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Option B seems to be the best example of substantial performance. Leslie painted the entire room, which is the main job, and the only thing missing is putting the electrical outlet covers back on, which is a minor oversight compared to the main task.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn Option A, delivering the wrong color chairs is more than a minor deviation; it's a significant change in the product delivered.\n\nIn Option C, if the contract specifies that styling must be to Toby's satisfaction and he's not satisfied, then the stylist hasn't met the contractual obligation, even if they did their best.\n\nAnd in Option D, extracting the wrong tooth is a serious medical error, not a minor mistake, so that doesn't qualify as substantial performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
