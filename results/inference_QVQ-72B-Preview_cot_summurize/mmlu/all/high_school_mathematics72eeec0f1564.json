                    "text": "To express the repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{7}$ as a common fraction, I can use algebraic methods. Let's denote the repeating decimal as x:\n\nx = 0.17777...\n\nFirst, I need to separate the non-repeating and repeating parts. Here, 0.1 is non-repeating and 7 is repeating.\n\nOne approach is to set up equations where the repeating parts align:\n\nLet x = 0.17777...\n\nMultiply x by 10 to shift the decimal point one place to the right:\n\n10x = 1.7777...\n\nNow, subtract the original x from this equation to eliminate the repeating part:\n\n10x - x = 1.7777... - 0.17777...\n\n9x = 1.6\n\nSo, x = 1.6 / 9 = 16/90, which simplifies to 8/45.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 8/45 is one of them. But let me double-check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the repeating part is after the decimal point. Let's try another method.\n\nLet x = 0.17777...\n\nThis can be thought of as 0.1 + 0.07777...\n\nSo, x = 0.1 + (7/9)/10\n\nWait, why?\n\nWell, 0.1 is just 1/10.\n\nAnd 0.07777... is 7/9 divided by 10, because 0.7777... is 7/9.\n\nSo, x = 1/10 + (7/9)/10 = 1/10 + 7/(9*10) = 1/10 + 7/90 = 9/90 + 7/90 = 16/90 = 8/45.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nAnother method is to use the formula for infinite geometric series.\n\nLet x = 0.17777...\n\nThis can be written as:\n\nx = 0.1 + 0.07 + 0.007 + 0.0007 + ...\n\nSo, x = 0.1 + 7*(0.01 + 0.001 + 0.0001 + ...)\n\nThe series in the parentheses is a geometric series with first term 0.01 and common ratio 0.1.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nSo, S = 0.01 / (1 - 0.1) = 0.01 / 0.9 = 1/90.\n\nTherefore, x = 0.1 + 7*(1/90) = 1/10 + 7/90 = (9/90) + (7/90) = 16/90 = 8/45.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nBut let me check if this matches with the options provided.\n\nOption A is 8/45, which matches my result.\n\nOption B is 8/5, which is much larger than 0.17777...\n\nOption C is 8/7, which is approximately 1.142857..., not matching.\n\nOption D is 8/33, which is approximately 0.242424..., also not matching.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A, 8/45.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I should consider if there's any mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet x = 0.17777...\n\nMultiply x by 100 to shift the decimal point two places to the right:\n\n100x = 17.7777...\n\nNow, subtract the original x from this equation:\n\n100x - x = 17.7777... - 0.17777...\n\n99x = 17.6\n\nSo, x = 17.6 / 99 = 176 / 990 = 88 / 495.\n\nWait, that doesn't simplify to 8/45. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps this method isn't the best for this particular decimal.\n\nLet me go back to the first method, which seems more straightforward.\n\nx = 0.17777...\n\nx = 0.1 + 0.07777...\n\n0.1 is 1/10.\n\n0.07777... is 7/9 * 1/10 = 7/90.\n\nSo, x = 1/10 + 7/90 = 9/90 + 7/90 = 16/90 = 8/45.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a repeating decimal with n digits repeating.\n\nThe general formula is:\n\nIf a decimal is 0.a1a2...an b1b2...bm repeating, it can be expressed as:\n\na1a2...an / (10^n - 1) + b1b2...bm / (10^n - 1) * 10^(-m)\n\nBut in this case, it might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nGiven that all my previous methods lead me to 8/45, and that matches with option A, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nMaybe to double-check, I can plug in the value and see if it matches.\n\n8/45 is approximately 0.17777..., which matches the decimal representation of 0.1 with 7 repeating.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A, 8/45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\dfrac{8}{45}} \\]"
