                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about groups in abstract algebra. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst statement: \"For every positive integer n, there is a cyclic group of order n.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what a cyclic group is. A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. Like, for example, the integers modulo n under addition, denoted as Z_n, is a cyclic group generated by 1 or n-1, depending on the context.\n\nSo, for every positive integer n, does there exist a cyclic group of order n?\n\nWell, Z_n is a cyclic group of order n, right? It has n elements, and it's generated by a single element. So, for n=1, it's just the trivial group {0}. For n=2, it's {0,1}, and so on.\n\nBut is there any positive integer n for which there isn't a cyclic group of that order? From what I remember, no. Because for every n, Z_n exists and is cyclic.\n\nSo, statement 1 seems true.\n\nNow, statement 2: \"Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\"\n\nAlright, so let's break this down. We have a finite cyclic group, say G, of order n. And we need to show that for every divisor d of n, there is an element in G of order d.\n\nHmm, that sounds familiar. I think there's a theorem about this, maybe Lagrange's theorem or something related to cyclic groups.\n\nLet me recall Lagrange's theorem. It says that for any finite group, the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. But here, we're talking about elements, not subgroups directly.\n\nWait, but in a cyclic group, every subgroup is also cyclic, and the order of an element generating a subgroup divides the order of the group, again by Lagrange's theorem.\n\nBut does that mean that for every divisor d of n, there is an element of order d in G?\n\nLet me think of an example. Take Z_6, which is a cyclic group of order 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nIn Z_6, the element 1 has order 6, 2 has order 3, 3 has order 2, and 0 has order 1. So, yes, it contains elements of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nAnother example, Z_4, order 4, divisors 1, 2, 4. Elements: 0 (order 1), 1 (order 4), 2 (order 2), 3 (order 4). So, again, it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 4.\n\nSeems to hold for these examples.\n\nIs there a general proof for this?\n\nSuppose G is a cyclic group of order n, generated by g. Then, for any divisor d of n, there exists an integer k such that n = d * k.\n\nConsider the element g^k. What's its order?\n\nThe order of g^k is n / gcd(n, k). Wait, is that right?\n\nActually, I think the order of g^k is n / gcd(n, k).\n\nIn our case, since n = d * k, and d and k are divisors, but wait, if n = d * k, then gcd(n, k) = gcd(d*k, k) = k * gcd(d,1) = k, since d and 1 are coprime.\n\nWait, no. If n = d * k, then gcd(n, k) = gcd(d*k, k) = k * gcd(d,1) = k, because d and 1 are coprime only if d is 1.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to recall the formula for the order of g^k in a cyclic group.\n\nI think the order of g^k is n / gcd(n, k).\n\nSo, order of g^k = n / gcd(n, k).\n\nIf n = d * k, then gcd(n, k) = gcd(d*k, k) = k * gcd(d,1).\n\nWait, gcd(d*k, k) = k * gcd(d,1). If d and 1 are coprime, gcd(d,1) =1, so gcd(n, k) = k.\n\nTherefore, order of g^k = n / k = d.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of n, there exists an element g^k of order d, where k = n / d.\n\nYes, that seems to make sense.\n\nSo, in Z_6, for d=2, k = 6/2 = 3, so g^3 has order 2, which matches our earlier example.\n\nSimilarly, for d=3, k=2, g^2 has order 3.\n\nCool, so this seems to hold in general.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which would make the answer A. True, True.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any finite cyclic group that doesn't have elements of every order dividing its order?\n\nBased on the reasoning above, no, because for each divisor d of n, there is an element g^{n/d} of order d.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
