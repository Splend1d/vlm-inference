                    "text": "Oh, I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. So, it says that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. And then, seven pens cost $9.24. And I need to find the cost of one pencil in cents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships here. If eleven pencils cost the same as three pens, that means there's some equivalence between the cost of pencils and pens. And then, knowing the cost of seven pens, I can probably find the cost of one pen and then use that to find the cost of one pencil.\n\nLet me try to set this up with some variables. Let's say the cost of one pencil is P (in dollars), and the cost of one pen is E (in dollars).\n\nAccording to the problem, eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. So, that would be:\n\n11P = 3E\n\nAnd also, seven pens cost $9.24:\n\n7E = 9.24\n\nOkay, so now I have two equations:\n\n1) 11P = 3E\n\n2) 7E = 9.24\n\nI can solve for E from the second equation. Let's do that.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n7E = 9.24\n\nSo, E = 9.24 / 7\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n9.24 divided by 7.\n\nWell, 7 times 1.32 is 9.24, because 7 times 1.3 is 9.1, and 7 times 0.02 is 0.14, so total 9.24.\n\nSo, E = 1.32 dollars.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me check.\n\nActually, 7 times 1.32 is 9.24, yes. So, E = $1.32.\n\nNow, I can plug this back into equation 1 to find P.\n\nSo, 11P = 3 * 1.32\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n3 times 1.32 is 3.96.\n\nSo, 11P = 3.96\n\nNow, to find P, I divide both sides by 11.\n\nP = 3.96 / 11\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n11 times 0.36 is 3.96, because 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.06 is 0.66, so total 3.96.\n\nSo, P = 0.36 dollars.\n\nBut the question asks for the cost in cents. Since one dollar is 100 cents, 0.36 dollars is 36 cents.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 11\n\nB. 33\n\nC. 36\n\nD. 52\n\nSo, 36 cents is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, from 7E = 9.24, E = 9.24 / 7.\n\n7 times 1.32 is indeed 9.24, so E = $1.32 is correct.\n\nThen, 11P = 3E = 3 * 1.32 = 3.96\n\nSo, P = 3.96 / 11 = 0.36 dollars, which is 36 cents.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could cross-verify by plugging the values back into the original statements.\n\nIf eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, then 11 * 0.36 should equal 3 * 1.32.\n\n11 * 0.36 = 3.96\n\n3 * 1.32 = 3.96\n\nYes, they match.\n\nSo, the cost of one pencil is 36 cents.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
