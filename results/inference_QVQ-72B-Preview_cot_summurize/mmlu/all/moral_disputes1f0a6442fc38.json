                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is an example of a duty-based moral theory. The choices are consequentialism, natural law theory, Kantian moral theories, or none of the above. I need to recall what a duty-based moral theory is and then see which one of these fits that description.\n\nFirst off, a duty-based moral theory, also known as deontological ethics, focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions based on their adherence to rules or duties. It's more about the nature of the action itself rather than the consequences that result from it. So, in deontological ethics, an action is moral if it aligns with one's duties and immoral if it doesn't, regardless of the outcome.\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Consequentialism: This theory suggests that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. In other words, an action is right if it leads to the best possible outcome, and wrong if it doesn't. This sounds more like utilitarianism, which is a type of consequentialism. It seems like consequentialism is more focused on the results of actions rather than on duties or rules. So, it doesn't fit the definition of a duty-based moral theory.\n\nB. Natural law theory: This one is a bit trickier. Natural law theory is based on the idea that there are universal moral principles that are derived from human nature and reason, rather than from societal conventions or religious teachings. These principles are considered to be objective and applicable to all people. Now, natural law theory does emphasize certain duties and rights that are inherent in human nature. For example, duties related to preserving life, reproducing, and seeking truth. So, in a way, it does focus on duties, which might make it seem like a duty-based moral theory.\n\nHowever, natural law theory isn't primarily centered around the concept of duty in the same way that Kantian ethics is. Natural law theory is more about identifying what is naturally good or bad for humans based on their nature, and deriving moral norms from that. It's not solely based on duty, but rather on what is in accordance with human nature and reason.\n\nC. Kantian moral theories: Immanuel Kant was a prominent philosopher who developed a deontological ethical framework. His theory is often referred to as Kantian ethics. Kant believed that moral actions are those that are performed out of a sense of duty, not for any expected benefit or consequence. He introduced the concept of the categorical imperative, which is a fundamental principle that dictates that one should act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\n\nIn Kantian ethics, the morality of an action is determined by whether it can be universalized without leading to a contradiction. It's entirely focused on the action itself and the intentions behind it, rather than on the outcomes. This clearly aligns with the idea of a duty-based moral theory.\n\nD. None of the above: Since I think one of the options fits the description, I don't think this is the correct choice.\n\nAfter considering each option, it seems that Kantian moral theories are the best example of a duty-based moral theory. Consequentialism is more focused on outcomes, natural law theory is based on human nature and reason, and none of the above seems incorrect given that Kantian ethics is indeed deontological.\n\nTo make sure, let me double-check the definitions:\n\n- Consequentialism: Morality is based on the consequences of actions.\n\n- Natural law theory: Morality is derived from human nature and reason.\n\n- Kantian moral theories: Morality is based on duty and the categorical imperative.\n\n- None of the above: Not applicable.\n\nYes, Kantian moral theories are indeed deontological and focus on duty, which makes them a duty-based moral theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
