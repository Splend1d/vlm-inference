                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that an astronaut lands on a planet where the mass and radius are each twice that of Earth. And if the astronaut weighs 800 Newtons on Earth, I need to find out how much he will weigh on this planet. The options are 200 N, 400 N, 800 N, or 1600 N.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the formula for gravitational force, which is what determines weight on a planet. The gravitational force between two masses is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\n\\[F = G \\times \\frac{m_1 \\times m_2}{r^2}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(F\\) is the force between the masses,\n\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant,\n\n- \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of the two objects,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance between their centers.\n\nIn this case, the weight of the astronaut on a planet is essentially the gravitational force exerted by the planet on the astronaut. So, \\(m_1\\) would be the mass of the astronaut, and \\(m_2\\) would be the mass of the planet, with \\(r\\) being the radius of the planet.\n\nBut wait, on Earth, the weight of the astronaut is given as 800 N. That means:\n\n\\[F_{\\text{Earth}} = G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times m_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = 800 \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nNow, on this planet, both the mass and the radius are twice that of Earth. So, \\(m_{\\text{planet}} = 2 \\times m_{\\text{Earth}}\\) and \\(r_{\\text{planet}} = 2 \\times r_{\\text{Earth}}\\).\n\nI need to find \\(F_{\\text{planet}}\\), which is:\n\n\\[F_{\\text{planet}} = G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times m_{\\text{planet}}}{r_{\\text{planet}}^2}\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[F_{\\text{planet}} = G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times 2 \\times m_{\\text{Earth}}}{(2 \\times r_{\\text{Earth}})^2}\\]\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n\n\\[(2 \\times r_{\\text{Earth}})^2 = 4 \\times r_{\\text{Earth}}^2\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[F_{\\text{planet}} = G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times 2 \\times m_{\\text{Earth}}}{4 \\times r_{\\text{Earth}}^2}\\]\n\nNotice that this can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[F_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times m_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2}\\]\n\nBut we know that \\(G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times m_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2}\\) is equal to the astronaut's weight on Earth, which is 800 N. So,\n\n\\[F_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 800 \\, \\text{N} = 400 \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nWait a minute, that would mean the astronaut weighs 400 N on this planet. But looking back at the options, that's one of them. However, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me go through it again. The formula for gravitational force is correct. On Earth, the force is 800 N, which is given. On the planet, mass is doubled and radius is doubled.\n\nSo, \\(m_{\\text{planet}} = 2 m_{\\text{Earth}}\\) and \\(r_{\\text{planet}} = 2 r_{\\text{Earth}}\\).\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[F_{\\text{planet}} = G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times 2 m_{\\text{Earth}}}{(2 r_{\\text{Earth}})^2} = G \\times \\frac{2 m_{\\text{Earth}}}{4 r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} \\times m_{\\text{astronaut}}\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[F_{\\text{planet}} = G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times m_{\\text{Earth}}}{2 r_{\\text{Earth}}^2}\\]\n\nNow, since \\(G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times m_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = 800 \\, \\text{N}\\), then:\n\n\\[F_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 800 \\, \\text{N} = 400 \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think about it differently. Maybe using the formula for gravitational acceleration on the planet.\n\nOn Earth, weight is mass times gravitational acceleration:\n\n\\[w_{\\text{Earth}} = m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times g_{\\text{Earth}} = 800 \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nOn the planet:\n\n\\[w_{\\text{planet}} = m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times g_{\\text{planet}}\\]\n\nI need to find \\(g_{\\text{planet}}\\). The gravitational acceleration on a planet's surface is:\n\n\\[g = G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{planet}}}{r_{\\text{planet}}^2}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(m_{\\text{planet}} = 2 m_{\\text{Earth}}\\) and \\(r_{\\text{planet}} = 2 r_{\\text{Earth}}\\), then:\n\n\\[g_{\\text{planet}} = G \\times \\frac{2 m_{\\text{Earth}}}{(2 r_{\\text{Earth}})^2} = G \\times \\frac{2 m_{\\text{Earth}}}{4 r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times G \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\text{Earth}}\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\text{Earth}}\\).\n\nSo, the weight on the planet would be:\n\n\\[w_{\\text{planet}} = m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\text{Earth}}\\]\n\nBut \\(m_{\\text{astronaut}} \\times g_{\\text{Earth}} = 800 \\, \\text{N}\\), so:\n\n\\[w_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 800 \\, \\text{N} = 400 \\, \\text{N}\\]\n\nThis confirms the previous result. So, it seems the answer should be 400 N, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. For example, does the higher mass of the planet compensate for the increased radius? In this case, since both mass and radius are doubled, but radius is squared in the denominator, so the net effect is that gravity is halved, as we've calculated.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think that since mass and radius are both doubled, the gravitational force would be quadrupled due to mass but decreased by the square of the radius, so overall halved. Which again leads to 400 N.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option B is 400 N, which seems correct based on these calculations. But let me check if there's any trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that the mass of the astronaut changes? No, the mass of the astronaut should remain the same regardless of the planet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gravitational constant G changes, but no, G is a universal constant.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the weight on the planet is being compared incorrectly. But no, the problem states clearly that the astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth, and we're to find his weight on this planet, given that the planet's mass and radius are twice those of Earth.\n\nGiven that, and the calculations showing that the weight is halved, it seems consistent that the weight on the planet would be 400 N.\n\nWait a second, perhaps there's a confusion with the units or the concept of weight. Weight is indeed the gravitational force exerted on an object, and it does depend on the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the planet.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that both mass and radius are scaled by the same factor, the gravitational acceleration should scale accordingly, leading to the weight being halved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 400 N.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the scaling laws again.\n\nThe gravitational force is proportional to the mass of the planet divided by the square of its radius.\n\nSo, \\(F \\propto \\frac{m_{\\text{planet}}}{r_{\\text{planet}}^2}\\).\n\nIf both mass and radius are doubled, then:\n\n\\(F_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{2 m_{\\text{planet}}}{(2 r_{\\text{planet}})^2} = \\frac{2 m_{\\text{planet}}}{4 r_{\\text{planet}}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{m_{\\text{planet}}}{r_{\\text{planet}}^2}\\).\n\nThus, the new force is half the original force.\n\nTherefore, if the original weight is 800 N, the weight on this planet should be 400 N.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 400 N.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
