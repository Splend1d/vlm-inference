The options are relationship marketing, service mix, market exchanges, and service failure. Hmm, let's see which one fits this description.\n\nFirst off, relationship marketing sounds like it's about building long-term connections between a company and its customers. So, if there's no prior history or expectation of future exchanges, that doesn't really align with relationship marketing, does it? Like, relationship marketing is all about fostering ongoing relationships, not just one-off transactions.\n\nNext, service mix. I think service mix refers to the combination of services that a company offers. It's more about the range of services provided rather than the nature of the exchange between buyer and seller. So, maybe not the right choice here.\n\nThen there's market exchanges. This seems plausible. Market exchanges are typically transactions that happen in a marketplace, where buyers and sellers come together to trade goods and services. Often, especially in larger markets or anonymous settings, there might not be any prior history or expectation of future exchanges between specific buyers and sellers. For example, if you buy something from a vendor at a flea market and never plan to go back, it's a one-time exchange.\n\nLastly, service failure. That sounds like when something goes wrong with a service, leading to customer dissatisfaction. Again, this doesn't seem to directly fit the description of an exchange without prior or future interactions.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, market exchanges seem to be the most fitting answer. They can occur without any prior history or future expectations between the buyer and seller, whereas the other options involve more nuanced relationships or different aspects of marketing and service provision.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that relationship marketing could include one-time exchanges? Maybe in some cases, but generally, relationship marketing is about building and maintaining relationships over time, which implies multiple interactions. So, no, I don't think that's the case.\n\nService mix is more about the portfolio of services offered by a company, not about the nature of the exchange between buyer and seller. So, that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nService failure is about issues with the service provided, which isn't directly related to the type of exchange based on prior or future interactions.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is market exchanges. These are transactions that can happen independently, without any dependency on past or future interactions between the parties involved.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any context missing. For example, perhaps in certain industries or specific marketing strategies, the terms could overlap, but based on the standard definitions, market exchanges still seem the most appropriate choice.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Market exchanges.}} \\]"
