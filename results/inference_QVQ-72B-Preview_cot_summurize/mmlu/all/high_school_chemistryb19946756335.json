                    "text": "Okay, so I need to identify the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair from this list. Let me first make sure I understand what a conjugate acid-base pair is. In Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory, an acid is a proton (H+) donor, and a base is a proton acceptor. A conjugate acid-base pair consists of two species that differ only by a proton.\n\nSo, for each option, I need to see which two species can act as acid and base to each other by donating or accepting a proton.\n\nLet's look at option A: H3O+ and OH-\n\nH3O+ is the hydronium ion, which is basically water (H2O) that has accepted a proton (H+), making it an acid. OH- is the hydroxide ion, which can accept a proton to become H2O. So, if H3O+ donates a proton to OH-, it would turn into H2O, and OH- would turn into H2O as well. But in this pair, H3O+ and OH- are not directly conjugate to each other because they don't differ just by one proton in a way that they are acid-base pairs. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption B: H3PO4 and H2PO4-\n\nH3PO4 is phosphoric acid, which can donate a proton to become H2PO4-. So, H3PO4 is the acid, and H2PO4- is its conjugate base. This seems like a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\nOption C: HClO4 and ClO3-\n\nHClO4 is perchloric acid, which can donate a proton to become ClO4-. Wait, ClO3- is different; that's chlorate, not perchlorate. So, HClO4 and ClO3- don't form a conjugate acid-base pair because ClO3- is not the conjugate base of perchloric acid. Perchloric acid's conjugate base should be ClO4-.\n\nOption D: SO32- and HSO2-\n\nHmm, SO32- is sulfite ion, and HSO2- seems like it might be the bisulfite ion, but actually, the conjugate acid of sulfite ion is HSO3-, not HSO2-. So, this doesn't seem like a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\nFrom this, option B seems to be the correct conjugate acid-base pair, where H3PO4 is the acid and H2PO4- is its conjugate base.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry terms, when an acid donates a proton, it turns into its conjugate base. So, for H3PO4, donating one proton would give H2PO4-, which is the conjugate base. Similarly, if H2PO4- donates another proton, it becomes HPO4^2-, and so on.\n\nIn option A, H3O+ can donate a proton to become H2O, and OH- can accept a proton to become H2O. So, H3O+ and OH- are not directly conjugate to each other because their conjugate bases are different.\n\nIn option C, HClO4 donates a proton to become ClO4-, not ClO3-. ClO3- is a different species, like chlorate ion, which is not related to perchloric acid in this way.\n\nIn option D, SO32- is sulfite, and its conjugate acid is HSO3-, not HSO2-. So, that's incorrect as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: H3PO4 and H2PO4-.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair in the following list.\" It might be asking for the pair that consists of an acid and its conjugate base, or vice versa.\n\nLooking back, option B has H3PO4 and H2PO4-, which are indeed conjugate acid-base pair because H3PO4 donates a proton to form H2PO4-.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other pair that could also be considered a conjugate pair.\n\nOption A: H3O+ and OH- \u2013 H3O+ is the acid, and OH- is the base, but they are not conjugate to each other directly. H3O+ donates a proton to become H2O, and OH- accepts a proton to become H2O. So, they don't form a conjugate pair with each other.\n\nOption C: HClO4 and ClO3- \u2013 HClO4 donates a proton to become ClO4-, not ClO3-. ClO3- is a different species.\n\nOption D: SO32- and HSO2- \u2013 SO32- is sulfite, and its conjugate acid is HSO3-, not HSO2-. So, this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option B correctly represents a conjugate acid-base pair where one is the acid and the other is its conjugate base.\n\nWait, but the question might be tricky because sometimes people confuse conjugate acid-base pairs with just any acid and base pair.\n\nBut in Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory, a conjugate acid-base pair specifically refers to two species that differ by exactly one proton.\n\nSo, in option B, H3PO4 donates a proton to become H2PO4-, making them a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\nHence, the answer should be B.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any other option could be considered a conjugate acid-base pair in a different context.\n\nFor example, could H3O+ and OH- be considered conjugate in some way?\n\nWell, H3O+ donates a proton to become H2O, and H2O can donate a proton to become H+, leaving OH- as the conjugate base of H2O. But in that case, H3O+ and OH- are not directly conjugate to each other; they are separated by two steps.\n\nSimilarly, in option C, HClO4 donates a proton to become ClO4-, and ClO4- can accept a proton to become HClO4. So, HClO4 and ClO4- are conjugate acid-base pair, but the option lists ClO3-, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo or misremembering in option C.\n\nPerchloric acid is HClO4, and its conjugate base is ClO4-. Chlorate is ClO3-, which is a different species.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect because HClO4 and ClO3- are not conjugate acid-base pair.\n\nSimilarly, in option D, SO32- is sulfite, and its conjugate acid is HSO3-, not HSO2-. So, that's also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only correct conjugate acid-base pair in the list is option B: H3PO4 and H2PO4-.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
