                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a woman who leased a condo from the owner for one year. After six months, the owner gave her a written option to buy the condo for $100,000 before the lease ended. She spent $10,000 to remodel the kitchen with the owner's approval, and then one month before the lease ended, the owner said he was revoking the option to purchase. The woman tried to accept the option a week later, but the owner refused to sell. Now, she wants to sue for breach of contract. The question is asking what her strongest argument is that an enforceable contract was formed.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, there's a lease for one year. After six months, the owner gives her a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the lease expires. So, she has until the end of the lease to decide whether to buy it for that price.\n\nShe spends $10,000 to remodel the kitchen, with the owner's approval. That's interesting because she's investing money into the property based on the option to buy.\n\nThen, one month before the lease ends, the owner revokes the option. A week later, she tries to accept the option, but the owner refuses.\n\nNow, in a standard option contract, when someone is given an option to buy something within a certain period, generally, the offer can't be revoked during that period. But in this case, the owner is trying to revoke it before the end of the lease.\n\nOption A says that because she had until the end of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective. That makes sense because typically, an option contract specifies a time period during which the offer can be accepted, and revoking it before that period is against the terms.\n\nOption B mentions that if the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months. But we don't know if the owner is a merchant or not from the information given. He's just described as the owner of the condo.\n\nOption C says that because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen. Hmm, that's possible. If the remodeling was done in reliance on the option to buy, it could be seen as an act of acceptance.\n\nOption D suggests that after she paid to remodel the kitchen, an option contract resulted because the owner knew she was relying on the offer to her detriment. This sounds like the doctrine of promissory estoppel, where someone relies on a promise to their detriment, and the promisor is estopped from denying the promise.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an original lease for one year. After six months, the owner gives her a written option to purchase for $100,000 before the lease expires. So, she has up to the end of the lease to decide whether to exercise the option.\n\nShe invests $10,000 in remodeling the kitchen, presumably with the idea that she might buy the condo and want it customized to her liking.\n\nThen, one month before the lease ends, the owner revokes the option. She tries to accept it a week later, but he refuses.\n\nSo, the key issue is whether the owner can revoke the option before the end of the lease period.\n\nIn contract law, an option contract is a contract where one party pays a premium for the right to buy something at a set price within a certain time frame. The key feature is that the offeror (the owner) can't revoke the offer during that time period.\n\nSo, generally, the woman should have been able to accept the option until the lease ended, and the owner couldn't revoke it before then.\n\nBut the owner is trying to revoke it one month before the lease ends.\n\nOption A seems straightforward: since she had until the end of the lease to accept, revoking it earlier is ineffective.\n\nHowever, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there are conditions attached to the option that could affect its revocability.\n\nBut from what's given, it seems like a clear option contract with a specified time period for acceptance.\n\nOption B brings in the merchant exception, but we don't know if the owner is a merchant. He's just a condo owner who leased it out.\n\nOption C suggests that her act of remodeling the kitchen could be seen as acceptance of the option. That's an interesting point. If remodeling the kitchen was an act that signified her intention to accept the option, then perhaps the contract was formed at that point.\n\nBut did she explicitly accept the option when she remodeled the kitchen? It's not clear. She might have remodeled it with the idea that she might buy it, but she didn't formally accept the option until later.\n\nOption D mentions promissory estoppel. Since she invested $10,000 in remodeling based on the option to buy, if the owner now revokes the option, she's been detrimentally relied on his promise. Promissory estoppel could be a basis to enforce the option.\n\nBut again, it seems like the option contract itself should be enforceable until the end of the lease, without needing to resort to promissory estoppel.\n\nWait, maybe the remodeling changes things. If she remodeled the kitchen with the owner's approval and in reliance on the option to buy, perhaps that strengthens her position.\n\nBut in terms of forming an enforceable contract, the option contract seems sufficient on its own.\n\nLet me consider the sequence of events again:\n\n- Lease for one year.\n\n- After six months, written option to purchase for $100,000 before lease expires.\n\n- With owner's approval, she spends $10,000 to remodel the kitchen.\n\n- One month before lease ends, owner revokes option.\n\n- One week later, she tries to accept the option, but owner refuses.\n\nSo, the revocation is attempted one month before the lease ends, and she accepts a week later.\n\nIn contract law, generally, an option contract prevents the offeror from revoking the offer during the option period. So, if the option period is until the end of the lease, the owner can't revoke it before then.\n\nTherefore, her acceptance a week later should be valid, as the option was still in effect.\n\nUnless there's something about the remodeling that changes this, it seems like Option A is the strongest argument.\n\nBut let's consider if the remodeling affects the contract formation.\n\nIf she remodeled the kitchen with the understanding that she might exercise the option to buy, is that an act of acceptance?\n\nNot necessarily. Remodeling could be seen as preparing to buy, but not formally accepting the option.\n\nTo accept an option, she would need to communicate her acceptance explicitly, probably in writing, before the option period expires.\n\nSince she did that one week before the lease ended, and the owner had tried to revoke it one month before, her acceptance should be valid.\n\nTherefore, her strongest argument is that she had until the end of the lease to accept the offer, and the owner's revocation was ineffective.\n\nOption A seems to capture that.\n\nOption C is close but doesn't seem as strong because remodeling isn't necessarily an explicit acceptance.\n\nOption D is also relevant, but again, if the option contract itself is enforceable until the end of the lease, promissory estoppel might be overkill.\n\nOption B is speculative because we don't know if the owner is a merchant.\n\nTherefore, I think Option A is the strongest argument.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
