                    "text": "So I have this problem here about bending an electron beam using the Earth's magnetic field. The electrons are moving at a speed of 10^7 meters per second, and the magnetic field is 5 times 10 to the power of negative 5 teslas. I need to find out what the radius of the circular path these electrons will follow is.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a charged particle behaves in a magnetic field. I remember that when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it experiences a force called the Lorentz force. This force causes the particle to move in a circular path. The centripetal force needed for this circular motion is provided by the Lorentz force.\n\nSo, the Lorentz force is given by F = qvB, where q is the charge of the particle, v is its velocity, and B is the magnetic field strength. For electrons, q is equal to the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 times 10 to the power of minus 19 coulombs.\n\nNow, the centripetal force required for circular motion is F_c = mv^2 / r, where m is the mass of the electron, v is its velocity, and r is the radius of the circle we're trying to find.\n\nSince the Lorentz force provides the centripetal force, we can set these two equations equal to each other:\n\nqvB = mv^2 / r\n\nNow, I can solve for r:\n\nr = mv / qB\n\nI have values for v and B, but I need the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron to plug into this equation.\n\nLooking up the mass of an electron, it's approximately 9.109 times 10 to the power of minus 31 kilograms.\n\nThe charge of an electron, q, is 1.602 times 10 to the power of minus 19 coulombs.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nr = (9.109 \u00d7 10^-31 kg) \u00d7 (10^7 m/s) / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C) \u00d7 (5 \u00d7 10^-5 T)\n\nLet me calculate the numerator first:\n\n9.109 \u00d7 10^-31 \u00d7 10^7 = 9.109 \u00d7 10^-24 kg\u00b7m/s (since 10^7 m/s is the same as 10^7 m/s)\n\nNow, the denominator:\n\n1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^-5 = 1.602 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^-24 = 8.01 \u00d7 10^-24 C\u00b7T\n\nNow, r = 9.109 \u00d7 10^-24 / 8.01 \u00d7 10^-24\n\nLet me divide these:\n\n9.109 / 8.01 \u2248 1.137\n\nSo, r \u2248 1.137 meters\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1 nm\n\nB. 1 \u03bcm\n\nC. 1 mm\n\nD. 1 m\n\nThe closest option is D. 1 m.\n\nWait a minute, my calculation gave me approximately 1.137 meters, which is basically 1 meter. So, the answer should be D. 1 m.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the formula: r = mv / qB\n\nPlugging in:\n\nm = 9.109 \u00d7 10^-31 kg\n\nv = 10^7 m/s\n\nq = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C\n\nB = 5 \u00d7 10^-5 T\n\nSo, r = (9.109 \u00d7 10^-31) \u00d7 (10^7) / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19) \u00d7 (5 \u00d7 10^-5)\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nNumerator: 9.109 \u00d7 10^-31 \u00d7 10^7 = 9.109 \u00d7 10^-24 kg\u00b7m/s\n\nDenominator: 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^-5 = 1.602 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^-24 = 8.01 \u00d7 10^-24 C\u00b7T\n\nNow, r = 9.109 \u00d7 10^-24 / 8.01 \u00d7 10^-24 = 9.109 / 8.01 \u2248 1.137 meters\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the direction of the charges or any other forces, but I think for this problem, the Lorentz force and the centripetal force consideration should suffice.\n\nSo, the radius of the circle that the electron beam will bend into is approximately 1 meter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 1\\ \\text{m}} \\]"
