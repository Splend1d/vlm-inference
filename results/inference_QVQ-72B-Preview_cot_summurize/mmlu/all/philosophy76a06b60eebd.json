Constructing logical proofs for moral principles.\n\nB. Consulting social conventions.\n\nC. Reflecting on what we really think.\n\nD. Consulting scripture.\n\nI need to figure out which one of these aligns with Ross's approach to moral theory construction.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall who Ross is in this context. I think William David Ross was an ethical theorist who worked on moral philosophy, particularly on ethical particularism and the idea of prima facie duties. He was an intuitionist in ethics, believing that some moral truths are self-evident and can be known through intuition.\n\nGiven that, option C, \"reflecting on what we really think,\" sounds a bit like intuitionism. It suggests looking inward to our moral intuitions to understand what's right and wrong.\n\nOption A, \"constructing logical proofs for moral principles,\" seems more aligned with rationalist approaches, where moral truths are derived from logical deductions. Ross was an intuitionist, which is different from rationalism in that intuitionism relies on immediate moral intuitions rather than deriving moral principles through logical argumentation.\n\nOption B, \"consulting social conventions,\" would be more in line with cultural relativism or some form of conventionalism, where moral truths are determined by societal norms and customs. Ross, as an intuitionist, believed in objective moral truths that transcend cultural practices.\n\nOption D, \"consulting scripture,\" points towards divine command theory, where moral obligations are based on the commands of a deity. Ross was a Christian, but his moral philosophy wasn't based solely on religious texts; rather, he believed in self-evident moral principles that could be known through intuition.\n\nSo, considering these options, it seems that C is the closest to Ross's approach. He emphasized the role of intuition in moral knowledge, suggesting that we have immediate awareness of certain moral truths.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. Ross is known for his theory of prima facie duties, which are moral obligations that apply in most situations but can be overridden by stronger obligations in particular circumstances. This idea aligns with reflecting on specific situations and our intuitions about them, rather than following absolute rules or deriving principles from logic, social conventions, or scripture.\n\nMoreover, Ross believed that moral knowledge is non-inferential, meaning that we can know some moral truths directly, without having to infer them from other beliefs or premises. This again points towards the importance of reflection and intuition in moral theory construction.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I would conclude that according to Ross, we should construct a moral theory by reflecting on what we really think.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
