                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about percentiles. Mary scored at the 64th percentile and Pam at the 56th percentile on some test. And I need to figure out which of these statements is true based on that information.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what percentiles are. A percentile is a way to rank scores in a distribution. So, if you're at the 64th percentile, that means you scored higher than 64% of the people who took the test. Similarly, Pam at the 56th percentile scored higher than 56% of the test-takers.\n\nSo, Mary scored higher than Pam because 64 is greater than 56. But I need to see what these differences actually mean in terms of scores or proportions.\n\nLet me look at option A: \"Mary scored eight more points than Pam.\" Hmm, the difference between 64th and 56th percentile is indeed 8 percentage points. But does that mean she scored eight more points? I don't think so. Percentiles are about the relative standing, not necessarily about the actual score points. So, it's probably not accurate to say she scored eight more points.\n\nOption B: \"Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\" This seems similar to option A but phrased differently. Again, percentiles indicate the proportion of scores below a certain point, not the actual percentage of the score. So, I don't think this is directly translating the percentile difference to the actual score difference. Probably not true.\n\nOption C: \"Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\" Okay, this makes sense. Since Pam is at the 56th percentile and Mary at the 64th, the difference between them is 8 percentage points. So, yes, 8% of the test-takers scored between Pam and Mary. That seems correct.\n\nOption D: \"Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\" Hmm, this seems tricky. First, I need to know how many people took the test to figure out how many scored higher than both. But the problem doesn't specify the total number of test-takers. Without knowing the total number, I can't determine the exact number of people who scored higher than both Mary and Pam. So, this seems unlikely to be true without more information.\n\nBased on this reasoning, option C seems to be the true statement. The difference in percentiles directly tells us the percentage of test-takers who scored between Pam and Mary.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. If Pam is at the 56th percentile and Mary at the 64th, then indeed, the difference is 8 percentage points, which corresponds to 8% of the test-takers scoring between them. Unless there's some other factor at play here, like the distribution of scores within each percentile, but generally, percentiles are evenly spaced in terms of the cumulative percentage of scores.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
