                    "text": "So I need to figure out how many innings there are in a regular Major League Baseball game. The options are seven, eight, nine, or ten. Hmm, I think I remember something about baseball having nine innings, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should double-check.\n\nFirst, I know that in baseball, the game is divided into innings, and each inning consists of both a top and a bottom half. So, both teams get a chance to bat and field during each inning. But how many of these innings are there in a standard game?\n\nLet me think about it. I recall that in little league or youth baseball, games might be shorter, like six or seven innings, but in professional baseball, it seems like it's more. Wait, maybe it's different depending on the league or the level of play.\n\nI should consider what a \"regular\" Major League Baseball game entails. MLB is the top professional baseball league in the United States and Canada, and their games are typically longer than those in lower leagues or in amateur baseball.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've ever heard or seen a reference to the number of innings in an MLB game. I think the traditional number is nine innings. Yeah, that sounds familiar. Most MLB games I've watched or heard about last for nine innings, unless there's a tie, in which case they go into extra innings.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should think about the structure of the game more carefully. Each inning is composed of two halves: the top half where the visiting team bats, and the bottom half where the home team bats. After nine innings, the team with the most runs wins.\n\nWhat if the game is tied after nine innings? Then, they play additional innings, called extra innings, until one team has more runs than the other at the end of a complete inning. So, the regular game is nine innings, and anything beyond that is extra.\n\nAnother thing I can think about is the length of the game in terms of time. On average, a nine-inning baseball game lasts about three hours, give or take, depending on various factors like the number of pitches thrown, the number of batters, and so on.\n\nWait a minute, is there any variation in the number of innings based on the specific rules or exceptions? For example, in some leagues, they might play shorter games for various reasons, but I think in MLB, it's consistently nine innings per game.\n\nLet me also consider if there are any recent changes or experimental rules that might affect the number of innings. I don't think so; MLB hasn't changed the standard number of innings in a regular game as far as I know.\n\nJust to cover all bases, I'll consider the possibility that in certain situations, like during spring training or in exhibition games, the number of innings might be different. But the question specifies a \"regular\" Major League Baseball game, so I think it's safe to assume it's referring to the standard season games.\n\nSo, to sum it up, in a regular Major League Baseball game, there are nine innings. That seems to be the standard, and it aligns with what I recall from watching and following baseball games.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. nine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
