                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the Winter King from a seventeenth-century song. The options are:\n\nA. Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand\n\nB. Successfully defended his land from the Holy Roman Empire\n\nC. Rebelled against King Ferdinand\n\nD. Claimed the lands of Bohemia for the Catholic Church\n\nAnd I need to figure out which one is correct based on the song provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the song. It starts by saying, \"Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King! What's this that you have done? Is 't not a very naughty thing To snatch the kaiser's crown?\" So, it seems like the Winter King did something wrong, specifically snatching the Kaiser's crown. The Kaiser here is probably the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThen it says, \"Now you will have to stay away Alike from Rhine and Prague, And more than that\u2014shame and dismay Your days and nights will plague.\" This suggests that as a result of his actions, the Winter King is being punished or exiled from places like the Rhine and Prague, and he's experiencing shame and distress.\n\nNext, it mentions, \"Right well you knew, and all the world, Right well they know this thing, That Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king.\" So, this line is emphasizing that everyone knew that Ferdinand was the lawful king of Bohemia, but despite that, the Winter King did something against him.\n\nFinally, it says, \"So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go To Ferdinand, your king, And beg him graciously to show Full pardon for your sin.\" Here, \"Fritz\" is likely a nickname for Frederick, who was the Winter King. He's being urged to go to Ferdinand, acknowledge his wrongdoings, and seek forgiveness.\n\nFrom this, it seems like the Winter King did something to challenge Ferdinand's authority or to take something that belonged to him, specifically the crown. So, let's see which option aligns with this information.\n\nOption A says he gave over his crown to King Ferdinand. But the song says he snatched the Kaiser's crown, which implies he took it, not gave it away. So, this doesn't seem to match.\n\nOption B says he successfully defended his land from the Holy Roman Empire. The song doesn't mention any defense or military action. It's more about taking the crown and facing consequences like exile and shame. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C says he rebelled against King Ferdinand. Rebelling could involve challenging someone's authority or taking actions against them. Given that he snatched the Kaiser's crown, which was likely Ferdinand's, this seems plausible. Moreover, the consequence is exile and shame, which could be the result of a failed rebellion.\n\nOption D says he claimed the lands of Bohemia for the Catholic Church. But the song mentions that Ferdinand is Bohemia's lawful king, so it doesn't make sense that the Winter King would be giving Bohemia to the Catholic Church. He seems to be in conflict with Ferdinand, not supporting the Church's claims.\n\nSo, based on the song's content, it seems that the Winter King rebelled against King Ferdinand, which aligns with option C. This makes sense historically, as Frederick V, the Winter King, led a rebellion against Ferdinand II during the Bohemian Revolt, which was part of the Thirty Years' War. He was subsequently defeated, leading to his exile and the reinforcement of Ferdinand's rule in Bohemia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Rebelled against King Ferdinand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
