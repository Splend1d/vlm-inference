                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this question about whether a particular provision in a statute is constitutional. The statute in question allows a federal agency to choose a site and build a monument honoring members of the Capitol Police who were killed on duty. It's been passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President, which usually means it's a done deal, right? But there's a catch: the funds allocated for this project can't be spent until both houses of Congress pass a concurrent resolution approving the agency's plans for the monument's location and design. And this resolution doesn't need the President's signature.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether this provision, which requires further congressional approval before spending the funds, is constitutional. There are four options:\n\nA. No, because decisions about where to put and how to design government buildings or monuments are solely the executive branch's job, and Congress can't meddle with that.\n\nB. No, because this is just another way Congress is trying to mess with the executive branch's responsibilities.\n\nC. Yes, because Congress can attach reasonable conditions to the money it gives to executive departments, and since they have a special interest in the Capitol Police (because they protect Congress), this condition is reasonable.\n\nD. Yes, because the provision is part of a law that went through the proper channels\u2014passed by both houses and signed by the President.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the roles of Congress and the executive branch in this context. Congress has the power of the purse; that is, it controls spending. The executive branch is responsible for carrying out the laws and managing federal agencies.\n\nThe statute here authorizes the agency to select a site and construct the monument, and it appropriates the necessary funds. But it also says that these funds can't be spent until Congress passes a concurrent resolution approving the plans. A concurrent resolution is different from a regular bill because it doesn't go to the President for approval and doesn't have the force of law in the same way.\n\nSo, the issue is whether Congress can attach a condition like this to an appropriation, effectively requiring its own approval of the agency's plans after the law has already been enacted.\n\nOption A says that this is an exclusively executive function, and Congress can't interfere. But is that true? I thought that Congress has the power to set conditions on how its appropriations are spent, as long as those conditions are constitutional.\n\nOption B says no, it's an unconstitutional interference. But again, Congress does have the power to set conditions on appropriations. So, maybe it's not that straightforward.\n\nOption C says yes, because Congress can attach reasonable conditions to appropriations, and given their special interest in the Capitol Police, this condition is reasonable. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says yes, simply because it's part of a statute that was properly enacted. But that might be oversimplifying things. Just because a law is passed doesn't mean every part of it is constitutional. There have been many cases where parts of laws have been struck down as unconstitutional.\n\nI need to think about the principle here. Congress is using its appropriations power to set conditions on how the money is spent. This seems like a way for Congress to maintain control over the details of the monument's design and location, even after the law is passed.\n\nBut isn't that somewhat unusual? Typically, once Congress passes a law and appropriates funds, the executive branch carries out the details unless there are specific conditions attached.\n\nLet me consider some precedents. I recall that in the case of Nixon v. Administrator of General Services (1974), the Supreme Court held that Congress could not\u6536\u56de\u5df2\u7ecf\u62e8\u51fa\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8d44\u91d1\u5df2\u7ecf\u62e8\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u9644\u5e26\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u9700\u8981\u56fd\u4f1a\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6279\u51c6\u624d\u80fd\u652f\u51fa\u3002\n\nAnother relevant case is Train v. City of New York (1972), where the Court discussed the delegation of legislative power to administrative agencies. But I'm not sure how directly that applies here.\n\nWait, perhaps a better analogy is with conditions attached to grants to states. For example, in South Dakota v. Dole (1987), the Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to condition state receipt of federal funds on the states raising their drinking age to 21. The Court said that as long as the conditions are related to the federal interest in the funds, they are constitutional.\n\nIn this case, the condition is related to Congress's interest in the monument honoring its own police force. So, maybe that's similar\u2014Congress has a particular interest and is using its appropriations power to ensure that interest is met.\n\nBut is this a condition on the expenditure of funds, or is it an improper legislative veto?\n\nA legislative veto occurs when Congress tries to retract or modify executive action without the President's consent, which was deemed unconstitutional in Chadha v. Immigration and Naturalization Service (1983). But in that case, it was a one-house veto of an executive action. Here, it's a concurrent resolution requiring approval from both houses, and it's not a veto of an action but an approval of plans before funds are expended.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not a legislative veto in the same sense. It's more of a precondition for spending the funds.\n\nLet me see if there are any cases that deal specifically with conditions attached to appropriations for executive agencies.\n\nI recall that in INS v. Chadha, the Court struck down the legislative veto because it allowed one house to reverse executive action without going through the full legislative process, including presidential approval. But in this case, it's a concurrent resolution from both houses, not just one.\n\nStill, the issue might be whether Congress is improperly encroaching on executive functions by requiring its approval of administrative decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, Congress has the power to set conditions on how its appropriations are spent, as long as those conditions are clear and constitutional.\n\nIn this specific scenario, Congress is requiring its approval for the location and design of the monument. Given that the monument is to honor the Capitol Police, who protect Congress, it's understandable why Congress might want a say in how and where the monument is built.\n\nMoreover, the monument will likely be located in a place that falls under federal jurisdiction, possibly near the Capitol building, which is also under Congress's control.\n\nSo, perhaps Congress has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the monument fits with its vision and the area where it's located.\n\nOption C seems to capture this reasoning by stating that Congress can attach reasonable conditions to appropriations, and given its special interest in the Capitol Police, this condition is reasonable.\n\nOption D, while tempting, is too simplistic because just because a law is passed properly doesn't mean every part of it is constitutional. For example, if a law violated the separation of powers or some other constitutional principle, it could be struck down.\n\nOption A and B both say no, but for different reasons. Option A claims it's an exclusively executive function, which might not be accurate, as Congress does have a say in appropriations and can set conditions.\n\nOption B says it's an unconstitutional interference, but without specifying why. Maybe it's interfering with the executive's discretion, but is that necessarily the case?\n\nIn contrast, Option C provides a reasoned justification for why the provision is constitutional, citing Congress's power to attach conditions to appropriations and its special interest in the Capitol Police.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Yes, because Congress may attach reasonable conditions to its appropriation of funds to executive departments, and its special interest in the members of its own police force makes the provision a reasonable condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
