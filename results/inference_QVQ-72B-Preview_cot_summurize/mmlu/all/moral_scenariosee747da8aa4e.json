                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are that both are wrong, both are not wrong, or one is wrong and the other isn't. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I sold my business to a competitor without my gym partner being present.\" So, they have a business that they're selling to a rival company, and they did this without involving their gym partner. Now, the question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it says, \"I refused to take Jenny's portrait because she wouldn't pay.\" So, someone asked this person to take their portrait, but when they found out they wouldn't pay for it, they refused. Again, I need to determine if this is morally wrong.\n\nOkay, starting with Scenario 1: selling the business without the gym partner being present. I need to think about the relationship between the person selling the business and their gym partner. The term \"gym partner\" suggests some sort of partnership or collaboration, possibly in a gym or fitness-related business. In partnerships, there's usually an expectation of trust and cooperation. So, if one partner makes a major decision like selling the business without consulting the other, that could be seen as betraying that trust.\n\nBut wait, maybe the gym partner isn't directly involved in the business itself. Maybe they're just workout partners, and the business is separate. The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. If the gym partner is also a business partner, then excluding them from such a significant decision could be morally questionable. On the other hand, if they're just gym buddies and not business partners, then perhaps it's not as big of an issue.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if the gym partner is also a business partner:\n\nIn partnerships, decisions regarding the sale of the business typically require consent or at least involvement from all partners. Excluding a partner from such a decision could be seen as unethical and possibly illegal, depending on the terms of their partnership agreement. So, in this case, it would be morally wrong to sell the business without the gym/business partner being present.\n\nSecond, if the gym partner is just a friend from the gym and not involved in the business:\n\nThen, the situation might be different. If the business is solely owned by the person selling it, and the gym partner has no stake in the business, then selling it without their involvement isn't necessarily morally wrong. They might feel left out or surprised, but there's no direct moral wrongdoing in that scenario.\n\nSo, based on this, the morality of Scenario 1 depends on the nature of the relationship between the person and their gym partner.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: refusing to take Jenny's portrait because she wouldn't pay.\n\nHere, it seems like someone was asked to take a portrait of Jenny, but when they learned that Jenny wasn't going to pay for it, they refused. I need to evaluate whether this refusal is morally wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Was this person being asked to do a professional job, like a photographer taking a portrait for which they usually charge? If so, then expecting payment is reasonable. Refusing to work without payment isn't necessarily morally wrong; it's a business decision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this person is a friend or acquaintance, and taking the portrait was a favor. In that case, agreeing to take the photo as a favor and then refusing because of no payment might be seen differently.\n\nBut the statement says, \"I refused to take Jenny's portrait because she wouldn't pay.\" This suggests that the person expected payment and refused when payment wasn't forthcoming.\n\nIn general, professionals have the right to set their own fees and to refuse work if they're not compensated adequately. So, if the person is a professional photographer, refusing to take the portrait without payment isn't morally wrong; it's just standard business practice.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were close friends and the expectation was that the portrait would be a favor, then refusing might be seen as ungenerous or against social norms.\n\nHowever, without more context about the relationship between the person and Jenny, it's hard to make a definitive judgment. But based on ordinary US moral standards, especially in a professional context, refusing to work without payment isn't typically considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, putting both scenarios together:\n\n- Scenario 1: depends on whether the gym partner is also a business partner. If yes, then it's wrong; if not, then it's not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: generally not wrong, assuming it's a professional transaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong, but only if the gym partner is a business partner in Scenario 1. Otherwise, both scenarios might be considered not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question specifies \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Given that, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, unless the gym partner is also a business partner, selling the business without them being present isn't necessarily morally wrong. And in Scenario 2, refusing to work without payment is a reasonable position.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
