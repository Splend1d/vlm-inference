                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about sex ratios in species with two sexes. It says that when the ratio isn't 50:50, parents might give more care and resources to the offspring of the minority sex. And I need to figure out which type of selection this is an example of. The options are sexual selection, disruptive selection, balancing selection, and frequency-dependent selection.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with sexual selection: I think this is about traits that evolve because they make individuals more attractive to mates or better at competing for mates. So, it's more about characteristics that help in reproduction beyond just survival. Does this situation with sex ratios and parental care fit into that?\n\nHmm, maybe not directly. It seems more about how parents allocate resources based on the sex of their offspring, given imbalances in the sex ratio.\n\nNext, disruptive selection. I recall that this is when selection favors extreme variations in a trait, leading to two or more distinct forms within a population. Like, if an environment has conditions that favor both very small and very large sizes, but not medium sizes, you might see disruptive selection.\n\nBut in this case, we're talking about sex ratios and parental investment, not variation in a trait like size or color. So, maybe this isn't the right fit either.\n\nNow, balancing selection. This sounds like selection that maintains variation in a population by balancing different factors. For example, heterozygote advantage, where heterozygous individuals have a selective advantage over homozygous ones, can lead to balancing selection.\n\nAgain, not sure if this directly applies to the scenario described. We're dealing with sex ratios and parental care, not genetic variations per se.\n\nLastly, frequency-dependent selection. This one seems interesting. It's when the fitness of a trait depends on how common or rare it is in the population. So, if a trait is rare, it might be favored, and if it's common, it might be selected against, or vice versa.\n\nIn the context of sex ratios, if one sex is in the minority, perhaps there's an advantage to producing more of that sex, or to investing more in it, because it might be in higher demand in the mating market.\n\nWait a minute, there's a concept in evolutionary biology called the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, which suggests that parents may invest more in the sex that can provide the greatest reproductive benefit based on the parents' status. But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.\n\nLet me think differently. If there's an imbalance in the sex ratio, and parents invest more in the minority sex, could that be because those offspring might have better mating prospects? For example, if there are fewer males, males might have an easier time finding mates, so investing in males could yield more grandchildren.\n\nThat sounds a bit like frequency-dependent selection, where the advantage shifts based on the frequency of the trait\u2014in this case, the sex.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Maybe it's about maximizing inclusive fitness. Parents might invest more in the sex that can pass on more genes, given the current sex ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to parental manipulation or sexual selection, but I still think frequency-dependent selection makes the most sense here.\n\nLet me check the definitions again to make sure.\n\nA. Sexual selection: selection for traits that enhance mating success.\n\nB. Disruptive selection: selection that favors extreme trait values, leading to increased variation.\n\nC. Balancing selection: selection that maintains genetic variation in a population.\n\nD. Frequency-dependent selection: selection where a trait's fitness depends on its frequency in the population.\n\nGiven that, frequency-dependent selection seems the most fitting answer because the parental investment is dependent on the frequency of the sex in the population. When a sex is in the minority, it might have higher mating success, so investing more in that sex could be advantageous for the parents in terms of reproductive success.\n\nI don't think it's sexual selection, as that's more about traits that help in mating competitions or attractiveness, not directly about parental investment based on sex ratios.\n\nDisruptive selection doesn't seem relevant here because we're not talking about extreme trait expressions in a population.\n\nBalancing selection is about maintaining genetic variation, which isn't directly addressed in this scenario about sex ratios and parental care.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. frequency-dependent selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
