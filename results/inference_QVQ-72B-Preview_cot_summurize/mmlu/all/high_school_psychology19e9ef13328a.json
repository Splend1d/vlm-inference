                    "text": "So I've got this question about facial expressions that are recognized across different cultures. It says that certain cross-cultural studies have suggested that six facial expressions are recognized by people of virtually every culture. And I need to pick the correct list from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about universal facial expressions. I remember that there has been research, especially by Paul Ekman, which suggests that some facial expressions are universal and recognized across different cultures. The number six rings a bell, so that makes sense.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Happiness, sadness, anger, loathing, lust, and surprise.\n\nHmm, happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise seem like they would be universal. But loathing and lust... I'm not so sure about those. Loathing sounds a bit specific, and lust seems more related to desire, which might not be as universally expressed through facial expressions.\n\nOption B: Happiness, sadness, indifference, fright, surprise, and dislike.\n\nAgain, happiness, sadness, and surprise seem consistent. Indifference might be a bit more contextual, and fright could be related to fear. Dislike seems vague compared to other more specific emotions.\n\nOption C: Happiness, sadness, desire, repulsion, fear, and surprise.\n\nHere, happiness, sadness, and surprise are again present. Desire and repulsion seem like they might be more subjective or vary more across cultures. Fear seems plausible, but I need to confirm.\n\nOption D: Happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust.\n\nThis option includes happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. This seems very familiar. I think Paul Ekman's research identified these six expressions as universal: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust.\n\nLet me double-check my memory. I recall that in Ekman's studies, these six emotions were consistently recognized across diverse cultural groups, even in pre-literate societies that had minimal exposure to Western culture.\n\nSo, comparing this with the other options:\n\n- Option A has loathing and lust instead of fear and disgust.\n\n- Option B has indifference and dislike instead of anger and disgust.\n\n- Option C has desire and repulsion instead of anger and disgust.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to align best with the established research on universal facial expressions.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that other expressions could be considered universal. For example, in some cultures, certain expressions might have similar meanings, but according to Ekman's work, these six are the most consistently recognized worldwide.\n\nAdditionally, I can think about the facial muscle movements associated with these expressions. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), developed by Ekman and Friesen, codifies facial expressions based on muscle movements, and it supports the idea of these six basic emotions being universally expressed.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge and the options provided, I'm confident that option D\u2014happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust\u2014is the correct list of facial expressions recognized by people of virtually every culture.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
