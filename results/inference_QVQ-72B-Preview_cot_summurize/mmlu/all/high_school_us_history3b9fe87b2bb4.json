Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's about Federalist #15, which is written by Alexander Hamilton. The question is asking what Hamilton proposed to address the problems identified in that essay. The options are:\n\nA. Abandoning an isolationist approach to foreign policy and adopting a more aggressive and interventionist stance.\n\nB. Adopting a new constitution to create a more national government.\n\nC. Forging alliances with American Indian nations to present a united front to European powers.\n\nD. Increasing spending on military forces and cutting spending on social programs.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what Federalist #15 is about. I remember that the Federalist Papers were a series of essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to persuade New York state to ratify the U.S. Constitution. Each essay addressed different aspects of the new constitution and the reasons why it was necessary.\n\nFederalist #15, written by Hamilton, likely discusses the flaws of the existing government under the Articles of Confederation and makes a case for adopting the new constitution proposed by the Constitutional Convention.\n\nSo, to answer this question, I need to think about what Hamilton proposed as a solution to the problems he outlined in Federalist #15.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Abandoning an isolationist approach to foreign policy and adopting a more aggressive and interventionist stance.\n\nWhile it's possible that Hamilton discussed foreign policy in some of the Federalist Papers, I don't recall Federalist #15 specifically addressing foreign policy strategies. Moreover, the primary focus of the Federalist Papers was on the structure and function of the new government, not on specific foreign policy approaches.\n\nOption B: Adopting a new constitution to create a more national government.\n\nThis seems plausible. The entire purpose of the Federalist Papers was to advocate for the ratification of the new U.S. Constitution. Hamilton was a key figure in drafting and supporting the new constitution, which aimed to strengthen the federal government and address the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nOption C: Forging alliances with American Indian nations to present a united front to European powers.\n\nAgain, while relationships with Indigenous peoples were important in the early years of the United States, I don't think this was a main point in Federalist #15. The Federalist Papers were primarily concerned with the structure of the government and the distribution of power between the states and the federal government, not with specific diplomatic strategies regarding Indigenous peoples.\n\nOption D: Increasing spending on military forces and cutting spending on social programs.\n\nThis seems unlikely. The Federalist Papers were written in the late 18th century, a time when social programs as we know them today didn't exist. Moreover, the focus was on establishing a strong central government that could handle both domestic and international challenges, but specific fiscal policies like increasing military spending or cutting social programs weren't part of the discussion in these essays.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B seems to be the most accurate answer. Hamilton's proposal to address the problems he identified in Federalist #15 was indeed the adoption of a new constitution that would create a more national government, thereby strengthening the United States and addressing the deficiencies of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, let me think back to the content of Federalist #15. I believe it discusses the dangers of a weak central government and how it makes the country vulnerable to external threats and internal conflicts. Hamilton argues that without a stronger national government, the United States cannot effectively regulate commerce, defend against invasion, or manage relations between the states.\n\nTherefore, his solution is to replace the Articles of Confederation with a new constitution that grants the federal government the necessary authority to address these issues effectively.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer is B. Adopting a new constitution to create a more national government.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
