                    "text": "Alright, I've got this passage from Jane Addams' \"Twenty Years at Hull House.\" It's about a meeting at Hull House during a strike in a shoe factory. The discussion was about how some strikers were easily frightened and capitulated first, especially those who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell behind on payments. Then, one of them suggested having their own boarding club so they could support each other during tough times like strikes.\n\nSo, they talked about this idea, and by May 1, 1891, they rented and furnished two apartments near Hull House. The Settlement, which I assume is Hull House, provided the furniture and paid the first month's rent. After that, the members managed the club themselves. By the end of the third year, the club had expanded to six apartments and had fifty members.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option best reflects Jane Addams' perspective based on this passage. The options are:\n\nA. Poor people need the leadership of reformers like herself.\n\nB. Poor people need support in helping themselves.\n\nC. Poor people don't need outside help.\n\nD. Poor people don't deserve help.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is saying. It seems like Jane Addams is describing a situation where the women strikers faced challenges during the strike, particularly those who were paying for board. They were afraid of losing their boarding places if they fell behind on payments, which probably made them more likely to give up the strike early.\n\nThen, one of the women suggested starting their own boarding club where they could support each other in times of need, like during a strike. This idea was discussed, and with the help of Hull House, they set up this boarding club. Hull House provided initial support with furniture and the first month's rent, but after that, the members managed it themselves. Over time, the club grew, occupying more apartments and having more members.\n\nFrom this, it seems like Jane Addams is highlighting how these women identified their own needs and came up with a solution, with some initial support from Hull House. So, it's not that poor people don't need outside help, but rather that with a little support, they can help themselves and even build something sustainable, like this boarding club.\n\nLet me look at each option again:\n\nA. Poor people need the leadership of reformers like herself.\n\nWell, in the passage, Jane Addams doesn't present herself as the leader. It was the women themselves who came up with the idea and managed the club. Hull House provided support, but the leadership seems to have come from the women involved.\n\nB. Poor people need support in helping themselves.\n\nThis seems to align with what happened. The women identified a need and came up with a solution, and Hull House provided initial support to make it happen.\n\nC. Poor people don't need outside help.\n\nBut the passage shows that Hull House provided initial support, which was crucial for starting the boarding club. So, it seems that outside help was needed at least initially.\n\nD. Poor people don't deserve help.\n\nThis seems contrary to the spirit of the passage. Hull House was helping these women, and Jane Addams is describing their efforts positively.\n\nGiven this, option B seems to be the best reflection of Jane Addams' perspective based on the passage. She is showing that with support, poor people can help themselves and create lasting solutions to their problems.\n\nI don't think it's A because she doesn't position herself as the leader; rather, it was the women who took the lead. Option C is not supported by the fact that Hull House provided initial help, and option D is clearly not aligned with the positive tone of the passage.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Poor people need support in helping themselves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
