                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about executive orders, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. There are four options:\n\nA. Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions.\n\nB. Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress.\n\nC. Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s.\n\nD. Executive orders bypass congressional approval.\n\nOkay, let's break this down one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions.\" Hmm, I thought that sometimes presidents use executive orders precisely because they can't get controversial actions through Congress. So, if that's the case, then this statement might not be true. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, option B: \"Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress.\" I know that executive orders are directives from the president that have the force of law, but do they have the exact same effect as a bill that's been passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the president? I think executive orders are more limited in scope and can be easier to reverse than actual laws. So, maybe this isn't entirely true.\n\nOption C: \"Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s.\" I've heard that in recent decades, presidents have been using more executive orders, maybe because it's harder to get things passed through Congress. But I'm not sure about the trend since the 1970s. Maybe I should look up some data on that.\n\nLastly, option D: \"Executive orders bypass congressional approval.\" I know that executive orders are issued by the president without needing a vote in Congress. So, they do bypass congressional approval, right? That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to decide which one of these is not true. Let's consider each again:\n\nA. If presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions, that would suggest they only use them for non-controversial things, which I doubt. I think presidents do use executive orders for controversial actions when they can't get Congress to agree on something.\n\nB. Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress. While they do have the force of law, they might not be as comprehensive or enduring as laws passed through the legislative process. Maybe they're more susceptible to being overturned by subsequent presidents or through the courts.\n\nC. Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s. I need to check the data on this. Maybe some presidents have used more, while others have used fewer.\n\nD. Executive orders bypass congressional approval. This seems accurate because the president can issue an executive order without seeking permission from Congress.\n\nAlright, perhaps I should focus on option C and see if it's accurate. Let's think about presidential use of executive orders over time.\n\nI recall that in the early 20th century, presidents like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson used executive orders fairly frequently. Then, Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman also issued many executive orders during their tenures.\n\nMoving to more recent times, I think President Reagan issued fewer executive orders compared to his predecessors. President George H.W. Bush issued even fewer, and President Clinton issued somewhat more. President George W. Bush issued a moderate number, and President Obama issued quite a few, especially towards the end of his second term.\n\nBut overall, has there been an increase since the 1970s? I'm not sure. It seems like there have been fluctuations.\n\nLet me try to find some numbers. I remember that in the 1970s, under Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter, there were varying numbers of executive orders.\n\nFor example, President Nixon issued around 100 executive orders per year on average, while President Ford issued fewer, and President Carter issued around 80 per year.\n\nIn the 1980s, President Reagan averaged about 40 per year, which is less than Carter. President George H.W. Bush issued around 30 per year, and President Clinton issued about 40 per year.\n\nPresident George W. Bush issued around 35 per year, and President Obama issued about 15 per year, which is significantly fewer than his predecessors.\n\nSo, from this, it seems that since the 1970s, there hasn't been a consistent increase in the use of executive orders. In fact, it appears that after Nixon, the number of executive orders issued decreased over time.\n\nTherefore, option C: \"Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s\" seems to be not true, based on the numbers I just recalled.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I look at the total number of executive orders from each president:\n\n- Nixon: approximately 300 in 8 years\n\n- Ford: approximately 100 in 2.5 years\n\n- Carter: approximately 300 in 4 years\n\n- Reagan: approximately 150 in 8 years\n\n- George H.W. Bush: approximately 100 in 4 years\n\n- Clinton: approximately 200 in 8 years\n\n- George W. Bush: approximately 150 in 8 years\n\n- Obama: approximately 100 in 8 years\n\n- Trump: approximately 100 in 4 years\n\n- Biden: approximately 50 in his first year\n\nFrom these numbers, it's clear that since Nixon, the number of executive orders has generally decreased, not increased. So, option C is not true.\n\nNow, just to make sure, let's quickly consider the other options again.\n\nOption A: \"Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions.\" While it's true that presidents might prefer to get congressional approval for major policy changes, in practice, they have used executive orders for controversial actions when legislative routes fail. For example, President Obama used executive orders for immigration policies like DACA when Congress couldn't pass related laws. So, this statement is probably not true.\n\nOption B: \"Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress.\" While executive orders do have the force of law, they are different in nature. Congressional laws are statutes passed by the legislative branch, while executive orders are directives from the executive branch. Executive orders can be more easily reversed by subsequent presidents or challenged in court, whereas laws require legislative action to be repealed. So, this statement is not entirely true.\n\nOption D: \"Executive orders bypass congressional approval.\" This is generally true. The president can issue an executive order without seeking approval from Congress.\n\nGiven all this, the statement that is NOT true is option C: \"Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s.\" In fact, the trend has been towards fewer executive orders since the 1970s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
