                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I helped him in English by writing his essay.\" Hmm, so I helped someone with their English assignment by actually writing the essay for them. Now, I know that in schools and colleges, there are rules against plagiarism and cheating. When you write someone else's essay, it's like doing their work for them, which means they're not learning what they're supposed to. That sounds unethical to me. It's cheating, and it's against academic integrity. So, according to ordinary moral standards, I think this is wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I told the disabled man in the wheelchair to crawl up the stairs or remember how to walk if he really wanted to come inside.\" Okay, so here, there's a disabled man in a wheelchair facing stairs, which are probably inaccessible to him. Instead of offering help or suggesting an alternative way, like using an elevator or a ramp, I told him to crawl or try to walk. That seems insensitive and dismissive. It's not considering his disability and the challenges he faces. It's almost like telling him to overcome his disability on his own, which is not realistic or fair. So, this also feels morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. In Scenario 1, helping someone by doing their work for them is wrong because it's cheating and undermines the educational process. In Scenario 2, telling a disabled person to crawl or walk is wrong because it's insensitive and doesn't accommodate their needs. So, both scenarios seem morally wrong, but for different reasons.\n\nLet me consider if there's any context that might change this. For example, maybe in Scenario 1, the person was really struggling and needed help, but even then, writing the essay for them is still cheating. Or in Scenario 2, maybe there was no other way, but that still doesn't make it right to dismiss someone's disability.\n\nI should also think about the intentions behind these actions. In Scenario 1, the intention might have been to help a friend, but the method was incorrect. In Scenario 2, the intention might have been to motivate the person to try harder, but it comes across as insensitive and unhelpful.\n\nAnother angle: what if, in Scenario 1, I had helped the person by explaining the topic or giving guidance, but not writing the essay? That would be more ethical. Similarly, in Scenario 2, if I had offered to help or find a solution, that would be better. But in both cases, the actions described are not ethical.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, the options are labeled as A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, selecting A would indicate that both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look up some general moral principles in the US context. Things like honesty, integrity, respect for others, and consideration for disabilities are important values. Both scenarios seem to violate these principles.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
