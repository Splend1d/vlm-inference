The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Napoleon and the French Revolution. It says that Napoleon helped make the French Revolution an international movement in the areas he conquered, and then it gives four options: A) By imposing a universal currency based on the French franc, B) By the brutal suppression of guerrilla resistance, C) By abolishing feudalism and manorialism, and D) By encouraging the use of French as the universal language.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what the question is asking. It wants to know how Napoleon spread the ideas of the French Revolution to the places he conquered. The French Revolution was all about liberty, equality, and fraternity, right? So, his actions in these conquered areas should reflect those ideals in some way, making the revolution not just a local event but something that affected other countries too.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says by imposing a universal currency based on the French franc. Hmm, a universal currency sounds like it could be a way to standardize trade and economics across different regions, which might have some benefits, but is that really about spreading the revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality? Maybe not directly. It seems more like a practical measure for administration and trade.\n\nOption B is about brutal suppression of guerrilla resistance. This sounds more like a repressive measure to control the areas he conquered rather than spreading revolutionary ideas. If anything, suppressing resistance might go against the revolutionary ideals of freedom and self-determination.\n\nOption C mentions abolishing feudalism and manorialism. Feudalism and manorialism were systems where land was held by nobles who granted it to vassals in exchange for loyalty and service. Peasants were often tied to the land and had limited rights. The French Revolution aimed to end these systems in France, so if Napoleon was abolishing them in the areas he conquered, that would be in line with revolutionary ideals. It would mean giving more freedom and equality to the common people in those regions, which aligns with the revolution's goals.\n\nOption D is about encouraging the use of French as a universal language. Language is an important part of culture and communication, and making French the universal language could facilitate administration and perhaps spread French ideas. However, imposing one language over others might not be seen as a revolutionary act in the sense of promoting liberty and equality for all cultures and languages.\n\nSo, comparing these options, option C seems to be the one that most directly aligns with the revolutionary ideals of ending oppressive old systems and promoting greater equality and freedom for the people in the conquered areas.\n\nWait a minute, let me think about this again. The question says \"helped make the French Revolution an international movement.\" That suggests that his actions were spreading the revolutionary ideas and perhaps inspiring similar changes in other places.\n\nOption A, imposing a currency, might have economic impacts but isn't necessarily about spreading revolutionary ideals.\n\nOption B, suppressing resistance, seems counter to the revolutionary spirit, as it's more about control than liberation.\n\nOption C, abolishing feudalism and manorialism, directly challenges the old order and supports the ideas of equality and individual rights, which are core to the French Revolution.\n\nOption D, promoting French language, could be seen as a way to spread French culture and ideas, which might include revolutionary thoughts, but it could also be seen as cultural imperialism.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the best answer because it directly applies the revolutionary principles to the conquered areas by ending feudal and manorial systems, thereby promoting greater equality and freedom.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any context I'm missing. For example, did Napoleon actually abolish feudalism and manorialism in the areas he conquered? I recall that in some places, like Germany and Italy, Napoleon did take steps to end feudal privileges and establish more modern legal systems based on the Napoleonic Code, which reflected the revolutionary principles.\n\nAlso, imposing a universal currency (option A) was something Napoleon did, like the franc, but that was more about economic control and standardization than spreading revolutionary ideals.\n\nOption B, suppressing guerrilla resistance, was certainly part of Napoleon's tactics to maintain control over conquered territories, but it's not something that would make the revolution an international movement; rather, it was a means to enforce his rule.\n\nOption D, encouraging the use of French, did happen, especially as Napoleon wanted to spread French culture and language, but again, this seems more about imposing French dominance than spreading the revolutionary ideas per se.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I still think that option C, abolishing feudalism and manorialism, is the correct answer because it directly applies the revolutionary principles of equality and freedom to the conquered areas, thereby making the French Revolution an international movement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
