                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here. It says: \"The university raises tuition if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\" And I need to identify the antecedent of this conditional proposition. The options are:\n\nA. The university raises tuition.\n\nB. The governor approves of it.\n\nC. The board of trustees recommends it.\n\nD. The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what an antecedent is in a conditional statement. From what I remember, in a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. So, in this case, the statement is: \"If both the governor approves and the board of trustees recommends, then the university raises tuition.\"\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased is \"The university raises tuition if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\" So, it's basically saying that raising tuition depends on both approvals.\n\nNow, I need to identify which part is the antecedent. Let's rephrase this to make it clearer. The statement can be rephrased as: \"If both the governor approves and the board of trustees recommends, then the university raises tuition.\"\n\nIn this standard form, the \"if\" part is the antecedent, and the \"then\" part is the consequent.\n\nSo, the antecedent is \"both the governor approves and the board of trustees recommends.\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The university raises tuition. - That's the consequent.\n\nB. The governor approves of it. - This is part of the antecedent.\n\nC. The board of trustees recommends it. - This is also part of the antecedent.\n\nD. The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it. - This is the entire antecedent.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D, because that's the entire condition that leads to the university raising tuition.\n\nWait a second, the question says \"both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\" So, both conditions need to be true for the university to raise tuition.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent is the combined condition of both approvals.\n\nHence, the antecedent is \"the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nWhich matches option D.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that the antecedent could be considered differently?\n\nFor example, could \"if both\" imply something else in logical terms?\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nIn logic, \"if P and Q, then R\" is the same as saying \"if P and Q, then R.\"\n\nSo, in this case, P is \"the governor approves,\" Q is \"the board recommends,\" and R is \"the university raises tuition.\"\n\nSo, the statement is \"if P and Q, then R.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent is P and Q, which is exactly what option D says.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nCould the antecedent be just \"the governor approves\" or \"the board recommends\"?\n\nWell, the statement says \"if both,\" which means both conditions together are necessary.\n\nSo, neither approving nor recommending alone is sufficient; it's their conjunction that matters.\n\nTherefore, options B and C are incorrect because they are only parts of the antecedent, not the whole.\n\nOption A is the consequent, which is not the antecedent.\n\nOption D is the full antecedent.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look at the structure again:\n\nStatement: \"The university raises tuition if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.\"\n\nRephrased: \"If the governor approves and the board recommends, then the university raises tuition.\"\n\nIn logical notation, this would be: (Governor approves \u2227 Board recommends) \u2192 University raises tuition.\n\nHere, the antecedent is (Governor approves \u2227 Board recommends), which matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
