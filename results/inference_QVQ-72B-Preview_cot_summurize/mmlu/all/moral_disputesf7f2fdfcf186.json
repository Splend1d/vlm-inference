                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept about special obligations to fellow citizens, as per Macedo. The question is asking what gives rise to these special obligations. Let me see the options again:\n\nA. our relationships to noncitizens.\n\nB. consequentialist duties to promote the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nC. membership in a legitimate self-governing community.\n\nD. nothing; we do not have special obligations to fellow citizens.\n\nHmm, I need to think carefully about this. First off, I need to understand what Macedo is arguing. I recall that Macedo is a political philosopher who has written about democracy and justice. So, in this context, he's likely discussing why we might have particular duties or obligations to our fellow citizens beyond just general moral duties to all people.\n\nOption A suggests that our relationships to noncitizens are the basis for these special obligations. That seems a bit counterintuitive. If anything, our relationships with noncitizens might be different, but I don't see how they directly give rise to special obligations to fellow citizens. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nOption B mentions consequentialist duties to promote the greatest good for the greatest number. Consequentialism is a moral theory that judges the rightness of actions based on their outcomes. So, if Macedo is arguing from a consequentialist perspective, he might be saying that favoring our fellow citizens leads to better overall outcomes, perhaps by strengthening the community or the state. That could make sense, but I'm not entirely sure if that's his main point.\n\nOption C refers to membership in a legitimate self-governing community. This sounds plausible. If we're part of a community that governs itself legitimately, perhaps through democratic means, then we might have special obligations to other members of that community because we share in the responsibility of governing ourselves. This seems like a solid argument for why we might have special duties to fellow citizens.\n\nOption D simply states that there are no special obligations to fellow citizens. Well, if Macedo is arguing against this view, then this can't be his position. So, I can probably eliminate this option.\n\nNow, between options B and C, I need to decide which one best represents Macedo's view. Consequentialism is about outcomes, whereas the idea of a self-governing community is about the nature of the relationship and shared responsibilities among citizens.\n\nI think Macedo's argument is more grounded in the idea of shared governance and mutual responsibilities among citizens in a democratic society rather than purely on the outcomes of such obligations. So, I'm leaning towards option C.\n\nLet me consider this further. In a self-governing community, citizens participate in making collective decisions that affect everyone. Therefore, they have a direct stake in each other's welfare and in upholding the rules and norms they've collectively agreed upon. This shared enterprise could indeed generate special obligations to one another.\n\nOn the other hand, consequentialism might support special obligations to fellow citizens if it can be shown that doing so leads to better overall consequences, but that seems more of a secondary justification rather than the primary basis for such obligations.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I think the correct answer is C. membership in a legitimate self-governing community.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
