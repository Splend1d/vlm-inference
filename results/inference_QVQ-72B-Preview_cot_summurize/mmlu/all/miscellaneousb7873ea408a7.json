The options are:\n\nA. 12 1/2 rpm\n\nB. 33 1/3 rpm\n\nC. 45 rpm\n\nD. 100 rpm\n\nHmm, I need to recall what the standard playback speed is for a 12-inch LP. I know that LP stands for \"long-playing\" record, which was introduced to provide longer playback times compared to earlier records.\n\nLet me think about this. I remember that the 12-inch LP revolutionized the music industry in the 1940s and 1950s, offering a way to play music for longer durations without having to change records frequently.\n\nNow, regarding the playback speed, I think the standard rpm (revolutions per minute) for a 12-inch LP is 33 1/3 rpm. But let me make sure I'm not confusing it with other types of records.\n\nI know that there are different types of records, each with their own standard playback speeds:\n\n1. 16 rpm: This was a format used by the U.S. Armed Forces for educational and entertainment purposes.\n\n2. 33 1/3 rpm: This is commonly associated with LP records.\n\n3. 45 rpm: These are single records, usually smaller in size, like 7 inches.\n\n4. 78 rpm: These are the older, heavier records that were standard before the LP was introduced.\n\nSo, for a 12-inch LP, 33 1/3 rpm seems right. But just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\n12 1/2 rpm doesn't sound familiar for LPs. I think it might be a misremembered number or perhaps related to some specific application, but not the standard for 12-inch LPs.\n\n45 rpm is typical for singles, which are usually smaller records, like 7 inches or sometimes 10 inches, but not 12 inches.\n\n100 rpm sounds too fast for a record; that would probably cause wear and tear and might not be suitable for audio playback.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, the correct answer should be B. 33 1/3 rpm.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that when I've seen turntables and record players, they almost always have a setting for 33 1/3 rpm, especially if they're designed to play LPs. They might also have settings for 45 rpm and sometimes 78 rpm, but 33 1/3 is the one consistently associated with 12-inch LPs.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the normal playback speed for a 12-inch long-playing record is 33 1/3 rpm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 33\\ 1/3\\ rpm} \\]"
