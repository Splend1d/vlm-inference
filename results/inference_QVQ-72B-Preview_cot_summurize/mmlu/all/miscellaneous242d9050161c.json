                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this sentence: \"Whenever the mood strikes her, Angela takes a short walk around the block.\" And the underlined part is \"Whenever the mood strikes her.\" I need to figure out what kind of clause this is from the options given: an adjective clause, a relative clause, a subordinate clause, or an independent clause.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each type of clause is.\n\nStarting with an adjective clause: I think an adjective clause is a type of dependent clause that modifies a noun or pronoun in the sentence, kind of like how an adjective does. For example, in the sentence \"The car that is red is mine,\" \"that is red\" is an adjective clause modifying \"car.\"\n\nNext, a relative clause: I believe this is similar to an adjective clause; it starts with a relative pronoun like \"who,\" \"whom,\" \"whose,\" \"which,\" or \"that\" and modifies a noun or pronoun. So, it's essentially an adjective clause.\n\nThen, a subordinate clause: This is a clause that can't stand alone as a sentence; it's dependent on another clause to make sense. It can be an adjective clause, an adverb clause, or a noun clause. So, it's a bit broader than just an adjective clause.\n\nLastly, an independent clause: This is a clause that can stand alone as a sentence because it has a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought.\n\nGiven that, I need to look at the underlined part: \"Whenever the mood strikes her.\"\n\nFirst, \"whenever\" seems like a subordinating conjunction, which suggests that this clause is subordinate, meaning it can't stand alone.\n\nIt's modifying the main clause \"Angela takes a short walk around the block.\" But how is it modifying it?\n\n\"Whenever the mood strikes her\" seems to be indicating a condition or a time when Angela decides to take a walk. So, it's providing additional information about when she takes these walks.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. an adjective clause: Adjective clauses modify nouns or pronouns. In this case, is \"whenever the mood strikes her\" modifying a noun or pronoun? Not directly. The main clause is about Angela taking a walk, but the underlined clause isn't modifying Angela or any specific noun in the main clause in a way that an adjective would.\n\nB. a relative clause: Similar to an adjective clause, this also seems not to be modifying a specific noun or pronoun.\n\nC. a subordinate clause: This seems plausible because \"whenever\" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a subordinate clause. This clause depends on the main clause to make complete sense.\n\nD. an independent clause: This can stand alone, but \"whenever the mood strikes her\" doesn't express a complete thought on its own. It needs the main clause to complete its meaning.\n\nSo, between the options, C. a subordinate clause seems to be the best fit.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"an adjective clause\" is option A, and \"a relative clause\" is option B. I think adjective clauses and relative clauses are types of subordinate clauses, but not all subordinate clauses are adjective clauses or relative clauses.\n\nThere are also adverb clauses, which provide information about time, place, reason, condition, etc., and noun clauses.\n\nIn this case, \"whenever the mood strikes her\" seems to be an adverb clause of time, indicating when Angela takes her walks.\n\nSo, technically, a subordinate clause can be further classified into adjective, adverb, or noun clauses.\n\nBut among the given options, C. a subordinate clause is the most accurate general category for \"whenever the mood strikes her.\"\n\nOption D. an independent clause is incorrect because this clause cannot stand alone; it needs the main clause to make sense.\n\nOption A. an adjective clause doesn't fit because it's not modifying a noun or pronoun.\n\nOption B. a relative clause also doesn't fit for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. a subordinate clause.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the definitions again:\n\n- Adjective clause: modifies a noun or pronoun.\n\n- Relative clause: same as above.\n\n- Subordinate clause: cannot stand alone and is used to provide additional information in a sentence.\n\n- Independent clause: can stand alone as a sentence.\n\nGiven that, \"whenever the mood strikes her\" is indeed a subordinate clause, specifically an adverb clause of time.\n\nSo, the answer is C. a subordinate clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
