                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about energy intake and output in a healthy woman. She has a gross energy intake of 9279 kJ per day. The energy content in her faeces is 647 kJ and in her urine is 318 kJ per day. I need to find her average daily digestible energy intake and metabolisable energy intake. The options are given, but I want to understand what these terms mean and how to calculate them.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what gross energy intake refers to. I think it's the total energy consumed from food and drink before any deductions for what's lost in waste. So, that's 9279 kJ.\n\nNow, faeces are the undigested part of food that the body eliminates, and urine is waste products from metabolism. So, the energy in faeces should be the energy that wasn't digested or absorbed by the body, and the energy in urine might be from metabolic processes or breakdown of nutrients.\n\nDigestible energy intake, I believe, is the energy from food that the body can actually digest and absorb. So, if gross energy is total energy consumed, and some of that ends up in faeces undigested, then digestible energy should be gross energy minus the energy in faeces.\n\nSo, digestible energy = gross energy - energy in faeces = 9279 kJ - 647 kJ = 8632 kJ.\n\nMetabolisable energy, on the other hand, should be the energy that the body can use after accounting for both faecal and urinary energy losses. So, that would be gross energy minus energy in faeces and urine.\n\nSo, metabolisable energy = gross energy - (energy in faeces + energy in urine) = 9279 kJ - (647 kJ + 318 kJ) = 9279 kJ - 965 kJ = 8314 kJ.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 647 kJ and 318 kJ\n\nThis seems to be just the energy in faeces and urine, which doesn't make sense for digestible and metabolisable energy.\n\nB. 9279-318 kJ and 9279-647 kJ\n\nThis would be 8961 kJ and 8632 kJ, which seems incorrect because metabolisable energy should account for both faecal and urinary energy losses, not just one or the other.\n\nC. 9279+318 kJ and 9279+647 kJ\n\nAdding the energy in urine and faeces to the gross energy doesn't make sense because these are losses, not additional energy sources.\n\nD. 9279-647 kJ and 9279-(647+318) kJ\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation for digestible energy and metabolisable energy.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be D.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check the definitions.\n\nDigestible energy is indeed the energy from food that is digested and absorbed by the body, which is gross energy minus the energy lost in faeces.\n\nMetabolisable energy is the energy available to the body after accounting for both faecal and urinary energy losses, which includes the energy from digested food minus the energy lost in urine.\n\nTherefore, digestible energy = 9279 - 647 = 8632 kJ\n\nMetabolisable energy = 9279 - (647 + 318) = 9279 - 965 = 8314 kJ\n\nYes, that aligns with option D.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
