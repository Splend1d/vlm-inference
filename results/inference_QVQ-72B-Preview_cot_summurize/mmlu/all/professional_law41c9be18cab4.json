                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out what a court would decide in this situation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an owner who has two adjoining lots, and there's a building on both lots that's divided into two separate residential units, like a twin home. There's a party wall separating the two units. The front entrance is entirely on one of the lots, and there's a door through the party wall that the occupants of the adjoining residence use to get in and out.\n\nSo, the owner sells one of the lots, the one with the staircase, to a buyer, and the owner continues to live in the remaining part of the building. But the deed didn't include any reservation of a right to use the doorway. Now, there's a dispute about whether the owner can still use the entrance on the lot that was sold.\n\nI need to see what the court would most appropriately decide regarding the rights of the parties. The options are:\n\nA. The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\n\nB. The buyer can prevent access to the owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\n\nC. The court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.\n\nD. The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of the owner to use the doorway.\n\nAlright, let's consider each option.\n\nStarting with option A: an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\n\nI need to understand what an exclusive license is. A license is generally a personal right to use land, often revocable. An exclusive license might mean that only the licensee can use the property in that manner. But I'm not entirely sure about the concept of an \"exclusive license by necessity.\" Maybe it's similar to an easement by necessity, but phrased differently.\n\nEasements by necessity are implied easements that arise when a property is landlocked and there's no access to a public road unless an easement is granted over a neighboring property. But in this case, it's not about access to a public road; it's about access through a doorway in a party wall.\n\nSo, maybe the concept of an easement by necessity could be extended here, but I'm not sure if it directly applies to this situation. Perhaps the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nMoving on to option B: the buyer can prevent access to the owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\n\nWell, the deed didn't reserve a right to use the doorway, which means that technically, the buyer owns the lot with the entrance and could potentially prevent the owner from using it. However, that seems unfair because the owner needs to use that doorway to access their own residence.\n\nI think courts generally try to reach equitable solutions, especially in property disputes where one party's use depends on another's property.\n\nOption C: the court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.\n\nThis seems a bit drastic. Courts don't usually rewrite deeds or order new deeds to be drafted unless there's a clear mistake or some other compelling reason. It's more common for courts to interpret existing deeds rather than create new ones from scratch.\n\nOption D: the court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of the owner to use the doorway.\n\nAn easement is a nonpossessory interest in another's land, allowing the holder to use the land in a specified manner. Implied easements can arise in several ways, including by necessity, prior use, or severance of unity of title.\n\nIn this case, since the building was originally on both lots and was divided into two units, there might be an implied easement for the benefit of the owner to use the doorway.\n\nLet me think about the doctrine of implied easements more carefully.\n\nImplied easements by prior unity of title generally require that:\n\n1. There was a single ownership of the two properties at some point.\n\n2. During that single ownership, there was evident, continuous, and apparent use of one part for the benefit of the other.\n\n3. When the properties are severed, the use continues to be necessary for the enjoyment of the dominant tenement.\n\nIn this scenario, the two lots were originally owned by the same person, and there was a building spanning both lots with a common doorway. So, there was a unified ownership and a common structure benefiting both parts.\n\nWhen the owner sold one of the lots to the buyer, the unity of title was severed. Now, the owner needs to use the doorway on the sold lot to access their own residence.\n\nIs this use necessary for the enjoyment of the owner's remaining property? It seems so, because without access through the doorway, the owner would have to find another way to enter their residence.\n\nTherefore, it appears that an implied easement by prior unity of title might be applicable here.\n\nAdditionally, there might be an easement by necessity, similar to what's mentioned in option A, but again, that's more typically about access to public roads.\n\nGiven that, option D seems like a plausible answer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A mentions an \"exclusive license by necessity,\" which sounds similar to an easement by necessity, but perhaps with different implications. Licenses are generally more personal and revocable than easements, which are appurtenant to the land.\n\nHowever, in this context, it might be more appropriate to consider an easement, which is a property right that runs with the land, rather than a license, which is more personal and revocable.\n\nTherefore, option D seems more accurate because it refers to an implied easement created by law, which aligns better with the principles of property law regarding implied easements.\n\nOption C seems too extreme, as courts don't typically order the drafting of new deeds without clear justification.\n\nOption B suggests that the buyer can prevent access because the deed didn't reserve the right to use the doorway. While technically true, it ignores the practical realities and the principle that property divisions should not leave one party without reasonable access to their property.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate decision by the court would be to recognize an implied easement allowing the owner to use the doorway.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
