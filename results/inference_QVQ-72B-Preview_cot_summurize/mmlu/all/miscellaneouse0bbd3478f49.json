Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I know that different animals have different names for their young. For example, a baby horse is a foal, and a baby pig is a piglet. So, for a young cow, I think it's called a calf. But let me make sure.\n\nOption A is mare. I believe a mare is a female horse. So, that doesn't seem right for a young cow.\n\nOption B is lamb. I know that a lamb is a young sheep. So, that can't be it.\n\nOption C is kid. I think a kid is a young goat or sometimes a young deer. But not a young cow.\n\nOption D is calf. That sounds familiar for a young cow. Let me confirm this.\n\nI recall that in cattle farming, a calf is a young cow, regardless of gender, until about one year old. After that, they might be called heifers or steers depending on their sex and age.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident that a young cow is called a calf. So, the correct answer should be D. calf.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's quickly go through why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. mare: This is a female horse, not related to cows.\n\nB. lamb: This is a young sheep, which is a different species from cows.\n\nC. kid: Although sometimes used colloquially for various young animals, in formal terms, it refers to young goats or deer, not cows.\n\nD. calf: This is the correct term for a young cow.\n\nSo, I'm sure the answer is D. calf.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. calf}} \\]"
