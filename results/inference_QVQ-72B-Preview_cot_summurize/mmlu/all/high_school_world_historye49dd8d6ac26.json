                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we've got a quote from Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanian leader, from 1961. He's talking about the importance of African unity and how it can contribute to world peace. He mentions that a political union of African states would be a powerful example to a divided world and would help project African identity and influence. He also criticizes the lack of attention and respect African nations receive from world powers, specifically mentioning the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the United Nations' handling of the Congo crisis.\n\nThe question is asking about the inclusion of the Congo in Nkrumah's argument. We need to figure out what purpose mentioning the Congo serves in his broader point. The options are:\n\nA. Demonstrate the possibility of African unity\n\nB. Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers\n\nC. Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations\n\nD. Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand the context. The Congo, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was a Belgian colony until 1960 when it gained independence. Shortly after, it faced significant political instability and interference from external powers, including the United States and the Soviet Union, during the Cold War. The UN intervention in the Congo was aimed at maintaining order but was met with criticism for not being effective enough, especially after the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister.\n\nNow, looking back at Nkrumah's quote, he mentions \"the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy.\" He also talks about \"the callous disregard of African independence by the Great Powers.\"\n\nOption A suggests that mentioning the Congo is to demonstrate the possibility of African unity. But from the quote, it seems like Nkrumah is using the Congo as an example of what goes wrong when African nations are divided and don't have a united front. He's not necessarily demonstrating the possibility of unity but rather the consequences of disunity.\n\nOption B says it's to give an example of how African nations are neglected by world powers. Nkrumah definitely criticizes the lack of attention and respect from world powers, citing the French atomic tests and the UN's handling of the Congo crisis as evidence of this neglect.\n\nOption C proposes that it's to illustrate how developing a constitution brings order to nations. But in the quote, Nkrumah seems to be criticizing the UN for quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Congo was descending into chaos. So, it's more about the ineffectiveness of focusing on constitutional details when there's broader political instability.\n\nOption D suggests blaming European powers for Africa's difficulties. While Nkrumah does mention French atomic tests in the Sahara, which were conducted by a European power, the Congo was a former Belgian colony, and the quote doesn't directly blame European powers for all of Africa's difficulties.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B is the most accurate. Nkrumah is using the Congo as an example of how African nations are neglected by world powers. He's highlighting that even when a nation is facing severe crises, the international community, especially the powerful nations, doesn't give it the respect or attention it deserves. This fits perfectly with his broader argument about the need for African unity to command more respect on the global stage.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
