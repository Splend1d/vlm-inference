                    "text": "So I have this problem here about blackbody radiation and finding the wavelength at which the thermal spectrum reaches its maximum for a body with a surface temperature of 300 K. The Sun, with a temperature of about 6000 K, has its peak emission near 500 nm. I need to find the peak wavelength for a 300 K body. The options are different wavelengths, but they're written in a bit of a confusing way with colons and \"Pm\" and \"mm.\" I need to make sure I understand the units here.\n\nFirst, I recall that for a blackbody, the wavelength at which the emission spectrum peaks can be found using Wien's displacement law. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{b}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}\\) is the wavelength of the peak emission, \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and \\(b\\) is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nI remember that Wien's displacement constant is approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K. So, if I plug in the temperature of 300 K, I can find \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}\\).\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2.898 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m\u00b7K}}{300 \\, \\text{K}} = 9.66 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to convert this into more familiar units for wavelengths, like micrometers (\u03bcm), since the options might be in those units.\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n1 \\, \\text{\u03bcm} = 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n9.66 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} = 9.66 \\, \\text{\u03bcm}\n\\]\n\nNow, looking back at the options, they are given in a format like \"10:00 PM,\" \"100 Pm,\" \"10 mm,\" and \"100 mm.\" I suspect that the \":\" might be a typo or misplacement, and that the units are meant to be something else.\n\nLet me consider the possible units:\n\n- nm (nanometers): 1 nm = 10^-9 m\n\n- \u03bcm (micrometers): 1 \u03bcm = 10^-6 m\n\n- mm (millimeters): 1 mm = 10^-3 m\n\nGiven that the Sun's peak is around 500 nm, which is 0.5 \u03bcm, and for a cooler body like 300 K, the peak should be longer, around 9.66 \u03bcm.\n\nSo, 9.66 \u03bcm is equivalent to 9.66 x 10^-6 m, which is also 9.66 x 10^3 nm, or 0.00966 mm.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 10:00 PM\n\nThis looks like it might be 10 \u03bcm, but the \":00 PM\" seems like a formatting error. Maybe it's just \"10 \u03bcm.\"\n\nB. 100 Pm\n\nI'm not sure what \"Pm\" stands for. If it's \"pm,\" that's picometers (1 pm = 10^-12 m), but 100 pm would be 0.1 nm, which is way shorter than what we're expecting.\n\nC. 10 mm\n\n10 mm is 10 x 10^-3 m = 10^-2 m, which is much longer than our calculated value of 9.66 \u03bcm.\n\nD. 100 mm\n\n100 mm is 0.1 m, which is even longer.\n\nGiven that our calculated value is around 9.66 \u03bcm, which is 9.66 x 10^-6 m, option A seems the closest if it's intended to be 10 \u03bcm, which is 10 x 10^-6 m = 10^-5 m.\n\nHowever, that's slightly higher than our calculated value of 9.66 x 10^-6 m, but considering the options, it's the closest.\n\nOption B, if \"Pm\" is picometers, then 100 Pm would be 100 x 10^-12 m = 10^-10 m, which is much shorter than our calculated value.\n\nOption C, 10 mm, is 10 x 10^-3 m = 10^-2 m, which is much longer than our calculated value.\n\nOption D, 100 mm, is 100 x 10^-3 m = 0.1 m, which is even longer.\n\nTherefore, the only option that makes sense is A, assuming it's meant to be 10 \u03bcm.\n\nBut wait, our calculation gave us approximately 9.66 \u03bcm, and option A is 10 \u03bcm. Maybe it's a rounding difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are in different units, and I need to be careful.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation of Wien's displacement law.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{b}{T}\n\\]\n\nWith \\(b = 2.898 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m\u00b7K}\\), and \\(T = 300 \\, \\text{K}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2.898 \\times 10^{-3}}{300} = 9.66 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} = 9.66 \\, \\text{\u03bcm}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 10:00 PM\n\nThis seems like it might be a typo, perhaps intended to be \"10 \u03bcm,\" which is 10 x 10^-6 m = 10^-5 m, which is close to our calculation of 9.66 x 10^-6 m.\n\nB. 100 Pm\n\nIf \"Pm\" is picometers, then 100 Pm = 100 x 10^-12 m = 10^-10 m, which is 0.01 \u03bcm, not matching our calculation.\n\nC. 10 mm\n\n10 mm = 10 x 10^-3 m = 10^-2 m = 10,000 \u03bcm, which is way longer than our calculation.\n\nD. 100 mm\n\n100 mm = 0.1 m, which is even longer.\n\nGiven this, it seems that option A, despite the unusual formatting, is intended to represent 10 \u03bcm, which is the closest to our calculated value of approximately 9.66 \u03bcm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are in units of \"pm\" (picometers), \"\u03bcm\" (micrometers), \"mm\" (millimeters), etc., but the notation is confusing.\n\nIf option A is \"10:00 PM,\" it might be a misprint, and it was supposed to be \"10 \u03bcm.\"\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option A as the closest correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
