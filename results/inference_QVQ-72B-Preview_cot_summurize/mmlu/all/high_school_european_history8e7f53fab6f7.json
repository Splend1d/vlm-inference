It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this passage about Erasmus and his work, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It seems like Erasmus did something pretty important with this book, and Johan Huizinga, the philosopher, is praising him for it. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, Erasmus wrote this book after some misfortune at Dover, and he dedicated it to someone named Mountjoy. The book is a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings from ancient Latin authors. The idea was to help people who wanted to write in elegant Latin by giving them these sayings to ornament their style and strengthen their arguments.\n\nHuizinga mentions that earlier humanists kind of monopolized classic culture to show off their knowledge, making themselves seem like prodigies of learning, but the general public didn't benefit from that knowledge. Erasmus, on the other hand, wanted to make the classics more accessible to a wider circle of people. He loved humanity and its general culture, and he wanted to teach others about it.\n\nBut, Huizinga also points out that Erasmus wrote in Latin, which means his direct influence was limited to educated classes, mostly the upper classes, because not everyone could understand Latin. So, he wasn't reaching the entire population, just the educated few.\n\nDespite that, Erasmus made the classic spirit more current and less of an exclusive privilege. Other humanists also contributed, but Erasmus did it more extensively and effectively. Some humanists even criticized him for revealing the secrets of their craft when he published the Adagia, but Erasmus believed that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\n\nNow, the question is asking why Huizinga thinks Erasmus's legacy is more significant than that of earlier humanists. The options are:\n\nA. He had more support from the Church.\n\nB. He wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors.\n\nC. He wrote exclusively about religious matters.\n\nD. He valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had.\n\nLet me think about each option.\n\nOption A: Did Erasmus have more support from the Church than earlier humanists? The passage doesn't mention anything about church support. It focuses on his writings and their impact, not on institutional backing.\n\nOption B: He wrote in a language understandable to the masses. But wait, the passage says he wrote in Latin, which was limited to educated classes. Latin wasn't the common language of the masses; it was the language of scholars and the educated elite. So, this seems contradictory to what's in the passage.\n\nOption C: He wrote exclusively about religious matters. The passage mentions that Erasmus was a sixteenth-century Christian, but it doesn't say he wrote only about religious matters. In fact, his Adagia is about proverbial sayings from ancient Latin authors, which might not necessarily be religious.\n\nOption D: He valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had. This seems plausible. The passage says that Erasmus introduced the classic spirit among the people more extensively and effectively than others. It also says he wanted the book of antiquity to be open to all, which suggests a broader educational goal.\n\nBut, there's a caveat: He wrote in Latin, which limited his direct influence to educated classes. So, how could he be educating the masses if they couldn't read his works? Maybe his influence spread indirectly through those educated classes, who then passed on the knowledge to others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"masses\" in this context refers to the educated classes of the time, since not everyone was literate or educated enough to understand classical texts. In that case, Erasmus was making classical knowledge more accessible to a larger group of educated people compared to earlier humanists who kept it more exclusive.\n\nWait, the passage says that by writing in Latin, he limited his direct influence to educated classes, which were the upper classes. So, perhaps the \"masses\" here refers to the educated classes of his time, not the general population.\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most fitting. Erasmus valued educating the educated classes more broadly than earlier humanists did, and his work had a wider reach among them.\n\nOption A is out because there's no mention of church support.\n\nOption B is incorrect because he wrote in Latin, which was not the language of the masses.\n\nOption C is not supported by the passage, as it doesn't specify that he wrote exclusively about religious matters.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: He valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
