                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario about burglary. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nSo, the defendant was camping, got really drunk, and lost his way back to the campsite. He stumbled upon a mountain cabin, which was locked, so he broke a window to get in. He fell asleep there, woke up hungry the next morning, ate some food from the fridge, and then found a gold watch in the bedroom, which he took before leaving. He was later arrested and charged with burglary.\n\nNow, I need to find out what his strongest defense would be from the options given:\n\nA. He was drunk when he broke into the cabin.\n\nB. The crime was not completed until the morning hours.\n\nC. He did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\n\nD. The cabin was empty when he entered it.\n\nFirst, I should understand what burglary is. I think burglary is entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime inside, like theft. So, it's not just about breaking into a place, but also having the intent to do something illegal once you're inside.\n\nIn this case, the defendant broke into the cabin by breaking a window, which is an unlawful entry. Then, he ate some food and took a gold watch, which could be considered theft.\n\nBut the question is about his defense. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. He was drunk when he broke into the cabin.\n\nHmm, being drunk might affect his judgment, but does it serve as a defense for burglary? I don't think being drunk exempts someone from criminal responsibility unless it's extreme intoxication that leads to a lack of understanding of one's actions. But even then, it's a tricky defense.\n\nB. The crime was not completed until the morning hours.\n\nWell, the breaking and entering happened at night when he broke the window, but he took the watch the next morning. So, was the burglary completed at night or in the morning? Maybe the argument is that the initial entry was for shelter, not for theft, and the theft happened later. But I'm not sure how that affects the burglary charge.\n\nC. He did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\n\nThis seems important. Burglary requires intent to commit a crime inside the building at the time of the breaking and entering. If the defendant didn't have that intent when he broke in, maybe he only formed the intent to steal later, then perhaps he didn't commit burglary.\n\nWait, but he did take the watch when he left, so he did have the intent to steal at some point. But was that intent present when he broke in, or did it form later?\n\nD. The cabin was empty when he entered it.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. If the cabin was empty, does that change the nature of the crime? I think burglary can still occur even if the building is unoccupied. Plus, the cabin wasn't empty; there was food in the fridge and a watch in the bedroom.\n\nLet me think more carefully.\n\nFirst, the breaking and entering: He broke a window to get in, which is unlawful entry.\n\nSecond, the intent: At the time he broke in, was it to commit a crime inside? He was looking for shelter, not specifically to steal something. He only took the watch the next morning.\n\nSo, maybe he didn't have the intent to commit a crime when he broke in; he only formed the intent to steal later.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, burglary requires that the intent to commit a crime inside is formed at the time of the breaking and entering. If that's the case here, then the defendant's lack of intent at that specific time could be a strong defense.\n\nAlternatively, some places have broader definitions of burglary that include forming the intent to steal after entry.\n\nI need to consider the specific elements of burglary in the jurisdiction in question. But since it's a general scenario, I'll assume it follows the common law definition: unlawful entry into a building with intent to commit a felony or theft therein.\n\nIf the defendant didn't have the intent to commit a crime when he broke in, but formed it later, then perhaps he didn't commit burglary.\n\nHowever, there might be other charges, like trespassing or theft, but the specific charge here is burglary.\n\nLet me consider option C again: He did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\n\nThis seems like a solid defense. If he broke in only to seek shelter and had no plan to steal anything at that time, then he may not have had the specific intent required for burglary.\n\nOption A, being drunk, might affect his state of mind, but it's not necessarily a defense unless it can be shown that his intoxication prevented him from forming the requisite intent.\n\nOption B suggests that the crime wasn't completed until the morning, but even if that's true, the breaking and entering with intent had already occurred earlier.\n\nOption D, the cabin being empty, doesn't seem relevant because there was food and personal belongings inside.\n\nTherefore, the strongest defense appears to be that he did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
