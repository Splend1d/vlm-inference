                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What is the colored part of the eye called?\" And the options are A. iris, B. pupil, C. retina, D. cochlea. Hmm, I need to make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst off, I know that the eye has several parts, and each part has a specific function. Let's recall what each of these terms refers to.\n\nOption A is the iris. I think the iris is the colored part of the eye. It's like the curtain that controls how much light enters the eye. It comes in different colors like blue, green, brown, etc., depending on the person. So, that seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption B is the pupil. The pupil is the black circle in the center of the eye. It's the opening that allows light to pass through. It gets bigger or smaller based on how bright the light is. But it's not the colored part; the color is in the iris that surrounds it.\n\nOption C is the retina. The retina is at the back of the eye. It's like the film in a camera that captures the image. Light passes through the lens and focuses on the retina, where special cells called rods and cones detect the image and send signals to the brain. So, it's important for vision, but it's not the colored part of the eye.\n\nOption D is the cochlea. Wait a minute, the cochlea is part of the inner ear, not the eye. It's involved in hearing and balance. So, that definitely doesn't belong here.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option A, the iris, is the colored part of the eye. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nI remember that the iris is what gives our eyes their color. It has melanin, which determines the eye color based on how much is present. People with more melanin have darker eyes, like brown or black, while those with less have lighter eyes, like blue or green. So, that makes sense.\n\nThe pupil is just the opening in the iris, and it's black because it's allowing light to pass through to the retina. It doesn't have a color itself; it's more about the shape and function.\n\nThe retina is located inside the eye and isn't visible from the outside, so it doesn't contribute to the eye's color that we see.\n\nAnd the cochlea is definitely not part of the eye; it's in the ear, so that can be eliminated right away.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. iris.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other part of the eye that might be considered colored. For example, the sclera is the white part of the eye, and the cornea is clear. The lens is also clear, and the vitreous humor is the jelly-like substance that fills the back of the eye, which is also clear.\n\nSo, no, none of these other parts are colored in a way that we perceive as the color of the eye. The iris is indeed the part that determines the eye color.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is A. iris.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ iris}} \\]"
