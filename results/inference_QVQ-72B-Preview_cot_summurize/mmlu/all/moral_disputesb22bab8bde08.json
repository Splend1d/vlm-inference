                    "text": "So I'm thinking about this objection to utilitarianism, and the question is about the principle of utility being too complicated, too demanding, too easy to satisfy, or none of the above. I need to figure out which one is the common objection.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what utilitarianism is. Utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as happiness or pleasure, and minimizes disutility, like pain or suffering. So, the principle of utility is about choosing actions that produce the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nNow, the question is about a common objection to this principle. The options are:\n\nA. too complicated.\n\nB. too demanding.\n\nC. too easy to satisfy.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: too complicated.\n\nIs the principle of utility too complicated? Well, on the surface, it seems pretty straightforward: do what brings the most happiness to the most people. But, I can see how in practice, it might be complicated to apply. For example, how do you measure happiness? How do you compare the happiness of different people? And what about situations where what's best for the majority isn't best for the minority? There could be ethical dilemmas there.\n\nBut, is it too complicated? Maybe for practical application, but as a general principle, it seems understandable. Maybe this isn't the primary objection.\n\nOption B: too demanding.\n\nThis seems interesting. Utilitarianism requires that we always act in a way that maximizes overall happiness. That means we have to constantly consider the well-being of everyone affected by our actions. It's not just about following a set of rules or doing what's best for ourselves or those close to us. It's about the greater good, no matter who is involved.\n\nThis can be really demanding. For instance, if I have to choose between spending time with my family or volunteering at a shelter that helps hundreds of people, utilitarianism might suggest that helping the hundreds of people is the better use of my time. But personally, that's a tough choice. It might be too much to expect someone to always prioritize the greater good over their own interests or the interests of their loved ones.\n\nMoreover, utilitarianism doesn't consider the distribution of happiness; it's all about the total sum. So, even if one person's happiness is maximized at the expense of many others, as long as the total happiness is maximized, it's considered ethical. This can lead to scenarios that feel unjust or unfair.\n\nSo, in this sense, utilitarianism can be seen as too demanding because it requires us to always act in ways that benefit the majority, potentially at significant personal cost or even at the cost of minority rights.\n\nOption C: too easy to satisfy.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive at first glance. If the principle of utility is about maximizing happiness for the greatest number, how could that be too easy to satisfy? Wouldn't it be difficult to ensure that our actions are always leading to the greatest good for the greatest number?\n\nPerhaps someone might argue that in certain situations, it's easy to satisfy the principle of utility. For example, in cases where everyone's happiness aligns, and doing good for one person naturally leads to good for others. But, in reality, situations are often more complex, with conflicting interests and unforeseen consequences.\n\nI don't think this is a common objection to utilitarianism. In fact, one of the criticisms is that it's too difficult to apply in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of measuring and comparing utilities.\n\nOption D: none of the above.\n\nIf none of the above, that would mean that the common objection isn't about the principle being too complicated, too demanding, or too easy to satisfy. But based on my understanding, I know that there are several objections to utilitarianism, including the ones I've considered.\n\nGiven that, I think the most fitting answer is B: too demanding. This is because utilitarianism requires constant consideration of the greater good, often at the expense of personal interests or the interests of smaller groups, which can be seen as too much to ask from individuals.\n\nAdditionally, utilitarianism can lead to moral dilemmas where actions that seem intuitively wrong might be justified if they lead to a greater overall good. This can make the principle feel too demanding in terms of moral sacrifices.\n\nSo, I'll go with B. too demanding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
