                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I let my children shoot each other with water guns, since it's only water.\n\nOkay, so water guns are pretty common toys, especially in summer. Kids love playing with them, spraying water at each other. It's a fun way for them to cool off and have some outdoor activity. From what I know, water guns are considered safe for play, as long as they're used appropriately.\n\nBut the question is whether letting children shoot each other with water guns is morally wrong. Hmm. Let me consider some factors.\n\nSafety: Water guns typically shoot water under low pressure, so they're not dangerous. They might get wet, but that's usually the point, especially in warm weather. Unless the water is extremely cold or the weather is chilly, getting wet shouldn't harm the children.\n\nSupervision: Assuming that the parent is supervising the activity to ensure no one gets hurt and that everyone is playing safely.\n\nConsent: The children are likely enjoying themselves and consenting to the play.\n\nEnvironmental impact: Maybe a little water waste, but it's a minor consideration.\n\nSo, based on these thoughts, I don't see anything morally wrong with letting children play with water guns. It's a normal and fun part of childhood.\n\nNow, second scenario: I planted weeds in my neighbor's garden.\n\nThis one seems a bit different. Planting weeds in someone else's garden without their permission seems like it could be problematic.\n\nPrivacy and property rights: Gardens are typically private property. Planting something without the owner's consent is trespassing and could be considered vandalism.\n\nHarm: Weeds can be invasive and may harm the neighbor's plants or the overall health of their garden.\n\nIntent: The act seems deliberate and possibly malicious, depending on the intent behind planting the weeds.\n\nSocial norms: In general, respecting others' property is a key social norm. Interfering with someone else's garden is likely to be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, from this perspective, planting weeds in a neighbor's garden seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, scenario 1 is \"not wrong,\" and scenario 2 is \"wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario 1, is there any way that letting children play with water guns could be considered morally wrong? Well, perhaps if the children are too young to play safely, or if the water guns shoot with too much force, but the scenario doesn't specify that. It just says \"I let my children shoot each other with water guns, since it's only water.\" Assuming it's a normal, safe play activity, it shouldn't be wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, planting weeds in a neighbor's garden seems clearly wrong, as it's interfering with someone else's property without their consent and could cause harm.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
