It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Johan Huizinga and his support for Erasmus' idea that the \"book of antiquity\" should be open to all. The question is asking why Huizinga might support this view, and it gives me four options to choose from. I need to pick the one that's most likely the reason for Huizinga's support.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what's being said. Erasmus wrote a book called Adagiorum Collectanea, which is a collection of about 800 proverbial sayings from ancient Latin authors. He dedicated this work to someone named Mountjoy and wrote about how these sayings can help writers improve their style and arguments. Erasmus wanted to make these ancient wisdoms accessible to more people, not just a select few who were already well-versed in classical literature.\n\nNow, Johan Huizinga was a twentieth-century Dutch philosopher who wrote about Erasmus and his time. The quote here says that Huizinga appears to support Erasmus' belief that the \"book of antiquity\" should be open to all. The question is trying to figure out why Huizinga might hold this view.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics.\n\nB. The longevity of Erasmus' works.\n\nC. The Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus.\n\nD. The typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work.\n\nI need to think through each one.\n\nStarting with option A: the idea is that because Huizinga lived in twentieth-century Europe, and that era valued the idea of making knowledge accessible to all, he would naturally support Erasmus' view. This seems plausible. The twentieth century saw a lot of emphasis on education and accessibility, so Huizinga might align with Erasmus' desire to make ancient knowledge available to a broader audience.\n\nOption B: the longevity of Erasmus' works. This suggests that because Erasmus' works have lasted over time and are still read and appreciated, Huizinga might support his approach. But is this directly related to the specific belief that ancient knowledge should be open to all? Maybe indirectly, but it seems a bit of a stretch. Erasmus' works could be enduring for many reasons, not necessarily because of his approach to accessibility.\n\nOption C: the Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus. Since Erasmus was Dutch, and the Dutch might have a particular admiration for his contributions, Huizinga, being Dutch himself, might support Erasmus' views out of national pride or cultural heritage. This could be a factor, but it feels a bit too narrow. Just because someone is from the same country doesn't necessarily mean they'll agree with everything about a famous compatriot from the past.\n\nOption D: the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work. This seems like a generalization. Philosophers don't necessarily support each other's work blindly. In fact, philosophical traditions are often built on critique and debate. So, this seems unlikely to be the primary reason for Huizinga's support.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, option A seems the most directly relevant. Huizinga lived in a time when there was a strong push for making knowledge and education more accessible to the general public. The twentieth century saw the expansion of public education systems and a general democratization of knowledge. Given this context, it makes sense that Huizinga would support Erasmus' desire to make ancient wisdom available to all.\n\nOption B, the longevity of Erasmus' works, might be a factor in appreciating Erasmus' contributions, but it doesn't directly speak to the issue of accessibility. Erasmus' works could be enduring for their literary merit, historical importance, or other reasons unrelated to his specific goal of making knowledge more widely available.\n\nOption C, the Dutch reverence for Erasmus, could influence Huizinga's views, but it's too vague and general. It doesn't provide a specific reason why Huizinga would support this particular aspect of Erasmus' work.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason for Huizinga's support of Erasmus' belief in making the \"book of antiquity\" open to all is option A: the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should consider whether Huizinga's support is solely based on the cultural values of his time or if there's something more to it. Maybe he saw merit in Erasmus' approach beyond just the cultural context. However, the question specifies \"most likely,\" and given the options provided, option A seems the strongest.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps Huizinga admired Erasmus' humanist approach and his efforts to spread knowledge more widely, seeing it as a positive force in society. This could align with broader humanistic values that emphasize the importance of education and knowledge for all people.\n\nStill, the question is specifically about why Huizinga supports this particular view of Erasmus, and the options are limited. Based on the information given and the choices provided, option A seems the most fitting answer.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics."
