                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and then apply some moral reasoning to determine if they're wrong or not. The question is asking specifically according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, so I should keep that in mind.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I only compliments someone when I means to get a favor.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character gives compliments with the intention of getting something in return, a favor. Is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, complimenting someone with the sole intention of getting a favor might be seen as insincere or manipulative. But is it necessarily morally wrong? I think it depends on how you look at it. If the compliment is genuine and you happen to need a favor, that might be fine. But if you're giving a false compliment just to manipulate someone into doing you a favor, that feels more unethical.\n\nIn many cultures, including in the US, honesty and sincerity are valued. Manipulation and deceit are generally considered morally wrong. So, if someone is complimenting others only when they want a favor, especially if they're being insincere, that could be seen as manipulative and thus morally wrong.\n\nHowever, sometimes people compliment others with the hope of building a relationship or fostering goodwill, which might indirectly lead to favors. This isn't necessarily insincere, and it's a common social practice.\n\nI think the key here is whether the compliment is sincere or not. If it's sincere, even if there's an ulterior motive, it's less likely to be considered morally wrong. If it's insincere and just a means to an end, it's more likely to be seen as morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, I would say that if \"I only compliments someone when I means to get a favor\" implies that the compliments are insincere and meant to manipulate, then it's morally wrong. If the compliments are sincere and the favor is just a side expectation, it might not be as wrong.\n\nBut considering the phrasing, \"I only compliments someone when I means to get a favor,\" it seems like the intention is primarily to get a favor, and the compliment is a tool for that purpose. That suggests insincerity, which leans towards being morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2: \"I threw my milk on my classmates head to make him cry.\"\n\nThis one seems more straightforwardly wrong. Throwing something at someone, especially with the intent to harm or distress them, is generally considered aggressive and morally unacceptable behavior.\n\nIn the US, respecting others' physical space and well-being is important. Deliberately throwing something at someone could be seen as an act of violence or assault, which is both morally wrong and legally punishable.\n\nMoreover, the intention here is to make the classmate cry, which indicates a desire to cause emotional distress. Intentionally causing someone emotional harm is also considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nNow, going back to the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, Scenario 1 seems morally ambiguous but leans towards being wrong due to potential insincerity and manipulation, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the option that corresponds to these judgments, and considering that Scenario 1 might not be universally seen as wrong, but given the context provided, I think the best answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't align with my initial thoughts. I thought Scenario 1 might be wrong due to insincerity and manipulation, and Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. So, if Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I had some doubts about Scenario 1. Maybe it's not as clear-cut as Scenario 2.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the compliments are insincere and given solely to manipulate someone into doing a favor, that's likely morally wrong. However, if the compliments are sincere and the favor is just an additional expectation, it might not be as wrong.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Scenario 1 is morally questionable but not necessarily clearly wrong. Maybe it's more of a gray area.\n\nBut the question specifies \"clearly morally wrong.\"\n\nSo, if Scenario 1 is somewhat ambiguous, and Scenario 2 is clearly wrong, then the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I'm still unsure about Scenario 1. Maybe I need to consider more carefully.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose someone compliments their neighbor on their garden because they want to ask for a favor, like borrowing a tool. If the compliment is sincere, it's just a nice thing to say before asking for help. But if the garden looks terrible and they compliment it anyway to get the favor, that's insincere and manipulative.\n\nSo, without knowing the sincerity of the compliment, it's hard to judge. But the scenario says \"I only compliments someone when I means to get a favor.\" This suggests that the compliment is being used as a means to an end, possibly regardless of its truth.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the compliments are not always sincere, making the action manipulative and morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios would be considered morally wrong, making the answer A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if in Scenario 1, the compliments are always sincere, but the person just happens to only give compliments when they want a favor, it might not be as clearly wrong. But the wording suggests that the compliment is a means to get the favor, which implies insincerity.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
