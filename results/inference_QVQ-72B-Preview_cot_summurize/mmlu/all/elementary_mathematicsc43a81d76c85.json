                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here. A baker made 232 muffins. He sent 190 of them to a local hotel. The rest he wants to put in boxes, and each box can hold 6 muffins. I need to find out which equation to use to find out how many boxes he will need. The options are:\n\nA. (232 - 190)/6 = b\n\nB. (232 + 190) \u00d7 6 = b\n\nC. (232 - 190) \u00d7 6 = b\n\nD. (232 + 190)/6 = b\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to figure out how many muffins are left after sending 190 to the hotel. So, total muffins are 232, and he sent 190 to the hotel. That means left muffins are 232 minus 190.\n\nLet me calculate that: 232 - 190 = 42 muffins left.\n\nNow, each box can hold 6 muffins. So, to find out how many boxes he needs, I need to divide the remaining muffins by the number each box can hold.\n\nSo, 42 divided by 6 equals... let's see, 6 times 7 is 42, so that's 7 boxes.\n\nBut let's look at the options again to make sure.\n\nOption A: (232 - 190)/6 = b\n\nThat's exactly what I did: subtract 190 from 232 to get 42, then divide by 6 to get 7. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: (232 + 190) \u00d7 6 = b\n\nWait, adding 232 and 190 would give me the total muffins made and sent, which is 422, then multiplying by 6 gives 2532. That doesn't make sense in this context. Why would he need 2532 boxes? No, that can't be right.\n\nOption C: (232 - 190) \u00d7 6 = b\n\nSo, 232 - 190 is 42, then multiplying by 6 gives 252. But that would mean he needs 252 boxes for the remaining 42 muffins. That doesn't seem logical because if each box holds 6 muffins, 7 boxes should hold 42 muffins, as calculated in option A.\n\nOption D: (232 + 190)/6 = b\n\nAdding 232 and 190 gives 422, then dividing by 6 gives approximately 70.333. Again, that doesn't make sense because we already determined he only needs 7 boxes for the remaining muffins.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the correct equation to use.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n1. Total muffins made: 232\n\n2. Muffins sent to the hotel: 190\n\n3. Muffins left: 232 - 190 = 42\n\n4. Each box holds: 6 muffins\n\n5. Number of boxes needed: 42 / 6 = 7\n\nYes, that matches with option A.\n\nBut let's see why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption B: (232 + 190) \u00d7 6 = b\n\nAdding 232 and 190 gives 422, then multiplying by 6 gives 2532. This would suggest he needs 2532 boxes for the total muffins made and sent, which doesn't make sense because those muffins are already sent or kept.\n\nOption C: (232 - 190) \u00d7 6 = b\n\nThis multiplies the remaining muffins by 6, which would give the total number of muffins that could be boxed, not the number of boxes needed.\n\nOption D: (232 + 190)/6 = b\n\nThis adds the total muffins made and sent, then divides by 6, which again doesn't relate directly to the number of boxes needed for the remaining muffins.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is indeed option A: (232 - 190)/6 = b\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
