                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What high school does the gang from the 'Archie' comic strip attend? A. Ridgemont High, B. Riverdale High, C. Rumson High, D. Riker's Island High.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm pretty sure I've heard of Archie before, but I can't remember which school they go to.\n\nFirst off, I know that Archie is a comic strip that's been around for a long time. It features characters like Archie, Betty, Veronica, and Jughead. They're all teenagers, and their lives revolve around high school, relationships, and typical teen dramas. But what's the name of their school?\n\nLet me think about this. I think the setting of the comic is a place called Riverdale. Maybe the school is Riverdale High? That sounds familiar. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is Ridgemont High. I've heard of Ridgemont High from the movie \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\" but I don't think that's related to Archie. So, maybe not that one.\n\nOption B is Riverdale High. That really sounds like it fits with the Archie comics. I think I recall that the town they live in is Riverdale, so it makes sense that the school would be Riverdale High.\n\nOption C is Rumson High. I don't remember that from the Archie comics. Maybe it's another comic or TV show. Doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D is Riker's Island High. Riker's Island is actually a real place in New York City, known for its prison. That doesn't sound like the setting for a high school comic strip. So, probably not that one.\n\nBased on my recollection and the process of elimination, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is Riverdale High. It just fits with the overall theme and setting of the Archie comics.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check this. Maybe I can think of something that confirms it. I know that the Archie comics have been adapted into a TV show called \"Riverdale,\" which is a darker take on the original stories. So, if the TV show is named after the town, it's likely that the school in the comics is also named after the town.\n\nAdditionally, I remember that in the comics, there are locations like Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe and the Riverdale Drive-In. So, again, that points to Riverdale being the setting.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that the school has a different name. Maybe there's another school in the comics? I think there's a mention of another school called Riverton or something, but I don't think that's the main school where Archie and his friends attend.\n\nNo, I don't think so. I believe Riverdale High is the primary school in the comics. Plus, the other options don't seem to fit. Ridgemont High is associated with a different franchise, Rumson High doesn't ring a bell in relation to Archie, and Riker's Island High is just not plausible given the context.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is Riverdale High. That's the high school where Archie and his friends attend in the comic strip.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Riverdale High}} \\]"
