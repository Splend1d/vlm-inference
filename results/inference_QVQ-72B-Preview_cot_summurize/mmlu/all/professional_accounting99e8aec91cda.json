                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Elan Co. with two employees, each getting two weeks of paid vacation annually. Vacation rights accumulate, which means if an employee doesn't take their vacation in one year, they can use it in the next year. That's important.\n\nFirst employee earns $600 per week and took a two-week vacation during the year. Since they took exactly what they earned for that year, I think their vacation liability is zero for that year. But let's confirm.\n\nSecond employee earns $800 per week and took no vacation during the year. So, their vacation liability should be the accumulated vacation they didn't take.\n\nNow, in financial statements, liability would be the amount the company owes for unused vacation time, and expense would be the cost associated with the vacations taken or accrued.\n\nLet me try to calculate the liability and expense for each employee separately, then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the first employee:\n\n- Weekly salary: $600\n\n- Vacation taken: 2 weeks\n\n- Since they took exactly what they were entitled to for that year, there's no excess or deficit. So, no liability for this employee.\n\n- Expense would be the cost of the vacation they took, which is 2 weeks * $600 = $1,200.\n\nNow, the second employee:\n\n- Weekly salary: $800\n\n- Vacation taken: 0 weeks\n\n- They didn't take any vacation, but they've accumulated 2 weeks of vacation entitlement.\n\n- Liability would be the cost of those 2 weeks, which is 2 * $800 = $1,600.\n\n- Expense for this employee would be the cost of the vacation they were entitled to for the year, which is also $1,600, even though they didn't take it.\n\nWait a minute, does the expense include the accrued vacation?\n\nI think so, because the company has to set aside money for future vacation pay, which is an expense in the current period even if the vacation isn't taken yet.\n\nBut let's double-check that.\n\nIn accounting, when employees accrue vacation time, the company should record an expense and a corresponding liability for the estimated cost of the vacation pay.\n\nSo, for the second employee, they've accrued 2 weeks, so expense is $1,600, and liability is also $1,600.\n\nNow, for the first employee, since they took exactly what they earned, there's no accrued liability, but the company still had to expense the vacation pay they provided.\n\nSo, total expense for both employees would be $1,200 (first employee's vacation) plus $1,600 (second employee's accrued vacation), totaling $2,800.\n\nTotal liability would be $1,600 (second employee's accrued vacation), and no liability for the first employee since they took their vacation.\n\nWait, but in option B, liability is $1,600 and expense is $2,800, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let's see why other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A: liability $1,600 and expense $1,200. This seems to only account for the second employee's accrued vacation and perhaps the first employee's vacation expense, but it doesn't include the second employee's accrued vacation in the expense.\n\nOption C: liability $0 and expense $1,200. This seems to ignore the second employee's accrued vacation entirely.\n\nOption D: liability $0 and expense $2,800. This seems to only consider the expense without recognizing the liability for the accrued vacation.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure about the expense part. In accounting, when an employee takes a vacation, that's an expense. When they accrue vacation time, that's also an expense recognized in the income statement, with a corresponding liability on the balance sheet.\n\nSo, total expense is the sum of the vacation taken and the vacation accrued.\n\nTherefore, first employee's vacation taken expense: $1,200.\n\nSecond employee's accrued vacation expense: $1,600.\n\nTotal expense: $2,800.\n\nLiability: $1,600 (the accrued vacation that hasn't been taken).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI think the answer is B. $1,600 liability and $2,800 expense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
