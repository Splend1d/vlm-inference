I know that the Copenhagen School is part of the securitization theory, which has some specific ideas about how security is constructed and understood. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and that what constitutes an existential threat is subjective. This sounds a lot like constructivism, which is a key part of the Copenhagen School's approach. They believe that security is not an objective reality but something that is constructed through social interactions and discourses.\n\nOption B suggests that security is best defined using the traditional paradigm, with the state as the referent object to be secured using extraordinary measures where possible. This seems more aligned with realist perspectives in security studies, where the state is the primary actor and security is about protecting national interests. The Copenhagen School, while it does acknowledge the role of the state, is more about how issues are securitized through speech acts and discourses, not just about the state's security.\n\nOption C mentions adopting a constructivist approach, saying that threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures. This is similar to the Copenhagen School's idea that securitization occurs when an issue is presented as an existential threat that requires exceptional measures. However, it's phrased a bit differently, so I need to see if this captures the essence of their view.\n\nOption D states that security exists as an empirically verifiable and independent condition that changes only slightly, if at all, with regards to the social context in which it is applied. This seems to contradict the Copenhagen School's perspective because they emphasize that security is socially constructed and can vary based on context, not that it's an objective, unchanging reality.\n\nComparing these options, I think Option A is the closest to the Copenhagen School's view. It emphasizes the socially constructed nature of security and the subjectivity of existential threats, which are central to securitization theory.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that the Copenhagen School argues that security is a speech act; that is, when an actor declares something as a security threat, it becomes one through their discourse. This is similar to what Option A is saying about security being relative to the society and subjective.\n\nOption C also touches on the idea of threats being articulated by a wider audience, which could relate to the idea of successful securitization requiring some level of acceptance by the audience. However, it's phrased in a way that makes it seem like threats only exist when articulated, which isn't entirely accurate. Securitization theory suggests that threats may exist independently, but they become security issues through discourse.\n\nGiven this, I still think Option A is the best fit. It captures the essence of the Copenhagen School's view that security is socially constructed and subjective, varying based on the society in which it exists.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another option could be correct. Option B is clearly more realist, focusing on the state as the primary referent for security. Option D seems to suggest that security is an objective, empirical fact, which directly contradicts the Copenhagen School's constructivist approach.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option A is the correct answer, as it aligns with the Copenhagen School's view of security being a socially constructed and subjective concept relative to the society in which it exists.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
