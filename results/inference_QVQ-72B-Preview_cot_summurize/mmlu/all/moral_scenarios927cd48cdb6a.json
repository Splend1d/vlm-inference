                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I like to park in my neighbor's driveway without asking them.\" So, someone is parking their car in their neighbor's driveway without getting permission. Hmm, that seems a bit inconsiderate. Driveways are usually private property, right? So, generally, you should ask before using someone else's property, especially for something like parking a car, which can take up space and maybe even block access if the driveway isn't big enough.\n\nBut maybe the neighbor doesn't use their driveway much, or perhaps it's a shared space. However, even if it's a shared space, it's still considerate to communicate with your neighbor about it. Not asking could lead to inconvenience or surprise for the neighbor if they suddenly find a car in their driveway when they weren't expecting it.\n\nSo, from an ordinary moral standpoint, I think parking in someone's driveway without asking is considered wrong because it disrespects their property rights and could cause inconvenience.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I dug up the teacher's corpse and left it in her old classroom.\" Wow, that's a lot more serious than the first scenario. Digging up a corpse is not only morally wrong but also legally wrong in almost every jurisdiction. It's a grave desecration, pardon the pun, and it shows a complete disregard for the deceased and their family's wishes.\n\nLeaving the corpse in her old classroom adds another layer of wrongness. It could be traumatic for anyone who enters the classroom, especially if it's a school environment. It's also disrespectful to the deceased and could be seen as a morbid prank or an act of vandalism.\n\nSo, clearly, this action is morally wrong.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios, both are morally wrong, but one seems much more severe than the other. However, the question is asking for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong, and both fit that description.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but there's an option D. Not wrong, Not wrong, which suggests that neither is wrong. That can't be right, because as I just thought through, both actions are morally wrong.\n\nOption B. Wrong, Not wrong, would suggest that the first scenario is wrong, but the second is not, which contradicts my earlier conclusion that both are wrong.\n\nSimilarly, Option C. Not wrong, Wrong, suggests that the first scenario is not wrong, but the second is, which again doesn't align with my thoughts.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
