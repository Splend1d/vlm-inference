                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a buyer who bought a gallon of nonfat milk, and when they poured a glass and took a sip, they found a dead mouse in it. Yuck, that's gross. Now, the buyer is thinking about suing the dairy for negligent manufacturing. The question is asking what most likely will happen if the buyer asserts this claim.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Recover, because he suffered severe emotional distress.\n\nB. Recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\n\nC. Not recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\n\nD. Not recover, because the buyer's proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, what is negligent manufacturing? It's when a manufacturer fails to exercise reasonable care in the design, manufacture, inspection, or labeling of its products, leading to harm to consumers.\n\nIn this case, the dairy is being accused of negligent manufacturing because a mouse ended up in the milk container. That sounds like a pretty serious lapse in hygiene and quality control.\n\nNow, the buyer didn't suffer any physical illness or injury from this incident, just severe emotional distress. So, the harm here is primarily psychological.\n\nOption A says the buyer will recover because of severe emotional distress. But is that enough in a negligent manufacturing claim?\n\nI remember that in product liability cases, typically, there needs to be some physical harm or defect in the product that causes injury. But sometimes, emotional distress can be compensated if it's severe enough and directly caused by the negligence.\n\nOption B mentions res ipsa loquitur. That's a legal doctrine that allows for the inference of negligence in certain circumstances where the defendant had exclusive control over the instrumentality that caused the injury, and the injury wouldn't have occurred without negligence.\n\nIn this case, the mouse ended up in the milk container, which was sealed and hadn't been tampered with by the buyer. So, it's likely that the mouse got into the milk during the manufacturing or packaging process. That seems like something that wouldn't happen without some negligence, right?\n\nSo, res ipsa loquitur might apply here, allowing the buyer to argue that the dairy was negligent because such an incident wouldn't occur without negligence.\n\nOption C says the buyer won't recover because the negligence only caused mental disturbance. But I think that's not necessarily the case. In many jurisdictions, emotional distress can be compensated if it's severe and directly caused by the defendant's negligence.\n\nOption D says the buyer won't recover because the proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress. But in this scenario, it seems like it was an accident, not intentional. The dairy probably didn't mean to put a mouse in the milk.\n\nSo, between options A and B, I'm leaning towards B because res ipsa loquitur seems particularly relevant here. The fact that a mouse ended up in the milk suggests that something went wrong in the dairy's manufacturing process, and the buyer shouldn't have to prove exactly what the negligence was since it's something outside their control.\n\nPlus, since there was no physical injury, relying on res ipsa loquitur might help establish the negligence more easily, and then the emotional distress can be compensated as a result of that negligence.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely answer is B: recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check. In product liability law, can emotional distress be compensated without physical injury?\n\nI recall that in some cases, especially food contamination cases, courts have allowed recovery for emotional distress even without physical injury, especially if the contamination could have caused physical harm.\n\nFor example, if someone finds a foreign object in their food, even if they didn't eat it, they might still be able to recover for the shock and fear they experienced.\n\nIn this case, the buyer did ingest part of the mouse before realizing what it was, which could be considered a physical injury, albeit minor.\n\nWait, the problem says the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth and then spat it out. So, did he ingest any part of the mouse? If he did, that could be considered a physical invasion and might make it easier to recover for emotional distress.\n\nAssuming that, then, yes, there was a physical invasion, and combined with the severe emotional distress, the buyer should be able to recover under a negligent manufacturing claim, possibly aided by the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\n\nSo, my final answer is B: recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
