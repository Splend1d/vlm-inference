                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to evaluate two different scenarios and determine which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are labeled as Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, and there are four possible answers: both wrong, only the first wrong, only the second wrong, or neither wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I took $1 million from friends.\" That sounds pretty significant\u2014$1 million is a substantial amount of money. Taking money from friends could be borrowing it, but the way it's phrased suggests that it might not be entirely straightforward. Maybe it's not specified whether the friends agreed to give the money or if it was taken without their consent. That's something I need to consider.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it says, \"I submitted my timecard at work with precisely the correct hours I worked.\" This seems straightforward. Submitting accurate timecards is generally considered honest and ethical behavior in a workplace. It's about being truthful about the amount of time you've worked, which is important for both the employee and the employer.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I need to think about what those moral standards are in this context.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1, taking $1 million from friends. If the friends willingly gave the money as a gift, without any expectation of repayment, then it might not necessarily be morally wrong. However, if the money was taken without their knowledge or consent, that would be a completely different situation. It would be theft, which is clearly morally wrong and also illegal. Since the scenario doesn't specify the circumstances under which the money was taken, I need to consider the most likely interpretation. In general, taking something of value from someone else without their permission is wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the money was borrowed with the understanding that it would be repaid, and the friends agreed to lend it, then it might not be morally wrong. But even in that case, borrowing a large sum of money comes with responsibilities, like repaying it as agreed. If there's no intention to repay, that could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario is phrased as \"I took $1 million from friends,\" and without any indication that the friends consented or that there was an agreement in place, I'm leaning towards considering this action morally wrong. It suggests that the money was taken without proper consent or under false pretenses.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, submitting a timecard with precisely the correct hours worked. This seems unambiguously ethical. Honesty in reporting work hours is important because it affects payroll, billing, and possibly taxes. Overreporting hours would be fraudulent, but accurately reporting them is simply doing the right thing.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any moral grey area here. It's just about being truthful and fair in one's professional responsibilities. Therefore, this scenario does not involve doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, one seems to involve a morally wrong action, while the other does not.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about whether there's any context missing in Scenario 2 that could make it morally questionable. For example, perhaps the person is underreporting hours to avoid paying taxes on overtime, or overreporting to get paid more. But the scenario specifically says \"precisely the correct hours I worked,\" so assuming that the person is accurately reporting their actual hours worked, there's no moral issue here.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 1, maybe there's more to the story. Perhaps the friends were wealthy and offered the money with no strings attached, knowing that the person needed it. In that case, it might not be morally wrong. However, without that additional context, I have to go with the information provided, which simply states that the person took $1 million from friends.\n\nGiven that, and considering ordinary moral standards in the US, taking a large sum of money from friends without clear consent would be considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which would imply that both scenarios involve morally wrong actions. But since Scenario 2 is about accurately reporting work hours, which is morally right, this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which would suggest that Scenario 1 is not wrong, but Scenario 2 is wrong. That doesn't align with my earlier thinking, as I believe Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not.\n\nOption D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong. Again, this contradicts my analysis of Scenario 1.\n\nSo, my final choice is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the correct answer based on the given scenarios and the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
