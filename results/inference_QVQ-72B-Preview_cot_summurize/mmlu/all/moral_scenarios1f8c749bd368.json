                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario. There are two situations presented:\n\nScenario 1: \"I cut the bar patron off because he had to drive home.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I keep the corpses in the garage because they would really stink up the house.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is at a bar, and the bartender decides to stop serving them alcohol because they have to drive home. In Scenario 2, someone is keeping corpses in their garage to prevent the house from smelling bad.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the bartender is cutting off a patron who has to drive home. From what I understand, responsible bartending includes not over-serving alcohol to customers, especially if they're planning to drive. This is not only a moral consideration but also a legal one. In many places in the US, bartenders can be held liable if they serve someone who is clearly intoxicated and that person causes harm while driving.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the bartender is actually doing the right thing by cutting off the patron who has to drive home. It's a responsible action that prioritizes safety and prevents potential drunk driving.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 1, the action is not morally wrong; in fact, it's morally right.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone is keeping corpses in their garage to avoid the house smelling bad. This seems extremely unusual and raises several red flags.\n\nFirst off, having corpses in one's possession is highly unusual unless you're a funeral director or involved in some professional capacity that allows for it. Keeping corpses at home is generally against the law and considered morally reprehensible.\n\nMoreover, corpses do decompose and can cause health hazards, not to mention the ethical issues involved in mishandling human remains.\n\nSo, in this scenario, keeping corpses in the garage is clearly morally wrong, and likely legally wrong as well.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, the action is morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong (morally right)\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong (morally wrong)\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any chance that cutting off the patron could be considered morally wrong? Maybe if the patron was upset or something, but no, the reason given is to prevent them from driving drunk, which is a noble and responsible action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, keeping corpses in the garage is definitely morally wrong, as it's disrespectful to the deceased and poses health risks.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
