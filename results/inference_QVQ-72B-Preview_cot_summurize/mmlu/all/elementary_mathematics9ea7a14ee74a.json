Hmm, I think I know the answer, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything here.\n\nFirst off, I know that a decade is a period of 10 years. Like, the 1980s were a decade, right? And that's from 1980 to 1989, which is 10 years. So, that seems straightforward. But let me think about it a bit more to be certain.\n\nI recall that the prefix \"deca-\" in Greek means ten, like in decathlon, which has ten events, or a decagon has ten sides. So, that reinforces the idea that a decade is 10 years. Maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret \"decade.\"\n\nWait a minute, sometimes people might think of a decade as starting from a year ending in zero, like 2000 to 2009, which is 10 years, or 2010 to 2019, also 10 years. But I've heard some debates about whether a decade includes the year that ends in zero or not. For example, does the 20th century start in 1900 or 1901? But in terms of counting the years in a decade, it's still 10 years either way.\n\nLet me consider the definition of a decade. In general usage, a decade is indeed a period of 10 years. So, regardless of how you slice it, the count should be 10 years. Maybe to be extra sure, I can list them out. If I take the 1990s, that would be 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. That's 10 years. Similarly, the 2000s would be 2000 to 2009, which is also 10 years.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The question is pretty clear: how many years are there in a decade? And the answer is B. 10. It's not A. 5, because that's half a decade, sometimes called a quinquennium. And it's not C. 15 or D. 20, which would be one and a half or two decades, respectively.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check online or in a dictionary to confirm. Let's see, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, a decade is \"a period of ten years, especially one that begins with a year ending in 0 and ends with the preceding year ending in 9.\" So, that confirms it's 10 years.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the word's etymology. \"Decade\" comes from the Greek \"dekas,\" meaning a group of ten, and it was later adopted by the French as \"d\u00e9cade.\" So, again, the root points to ten years.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
