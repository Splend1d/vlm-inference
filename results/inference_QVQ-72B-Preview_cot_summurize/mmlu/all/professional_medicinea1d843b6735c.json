Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer.

The study is retrospective, which means it looks back at data that's already been collected. There are 600 people in total with a specific disease: 200 took Drug X and 400 did not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what relative risk means. Relative risk compares the risk of a health event, like death from cancer, in one group to another group. It's calculated as the risk in the exposed group divided by the risk in the unexposed group.\n\nSo, in this case, the exposed group is the one that took Drug X, and the unexposed group is the one that didn't take the drug.\n\nLet me gather the data:\n\n- Total participants: 600\n\n- Took Drug X: 200\n\n- Did not take Drug X: 400\n\n- Died of cancer in Drug X group: 100\n\n- Died of cancer in no drug group: 100\n\nFirst, I need to find the risk of dying from cancer in the Drug X group and in the no drug group.\n\nRisk is usually calculated as the number of events (deaths from cancer) divided by the number of people in the group.\n\nSo, for the Drug X group:\n\nRisk = number of deaths / number of people taking Drug X = 100 / 200 = 0.5 or 50%\n\nFor the no drug group:\n\nRisk = number of deaths / number of people not taking Drug X = 100 / 400 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nNow, relative risk (RR) is the risk in the exposed group divided by the risk in the unexposed group.\n\nSo, RR = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2\n\nThat means individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer compared to those who do not take the drug.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Equal risk (RR=1)\n\nB. Four times the risk (RR=4)\n\nC. Three times the risk (RR=3)\n\nD. Two times the risk (RR=2)\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the answer should be D. Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might calculate odds ratios instead of relative risks, but the question specifically asks for relative risk, so I should make sure I'm not confusing the two.\n\nOdds ratio is different from relative risk, and in some cases, especially in retrospective studies, odds ratios are used more frequently. However, the question here explicitly asks for relative risk, so I should stick with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether this is a cohort study or a case-control study. Since it's a retrospective review of a trial, it's likely a cohort study, where we follow groups that did or did not receive the drug and see the outcomes.\n\nIn a cohort study, relative risk is indeed the measure of choice.\n\nSo, I think I'm on the right track.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me plug in the numbers again.\n\nDrug X group:\n\n- 200 people\n\n- 100 deaths from cancer\n\n- Risk = 100/200 = 0.5\n\nNo drug group:\n\n- 400 people\n\n- 100 deaths from cancer\n\n- Risk = 100/400 = 0.25\n\nRelative risk = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this calculation, so I'm confident that the correct answer is D. Two times the risk.\n\nBut to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the data.\n\nIs there any possibility of confounding variables? For example, maybe people who took Drug X were older or had other risk factors that could increase their risk of dying from cancer.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we don't have data on other variables like age, lifestyle, or other medications. So, based on the given data, we have to assume that the only difference between the groups is whether they took Drug X or not.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, researchers would adjust for potential confounders to get a more accurate relative risk. But since that information isn't provided here, I think it's safe to proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the total number of deaths in each group. Both groups have 100 deaths from cancer, which seems straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, both groups have the same number of deaths, but the no drug group is larger, so their risk is lower, as calculated.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\n- Risk in Drug X group: 50%\n\n- Risk in no drug group: 25%\n\n- Relative risk: 50%/25% = 2\n\nTherefore, individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer compared to those who do not take the drug.\n\nThe answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
