                    "text": "So I've got this question here about how Islam spread to the kingdom of Mali. The options are:\n\nA. Muslim missionaries who came from Southern Africa.\n\nB. Trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara.\n\nC. Berber armies who conquered the former kingdom of Ghana.\n\nD. Pressure from Christian Ethiopia caused the king of Mali to seek Muslim allies.\n\nAnd there's this excerpt from Al-Zawawi, which talks about Sultan Musa of Mali and some details about his kingdom, like mining copper and trading it for gold, and mentioning pagan nations within his kingdom who extract gold.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand the context of Mali in the 14th century. Mali was a West African empire that controlled major trading routes across the Sahara Desert. It was known for its wealth, especially in gold and salt.\n\nNow, the question is about the spread of Islam to Mali. Islam originated in the Arabian Peninsula and spread through various means, including trade, conquest, and missionary work.\n\nOption A suggests Muslim missionaries came from Southern Africa. Hmm, I thought Islam mostly spread northward into Africa via the Mediterranean and eastward through the Arabian Peninsula and into India and Southeast Asia. I'm not sure about Southern Africa being a primary source of Muslim missionaries for Mali. Maybe not the most likely option.\n\nOption B mentions trade contacts from the north across the Sahara. This seems plausible. The trans-Saharan trade routes connected North Africa, which was predominantly Muslim, with West Africa. Goods like salt from the north and gold from the south were traded, and along with goods, ideas and religions could spread. So, perhaps Islam came to Mali through merchants and traders who were Muslim.\n\nOption C talks about Berber armies conquering the former kingdom of Ghana. Berbers are an ethnic group from North Africa, and they did play a role in the spread of Islam through North Africa and into West Africa. The kingdom of Ghana predates Mali and was located nearby. If Berber armies conquered Ghana and introduced Islam there, it's possible that Mali, being a neighboring kingdom, was influenced by Ghana's conversion to Islam.\n\nOption D mentions pressure from Christian Ethiopia leading the king of Mali to seek Muslim allies. Ethiopia was indeed Christian during this period, and there were likely interactions between Mali and Ethiopia. However, I'm not sure about the specifics of their relationship or whether this pressure would have led to the spread of Islam in Mali.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The excerpt provided talks about Sultan Musa, who was famous for his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324, which showcased Mali's wealth and his Islamic faith to the wider world. So, Islam was already established in Mali by the 14th century.\n\nBut the question is asking about what best accounts for the spread of Islam to Mali. Given that Musa was a Muslim ruler, it's likely that Islam was adopted at the royal level, which would have facilitated its spread throughout the kingdom.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\n- A: Muslim missionaries from Southern Africa \u2013 seems less likely, as Islam's spread into Africa was primarily from the north and east.\n\n- B: Trade contacts from the north across the Sahara \u2013 this is a strong possibility, given the extensive trade networks that connected North Africa and West Africa, facilitating the spread of Islam through merchants and traders.\n\n- C: Berber armies conquering Ghana \u2013 while Berbers did play a role in spreading Islam through conquest, the kingdom of Ghana was already in decline by the time Mali rose to power. It's possible that Mali was influenced by Ghana's conversion to Islam, but I need to verify that.\n\n- D: Pressure from Christian Ethiopia leading Mali to seek Muslim allies \u2013 this seems a bit of a stretch, as Mali was primarily concerned with its western and northern neighbors, not necessarily with Ethiopia, which is located to the east and was more isolated from West Africa at that time.\n\nGiven this, option B seems the most plausible. Trade across the Sahara was a major vector for the spread of Islam into West Africa. Merchants and traders from North Africa, many of whom were Muslim, interacted with West African societies, including Mali, and over time, Islam spread through these commercial interactions.\n\nMoreover, the Mali empire was known for its openness to Islamic learning and culture, and many of its rulers, including Musa, were Muslim. They encouraged the spread of Islam within their realm, building mosques and inviting Muslim scholars to their courts.\n\nSo, while conquest and missionary work may have played some role, the primary channel for the spread of Islam to Mali was likely through trade relations with North Africa.\n\nWait a minute, the excerpt mentions \"pagan nations\" in Mali's kingdom who extract gold and don't pay jizya, which is a tax levied on non-Muslims in Islamic states. This suggests that Mali had a policy of tolerance towards non-Muslims, possibly to maintain stability and continue benefiting from their labor and trade.\n\nThis further supports the idea that Islam spread gradually in Mali, possibly through peaceful means like trade and cultural exchange, rather than through forced conversion or conquest.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option B: trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
