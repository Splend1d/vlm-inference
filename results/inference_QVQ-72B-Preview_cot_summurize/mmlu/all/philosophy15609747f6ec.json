The options are:\n\nA. easily procured.\n\nB. attainable for everyone, but only through great effort.\n\nC. available only to the rich.\n\nD. available only to the gods.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Epicurus was and what his philosophy entailed. Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who founded a school of philosophy called Epicureanism. His philosophy emphasized happiness as the primary goal of life, and he believed that happiness came from the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain.\n\nBut it's important to note that for Epicurus, not all pleasures were equal. He distinguished between physical and mental pleasures, and he valued mental pleasures higher because they were more lasting and less troubled by pain. So, in his view, the highest form of happiness was a state of tranquility and freedom from fear and bodily pain.\n\nNow, considering his views on happiness and pleasure, let's think about how he would view wealth in relation to achieving a good life.\n\nOption A says that the wealth required for a good life is easily procured. If Epicurus believed that minimal material needs were necessary for happiness and that excessive wealth could lead to unnecessary desires and pains, then perhaps he would think that the wealth needed for a good life is not too difficult to obtain. After all, his philosophy promotes a simple life free from excessive desires.\n\nOption B suggests that the wealth needed for a good life is attainable for everyone but only through great effort. This might contradict Epicurus's idea that a simple life with few possessions is sufficient for happiness. If wealth requires a lot of effort to attain, and that effort causes stress and pain, then it might not align with his philosophy of minimizing pain.\n\nOption C states that the wealth required for a good life is available only to the rich. This seems at odds with Epicurus's teachings, as he advocated for a life of modesty and simplicity, suggesting that true happiness is within reach of everyone, regardless of their wealth.\n\nOption D claims that the wealth required for a good life is available only to the gods. This also doesn't seem to align with Epicurus's philosophy, as he was known for his materialist view of the universe and his belief in the importance of living well in this life, rather than focusing on divine intervention or afterlife.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems the most plausible. Epicurus likely believed that the wealth necessary for a good life is not excessive and, therefore, easily procured. His philosophy emphasizes contentment with what one has and the avoidance of unnecessary desires that could lead to unhappiness.\n\nMoreover, Epicurus taught that friendship, freedom, and an active mind were crucial for happiness. These are not dependent on great wealth but rather on one's choices and relationships.\n\nIn summary, based on Epicurus's philosophy of simple living and the pursuit of modest pleasures, it's reasonable to conclude that he would view the wealth required for a good life as easily procured.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
