                    "text": "So I have this question about the limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume for a gas-phase diatomic molecule. The options are 1.5R, 2R, 2.5R, and 3.5R. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what molar heat capacity at constant volume (C_V) represents. It's the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree Celsius, while keeping the volume constant. For ideal gases, C_V depends on the degrees of freedom of the molecules.\n\nNow, for a diatomic molecule, like nitrogen or oxygen, there are more degrees of freedom compared to a monatomic gas like helium. Let's think about the different types of molecular motion that contribute to these degrees of freedom.\n\nAt low temperatures, only translational motion is active. As temperature increases, rotational motion becomes excited, and at even higher temperatures, vibrational motion can be excited as well. Each of these motions contributes to the molar heat capacity.\n\nFor a diatomic molecule at high temperatures, all these modes are active. So, we need to account for translational, rotational, and vibrational degrees of freedom.\n\nLet's start with translational degrees of freedom. For any ideal gas, there are three translational degrees of freedom, each contributing R/2 to C_V. So, translational C_V is 3*(R/2) = 1.5R.\n\nNext, rotational degrees of freedom. For a linear molecule like a diatomic, there are two perpendicular axes of rotation, each contributing R/2 to C_V. So, rotational C_V is 2*(R/2) = R.\n\nThen, vibrational degrees of freedom. A diatomic molecule has one vibrational mode. Each vibrational degree of freedom contributes R/2 to C_V. However, vibrational motion is quantized, and at high temperatures, the quantum effects become significant. But in the classical limit, we can consider it contributes R/2 each for potential and kinetic energy, totaling R per vibrational degree of freedom.\n\nSo, adding them up: translational (1.5R) + rotational (R) + vibrational (R) = 1.5R + R + R = 3.5R.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I recall that in reality, at very high temperatures, the vibrational mode might not fully contribute R due to quantum mechanical effects. However, in the classical limit or at high temperatures, it should approach R.\n\nBut let me check standard values for diatomic molecules at room temperature. For diatomic gases like air (mostly nitrogen and oxygen), the molar heat capacity at constant volume is around 20.8 J/(mol\u00b7K), which is approximately 2.5R (since R is about 8.314 J/(mol\u00b7K)).\n\nSo, why is it 2.5R at room temperature instead of 3.5R? Maybe the vibrational mode isn't fully excited at room temperature.\n\nLet me look up the expression for C_V for a diatomic ideal gas at high temperatures.\n\nUpon checking, for a diatomic ideal gas, at high temperatures, the vibrational contribution approaches R, making the total C_V approach 3.5R.\n\nHowever, at room temperature, the vibrational contribution is less than R, typically around 0.5R, making the total C_V around 2.5R.\n\nSo, in the limiting case of very high temperatures, C_V should approach 3.5R.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 3.5R.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the equipartition theorem, which states that each degree of freedom contributes R/2 per mole to the molar heat capacity, provided that the energy of that degree of freedom is classically distributed.\n\nFor a diatomic molecule:\n\n- Translational: 3 degrees \u2192 3*(R/2) = 1.5R\n\n- Rotational: 2 degrees \u2192 2*(R/2) = R\n\n- Vibrational: 1 degree \u2192 R/2\n\nBut wait, according to some sources, the vibrational degree of freedom should contribute R in the quantum mechanical treatment at high temperatures.\n\nPerhaps I need to look into the quantum mechanical treatment of vibrational energy.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the spacing between levels increases with energy. At high temperatures, the thermal energy kT is much larger than the energy spacing, and the vibrational modes should be fully excited, contributing R to C_V.\n\nTherefore, the total C_V should be 1.5R (translational) + R (rotational) + R (vibrational) = 3.5R.\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 3.5R.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the expression for C_V for a diatomic gas.\n\nThe molar heat capacity at constant volume for a diatomic gas can be given by:\n\nC_V = 5/2 R + R * (e^(-\u03b8_v/T))/(1 - e^(-\u03b8_v/T))^2\n\nWhere \u03b8_v is the vibrational temperature, and T is the absolute temperature.\n\nAt high temperatures, when T >> \u03b8_v, this expression approaches 7/2 R, which is 3.5R.\n\nTherefore, in the high-temperature limit, C_V approaches 3.5R.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 3.5R.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
