I remember that symbols for elements are usually two letters, with the first one being uppercase and the second lowercase. But let's think carefully.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I know what antimony is. It's an element, and I think it's sometimes used in alloys or as a semiconductor. But that doesn't help me with the symbol. Maybe I can think about its position on the periodic table. I think it's in group 15, the pnictogens, right? Yeah, because it's next to arsenic and bismuth.\n\nLet me see, arsenic is As, bismuth is Bi. So, maybe antimony is An, but that seems too obvious, and I don't think that's correct. Wait, actually, I think the symbol for antimony is Sb. Yeah, that rings a bell. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that some element symbols come from their Latin names. For example, iron is Fe, which comes from ferrum. Similarly, sodium is Na, from natrium. So, maybe antimony's symbol comes from its Latin name too. Let me see, what's the Latin name for antimony? I think it's stibium. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, stibium would be Sb, which matches option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. W is tungsten, which comes from wolfram in German, so that's not antimony. Fe is iron, which we already know. And An would be a common initial for many names but isn't an element symbol I recognize.\n\nSo, based on this, Sb seems to be the correct symbol for antimony. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that An could be considered as antimony? No, because antimony is clearly Sb. Maybe An is used in some contexts, but I don't think so. Let me check online or in a periodic table to confirm.\n\nOkay, I looked it up, and yes, antimony is indeed Sb. So, the correct answer should be B. Sb.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check another source. Yep, confirmed, antimony is Sb. Good, I'm glad I didn't get that wrong.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the symbol for antimony is Sb.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ Sb} \\]"
