                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out if the neighbor can get paid for mowing the lawn after the man tried to revoke his offer. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the man told his neighbor that if the neighbor mows his lawn, he'll pay $50. So, that sounds like an offer to pay $50 in exchange for the neighbor mowing his lawn. The neighbor then bought gasoline for the mower, which I guess is a preparation to fulfill the offer. Then, the neighbor wheeled the lawn mower to the man's property and started the engine. Right at that moment, the man yelled that he revokes his offer. Now, the question is, if the neighbor goes ahead and mows the lawn anyway, will he be able to recover the $50?\n\nOkay, so I need to think about contracts here, specifically unilateral contracts. I remember that in a unilateral contract, the promise is in exchange for an act, not another promise. So, in this case, the man is promising to pay $50 in exchange for the neighbor mowing his lawn.\n\nNow, with unilateral contracts, the offer can be revoked at any time before the act is completed, right? But, there's a catch. Once the act has begun, the offer becomes irrevocable. So, if the neighbor has already started mowing, the man can't revoke the offer.\n\nIn this scenario, the neighbor has bought gasoline, wheeled the mower to the property, and started the engine. Does that count as starting the act of mowing the lawn? Or does mowing only start when the mower is actually cutting grass?\n\nHmm, that's a bit unclear. Maybe I need to think about what constitutes the beginning of the act. In contract law, the act is mowing the lawn, which probably involves preparing the mower and getting it to the site, but the actual mowing is when the grass is being cut.\n\nSo, if starting the engine is part of the preparation but not the actual mowing, maybe the act hasn't begun yet. But, perhaps starting the engine is a substantial step towards completing the act.\n\nWait, but in unilateral contracts, once the offeree has begun performance, the offeror can't revoke the offer. So, if starting the engine is part of the performance, then the revocation is ineffective.\n\nBut, the man yelled \"I hereby revoke my offer\" at the moment the engine was started. So, if starting the engine is part of the performance, then the revocation comes after the performance has begun, making it ineffective.\n\nAlternatively, if starting the engine is just preparation and not part of the performance, then the revocation is effective.\n\nI need to find out what constitutes the beginning of performance in this context.\n\nLet me think about it differently. In contract law, when does performance begin in a unilateral contract? It's when the offeree starts doing the act that was promised.\n\nIn this case, mowing the lawn likely involves multiple steps: preparing the mower, getting it to the property, starting the engine, and then actually cutting the grass.\n\nSo, when does the act of mowing begin? Is it when the engine is started, or when the mower starts cutting grass?\n\nI think it's when the mower starts cutting grass. Starting the engine is just a preparatory step, not part of the actual mowing.\n\nIf that's the case, then when the man revoked the offer, the neighbor hadn't yet started the act of mowing, so the revocation is effective.\n\nTherefore, if the neighbor goes ahead and mows the lawn, he wouldn't be able to recover the $50, because the offer was revoked before he started the act.\n\nBut wait, maybe starting the engine is considered part of the act of mowing. Maybe it's a necessary step to be able to mow.\n\nIn that case, perhaps starting the engine is substantial enough to be considered the beginning of performance.\n\nLet me see. In some cases, preparing to perform can be considered part of performance if those preparations are necessary and substantial.\n\nBut generally, the act is mowing the lawn, which is cutting the grass, not starting the engine.\n\nSo, probably, starting the engine is just a preparatory step, and the actual act begins when the mower starts cutting grass.\n\nTherefore, the revocation was effective because the neighbor hadn't yet started the act of mowing.\n\nSo, if the neighbor mows the lawn anyway, he wouldn't be able to recover the $50.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Maybe the neighbor has already incurred costs by buying gasoline and preparing the mower, so perhaps there's some promissory estoppel or quasi-contract that could apply here.\n\nPromissory estoppel allows enforcement of a promise when the promisee has reasonably relied on it to their detriment.\n\nIn this case, the neighbor bought gasoline and prepared the mower in reliance on the man's promise to pay $50 for mowing the lawn.\n\nIf the man revokes the offer before the neighbor has completed the act, but the neighbor has already taken steps in preparation, perhaps the neighbor can still recover based on promissory estoppel.\n\nBut, I think promissory estoppel typically applies when there's partial performance, not just preparation.\n\nWait, in some jurisdictions, reasonable reliance can lead to enforcement of the promise, even if the act isn't fully completed.\n\nSo, maybe the neighbor can argue that they relied on the man's promise by purchasing gasoline and preparing the mower, and therefore should be compensated for their reliance.\n\nBut, the question is specifically asking if the neighbor mows the lawn after the revocation, will he recover the $50?\n\nSo, if the neighbor completes the act despite the revocation, does promissory estoppel still apply?\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe the neighbor can still recover the $50 based on promissory estoppel, even if the offer was revoked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the neighbor can recover the cost of the gasoline and preparation under quasi-contract or restitution.\n\nQuasi-contract is when there's no actual contract, but the law imposes a contractual obligation to prevent unjust enrichment.\n\nIn this case, if the neighbor mows the lawn after the revocation, perhaps the man is unjustly enriched by having a mowed lawn without paying for it.\n\nBut, the man revoked the offer before the neighbor completed the act, so maybe quasi-contract doesn't apply.\n\nWait, quasi-contract often applies in situations where there's no express contract, but one party benefits at the expense of another.\n\nHere, the man benefits from having his lawn mowed, but he revoked the offer before the act was completed.\n\nSo, perhaps the neighbor can still recover the $50 based on quasi-contract, arguing that it's unfair for the man to benefit from the mowed lawn without paying.\n\nBut, I think quasi-contract typically applies when there's no valid contract, which in this case, the offer was revoked before completion, so maybe there is no valid contract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the neighbor can argue that by accepting the offer and starting to perform, a contract was formed, and the revocation was ineffective.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, in unilateral contracts, the offer can be revoked until the act is completed.\n\nSo, if the man revoked the offer before the act was completed, the revocation is effective.\n\nTherefore, there's no valid contract, and the neighbor can't recover the $50.\n\nBut, maybe the neighbor can still recover some amount for the preparation and partial performance under promissory estoppel or restitution.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking if the neighbor will recover the $50.\n\nSo, perhaps the neighbor can't recover the full $50, but only the cost of preparation.\n\nBut, the options are:\n\nA. Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\n\nB. Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.\n\nC. No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\n\nD. No, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man's revocation.\n\nSo, option A suggests that the offer became irrevocable before the revocation, meaning that the neighbor had already started performance.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, starting the engine might not be part of the act of mowing, just preparation.\n\nSo, if starting the engine is preparation, not part of the act, then the revocation is effective.\n\nTherefore, option C seems plausible: no, because the revocation was effective since the neighbor hadn't completed performance.\n\nOption D says no, because the neighbor only prepared to accept the offer.\n\nBut, in this case, the neighbor did more than just prepare; he bought gasoline, wheeled the mower to the property, and started the engine.\n\nSo, perhaps there was some partial performance.\n\nBut, if starting the engine is still preparation, then option D might be correct.\n\nHowever, I think starting the engine is a step closer to performance but not yet part of the act itself.\n\nSo, perhaps the revocation is effective, and the neighbor can't recover the $50.\n\nBut, option B suggests yes, under quasi-contract.\n\nAs I thought earlier, quasi-contract might apply here because the man benefits from the mowed lawn without paying.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if that's the case, because the offer was revoked before completion.\n\nMaybe the man can argue that he didn't consent to the neighbor mowing the lawn after the revocation, so there's no quasi-contract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the neighbor can argue that by mowing the lawn, he conferred a benefit on the man, who passively accepted it by not objecting.\n\nBut, I think quasi-contract typically requires that the benefit was conferred with the expectation of payment or with the other party's knowledge.\n\nIn this case, the man revoked the offer, so maybe he didn't expect or want the neighbor to mow the lawn.\n\nTherefore, quasi-contract might not apply here.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is C: no, because the man's revocation was effective since the neighbor hadn't completed performance.\n\nBut, I'm still a bit unsure about whether starting the engine counts as part of the performance or just preparation.\n\nIf starting the engine is part of the performance, then the revocation is ineffective, and the neighbor can recover the $50.\n\nBut, if starting the engine is just preparation, then the revocation is effective, and the neighbor can't recover.\n\nI need to find out what constitutes the beginning of performance in this context.\n\nLet me look up a definition of when performance begins in a unilateral contract.\n\nIn contract law, performance begins when the offeree starts doing the act that was promised.\n\nIn this case, mowing the lawn likely begins when the mower starts cutting grass, not when the engine is started.\n\nStarting the engine is a necessary step to be able to mow, but it's not the actual act of mowing.\n\nTherefore, the act of mowing hasn't begun until the mower starts cutting grass.\n\nSo, if the man revoked the offer before the mower started cutting grass, the revocation is effective.\n\nTherefore, if the neighbor goes ahead and mows the lawn anyway, he wouldn't be able to recover the $50.\n\nSo, the answer is C: no, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's consider another perspective.\n\nMaybe the neighbor can argue that by starting the engine, he has already incurred costs and taken steps in reliance on the man's promise, and therefore should be compensated.\n\nBut, in contract law, reliance damages are generally not available in unilateral contracts unless the act is completed.\n\nSo, perhaps the neighbor can't recover the full $50, only the costs he incurred in preparation.\n\nBut, the question is specifically about recovering the $50, not about recovering preparation costs.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor won't be able to recover the $50.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
