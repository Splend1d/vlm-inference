                    "text": "So I have this problem about sulfurous acid, H2SO3, in an aqueous solution. It's asking which of the given options correctly represents the concentrations of three different ions in the solution. The options are combinations of [SO32-], [HSO3-], and [H2SO3], arranged in decreasing order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the behavior of sulfurous acid in water. Sulfurous acid is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons (H+) stepwise. So, when it dissolves in water, it undergoes two ionization steps:\n\n1. H2SO3 \u21cc H+ + HSO3-\n\n2. HSO3- \u21cc H+ + SO32-\n\nEach of these steps has its own acid dissociation constant, Ka1 and Ka2, respectively. These constants tell us the extent to which the acid donates protons in solution.\n\nNow, to determine the relative concentrations of H2SO3, HSO3-, and SO32-, I need to consider the values of these Ka constants. If I know the pH of the solution, that would help, but since it's not provided, I'll have to think differently.\n\nLet me recall the Ka values for sulfurous acid. I think Ka1 is around 1.54 \u00d7 10^-2, and Ka2 is around 1.02 \u00d7 10^-7. These values indicate that the first ionization is stronger than the second, meaning that H2SO3 donates protons more readily than HSO3- does.\n\nGiven that, in solution, more H2SO3 molecules will ionize to form HSO3- and H+ compared to the number of HSO3- ions that ionize to form SO32- and H+.\n\nSo, logically, [H2SO3] should be greater than [HSO3-], and [HSO3-] should be greater than [SO32-]. That would make sense because each subsequent ionization is weaker.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. [SO32-] > [HSO3-] > [H2SO3]\n\nB. [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]\n\nC. [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] = [SO32-]\n\nD. [SO32-] = [HSO3-] > [H2SO3]\n\nOption B seems to align with my initial thought that [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-].\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Is it always true that [HSO3-] > [SO32-]? Or could there be conditions where [SO32-] is higher than [HSO3-]?\n\nI need to consider the pH of the solution and how it affects the ionization equilibria.\n\nLet me use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the first ionization:\n\npH = pKa1 + log([HSO3-]/[H2SO3])\n\nSimilarly, for the second ionization:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([SO32-]/[HSO3-])\n\nGiven that pKa1 is approximately -log(1.54 \u00d7 10^-2) \u2248 1.81, and pKa2 is approximately -log(1.02 \u00d7 10^-7) \u2248 6.99.\n\nNow, if the pH is below pKa1, say around 1.8, then [H2SO3] > [HSO3-]. If the pH is above pKa1, [HSO3-] > [H2SO3].\n\nSimilarly, for the second ionization, if the pH is above pKa2, [SO32-] > [HSO3-].\n\nBut since sulfurous acid is a weak acid, the solution is likely to be acidic, with pH below pKa1.\n\nAssuming a typical concentration of H2SO3, say 0.1 M, and considering the first ionization:\n\nLet\u2019s assume x is the concentration of H+ and HSO3- produced by the first ionization.\n\nThen, Ka1 = [H+][HSO3-]/[H2SO3] \u2248 x^2 / (0.1 - x) \u2248 1.54 \u00d7 10^-2.\n\nSolving for x, we get x \u2248 0.039 M, so [H+] \u2248 0.039 M, which corresponds to pH \u2248 -log(0.039) \u2248 1.41.\n\nAt this pH, which is below pKa1, [H2SO3] > [HSO3-].\n\nNow, for the second ionization:\n\nKa2 = [H+][SO32-]/[HSO3-] \u2248 1.02 \u00d7 10^-7.\n\nGiven [H+] \u2248 0.039 M, then [SO32-]/[HSO3-] \u2248 Ka2 / [H+] \u2248 (1.02 \u00d7 10^-7)/0.039 \u2248 2.62 \u00d7 10^-6.\n\nSo, [SO32-] \u2248 2.62 \u00d7 10^-6 \u00d7 [HSO3-].\n\nSince [HSO3-] is around 0.039 M, [SO32-] \u2248 2.62 \u00d7 10^-6 \u00d7 0.039 \u2248 1.02 \u00d7 10^-7 M.\n\nComparing to [HSO3-] \u2248 0.039 M, clearly [HSO3-] > [SO32-].\n\nTherefore, in this case, [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-], which matches option B.\n\nBut wait, what if the pH is different? Could [SO32-] be higher than [HSO3-] under certain conditions?\n\nLet\u2019s consider a higher pH, say around pKa2, which is about 7.\n\nAt pH \u2248 7, for the second ionization:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([SO32-]/[HSO3-])\n\n7 \u2248 6.99 + log([SO32-]/[HSO3-])\n\nSo, log([SO32-]/[HSO3-]) \u2248 0.01, which is close to 0, meaning [SO32-] \u2248 [HSO3-].\n\nThis would correspond to option C, where [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] = [SO32-].\n\nBut in the problem, it's not specified what the pH is, so perhaps we should consider the typical behavior.\n\nIn most cases, sulfurous acid solutions are acidic due to the first ionization, so [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-] is more common.\n\nMoreover, the problem states \"an aqueous solution\" without specifying any adjustments to pH, so perhaps it's safe to assume natural conditions favoring option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all options could be possible under different pH conditions, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's expecting the answer based on typical behavior.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a solution of sulfurous acid, H2SO3, is present in an aqueous solution,\" and asks which represents the concentrations of three different ions.\n\nOption C has [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] = [SO32-], but based on my earlier calculation, [SO32-] is much smaller than [HSO3-] at the pH determined by the first ionization.\n\nOption D has [SO32-] = [HSO3-] > [H2SO3], which would require [SO32-] > [HSO3-], which seems unlikely unless the pH is significantly above pKa2.\n\nOption A has [SO32-] > [HSO3-] > [H2SO3], which might be possible at a very high pH, but that seems unconventional for a sulfurous acid solution.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most plausible, representing the typical concentration order in a sulfurous acid solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing understanding of acid dissociation and Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nLet me consider the equilibrium for the first ionization:\n\nH2SO3 \u21cc H+ + HSO3-\n\nIf the solution is acidic, as it naturally tends to be due to H2SO3 ionization, then [H+] increases, which would shift the equilibrium to the left, favoring more H2SO3 and less HSO3-.\n\nHowever, in reality, the ionization is established based on the Ka values, and at equilibrium, the concentrations are determined as per the Ka expressions.\n\nGiven that, and my earlier calculations, option B seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the second ionization:\n\nHSO3- \u21cc H+ + SO32-\n\nAt higher pH, more SO32- would be formed, but in the presence of H2SO3, which is an acid, the pH would be low, suppressing the formation of SO32-.\n\nTherefore, unless the solution is buffered or has been adjusted to a higher pH, [SO32-] should be much lower than [HSO3-].\n\nHence, option B remains the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the multiple equilibria and the overall ionization steps.\n\nLet me attempt to calculate the concentrations step by step.\n\nAssume an initial concentration of H2SO3, say 0.1 M.\n\nFirst ionization:\n\nH2SO3 \u21cc H+ + HSO3-\n\nLet\u2019s denote the concentration of H+ and HSO3- produced as x.\n\nThen, Ka1 = x^2 / (0.1 - x) = 1.54 \u00d7 10^-2.\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.1, we can approximate:\n\nx^2 / 0.1 = 1.54 \u00d7 10^-2 \u21d2 x^2 = 1.54 \u00d7 10^-3 \u21d2 x \u2248 0.039 M.\n\nSo, [H+] \u2248 0.039 M, [HSO3-] \u2248 0.039 M, and [H2SO3] \u2248 0.1 - 0.039 = 0.061 M.\n\nSecond ionization:\n\nHSO3- \u21cc H+ + SO32-\n\nKa2 = [H+][SO32-]/[HSO3-] = 1.02 \u00d7 10^-7.\n\nGiven [H+] \u2248 0.039 M, then [SO32-]/[HSO3-] \u2248 Ka2 / [H+] \u2248 (1.02 \u00d7 10^-7)/0.039 \u2248 2.62 \u00d7 10^-6.\n\nTherefore, [SO32-] \u2248 2.62 \u00d7 10^-6 \u00d7 [HSO3-] \u2248 2.62 \u00d7 10^-6 \u00d7 0.039 \u2248 1.02 \u00d7 10^-7 M.\n\nSo, [H2SO3] \u2248 0.061 M, [HSO3-] \u2248 0.039 M, [SO32-] \u2248 1.02 \u00d7 10^-7 M.\n\nClearly, [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-], which corresponds to option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-].\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
