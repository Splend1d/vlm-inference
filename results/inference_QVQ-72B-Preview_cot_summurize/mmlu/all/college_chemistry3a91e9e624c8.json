                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this problem about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle applied to a quantum mechanical particle in the lowest energy level of a one-dimensional box. The options are pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst, let's recall what the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states. It says that you cannot simultaneously know both the position and the momentum of a particle with arbitrary precision. The product of the uncertainties in position (\u0394x) and momentum (\u0394p) is at least on the order of Planck's constant divided by 4\u03c0, or \u0394x \u0394p \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nNow, in a one-dimensional box, also known as an infinite square well, the particle is confined within the box, say from x = 0 to x = L. Outside the box, the potential is infinite, so the particle can't be there. Inside the box, the potential is zero.\n\nFor the lowest energy level, which is the ground state, the wave function is sinusoidal. I think for a box of length L, the ground state wave function is something like \u221a(2/L) sin(\u03c0x/L). But I might need to double-check that.\n\nIn this state, the particle has a certain probability distribution for its position. Since it's confined within the box, we know it's somewhere between x = 0 and x = L. So, its position is not completely unknown; there's a probability distribution for where it could be.\n\nNow, for the momentum. In quantum mechanics, momentum is related to the derivative of the wave function. If the wave function is sinusoidal, like sin(\u03c0x/L), then its derivative is a cosine function, which is also well-defined within the box.\n\nBut according to the uncertainty principle, if position is well-defined, momentum should be uncertain, and vice versa. But in this case, since the particle is in a box, both position and momentum have some uncertainties.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about the expectation values or the uncertainties more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the expectation value of position. In the ground state, the wave function is symmetric, so the expectation value of position should be at the center of the box, at x = L/2. But the position is not known exactly; it's spread out over the entire box according to the probability density |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for momentum, in the ground state, the wave function is real, so the expectation value of momentum should be zero because the wave function is even. But again, momentum is not exactly known; there's a distribution of possible momentum values.\n\nSo, neither position nor momentum is known exactly. Both have some uncertainty.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Momentum is known exactly, but no information about position can be known.\n\nThis can't be right because the uncertainty principle says that if you know momentum exactly, you can't know position, but in this case, the particle is confined in a box, so we do have information about its position\u2014it's somewhere in the box.\n\nB. Position is known exactly, but no information about momentum can be known.\n\nThis also seems incorrect because the particle is in a quantum state with a spread in position. It's not localized at a single point; it's spread out in the box. So, position isn't known exactly.\n\nC. No information about either position or momentum can be known.\n\nThis seems too extreme. We know the particle is in the box, so we have some information about its position. And since it's moving, it has some momentum, but it's not exactly known.\n\nD. Neither position nor momentum can be known exactly.\n\nThis seems the most accurate. Both position and momentum have uncertainties due to the quantum nature of the particle. Even though we know it's in the box, we don't know exactly where it is within the box, and similarly for momentum.\n\nI think the answer is D. Neither position nor momentum can be known exactly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the uncertainties quantitatively.\n\nThe uncertainty in position, \u0394x, for the ground state of the infinite square well is, I believe, L/\u221a(12), or something like that. And the uncertainty in momentum, \u0394p, can be found similarly.\n\nBut more importantly, according to the uncertainty principle, \u0394x \u0394p \u2265 \u0127/2. So, both \u0394x and \u0394p are non-zero, meaning both position and momentum have uncertainties.\n\nTherefore, neither position nor momentum can be known exactly.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
