                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a company that bought a new machine, and we need to find out how much they paid for it. The options are quite spread out, so if I can get close to the right answer, I should be able to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the information given:\n\n- Annual revenue generated by the machine: $35,000\n\n- Annual operating expenses: $7,000\n\n- Annual depreciation expense: $4,000\n\n- Expected payback period: 5.2 years\n\nThe machine will generate revenue for seven years, but the payback period is 5.2 years. Payback period is the time it takes to recover the initial investment from the cash flows generated by the project. So, the initial cost should be equal to the cumulative cash flows over 5.2 years.\n\nBut first, let's calculate the annual cash flow from the machine.\n\nAnnual revenue: $35,000\n\nAnnual operating expenses: $7,000\n\nSo, before depreciation, the operating income is $35,000 - $7,000 = $28,000.\n\nBut there's depreciation expense of $4,000 per year. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so in cash flow calculations, we add it back to the net income.\n\nTherefore, annual cash flow = operating income + depreciation\n\n= $28,000 + $4,000 = $32,000\n\nSo, the machine generates $32,000 in cash flow each year.\n\nNow, the payback period is 5.2 years. The payback period formula is:\n\nPayback period = Initial investment / Annual cash inflow\n\nGiven that, we can rearrange it to solve for the initial investment:\n\nInitial investment = Payback period * Annual cash inflow\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nInitial investment = 5.2 years * $32,000/year = $166,400\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option C.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's make sure there aren't any other factors to consider.\n\nThe machine has a useful life of seven years, but the payback period is 5.2 years. The payback period only considers the cash flows up to the point where the initial investment is recovered, which is 5.2 years in this case. So, the calculation should be correct based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, sometimes there might be salvage value or other cash flows beyond the payback period, but the problem doesn't mention any of that. So, probably not.\n\nAlso, the depreciation expense is given as $4,000 per year, which is likely the straight-line depreciation for tax purposes, but since we're using it for cash flow calculations, adding it back to net income to get cash flow seems appropriate.\n\nLet me double-check the annual cash flow.\n\nRevenue: $35,000\n\nOperating expenses: $7,000\n\nSo, operating income before depreciation: $28,000\n\nAdd back depreciation: $4,000\n\nTotal annual cash flow: $32,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, payback period is 5.2 years, so initial investment = 5.2 * $32,000 = $166,400\n\nSo, the answer should be C. $166,400\n\nI think that's it. No tricks here, just straightforward payback period calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
