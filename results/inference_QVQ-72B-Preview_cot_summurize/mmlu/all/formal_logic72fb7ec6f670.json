                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, I have this sentence: \"Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\" And I need to find which of the given formulas best symbolizes this sentence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. There are two main parts connected by \"either...or.\" That means one or the other part can be true.\n\nThe first part is: \"England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nAnd the second part is: \"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\"\n\nAlright, let's break down each part.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nI need to recall what a necessary condition is in logic. If A is a necessary condition for B, that means B cannot occur without A. In logical terms, that's represented by B \u2283 A (if B, then A).\n\nSo, in this case, if France subsidizes agriculture (F), then England must be importing beef (E). So, it's F \u2283 E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B has (F \u2283 E), which matches this.\n\nNow, the second part: \"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\"\n\nSo, China promoting human rights (C) is dependent on South Africa not supplying diamonds (~S). In logical terms, this would be represented as if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds (~S), then China promotes human rights (C). So, that's ~S \u2283 C.\n\nLooking at the options, option D has (~S \u2283 C).\n\nSo, combining both parts, the entire statement should be: (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2261 C)\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (S \u2283 ~C)\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C)\n\nSo, option D matches exactly what I derived.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst part: \"England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nNecessary condition translates to B \u2283 A, where A is the condition necessary for B.\n\nSo, France's subsidizing agriculture (B) \u2283 England's importing beef (A).\n\nSo, F \u2283 E.\n\nSecond part: \"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\"\n\nThis seems like a conditional statement: If South Africa doesn't supply diamonds (~S), then China promotes human rights (C).\n\nSo, ~S \u2283 C.\n\nTherefore, the whole statement is (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C).\n\nOption D is indeed (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C).\n\nOption B has (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2261 C), which includes equivalence (\u2261), but the second part should be implication (\u2283), not equivalence.\n\nOption A has (E \u2283 F), which is the converse of what we need, and it includes equivalence between C and ~S, which doesn't match.\n\nOption C has (E \u2283 F) and (S \u2283 ~C), which again doesn't match our derivation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the second part.\n\n\"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\"\n\nIs it possible to interpret this as: \"if China promotes human rights, then South Africa doesn't supply diamonds,\" which would be C \u2283 ~S.\n\nBut no, the way it's phrased suggests that the promotion of human rights by China is conditional on South Africa not supplying diamonds. So, it's more like ~S \u2283 C.\n\nAlternatively, \"given that\" can sometimes imply a premise, so \"given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds, China promotes human rights,\" which would be ~S \u2283 C.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think option D is the correct one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
