                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about monks and nuns in both Eastern religions and Christianity who take vows of celibacy, virginity, and poverty. It's asking what ethical system they follow, and the options are legalism, asceticism, situationism, and hedonism. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these terms means. Starting with legalism, I think it's about strictly following laws or rules, maybe prioritizing adherence to specific doctrines or commandments. But in this context, it doesn't seem to directly relate to the vows of celibacy and poverty.\n\nNext is asceticism. I recall that ascetics are people who practice severe self-discipline and abstain from indulgence, often for religious reasons. They might renounce worldly pleasures and focus on spiritual goals. This sounds a bit like the vows mentioned\u2014celibacy, virginity, and poverty\u2014all of which involve giving up certain aspects of worldly life for a higher purpose.\n\nSituationism, on the other hand, sounds like it's about making moral decisions based on the situation at hand, perhaps emphasizing context and circumstances over absolute rules. Again, not sure if that directly aligns with the vows of monks and nuns.\n\nHedonism is the philosophy that pleasure is the primary or most important intrinsic good. Hedonists might seek to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. This seems contrary to the vows of celibacy and poverty, which involve giving up pleasures and material possessions.\n\nSo, comparing these options, asceticism seems to be the most fitting choice. It aligns with the practice of monks and nuns in both Eastern and Western traditions who dedicate their lives to spiritual pursuits, often living simply and avoiding luxuries.\n\nLet me double-check. In Christianity, monastic orders like the Benedictines and Franciscans take vows of chastity, obedience, and poverty, reflecting an ascetic lifestyle dedicated to prayer and service. In Buddhism, monks and nuns also take vows of celibacy and renounce worldly possessions, practicing a life of simplicity and meditation.\n\nSimilarly, in Hinduism and Jainism, there are ascetic traditions where individuals renounce family life and material possessions to pursue spiritual enlightenment.\n\nGiven this, it seems that asceticism is the ethical system being described here, as it involves voluntary self-denial and simplicity for spiritual ends.\n\nI don't think it's legalism, because that's more about following rules and laws to the letter, not necessarily about renouncing worldly possessions or pleasures.\n\nSituationism doesn't fit because it's about making choices based on specific situations, whereas the vows of celibacy and poverty are more about making a lifelong commitment to a certain way of life, regardless of the situation.\n\nHedonism is clearly opposite to the vows, as it promotes pleasure-seeking, which is at odds with the self-denial involved in ascetic practices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. asceticism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
