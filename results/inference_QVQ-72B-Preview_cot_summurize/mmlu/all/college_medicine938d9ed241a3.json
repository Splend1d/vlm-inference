                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a race car trying to jump a bunch of buses. It needs to reach a speed of 130 km/h over a distance of 50 meters, and I need to find out at what rate it must accelerate to achieve that speed. The options are 13 m/s\u00b2, 26 m/s\u00b2, 7 m/s\u00b2, and 17 m/s\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand all the parts of the problem. The car is starting from rest, right? I think so, because it's on a flat track and the ramp is at the end. So, initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s. The final velocity (v) is 130 km/h, and the distance (s) is 50 meters. I need to find the acceleration (a).\n\nBut wait, the units are in km/h and meters. I should probably convert everything to consistent units, like meters per second for velocity and meters for distance. So, let's convert 130 km/h to m/s.\n\nI know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. So, 130 km/h is equal to 130 * 1000 / 3600 m/s.\n\nLet me calculate that: 130 times 1000 is 130,000, divided by 3600.\n\n130,000 divided by 3600. Well, 36 times 36 is 1296, so 36 times 36 is 1296, and 36 times 36.5 is 1296 plus 36 is 1332, which is too high. So, 36 times 35.5 is 1278, plus another 36 would be 1314, still too high. Maybe 36.1: 36 times 36 is 1296, plus 0.1 times 36 is 3.6, so 1300.6. That's close, but not exact.\n\nActually, there's a better way to do this. I can divide 130 by 3.6 to get m/s directly, since 1 km/h is approximately 0.27778 m/s, but 1 km/h * 5/18 is m/s. Wait, no, 1 km/h is equal to 1/3.6 m/s, because 3.6 km/h is 1 m/s.\n\nSo, 130 divided by 3.6 should give me the velocity in m/s.\n\nLet me calculate 130 \u00f7 3.6.\n\nFirst, 130 \u00f7 4 is 32.5, but since 3.6 is 4 multiplied by 0.9, I can adjust.\n\nAlternatively, I can do long division: 3.6 into 130.\n\n3.6 times 36 is 129.6, which leaves a remainder of 0.4.\n\nSo, v = 36.11 m/s approximately.\n\nWait, 36 times 3.6 is 129.6, and 37 times 3.6 is 133.2, which is too high. So, 36.1 times 3.6 is 36 times 3.6 is 129.6, plus 0.1 times 3.6 is 0.36, total 130. So, v = 36.11 m/s.\n\nNow, I have u = 0 m/s, v = 36.11 m/s, s = 50 m, and I need to find a.\n\nI recall that there's a kinematic equation that relates velocity, acceleration, and distance without time: v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as.\n\nSo, rearranged, a = (v\u00b2 - u\u00b2)/(2s).\n\nPlugging in the values: a = (36.11\u00b2 - 0)/ (2 * 50).\n\nFirst, calculate 36.11 squared.\n\n36^2 is 1296, and 0.11^2 is 0.0121, and 36*0.11*2 is 7.92.\n\nSo, 1296 + 7.92 + 0.0121 is approximately 1303.9321 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nThen, a = 1303.9321 / (2*50) = 1303.9321 / 100 = 13.039 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, that's approximately 13 m/s\u00b2.\n\nBut let's check if there's a more precise way to calculate this.\n\nFirst, confirm the conversion of 130 km/h to m/s.\n\n1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s = 5/18 m/s.\n\nSo, 130 km/h = 130 * 5/18 = 650/18 \u2248 36.111... m/s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, using the kinematic equation v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as.\n\nWith u = 0, v \u2248 36.111 m/s, s = 50 m.\n\nSo, a = v\u00b2 / (2s) = (36.111)^2 / 100 \u2248 1303.99 / 100 = 13.04 m/s\u00b2.\n\nLooking back at the options, 13 m/s\u00b2 is the closest.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using time.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the equation v = u + at to find time first, then find acceleration.\n\nBut since time isn't given, that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, using the equation s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2, but again, without time, it might not be straightforward.\n\nGiven that, I think the first method using v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as is the most straightforward here.\n\nSo, my answer is approximately 13 m/s\u00b2, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
