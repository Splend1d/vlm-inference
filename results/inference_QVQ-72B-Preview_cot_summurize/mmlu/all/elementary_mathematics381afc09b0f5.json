                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a map scale. It says that the scale is 1 inch equals 25 miles, and I need to find out how many miles are represented by 5 inches on this map. Okay, let's see. I'm not great at these kinds of problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem tells me that 1 inch on the map represents 25 miles in real life. So, if 1 inch is 25 miles, then maybe I can just multiply to find out how many miles 5 inches represent. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but I should make sure I understand the concept.\n\nI think of it like this: if one unit on the map corresponds to a certain distance in reality, then increasing the map units should increase the real distance proportionally. So, if 1 inch is 25 miles, then 2 inches would be 50 miles, 3 inches would be 75 miles, and so on. So, for 5 inches, it should be 5 times 25 miles.\n\nLet me calculate that: 5 multiplied by 25. Let's see, 5 times 20 is 100, and 5 times 5 is 25, so 100 plus 25 is 125 miles. Wait, but that seems too big. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the units. The scale is given in inches and miles, so the relationship is direct. No need to worry about different units or anything like that. So, 1 inch = 25 miles, and I have 5 inches, so it should indeed be 5 times 25, which is 125 miles.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using proportions. If 1 inch corresponds to 25 miles, then for 5 inches, the proportion would be 5 inches / 1 inch = X miles / 25 miles. So, 5/1 = X/25. To solve for X, I can cross-multiply: 5 * 25 = X * 1, which is 125 = X. So, again, that confirms that the answer is 125 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? Maybe if the map isn't to scale in some way, but the problem states that it is to scale with 1 inch equaling 25 miles. So, I think the straightforward multiplication is sufficient here.\n\nLet me consider if this makes sense in real-world terms. Suppose the scale is 1 inch = 25 miles. So, if I measure something that's 5 inches on the map, it should be 5 times 25 miles, which is 125 miles in reality. That seems logical.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the answer choices provided:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 25\n\nC. 50\n\nD. 125\n\nSo, according to my calculations, D. 125 should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why are the other options there? Maybe to test if I understand the concept properly. For example, someone might think that since 1 inch is 25 miles, 5 inches would be 5 times 5 miles, which is 25 miles, but that's incorrect because it's not scaling correctly.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that the scale is different, like 1 inch equals 10 miles or something, but the problem clearly states 1 inch equals 25 miles. So, I don't think that's the case.\n\nAnother thought: maybe there's a unit conversion involved, but the problem is already using consistent units\u2014inches and miles. So, no need to convert between different units.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that the correct answer is 125 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
