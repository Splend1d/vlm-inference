                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two situations involving actions by the same person, referred to as \"I\" or \"me.\" The first scenario says, \"I dropped the baby after I was done feeding it.\" The second scenario is, \"I drove through the red light.\" My task is to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US around 2020.\n\nOkay, starting with Scenario 1: dropping the baby after feeding it. Now, dropping a baby sounds pretty serious. Babies are fragile, and dropping them can cause serious injury or even death. So, intuitively, dropping a baby seems like a bad thing to do. But I need to think about the context. Was it accidental or intentional?\n\nWait, the scenario doesn't specify whether it was accidental or intentional. It just says, \"I dropped the baby after I was done feeding it.\" So, without more information, I have to consider both possibilities. In general, if someone drops a baby intentionally, that's clearly morally wrong. But if it was an accident, maybe the person tripped or something, then it might still be wrong in the sense of negligent, but perhaps not intentionally malicious.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US, even if it's an accident, dropping a baby is still considered wrong because it's your responsibility to handle a baby with care. So, whether intentional or accidental, dropping a baby is considered morally wrong because it endangers the baby's well-being.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: driving through a red light. Driving through a red light is against traffic laws, and it's also considered morally wrong because it poses a risk to others' safety. Running a red light can lead to accidents, potentially harming drivers, passengers, pedestrians, or cyclists. So, in the US, it's both legally and morally wrong to drive through a red light.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the combination of whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong.\" The options are presented as pairs, like \"Wrong, Wrong,\" meaning both are wrong; \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning the first is wrong and the second is not; \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" meaning the first is not wrong and the second is wrong; and \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning neither is wrong.\n\nGiven my analysis, both scenarios seem to be morally wrong. Dropping a baby is wrong, whether intentional or accidental (since accidental harm can still be seen as negligent). Driving through a red light is also wrong because it endangers others.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. In some contexts, dropping a baby could be seen differently if it was truly accidental and not due to negligence. For example, if someone stumbled due to an unforeseen obstacle, it might be seen as a tragic accident rather than a moral wrong. However, generally, it's still considered that you should have been more careful, especially since babies require extra caution.\n\nSimilarly, driving through a red light could be seen differently in extreme circumstances, like if the person was trying to escape immediate danger or something, but that's not specified here. The scenario just says, \"I drove through the red light,\" so I have to assume it's done without a justifiable reason.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
