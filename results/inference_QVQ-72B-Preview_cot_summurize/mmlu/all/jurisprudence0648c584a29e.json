                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about Donny throwing a knife at Sally, and now Sally is suing him for assault and battery. I need to figure out which of the given options is the most correct. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that assault and battery are both torts in civil law, which means people can sue for them in civil court. So, option D seems to be wrong because it says this is only a criminal matter, but actually, it can be both a criminal and a civil matter. But since Sally is suing Donny, it's definitely a civil case here.\n\nNow, let's clarify the differences between assault and battery. From what I recall, battery is when there's intentional harmful or offensive contact with another person without their consent. Assault, on the other hand, is the intentional creation of reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact without consent.\n\nIn this case, Donny threw a knife at Sally intending to injure her severely. But he missed her, and the knife passed within one inch of her head, scaring her a lot. So, there was no actual contact between the knife and Sally, right? The knife just missed her by an inch.\n\nGiven that, there was no actual contact, so would that mean there's no battery? I think so because battery requires actual contact. Even if the intent was there, if the contact didn't happen, there's no battery. So, option A, which says Donny will be liable for battery, seems incorrect.\n\nNow, for assault, it's about creating a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Sally saw the knife coming towards her and was very scared. That sounds like she had a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful contact. The fact that Donny intended to injure her severely also supports this.\n\nSo, it seems like Donny would be liable for assault but not for battery. That points towards option B.\n\nBut wait, let's think about it more carefully. Is there any possibility of battery here? Maybe if the near miss itself caused some sort of offensive contact or harm. For example, if the wind from the knife passing by caused her hair to move or something like that, but that seems pretty far-fetched. The scenario says the knife missed her by about one inch, so there was no contact. I think it's safe to say there was no battery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other angle. Could Sally argue that the near miss was so close that it caused her emotional distress or something similar? Maybe, but that might fall under a different tort, like intentional infliction of emotional distress, not battery.\n\nAlso, sometimes, in law, there can be attempts at battery, but I think for actual battery, there needs to be contact. So, even if Donny tried to harm her, without contact, it's not battery.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is B. Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
