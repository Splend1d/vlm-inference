                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about buses leaving a station at the same time. There are two buses: Bus A and Bus B. Bus A has a long route and leaves every 75 minutes, and Bus B has a short route and leaves every 15 minutes. They both start at 6:00 a.m., and I need to find out when they will next leave at the same time. The options are 7:00 a.m., 7:15 a.m., 7:30 a.m., or 8:30 a.m.\n\nAlright, first thing I need to understand is what it means for both buses to leave at the same time. It means that both their departure times coincide. So, I need to find a time after 6:00 a.m. when both the 75-minute and the 15-minute intervals align.\n\nI remember that when we have two different intervals and we want to find when they coincide, it's related to the least common multiple, or LCM, of those intervals. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.\n\nSo, if I find the LCM of 75 and 15, that will tell me how often both buses leave at the same time.\n\nLet me recall how to find the LCM of two numbers. One way is to find the prime factors of each number and then take the highest power of each prime that appears in either factorization, and multiply those together.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 75 and 15.\n\n75 can be factored into primes as 3 \u00d7 5^2 (since 75 = 3 \u00d7 25, and 25 is 5^2).\n\n15 can be factored into primes as 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nSo, the highest power of each prime in both factorizations is 3^1 and 5^2.\n\nTherefore, the LCM of 75 and 15 is 3^1 \u00d7 5^2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75.\n\nWait a minute, that means the buses leave together every 75 minutes. But 75 minutes is 1 hour and 15 minutes. So, starting from 6:00 a.m., they would leave together again at 7:15 a.m.\n\nBut let's double-check this because 15 is a divisor of 75, so the LCM of 75 and 15 is indeed 75. So, every 75 minutes, they should leave together.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 7:15 a.m. is one of them. So, that seems like a possible answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other time before that when they might leave together. Maybe there's a shorter interval where their schedules align.\n\nWait, but since 15 is a divisor of 75, the only time they leave together is every 75 minutes, starting at 6:00 a.m.\n\nLet me think about listing out the departure times for each bus to see when they coincide.\n\nStarting at 6:00 a.m., Bus A leaves every 75 minutes:\n\n6:00 a.m.\n\n7:15 a.m.\n\n8:30 a.m.\n\n9:45 a.m., and so on.\n\nBus B leaves every 15 minutes:\n\n6:00 a.m.\n\n6:15 a.m.\n\n6:30 a.m.\n\n6:45 a.m.\n\n7:00 a.m.\n\n7:15 a.m.\n\n7:30 a.m.\n\n7:45 a.m., and so on.\n\nLooking at these times, the common departure times are at 6:00 a.m., 7:15 a.m., 8:30 a.m., etc.\n\nSo, the next time after 6:00 a.m. would be 7:15 a.m.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's any other time before 7:15 a.m. where they might coincide.\n\nIs there any time between 6:00 a.m. and 7:15 a.m. where both schedules align? Well, from the list above, only 7:15 a.m. is the next common time.\n\nTherefore, the next time both Bus A and Bus B leave the station at the same time after 6:00 a.m. is at 7:15 a.m.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 7:15 a.m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 7:15\\ \\text{a.m.}} \\]"
