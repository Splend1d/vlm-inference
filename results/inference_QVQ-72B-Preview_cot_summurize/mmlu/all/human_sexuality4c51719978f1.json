Henry Havelock Ellis, B. Sigmund Freud, C. Linda George and Stephen Weiler, and D. William Masters and Virginia Johnson. Hmm, I need to recall who first modeled the physiology of human sexual response.\n\nLet me think about this. Physiology of sexual response refers to the physical reactions and changes that occur in the body during sexual arousal and activity. So, it's about things like blood flow, heart rate, and other bodily responses during different stages of sexual activity.\n\nI remember that William Masters and Virginia Johnson were famous for their work in human sexuality. They did a lot of research on sexual response cycles in the mid-20th century. In fact, they developed a model that described the stages of sexual response: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. That sounds like it fits the description of modeling the physiology of human sexual response.\n\nHenry Havelock Ellis was an earlier figure, more in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He wrote about sexual psychology and was known for his studies on sexual inversion and other topics, but I don't recall him being directly involved in the physiological aspects of sexual response.\n\nSigmund Freud is famous for his psychoanalytic theories and his emphasis on the psychological aspects of sexuality, particularly unconscious motivations. While he talked a lot about sexuality, his focus was more on the mental and emotional aspects rather than the physical physiology.\n\nLinda George and Stephen Weiler, I'm not as familiar with. Let me think... I believe they might have contributed to later research in sexuality, perhaps in the late 20th century, but I don't remember them being among the first to model the physiology of sexual response.\n\nSo, based on what I know, William Masters and Virginia Johnson seem to be the most fitting answer here. Their work was groundbreaking in observing and describing the physical changes that occur during sexual arousal and response, which directly relates to the physiology mentioned in the question.\n\nI should double-check this, though. Maybe I should look back at my notes or textbooks to confirm. I recall that Masters and Johnson used laboratory observations and measurements to document the physiological responses during sexual activity, which was quite innovative at the time.\n\nHenry Havelock Ellis, while important in the history of sexology, focused more on the psychological and social aspects of sexuality. Sigmund Freud's work was primarily psychoanalytic, dealing with the unconscious mind and its influence on behavior, including sexual behavior.\n\nAs for Linda George and Stephen Weiler, I think their work might have been more recent and possibly in a different area of sexuality research, perhaps in health or behavior, but not specifically in the physiology of sexual response.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. William Masters and Virginia Johnson. They were indeed pioneers in studying and modeling the physiology of the human sexual response.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
