                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is asking about two hormones that act on the hypothalamus to increase satiety and hunger, respectively. The options are:\n\nA. Leptin and insulin\n\nB. Leptin and ghrelin\n\nC. Ghrelin and leptin\n\nD. Ghrelin and insulin\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what satiety and hunger mean. Satiety is the feeling of fullness or satisfaction after eating, right? So, something that increases satiety would make you feel fuller. Hunger, on the other hand, is the feeling of wanting to eat, so a hormone that increases hunger would make you feel hungrier.\n\nNow, I need to match which hormones do what.\n\nLet's start with leptin. I remember that leptin is a hormone primarily made by fat cells, and it signals to the brain that energy stores are sufficient. So, when leptin levels are high, it should make you feel less hungry, right? Wait, but the question is about increasing satiety and hunger separately.\n\nWait, maybe I need to be more precise. Satiety is about feeling full, which might be related to short-term signals after a meal, whereas hunger might be more related to longer-term energy balance.\n\nLet me think about leptin again. Leptin is known to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure. So, higher leptin levels lead to decreased hunger and increased satiety. So, leptin would be the hormone that increases satiety.\n\nNow, for hunger, which hormone increases hunger? I know that ghrelin is a hormone released mainly by the stomach, and it signals hunger to the brain. So, when ghrelin levels rise, typically before meals, it makes you feel hungry.\n\nSo, according to this, leptin increases satiety, and ghrelin increases hunger.\n\nWait, but option A is leptin and insulin. Insulin is another hormone involved in energy regulation. Insulin is released in response to high blood sugar levels, and it helps store energy. Does insulin also affect hunger or satiety?\n\nI think insulin might make you feel fuller because it promotes energy storage, so maybe it increases satiety. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's more related to long-term energy balance.\n\nBut the question is specifically about increasing satiety and hunger, so perhaps insulin isn't directly involved in increasing hunger.\n\nOption D is ghrelin and insulin. If ghrelin increases hunger, and insulin might increase satiety, then that would contradict the question's requirement.\n\nOption C is ghrelin and leptin. If ghrelin increases hunger and leptin increases satiety, that seems opposite to what the question is asking for.\n\nWait, no. The question is asking for two hormones that respectively increase satiety and hunger. So, one hormone increases satiety and the other increases hunger.\n\nSo, if leptin increases satiety and ghrelin increases hunger, then option B would be correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A: Leptin and insulin. Leptin increases satiety, insulin might increase satiety as well by promoting energy storage.\n\nOption B: Leptin and ghrelin. Leptin increases satiety, ghrelin increases hunger.\n\nOption C: Ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin increases hunger, leptin increases satiety.\n\nOption D: Ghrelin and insulin. Ghrelin increases hunger, insulin might increase satiety.\n\nSo, option B seems to cover both aspects clearly: leptin for satiety and ghrelin for hunger.\n\nWait, but does insulin increase satiety? I think it might, because after eating, insulin levels rise, which helps store energy and might contribute to feeling full. But it's not as directly associated with hunger as ghrelin is.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is option B: leptin and ghrelin.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Leptin signals fullness and ghrelin signals hunger to the hypothalamus.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Leptin and ghrelin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
