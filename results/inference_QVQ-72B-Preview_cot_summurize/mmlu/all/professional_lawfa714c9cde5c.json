                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the surviving wife can enforce this \"automatic reverter\" clause after her husband died and their niece mortgaged the property they sold to her. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife sold part of their family farm to their niece for a price that was substantially below market value. That sounds like they gave her a really good deal, maybe out of familial love or to help her out. But in return, they reserved a reverter back to themselves under certain conditions.\n\nThe specific condition is that if the property is ever mortgaged or encumbered while either of the grantors is still alive, the property automatically reverts back to them. So, in this case, the husband has died, but the wife is still alive. The niece then mortgaged the property, which triggers this reverter clause.\n\nNow, the question is whether the surviving wife can enforce this automatic reverter to get the title back. There are four options:\n\nA. No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nB. No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\n\nC. Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari mutual.\n\nD. Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what is a restraint on alienation? I think it means restricting the ability to transfer or sell property. So, in this case, the clause is saying that if the niece mortgages the property while either of the original owners is still alive, the property goes back to them. That's a restriction on what the niece can do with the property\u2014she can't mortgage it under certain conditions without risking losing it.\n\nNow, generally, restraints on alienation are disfavored in law because they can interfere with the free transfer of property. But there are exceptions for reasonable restraints.\n\nOption A says that this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation, so it can't be enforced. But is that true? The clause only restricts mortgaging or encumbering the property while either grantor is alive. It doesn't prevent sale or other transfers, just specifically mortgaging it during their lifetimes.\n\nOption B says that an automatic reverter is unenforceable, period. But I think that's too broad of a statement. Reverters can be enforceable under certain circumstances, especially if they're reasonably related to the grantor's interests.\n\nOption C mentions that because the grantors and the grantee are blood relatives in pari mutual, the provision can be enforced. \"In pari mutual\" means equally between each other, but I'm not entirely sure what that adds here. Maybe it's relevant to the relationship between the parties and whether that affects the enforceability of the reverter.\n\nOption D says that the provision is enforceable because it's generally considered a reasonable restraint on alienation. So, it's suggesting that this type of reverter is acceptable under the law.\n\nI need to think about whether this reverter is reasonable or not. The reverter is triggered if the property is mortgaged while either grantor is still alive. In this case, the husband is dead, but the wife is still alive. So, as long as the wife is alive, the niece can't mortgage the property without risking it reverting back.\n\nIs this a reasonable restriction? Well, one could argue that it protects the grantors' interests in case the grantee defaults on the mortgage, which could affect their reversionary interest. But on the other hand, it might be seen as too restrictive because it prevents the grantee from using the property as collateral for a loan, which could be important for her financial planning.\n\nI need to consider the duration of the restriction. It only lasts as long as either grantor is alive, which could be a finite period, depending on their ages. Since the husband is already dead, it only lasts as long as the wife lives. So, it's not a perpetual restriction, which might make it more acceptable.\n\nAlso, considering that the property was sold at substantially below market value, maybe there was an understanding that the grantors would retain some control over it in exchange for the discount.\n\nNow, let's think about the enforceability. Generally, reverters for a specific purpose or condition are enforceable if they're not too vague or against public policy.\n\nIn this case, the condition is clear: no mortgaging or encumbering while either grantor is alive. So, it's not vague.\n\nIs it against public policy? Probably not, since it's a private agreement between parties, and it's not perpetuating any illegal or unethical behavior.\n\nSo, between the options, I'm leaning towards Option D: yes, the provision is enforceable because it's generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nOption C mentions the blood relationship and \"in pari mutual,\" which might be relevant in some jurisdictions, but I'm not sure if that's the primary reason for enforceability. Maybe it adds some weight, but I think the main reason is that it's a reasonable restraint.\n\nOption A suggests it's unreasonable, but I don't think that's the case here, given that the restriction is limited in time to the lifetime of the surviving grantor.\n\nOption B is too absolute; reverters aren't always unenforceable; it depends on the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is Option D: yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
