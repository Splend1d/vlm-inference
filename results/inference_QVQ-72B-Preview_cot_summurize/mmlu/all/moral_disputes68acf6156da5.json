                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"A war over ideological differences carried out by methods short of sustained overt military action and usually without breaking off diplomatic relations is known as...\". And the options are:\n\nA. a war simpliciter.\n\nB. a hot war.\n\nC. a cold war.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. The question is about a type of conflict that's driven by differences in ideology, like political or economic systems, but it's not a full-blown, constant military battle. And, importantly, it usually doesn't involve cutting off diplomatic relations.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"war simpliciter\" means. \"Simpliciter\" is a Latin term that means \"in a simple or absolute sense.\" So, \"war simpliciter\" would just be war in its most basic sense, without any modifiers. That doesn't seem to fit the description because the question is specifying a particular kind of war with specific characteristics.\n\nNext, option B is \"a hot war.\" I think of a hot war as an active military conflict with open hostilities, like battles and bombings. But the question says the methods are \"short of sustained overt military action,\" so this doesn't seem to match either.\n\nOption C is \"a cold war.\" I've heard of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union after World War II. It was characterized by political and ideological tensions but without direct military engagement between the two superpowers. They competed in areas like economics, propaganda, and proxy wars in other countries, but didn't fight each other directly.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"usually without breaking off diplomatic relations.\" During the Cold War, there were times when diplomatic relations were strained, but they were never completely severed between the US and the USSR. So, that seems to align with the description.\n\nLet me see if there's any other term that might fit better. There's \"proxy war,\" where countries support different sides in a conflict without directly fighting each other, but that's more specific than the general concept the question is describing.\n\nOr, maybe \"asymmetric warfare,\" but that refers to conflicts where adversaries differ in military capability or type of strategy, which isn't quite the same as a war over ideological differences conducted without direct military action.\n\nAnother thought: \"hybrid warfare\" combines conventional and unconventional tactics, but again, that might not capture the essence of the question.\n\nLooking back at the options, it seems like \"a cold war\" fits the bill. It's a conflict driven by ideological differences, carried out through means other than direct, sustained military action, and typically without severing diplomatic relations.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider option D: \"none of the above.\" But given that the description matches what I know about a cold war, I think C is the correct answer.\n\nMaybe I should check if there's any other context or nuance I'm missing. The question is pretty straightforward, defining a specific type of conflict based on its nature and methods. It's not trying to trick me with technicalities, I don't think.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is C. a cold war.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
