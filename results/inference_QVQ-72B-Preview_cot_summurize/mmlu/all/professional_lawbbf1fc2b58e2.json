                    "text": "So I've got this contract law problem here, and I need to figure out if the supplier's statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's an appliance manufacturer who calls a supplier on June 1 to ask if they can provide 300 washing machine motors by October 1. The supplier says yes, at $300 per motor, totaling $90,000. The manufacturer's rep says, \"Deal.\" So, it seems like they've reached an oral agreement.\n\nThe next day, the manufacturer's rep sends an unsigned note on company letterhead to the supplier, saying, \"I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order.\" Then, the manufacturer sends catalogs to its regular customers, advertising washing machines that include these specific motors.\n\nBut on July 1, the supplier calls back and says they can't supply the motors because they're no longer carrying that model. At that point, the manufacturer hasn't received any orders for the machines with those motors yet.\n\nNow, the manufacturer is suing the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier is using the statute of frauds as a defense. I need to see if that defense is likely to succeed.\n\nOkay, so the statute of frauds generally requires that certain contracts be in writing to be enforceable. In many jurisdictions, contracts for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more need to be in writing. Here, the total price is $90,000, which definitely exceeds that threshold.\n\nSo, for this contract to be enforceable, there needs to be some writing that evidences the contract.\n\nLooking at the communications:\n\n1. There was a telephone conversation on June 1 where they agreed on the terms.\n\n2. The next day, the manufacturer sent an unsigned note on company letterhead to the supplier, expressing happiness about the supply of motors and mentioning another order.\n\n3. The manufacturer also sent catalogs to its customers advertising washing machines with these motors.\n\nNow, the supplier is arguing that the statute of frauds applies because there's no proper written contract.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\nA. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\n\nHmm, reliance might be a way to enforce the contract despite the lack of a written agreement. But I think there needs to be some writing that confirms the contract, even if it's just a quantity term.\n\nWait, in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs the sale of goods, there's a provision that allows enforcement of a contract even if it's not fully written, as long as there's some written evidence that shows that a contract for a specified quantity was made.\n\nSpecifically, UCC \u00a72-201(1) generally requires a writing for contracts over $500, but under UCC \u00a72-201(2), a contract may be enforced if there's a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought that indicates the quantity term.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer sent an unsigned note, so it's not signed by the supplier. The supplier called back on July 1 to say they can't supply the motors, which might imply that they didn't object to the contents of the note, but they also didn't confirm it.\n\nOption B says: No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.\n\nBut did the supplier actually receive the note? The problem says the manufacturer sent the note, but it doesn't specify if the supplier acknowledged receiving it or not. Maybe I need to assume that the supplier received the note since they called back on July 1.\n\nIf the supplier received the note and didn't object to its contents, could that be considered acceptance or confirmation of the contract terms?\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe in some contexts, failure to object could imply acceptance, but I think there needs to be clearer evidence.\n\nOption C says: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\n\nWell, the note was unsigned, but it was on company letterhead. Does that make a difference?\n\nIn the UCC, the writing needs to be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Here, the manufacturer is the buyer, and the supplier is the seller. The note was from the manufacturer to the supplier, so it's the buyer signing, not the seller.\n\nWait, the statute requires the writing to be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the supplier is the party against whom enforcement is being sought (since the manufacturer is suing the supplier for breach).\n\nSo, the writing needs to be signed by the supplier to be enforceable against the supplier.\n\nThe note was sent by the manufacturer and was unsigned, so it doesn't satisfy that requirement.\n\nBut, perhaps there's another writing that could satisfy the statute.\n\nWait, the catalogs were sent to the manufacturer's customers, advertising washing machines with these specific motors. Does that have any relevance?\n\nMaybe, because it shows that the manufacturer relied on the contract by advertising the products.\n\nBut again, it's not a writing signed by the supplier.\n\nOption D says: Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n\nGiven that the note was unsigned and didn't include a quantity term, and the catalogs were sent by the manufacturer to its customers, not to the supplier, it seems like there's no writing that includes the quantity term signed by the supplier.\n\nBut, maybe the telephone conversation counts as some sort of writing if there's evidence of it.\n\nWait, oral agreements can sometimes be enforced if there's other evidence to support them, but generally, for sales over $500, there needs to be a writing.\n\nUnless there's some exception applying here.\n\nOption A mentions reliance: the manufacturer distributed catalogs in reliance on the contract.\n\nIn some cases, reliance can be a way to enforce a contract even without a written agreement, but I think there still needs to be some writing that indicates the contract's existence.\n\nI need to recall the specific UCC provisions here.\n\nUCC \u00a72-201(3) provides exceptions to the writing requirement:\n\na) Admission in pleadings: if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in pleadings, testimony, or otherwise in court that a contract was made.\n\nb) Payment or receipt of goods: if goods have been received and accepted, or payment has been made.\n\nc) Admissions by the party: if an oral contract has been made and the party seeking to enforce it has in good faith relied on it to their detriment.\n\nBut in this case, the manufacturer has relied on the contract by advertising the washing machines, but they haven't received any orders yet.\n\nSo, they've relied on the contract, but there's no writing that satisfies the statute of frauds.\n\nUnless the note sent by the manufacturer can be considered as part of the writing, even if it's unsigned.\n\nBut the note was from the manufacturer to the supplier, and it's unsigned, so it doesn't satisfy the requirement for the supplier's signature.\n\nMaybe the supplier's oral agreement over the phone could be considered as part of the writing, but I don't think that's how it works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the supplier's failure to object to the note could be seen as implicit confirmation of the contract terms.\n\nBut that seems tenuous.\n\nGiven that, I think the supplier's statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed because there's no writing signed by the supplier that contains the quantity term.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D: Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I look at UCC \u00a72-201(1), it requires a writing sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought, and specifying the quantity term.\n\nIn this case, the party against whom enforcement is sought is the supplier, and there's no writing signed by the supplier that specifies the quantity term.\n\nThe manufacturer's unsigned note doesn't satisfy this requirement.\n\nThe catalogs sent to customers also don't qualify, as they are not signed by the supplier and are not part of the agreement between the manufacturer and the supplier.\n\nTherefore, the supplier's statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
