                    "text": "So I'm here trying to figure out what Cicero, the ancient Roman philosopher and statesman, would say about certain moral dilemmas. The question is asking about his stance on whether it's ever permissible to commit acts of injustice, break promises, or steal. The options are A. commit acts of injustice, B. break one's promises, C. steal, or D. none of the above.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some of Cicero's ethical views. I know that Cicero was deeply influenced by Stoic philosophy, which emphasizes virtue, reason, and living in accordance with nature. Stoics believed in absolute moral principles that shouldn't be compromised, no matter the circumstances. Given that, I would imagine that Cicero would discourage acts of injustice, breaking promises, and stealing under any circumstances. So, perhaps the answer is D. none of the above.\n\nBut wait, I should think more carefully. Maybe there are exceptions that Cicero might consider permissible. For instance, if breaking a promise could save someone's life, would that be acceptable? Or if stealing food is the only way to feed one's starving family, what would Cicero say about that?\n\nLet me consider his work \"On Duty\" (\"De Officiis\"), where he discusses ethical behavior based on natural law and the duties derived from it. In Book I, Cicero outlines three levels of duty: the strictest duty, the medium duty, and the lenient duty. The strictest duty is aligned with perfect moral conduct, while the lenient duty allows for some flexibility based on circumstances.\n\nPerhaps, in certain extreme situations, Cicero might allow for actions that deviate from strict moral principles if they are necessary to prevent greater evils. For example, he might consider it permissible to break a promise if doing so prevents harm to innocent people.\n\nHowever, I need to verify this. Let's look at a specific example. Suppose someone makes a promise to keep a secret, but later learns that the secret could lead to a serious crime or harm to others if not disclosed. Would Cicero consider breaking the promise in this case?\n\nIn \"On Duty,\" Cicero discusses the conflict between justice and other virtues. He argues that while justice is fundamental, there may be situations where other virtues, such as wisdom or courage, might require one to act in a way that seems to contradict justice temporarily. But he also emphasizes that such actions should be exceptional and guided by the greater good.\n\nSo, perhaps Cicero would allow for breaking a promise in extreme circumstances where a higher moral good is at stake. That would make option B. break one's promises a possible answer.\n\nWhat about committing acts of injustice? Justice is a core Stoic virtue, so it seems unlikely that Cicero would condone acts of injustice under any circumstances. Injustice would involve harming others unfairly, which contradicts Stoic ethics. Therefore, option A. commit acts of injustice seems less plausible.\n\nAs for stealing, it's similar to injustice in that it involves taking something that doesn't belong to you, which is against the principle of justice. However, suppose someone steals food to prevent their family from starving. Would Cicero consider this permissible?\n\nIn \"On Duty,\" Cicero does acknowledge that extreme necessity might sometimes require exceptional measures. He might argue that while stealing is generally wrong, in a situation where no other option exists to save lives, it could be considered a lesser evil.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Stoicism places a high value on virtue and moral integrity, and would likely view stealing as inherently wrong, regardless of the circumstances. Perhaps Cicero would suggest that there are other ways to address such dire situations without resorting to theft, such as seeking help from others or accepting one's fate.\n\nGiven that, I'm torn between options B and C. On one hand, breaking a promise might be seen as permissible in certain extreme circumstances, whereas stealing seems more clearly against Stoic principles.\n\nLet me consider another angle. In Stoic philosophy, actions are judged based on the intention behind them and whether they align with reason and virtue. If someone breaks a promise with the intention to prevent greater harm, perhaps that could be seen as an act of wisdom rather than injustice.\n\nOn the other hand, stealing, even with the best intentions, still involves taking what isn't yours, which is a violation of another person's rights and property, which is against justice.\n\nTherefore, it seems that breaking a promise might be more permissible under certain conditions than stealing.\n\nNow, let's think about injustice more broadly. If injustice encompasses not just stealing but any act that harms others unfairly, would Cicero ever consider such acts permissible?\n\nGiven his emphasis on virtue and the common good, it's hard to imagine he would condone acts of injustice. However, in situations where one must choose the lesser evil, perhaps some acts could be considered justifiable.\n\nFor example, if a leader must sacrifice a few to save many, would that be seen as an act of injustice or as a necessary decision for the greater good?\n\nThis is tricky. Cicero was a statesman and understood the complexities of real-world decision-making. He might argue that in such cases, the action is not inherently unjust but is instead a difficult choice made with the intent to maximize good.\n\nBut again, this seems more about the context and intentions rather than condoning injustice per se.\n\nGiven all this, I'm still leaning towards option B. break one's promises as something Cicero might consider permissible under certain extreme circumstances.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether he would allow for any of these actions. Maybe his strict adherence to Stoic virtues would prevent him from condoning any of these behaviors, even in extreme situations.\n\nBut I recall that in \"On Duty,\" Cicero does discuss the concept of \"equity,\" which allows for adjustments to strict moral rules in exceptional cases. Perhaps this equity could apply to breaking promises in certain scenarios.\n\nOn the other hand, stealing seems more clearly against his principles, as it involves taking something that belongs to another without permission.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is likely B. break one's promises, as Cicero might consider this permissible in extreme circumstances where a higher moral good is at stake.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
