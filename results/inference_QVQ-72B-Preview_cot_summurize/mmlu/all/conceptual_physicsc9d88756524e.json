                    "text": "So I have this question about light bending when it enters a prism. It says that white light enters a prism and green light is bent more than... and then there are options: blue light, violet light, red light, or none of these choices is correct. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that when white light passes through a prism, it separates into different colors, right? Like a rainbow. That's called refraction. Each color bends at a slightly different angle because the prism has different refractive indices for different wavelengths.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about green light being bent more than which of these options: blue, violet, or red. Or if none of these are correct.\n\nI recall that in the visible spectrum, violet light has the shortest wavelength and red has the longest. The order from shortest to longest wavelength is violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.\n\nIn a prism, the shorter the wavelength, the more it bends. So, violet bends the most, and red bends the least.\n\nSo, if green is between blue and yellow, its wavelength is longer than blue and shorter than yellow.\n\nWait, actually, in the visible spectrum, green is between blue and yellow, with a longer wavelength than blue and a shorter wavelength than yellow.\n\nBut I need to think about how much green is bent compared to the options given.\n\nOption A is blue light. Blue has a shorter wavelength than green, so it should bend more than green.\n\nOption B is violet light, which has an even shorter wavelength than blue, so it should bend even more than blue.\n\nOption C is red light, which has a longer wavelength than green, so it should bend less than green.\n\nOption D says none of these choices is correct.\n\nSo, based on this, green should be bent more than red, but less than blue or violet.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. red light.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIf violet bends the most, then green bends less than violet, blue bends less than violet but more than green, and red bends the least.\n\nSo, green bends more than red, but less than blue and violet.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"green light is bent more than red light\" is correct.\n\nBut the question says \"green light is bent more than...\" and then gives options A. blue light, B. violet light, C. red light, D. none of these choices is correct.\n\nSo, if green bends more than red, but less than blue and violet, then the correct choice should be C. red light.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, it might be tricky. It says \"green light is bent more than...\" and then gives three options. So, if green is bent more than red, but not more than blue or violet, then among the options, only red is correct.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"green light is bent more than...\" and then gives options A. blue light, B. violet light, C. red light, D. none of these choices is correct.\n\nGiven that green bends more than red but less than blue and violet, the correct answer should be C. red light.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick here. Maybe the question is asking for the option that green bends more than, which would be red, but also considering if none of the choices are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is incomplete or missing something.\n\nLet me read it again: \"When white light enters a prism green light is bent more than\n\nA. blue light.\n\nB. violet light.\n\nC. red light.\n\nD. None of these choices is correct.\"\n\nSo, based on my understanding, green is bent more than red, but less than blue and violet.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. red light.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the refractive indices.\n\nIn a typical glass prism, violet light has the highest refractive index, so it bends the most, followed by blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.\n\nSo, the order of bending from most to least is: violet > blue > green > yellow > orange > red.\n\nTherefore, green bends more than yellow, orange, and red, but less than blue and violet.\n\nSince yellow isn't an option, and orange isn't listed, only red is given as an option that green bends more than.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. red light.\n\nI think the answer is C. red light.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
