                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I decided to swim in the river upstream of a lot of farmland.\" Okay, so someone is swimming in a river that's located upstream of farmland. I need to consider if this action is morally wrong. Morality usually involves considerations of right and wrong behavior towards others or the environment. So, is there something inherently wrong with swimming in a river near farmland?\n\nWell, rivers are common places for swimming, especially in rural areas where there's farmland. But the mention of farmland might imply that there could be agricultural runoff or something like that, which could make the water unsafe for swimming. But the question is about the morality of the action, not the wisdom or safety of it.\n\nIs swimming there harming anyone else? Probably not directly. It's not like the person is polluting the water or interfering with the farmland operations by swimming upstream. Unless there's some specific context I'm missing, it seems like a personal choice that doesn't directly affect others in a negative way.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, I don't think this is clearly morally wrong. It might be unwise if the water is contaminated, but that's more of a prudential issue than a moral one.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I bound her arms and legs and lashed her with a whip, consensually.\" Okay, this one is a bit more complex. It involves binding someone's arms and legs and using a whip on them, but it's specified that this is consensual.\n\nConsent is a crucial element in moral evaluations, especially in activities that could be potentially harmful or invasive. If all parties involved agree to the activity and it's done consensually, then it's generally not considered morally wrong in liberal societies like the US.\n\nHowever, there might be legal considerations or specific contexts where even consensual activities are regulated or prohibited. But according to ordinary moral standards, as long as the activity is between consenting adults and doesn't involve coercion or harm beyond what was consented to, it's not clearly morally wrong.\n\nThat being said, some people might find such activities distasteful or morally reprehensible based on their personal values or religious beliefs. But from a broader, societal perspective in the US as of 2020, consensual adult activities like this are generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, neither scenario seems to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In the first scenario, swimming in a river upstream of farmland doesn't seem to harm anyone else directly, so it's not wrong. In the second scenario, the activity is consensual, so again, it's not clearly morally wrong.\n\nYeah, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
