                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this legal scenario about a baseball card dealer who tried to sell a fake card to a collector using a courier. The dealer gave the courier a counterfeit card instead of the real one, and the police stopped the courier before he left the city. Now, the dealer is charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses. The question is about whether the scheme had progressed far enough to constitute an attempt, and there are options about what the dealer should claim regarding the courier's involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes an \"attempt\" in this context. In criminal law, an attempt is when someone takes a substantial step towards committing a crime but doesn't complete it. So, the dealer is being charged with trying to get money through false pretenses, meaning he intended to deceive the collector by selling a fake card.\n\nThe dealer is arguing that the scheme hadn't progressed far enough to be considered an attempt. So, he needs to show that he didn't take substantial steps towards completing the crime.\n\nOption A suggests that it would be to his advantage to claim that the courier was his accomplice and was participating in the scheme to get a share of the proceeds. If the courier was an accomplice, that might imply that the dealer had someone else involved in the plan, which could show that the scheme was more developed. But if the courier was just following orders and didn't know about the fake card, maybe that changes things.\n\nOption B says it's to his advantage to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme and was simply hired to make the delivery. This seems like a defense where the dealer is trying to show that the courier was just an innocent party, unaware of the fraud. If the courier didn't know about the fake card, maybe the dealer can argue that there was no conspiracy or agreement, and thus the scheme wasn't as far along as the prosecution claims.\n\nOption C is similar to B but says the courier was hired by the collector. Wait, in the scenario, it says the courier was hired by the dealer to pick up the card and take it to the collector. So, if the dealer claims the courier was hired by the collector, that might change the relationship. But according to the scenario, the courier was hired by the dealer. So, maybe the dealer can't just claim the courier was hired by the collector because that contradicts the facts.\n\nOption D says it makes no difference whether the courier was the dealer's accomplice or was an innocent agent. This seems to suggest that regardless of the courier's knowledge or role, it doesn't affect the dealer's liability for attempted fraud.\n\nI need to think about which of these options would best help the dealer's argument that the scheme hadn't progressed far enough to constitute an attempt.\n\nIf the dealer claims the courier was his accomplice (Option A), that might show that the scheme was more sophisticated and involved more than just him. But if the courier was stopped before delivering the card, maybe it doesn't matter who the courier was working with because the deception hadn't been completed.\n\nIf the dealer claims the courier was an innocent agent hired by the dealer (Option B), that might suggest that the courier was just following instructions and didn't know about the fake card. This could help the dealer argue that the scheme was in its early stages and hadn't progressed far enough to be considered an attempt.\n\nOption C seems less plausible because the scenario clearly states that the courier was hired by the dealer. Claiming otherwise might not hold up in court.\n\nOption D suggests that it doesn't matter whether the courier was an accomplice or not, which might not be helpful for the dealer's defense.\n\nI think Option B is the most advantageous for the dealer. By claiming that the courier was an innocent agent hired by the dealer, the dealer can argue that the scheme was not as developed as required for an attempt charge. The courier's lack of knowledge about the fake card could support the idea that the deception hadn't yet been presented to the collector, and thus the attempt was not substantial enough.\n\nAlternatively, if the courier was an accomplice, that might indicate that the scheme was more advanced, which could work against the dealer's argument that the scheme hadn't progressed far enough.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is B: it will be to his advantage to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the dealer to make the delivery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
