Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the landlord owns a two-story house and leases it fully furnished to a tenant for 10 years. So, it's a 10-year lease. During the seventh year, a storm blows off some roof shingles, and the tenant notices that there's a leak where the shingles blew off but doesn't fix it. Then, a month later, there's a heavy rainstorm, and water leaks through the roof, damaging the parquet floors in two rooms below. Now, the landlord is trying to recover the cost of this damage from the tenant.\n\nThe question is, who should be liable for this damage? The options are:\n\nA. The landlord, because he had an implied obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition.\n\nB. The landlord, because he had an affirmative obligation to deliver the premises in a reasonable state of repair.\n\nC. The landlord, because of a contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease.\n\nD. The tenant, because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which one of these is correct.\n\nFirst, let's think about the relationship between the landlord and the tenant. They have a lease agreement for 10 years, and the house was fully furnished when the tenant moved in. So, the tenant has been living there for seven years, and now there's damage to the floors due to a leaky roof caused by storm damage.\n\nLet me consider the duties of the landlord and the tenant in this situation.\n\nStarting with the landlord's obligations:\n\n- Generally, landlords have a duty to maintain the property in a habitable condition, especially regarding structural integrity and essential facilities.\n\n- They also have to ensure that the property is fit for occupation.\n\n- In many jurisdictions, there are implied warranties of habitability and quiet enjoyment.\n\nNow, regarding repairs:\n\n- Typically, landlords are responsible for maintaining the property's structural elements, like the roof, foundations, and load-bearing walls.\n\n- They also have to maintain essential facilities, like plumbing, heating, and electrical systems.\n\n- However, tenants may have obligations to maintain certain aspects of the property, like keeping it clean and preventing damage due to their use.\n\nIn this case, the damage is due to a leaky roof caused by storm damage.\n\n- Storm damage is generally considered an act of nature, not something the tenant caused.\n\n- The tenant noticed the leak but didn't make any repairs.\n\n- Then, a month later, a heavy rain caused further damage to the floors.\n\nSo, the question is whether the landlord or the tenant is responsible for the damage to the floors.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. The landlord had an implied obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition.\n\n- This seems plausible. Landlords often have an implied duty to maintain habitable conditions, especially regarding structural elements like the roof.\n\n- The roof is a critical component for protecting the interior of the house, including the floors.\n\n- If the roof was damaged and not repaired, leading to floor damage, the landlord might be responsible.\n\nB. The landlord had an affirmative obligation to deliver the premises in a reasonable state of repair.\n\n- This also sounds possible. Landlords are generally required to deliver the premises in a condition that complies with health and safety standards.\n\n- However, in this case, the damage occurred during the tenancy, not necessarily at the beginning.\n\n- But perhaps the landlord has an ongoing obligation to maintain the premises.\n\nC. The landlord has a contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease.\n\n- This seems like a strong possibility. If the lease agreement includes a clause that the landlord is responsible for repairs, then the landlord would be liable.\n\n- But I don't have the exact terms of the lease, so I need to consider whether such a clause is standard or not.\n\nD. The tenant is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.\n\n- Tenants generally have some responsibility to maintain the property, but this usually pertains to ordinary wear and tear and minor repairs.\n\n- Major structural repairs, like roof repairs, are typically the landlord's responsibility.\n\n- In this case, the damage was caused by a storm, which is an external event, not something the tenant caused through their use or negligence.\n\nNow, considering that the lease was for 10 years and the damage occurred in the seventh year, I need to think about whether the lease included any terms regarding repairs and maintenance.\n\nIf the lease is for a long term like 10 years, it's likely that there are clauses specifying who is responsible for repairs and maintenance.\n\nAssuming that the lease is silent on this matter, then general landlord-tenant law would apply.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, landlords are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the property, including the roof, and ensuring that it remains habitable throughout the tenancy.\n\nTenants, on the other hand, are generally responsible for keeping the property clean and preventing damage caused by their own actions or negligence.\n\nIn this scenario, the damage was caused by a storm, which is not something the tenant caused.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the landlord should be responsible for the damage.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any negligence on the part of the tenant that could make them liable.\n\nThe tenant noticed the leak but didn't make any repairs.\n\n- If the tenant had a duty to report such issues to the landlord, and failed to do so, that could be seen as negligence.\n\n- But even if the tenant didn't report it, if the lease places the responsibility for roof repairs on the landlord, the landlord would still be responsible.\n\n- Moreover, the tenant didn't cause the damage; it was caused by the storm.\n\n- The tenant's failure to repair might be seen as contributory negligence, but in many legal systems, the landlord's duty to maintain the property remains regardless of the tenant's actions.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the lease includes a clause requiring the tenant to maintain certain aspects of the property.\n\nIf the lease specifies that the tenant is responsible for all repairs, including roof repairs, then the tenant might be liable.\n\nHowever, such clauses are often scrutinized, especially if they place an unfair burden on the tenant.\n\nMoreover, if the damage is due to an act of God, like a storm, there might be specific provisions in the lease regarding such events.\n\nAssuming there's no such clause, or that the lease doesn't specify who is responsible for roof repairs, then default rules apply.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, roof repairs are the landlord's responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the landlord would be liable for the damage to the parquet floors caused by the leaky roof.\n\nBut let's look back at the options.\n\nOption C says: \"the landlord, because of the contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease.\"\n\nIf the lease includes such a clause, then the landlord is clearly responsible.\n\nHowever, if the lease doesn't specify this, then it falls back to general landlord-tenant law.\n\nOption A mentions an \"implied obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition.\"\n\nThis is another basis for the landlord's liability.\n\nOption B refers to an \"affirmative obligation to deliver the premises in a reasonable state of repair.\"\n\nThis might be relevant at the beginning of the tenancy, but the damage occurred during the tenancy.\n\nOption D suggests the tenant is liable because they are obligated to make ordinary repairs.\n\nBut in this case, roof repairs are not ordinary; they are structural and thus likely the landlord's responsibility.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Option C is the most accurate answer, assuming that the lease includes a clause obligating the landlord to make all necessary repairs during the term.\n\nIf the lease doesn't include such a clause, then Option A or B might apply, depending on the specific laws of the jurisdiction.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies \"under the lease,\" it's likely that Option C is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether the lease likely includes such a clause.\n\nGiven that it's a 10-year lease of a fully furnished house, it's plausible that the lease includes detailed maintenance and repair obligations.\n\nTherefore, the landlord would be liable under the terms of the lease.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
