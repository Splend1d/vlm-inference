                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about inverse proportionality. It says that x and y are inversely proportional. First off, I need to remember what that means. Inverse proportionality means that as one quantity increases, the other decreases, and their product is always constant. So, mathematically, that's x * y = k, where k is some constant.\n\nAlright, so x * y = k.\n\nNext, it says that when the sum of x and y is 42, x is twice y. Okay, so we have two equations here:\n\n1. x + y = 42\n\n2. x = 2y\n\nI think I can use these to find the value of k.\n\nLet me substitute x from the second equation into the first one.\n\nSo, 2y + y = 42 \u21d2 3y = 42 \u21d2 y = 14.\n\nThen, x = 2 * 14 = 28.\n\nNow that I have x and y, I can find k.\n\nk = x * y = 28 * 14 = 392.\n\nSo, the constant of proportionality k is 392.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the value of y when x = -8.\n\nSo, using the inverse proportionality equation:\n\nx * y = k\n\nPlug in x = -8:\n\n-8 * y = 392\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = 392 / -8 = -49.\n\nSo, y = -49.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -49\n\nB. -7\n\nC. -40\n\nD. 40\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. -49.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, inverse proportionality: x * y = k. That seems right.\n\nThen, given x + y = 42 and x = 2y.\n\nSubstituting x = 2y into the first equation: 2y + y = 42 \u21d2 3y = 42 \u21d2 y = 14.\n\nThen x = 28.\n\nk = x * y = 28 * 14 = 392. That seems correct.\n\nNow, when x = -8, -8 * y = 392 \u21d2 y = 392 / -8 = -49.\n\nThat seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are any other conditions or if I misread the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"The numbers x and y are inversely proportional. When the sum of x and y is 42, x is twice y. What is the value of y when x=-8?\"\n\nOkay, seems like I covered that.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to set up the inverse proportionality equation right away.\n\nSince x and y are inversely proportional, x * y = k.\n\nGiven that when x + y = 42, x = 2y.\n\nSo, as I did before, find y = 14 and x = 28, then k = 392.\n\nThen, for x = -8, y = k / x = 392 / -8 = -49.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the general form of inverse proportionality.\n\nIs there any chance that the relationship isn't just x * y = k, but maybe something else?\n\nWell, the problem specifically says they are inversely proportional, so x * y = k is the correct relationship.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here beyond that.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is y = -49 when x = -8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-49} \\]"
