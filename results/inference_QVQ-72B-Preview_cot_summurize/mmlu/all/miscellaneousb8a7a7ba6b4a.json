                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question: \"What term describes a word created by rearranging the letters of another word?\" And the options are A. onomatopoeia, B. malapropism, C. anagram, D. antonym. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these fits the description.\n\nFirst, let's think about what an anagram is. I recall that an anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, usually using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"silent\" and \"listen\" are anagrams. So, that seems to match the description in the question.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options to make sure they don't fit.\n\nOption A: onomatopoeia. I remember that onomatopoeia is when a word phonetically imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. Like \"buzz\" for a bee or \"splash\" for water. That's not about rearranging letters; it's about sounding like what it represents. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: malapropism. A malapropism is when a word is misused, often confused with another word that sounds similar but has a different meaning. For example, saying \"for all intensive purposes\" instead of \"for all intents and purposes.\" Again, this isn't about rearranging letters; it's about using the wrong word due to a similar sound.\n\nOption D: antonym. An antonym is a word that is the opposite in meaning to another word. For example, \"hot\" and \"cold\" are antonyms. This has nothing to do with rearranging letters; it's about opposite meanings.\n\nSo, after reviewing these options, it seems clear that \"anagram\" is the term that describes a word created by rearranging the letters of another word.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, maybe I should think of another example. Let's see, take the word \"earth\" and rearrange its letters to form \"heart.\" That's another classic example of anagrams. And indeed, anagram is the correct term for this kind of wordplay.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The question is straightforward, and based on my understanding, the answer should be C. anagram.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. anagram}} \\]"
