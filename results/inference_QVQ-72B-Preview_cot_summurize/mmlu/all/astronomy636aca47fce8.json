                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about spectral lines from hydrogen. So, in the lab, a certain hydrogen spectral line appears at 486.1 nanometers. But when we look at this star, the same line appears at 485.9 nanometers. I need to figure out what that means. The options are:\n\nA. The star is getting hotter.\n\nB. The star is getting colder.\n\nC. The star is moving toward us.\n\nD. The star is moving away from us.\n\nHmm, I remember something about redshift and blueshift in stars. Redshift means the light is shifted to longer wavelengths, which usually means the star is moving away from us. Blueshift is when the light is shifted to shorter wavelengths, meaning the star is moving towards us.\n\nSo, in this case, the wavelength observed from the star is 485.9 nm, which is shorter than the lab value of 486.1 nm. That sounds like a blueshift. So, according to that, the star should be moving towards us. That would be option C.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something else going on. The temperature of the star could affect the spectral lines, right? But the options mention the star getting hotter or colder, not that it already is hotter or colder. And the question is about what we can conclude from this observation, not necessarily about the current temperature of the star.\n\nLet me think about the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect causes the wavelength of light to appear shifted depending on the relative motion between the source and the observer. If the source is moving towards the observer, the wavelength is shortened (blueshift), and if it's moving away, the wavelength is lengthened (redshift).\n\nIn this problem, the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest wavelength, so that suggests a blueshift, meaning the star is moving towards us. So, that points to option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if temperature could have an effect here. If the star is getting hotter, would that affect the wavelength of the spectral lines? I think that higher temperatures could lead to different spectral lines or changes in the intensity of lines, but I don't recall temperature directly shifting the wavelength of a specific spectral line like this.\n\nFor example, in hotter stars, you might see different elements ionized, which could produce different lines, but the position of a specific hydrogen line should remain consistent unless there's some motion involved.\n\nSo, I don't think the temperature change would cause the wavelength to shift in this way. Therefore, options A and B probably aren't directly related to this observation.\n\nWhat about the star getting colder? Would that make the spectral lines shift to longer wavelengths? I don't think so. Cooler temperatures might lead to different spectral features, but again, not a direct shift in the wavelength of a specific line due to temperature change.\n\nMoreover, the problem is about a single spectral line of hydrogen, so I think it's safe to assume that the shift is due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's motion relative to us, rather than changes in temperature.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward conclusion is that the star is moving towards us, which is option C.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check the difference between the observed and rest wavelengths:\n\nRest wavelength = 486.1 nm\n\nObserved wavelength = 485.9 nm\n\nDifference = 486.1 nm - 485.9 nm = 0.2 nm\n\nThis is a very small shift, which suggests that the star's radial velocity is relatively small. But the direction of the shift\u2014shorter wavelength\u2014still indicates approaching motion.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is option C: the star is moving toward us.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
