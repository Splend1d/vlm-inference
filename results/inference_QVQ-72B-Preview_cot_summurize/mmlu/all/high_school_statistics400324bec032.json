                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a regression line and how removing a point changes the slope and the correlation coefficient. The point in question is (15,2), and when it's included, the slope is -0.54 and the correlation is -0.82. But when it's removed, the slope becomes -1.04 and the correlation jumps to -0.95. The question is asking what we call such a point that has this kind of impact when it's removed.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. I need to understand what makes a point \"influential\" in statistical terms.\n\nFirst off, I know that in regression analysis, we have something called \"influential points\" that can heavily affect the results. These points can be outliers, but not necessarily all outliers are influential. An outlier is just a data point that is significantly different from other observations, but it might not have a big impact on the regression line if it's not leverage.\n\nWait, what's leverage? Leverage is when a data point has extreme values in the predictor variable(s). So, if a point has an x-value that's far away from the mean of the x-values, it can have high leverage. High leverage points can be influential in pulling the regression line towards them.\n\nIn this problem, the point (15,2) is being removed, and it causes the slope to change from -0.54 to -1.04, and the correlation from -0.82 to -0.95. That's a pretty significant change. So, this point must be having a substantial influence on the regression line.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. Outlier\n\nB. Statistically significant point\n\nC. Point of discontinuity\n\nD. Influential point\n\nOkay, let's evaluate each one.\n\nOption A: Outlier. An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from other points. In regression, an outlier could be a point that doesn't fit the pattern of the data. However, not all outliers are influential. Influence in regression refers to how much a point affects the slope of the regression line. So, while this point might be an outlier, the term \"outlier\" doesn't necessarily capture its influence on the regression parameters.\n\nOption B: Statistically significant point. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. Statistical significance usually relates to whether a result is likely due to chance or not. In the context of regression, we might talk about significant predictors, but I don't think \"statistically significant point\" is a standard term for describing an influential observation. Maybe it's a misdirection.\n\nOption C: Point of discontinuity. This sounds like it might refer to a point where the function isn't continuous, but in regression analysis, we're dealing with data points, not necessarily a function defined everywhere. Unless the point is causing a break in the pattern, but that seems a bit vague. Doesn't seem directly applicable here.\n\nOption D: Influential point. This seems the most straightforward. An influential point is one that has a large effect on the estimated regression coefficients. If removing this point causes a substantial change in the slope and correlation, as described in the problem, then it fits the definition of an influential point.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Is there a difference between an outlier and an influential point? As I recalled, an outlier is an observation that is distant from other observations, but it may or may not be influential depending on its leverage. So, an outlier can be influential if it has high leverage, but not all outliers have high leverage, and not all influential points are necessarily outliers.\n\nIn this case, the point (15,2) seems to be both an outlier and influential because removing it changes the regression line significantly.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the name given to a point whose removal has this kind of effect on statistical calculations. So, based on that, \"influential point\" seems like the correct term.\n\nLet me check if there's any other perspective I should consider. Maybe I should think about the context of the problem. Is there any chance that \"statistically significant point\" could be interpreted as influential in this scenario?\n\nWell, if a point is statistically significant, it might indicate that it's having a notable impact on the results, but that's not a standard term, and it doesn't align with typical statistical terminology. So, I think it's a less accurate choice compared to \"influential point.\"\n\nWhat about \"point of discontinuity\"? That sounds more related to functions or graphs where there's an actual break in continuity. In regression, we're dealing with scatter plots and a best-fit line, not a function that has discontinuities. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nLastly, \"outlier.\" As I thought earlier, while the point might be an outlier, the term doesn't specifically capture its influence on the regression parameters. So, even if it's an outlier, the key aspect here is its influence on the statistical calculations.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate term for such a point, based on the description provided, is an \"influential point.\"\n\nI think the answer is D. Influential point.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
