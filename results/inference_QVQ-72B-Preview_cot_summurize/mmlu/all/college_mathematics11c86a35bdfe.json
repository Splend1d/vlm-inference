                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that the curves \\( y = (\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 \\) and \\( y = (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4 \\) intersect at \\( x = 0 \\), and \\( a \\) is the smallest positive value of \\( x \\) where they next intersect. I need to find the area between these two curves from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = a \\).\n\nFirst, I need to find out where these two curves intersect again after \\( x = 0 \\). Since they intersect at \\( x = 0 \\), and \\( a \\) is the next intersection point, I should find the values of \\( x \\) where \\( (\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 = (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4 \\).\n\nSo, let's set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n(\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 = (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4\n\\]\n\nSince both sides are raised to the fourth power, I can take the fourth root of both sides, but I have to be careful with the signs. However, since we're dealing with squares and fourth powers, both sides are non-negative, so I can safely take the fourth root without worrying about extraneous solutions.\n\n\\[\n\\sin x + \\cos x = \\sin x - \\cos x\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. If I have \\( a^4 = b^4 \\), then \\( a = b \\) or \\( a = -b \\). So, taking the fourth root, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x + \\cos x = \\sin x - \\cos x \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\sin x + \\cos x = -(\\sin x - \\cos x) = -\\sin x + \\cos x\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x + \\cos x = \\sin x - \\cos x \\\\\n\\cos x + \\cos x = 0 \\\\\n2 \\cos x = 0 \\\\\n\\cos x = 0 \\\\\nx = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nNow, the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x + \\cos x = -\\sin x + \\cos x \\\\\n\\sin x + \\cos x + \\sin x - \\cos x = 0 \\\\\n2 \\sin x = 0 \\\\\n\\sin x = 0 \\\\\nx = n\\pi, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nSo, combining these, the solutions are \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\) and \\( x = n\\pi \\). Since they already intersect at \\( x = 0 \\), the next smallest positive intersection should be at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). So, \\( a = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the area between the two curves from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). To do that, I need to integrate the absolute difference between the two functions over that interval.\n\nSo, the area \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} |(\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 - (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4| \\, dx\n\\]\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the expression inside the absolute value. Let's expand both terms.\n\nRecall that \\( (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3 b + 6a^2 b^2 + 4a b^3 + b^4 \\), and similarly for \\( (a - b)^4 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n(\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 = \\sin^4 x + 4 \\sin^3 x \\cos x + 6 \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x + 4 \\sin x \\cos^3 x + \\cos^4 x\n\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[\n(\\sin x - \\cos x)^4 = \\sin^4 x - 4 \\sin^3 x \\cos x + 6 \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x - 4 \\sin x \\cos^3 x + \\cos^4 x\n\\]\n\nSubtracting these:\n\n\\[\n(\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 - (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4 = 8 \\sin^3 x \\cos x + 8 \\sin x \\cos^3 x = 8 \\sin x \\cos x (\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n8 \\sin x \\cos x = 4 \\sin 2x\n\\]\n\nWait, how did I get from \\( 8 \\sin x \\cos x \\) to \\( 4 \\sin 2x \\)? Actually, \\( \\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x \\), so \\( 8 \\sin x \\cos x = 4 \\cdot 2 \\sin x \\cos x = 4 \\sin 2x \\).\n\nSo, the integrand becomes \\( |4 \\sin 2x| \\). Since \\( \\sin 2x \\) is non-negative in \\( [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}] \\), the absolute value isn't necessary, and the area is:\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} 4 \\sin 2x \\, dx\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute this integral.\n\nLet \\( u = 2x \\), then \\( du = 2 \\, dx \\), so \\( dx = \\frac{du}{2} \\).\n\nWhen \\( x = 0 \\), \\( u = 0 \\), and when \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), \\( u = \\pi \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} 4 \\sin u \\cdot \\frac{du}{2} = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin u \\, du = 2 \\left[ -\\cos u \\right]_{0}^{\\pi} = 2 \\left( -(-1) - (-1) \\right) = 2(1 + 1) = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area between the two curves from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) is 4.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. \u03c0\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 3\u03c0/2\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
