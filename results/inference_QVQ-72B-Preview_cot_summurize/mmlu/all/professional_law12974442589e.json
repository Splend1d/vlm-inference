In order to practice each day, she had to travel to a school of performing arts to use its musical facilities. Finally, the pianist decided to move out of her apartment and buy a more spacious home, where she could have her own piano. As she was house hunting, the pianist found a quaint home in the county that she wanted. She put a bid down on the home with the seller's broker. She was informed that the owner was in Europe on a business trip and would not be entertaining any offers until he returned. While she was awaiting word on the county property, the pianist's friend orally agreed to sell his piano to her for $8,000. The pianist explained that she wanted the piano only if she should succeed in her efforts to buy the county home. For this reason, the parties agreed that the piano sale would not take effect unless the pianist bought the county home. The next day, the parties reduced their oral agreement to a signed writing, but did not include in the writing any mention that the sale would not take effect unless the pianist bought the county home. Two weeks later, the owner of the county property returned from a trip and rejected the pianist's offer. The friend now brings an action against the pianist for breach of contract to buy the piano.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a pianist who wants to buy a piano but only if she can buy a specific house in the county. She makes an oral agreement with her friend to buy his piano for $8,000, but they agree that the sale won't take effect unless she buys that county home. Then they put it in writing, but they didn't include that condition in the written agreement. Later, she tries to buy the house, but the owner says no, and now her friend is suing her for not buying the piano. She wants to introduce evidence that she didn't buy the house to show she doesn't have to buy the piano. The question is, how should the court rule on this?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the agreement between the pianist and her friend. They had an oral agreement that the piano sale was contingent on her buying the county home. Then they wrote down the agreement, but didn't include that contingency in the written contract. So, the written agreement seems to say she'll buy the piano without any conditions.\n\nNow, her friend is suing her for not buying the piano, and she wants to bring up the fact that she didn't buy the house to show that the piano sale shouldn't go through. The question is whether this evidence is admissible in court.\n\nOption A says the evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement didn't become a contract because the condition wasn't met. Option B says it's admissible to show frustration of the purpose of the contract. Option C says it's barred because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds. Option D says it's barred because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n\nI need to think about contract law here, especially regarding the parol evidence rule. The parol evidence rule generally says that oral agreements that were made before or at the same time as a written contract can't be used to contradict the written contract. So, if there's a written agreement that's clear and complete, you can't introduce previous oral agreements to change its terms.\n\nIn this case, the written agreement seems to say she'll buy the piano without any conditions, but the prior oral agreement had a condition that she had to buy the county home first.\n\nSo, according to the parol evidence rule, if the written agreement is complete and unambiguous, the oral agreement can't be used to add conditions that aren't in the written agreement. That would be contradicting the written agreement.\n\nBut, there might be exceptions or nuances here. Maybe the written agreement wasn't intended to be the final agreement, or maybe there was a misunderstanding between the parties.\n\nLet me consider if the written agreement was intended to be a formal contract. If it was just a memorandum of the oral agreement, and they didn't intend for it to be the final agreement, then maybe the oral terms can be considered.\n\nBut, the problem says they \"reduced their oral agreement to a signed writing,\" which sounds like they were formalizing their agreement in writing. So, probably, they intended for the written agreement to be the contract.\n\nIf that's the case, then the parol evidence rule would prevent the pianist from introducing evidence of the prior oral agreement to add a condition that's not in the written agreement.\n\nWait, but the problem says that in the oral agreement, they agreed that the piano sale wouldn't take effect unless she bought the county home. So, the condition was part of the agreement from the beginning, and they later put the agreement in writing but left out that condition.\n\nSo, did they intentionally leave out the condition, or was it an oversight?\n\nIf they intentionally left it out, then the written agreement stands as is, and she can't introduce the prior oral agreement to add the condition.\n\nIf it was an oversight, maybe there's a way to correct the written agreement to include the condition they both agreed on.\n\nBut, generally, if there's a discrepancy between the oral and written agreements, and the written agreement is clear and complete, the written agreement prevails.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the condition is a condition precedent. A condition precedent is something that must happen before a party's obligation to perform under the contract arises.\n\nIn this case, the condition was that she had to buy the county home before she was obligated to buy the piano. So, if she didn't buy the house, she wouldn't have to buy the piano.\n\nIf that condition was part of the original agreement, but left out of the written agreement, and now she wants to introduce evidence of that condition, the parol evidence rule would generally prevent that.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the written agreement was incomplete or there was a mutual mistake in not including the condition.\n\nBut, the problem doesn't specify any mistake or incompleteness in the written agreement. It just says they didn't include the condition in the writing.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the written agreement is complete and unambiguous, and she can't introduce the prior oral agreement to add a condition.\n\nBut, let's look at the options again.\n\nOption A says the evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement didn't become a contract because the condition wasn't met.\n\nBut, if the written agreement is a standalone contract without the condition, and she signed it, then it's a valid contract, regardless of the prior oral agreement.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the entire agreement was conditional, and without the condition being met, there was no agreement.\n\nBut, generally, if they signed a written agreement to buy the piano without any conditions, that's a valid contract, and she can't back out just because she didn't buy the house.\n\nOption B says the evidence is admissible to show frustration of the purpose of the contract.\n\nFrustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines the fundamental purpose of the contract, making performance meaningless.\n\nIn this case, her purpose was to buy the piano only if she bought the house. But, if she signed a contract to buy the piano without that condition, then her personal desire to have the piano only if she buys the house doesn't frustrate the purpose of the contract.\n\nThe contract is to buy the piano, and she agreed to that in writing.\n\nSo, I don't think frustration of purpose applies here.\n\nOption C says the evidence is barred because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds.\n\nThe statute of frauds generally requires that certain contracts be in writing to be enforceable, such as contracts for the sale of goods over a certain amount, typically $500.\n\nIn this case, the piano is being sold for $8,000, which is over $500, so it would need to be in writing.\n\nBut, they did have a signed writing, according to the problem. They reduced their oral agreement to a signed writing.\n\nSo, the statute of frauds has been satisfied because there's a signed writing.\n\nTherefore, option C doesn't apply.\n\nOption D says the evidence is barred because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n\nThis seems to align with the parol evidence rule.\n\nThe written agreement says she'll buy the piano, without any conditions.\n\nThe oral agreement had a condition that she had to buy the county home first.\n\nSo, introducing evidence of the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement.\n\nTherefore, under the parol evidence rule, this evidence should be barred.\n\nSo, according to this analysis, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that the evidence could be admissible to show that the written agreement didn't become a contract?\n\nWell, if the entire agreement was conditional, and the condition wasn't met, then perhaps the contract never came into existence.\n\nBut, in this case, they signed a written agreement to buy the piano, which is a standalone contract.\n\nSo, unless there was some condition precedent attached to the signing of that agreement, which isn't mentioned, the written agreement is a valid contract once signed.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the correct answer.\n\nThe evidence is barred because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
