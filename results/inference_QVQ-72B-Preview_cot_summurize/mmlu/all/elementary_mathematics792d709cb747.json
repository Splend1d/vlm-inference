I need to find which pair of numbers, when rounded to the nearest hundred, both round to 1,500.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how rounding works. When rounding to the nearest hundred, I look at the tens and units place of the number. If the tens and units digits combined are 50 or above, the hundreds place rounds up. If they're below 50, it stays the same.\n\nSo, for a number to round to 1,500, it should be between 1,450 and 1,549, inclusive. Because:\n\n- 1,450 to 1,549 rounds to 1,500\n\n- 1,450 would round up to 1,500\n\n- 1,549 would round down to 1,500\n\nAnything below 1,450 would round down to 1,400, and anything above 1,549 would round up to 1,600.\n\nOkay, so my range is 1,450 to 1,549.\n\nNow, I need to check each pair to see if both numbers fall within this range.\n\nLet's start with option A: 1,399 and 1,599\n\n1,399 is below 1,450, so it rounds down to 1,400. 1,599 is above 1,549, so it rounds up to 1,600. Neither rounds to 1,500. So, option A is out.\n\nNext, option B: 1,449 and 1,549\n\n1,449 is below 1,450, so it rounds down to 1,400. 1,549 is right on the boundary, so it rounds down to 1,500. Only one of them rounds to 1,500. So, option B is not correct.\n\nOption C: 1,457 and 1,547\n\n1,457 is above 1,450, so it rounds up to 1,500. 1,547 is below 1,550, so it rounds down to 1,500. Both numbers round to 1,500. This looks promising.\n\nOption D: 1,489 and 1,589\n\n1,489 is above 1,450, so it rounds up to 1,500. 1,589 is above 1,549, so it rounds up to 1,600. Only one of them rounds to 1,500. So, option D is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: 1,457 and 1,547.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn option C, 1,457 is 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred because 57 is above 50. And 1,547 is also 1,500 because 47 is below 50. So, both numbers in option C correctly round to 1,500.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret rounding to the nearest hundred.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the standard rounding rule: if the digit after the hundreds place is 5 or greater, round up; if it's less than 5, round down.\n\nApplying this to option C:\n\n1,457: the digits after the hundreds place are 57, which is greater than 50, so it rounds up to 1,500.\n\n1,547: the digits after the hundreds place are 47, which is less than 50, so it rounds down to 1,500.\n\nPerfect, that matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, the final answer is option C: 1,457 and 1,547.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
