                    "text": "So I have this question about the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and it's asking in which stage an indigent person does not have that right. The options are preliminary hearing, arraignment, investigative surveillance, and post-charge lineups. I need to figure out which one of these doesn't guarantee the right to counsel for someone who can't afford a lawyer.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the Sixth Amendment says about the right to counsel. I know that the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to assistance of counsel for anyone accused of a crime in a criminal prosecution. But I think there are specific stages in the criminal process where this right applies and where it doesn't.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Preliminary Hearing: This is usually a proceeding where a judge decides if there's enough evidence to hold a trial. It happens after an arrest but before the trial. I think the right to counsel is important here because decisions can be made that affect the outcome of the case.\n\nB. Arraignment: This is where the accused is formally charged and pleads guilty or not guilty. It's another early stage in the criminal process. I would imagine that having a lawyer at this point is crucial because plea bargains sometimes happen right away.\n\nC. Investigative Surveillance: This seems different. It sounds like the gathering of evidence before any charges are filed. Maybe this is more about police investigations. If someone is indigent and can't afford a lawyer, does the Sixth Amendment require that they have a lawyer present during investigative surveillance? I'm not sure.\n\nD. Post-Charge Lineups: This seems like it happens after charges have been filed. Lineups are typically used to identify suspects, and if charges have already been made, then the right to counsel might apply.\n\nI need to recall if the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at all these stages. I think the right to counsel generally applies after formal charges have been filed. Before that, during investigations, the rights might be different.\n\nWait, but in the preliminary hearing, charges might be filed or specified. Similarly, at arraignment, formal charges are presented. So both of these seem to be post-charge events.\n\nInvestigative surveillance seems like it's part of the investigation phase, before charges are filed. Maybe that's why it's different.\n\nPost-charge lineups, as the name suggests, happen after charges have been filed, so the right to counsel should apply there.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me try to look up when exactly the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches.\n\nI remember that in the case of Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires states to provide counsel to indigent defendants in criminal cases. But that was about trials. Later cases expanded that right to other critical stages of the criminal process.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court has said that the right to counsel attaches at all \"critical stages\" of the criminal proceedings, where substantial rights might be affected.\n\nSo, critical stages would include the preliminary hearing, arraignment, trial, sentencing, appeals, and so on.\n\nBut investigative surveillance seems to be before any formal charges are filed. Is that considered a critical stage?\n\nI think not. I believe that during the investigative phase, before charges are filed, the right to counsel doesn't attach under the Sixth Amendment.\n\nWait, but there might be exceptions or specific scenarios where even during investigations, the right to counsel applies. For example, during interrogations, there might be Miranda rights that come into play, but that's under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nI need to distinguish between the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. The right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment is different from the right to have an attorney present during questioning under Miranda.\n\nSo, in investigative surveillance, which is likely part of the pre-charge investigation, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel probably doesn't apply.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider some case law. I recall a case called Kirby v. Illinois, where the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel doesn't attach until charges have been filed.\n\nIn that case, the Court said that the \"adversary judicial system\" begins when the government has committed itself to prosecuting someone, and the accused finds himself or herself facing the prosecutorial powers of the state.\n\nSo, in other words, the right to counsel attaches at or after the time of arraignment, when formal charges are presented.\n\nThat would mean that in investigative surveillance, which is likely before any charges are filed, there's no Sixth Amendment right to counsel for indigent persons.\n\nLet me cross-verify this. If someone is poor and can't afford a lawyer, does the state have to provide one during investigative surveillance?\n\nBased on Kirby v. Illinois, it seems that the answer is no, because charges haven't been filed yet.\n\nTherefore, investigative surveillance is the stage where an indigent person does not have the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider the other options again:\n\n- Preliminary Hearing: This is after arrest and before trial, where a judge decides if there's probable cause to hold a trial. Since charges are already filed, the right to counsel should apply.\n\n- Arraignment: This is where charges are formally presented, and the defendant pleads. Definitely a critical stage where the right to counsel applies.\n\n- Post-charge Lineups: Again, since charges have been filed, the right to counsel should be present.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. investigative surveillance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
