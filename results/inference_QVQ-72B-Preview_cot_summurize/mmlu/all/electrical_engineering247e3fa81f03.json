                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"The illumination at a point 5 meters below a lamp is 6 lux. The candle power of the lamp is A. 30 B. 140. C. 150. D. 200.\" Hmm, I need to find the candle power of the lamp based on the illumination it provides at a certain distance.\n\nFirst, I should recall what illumination and candle power are. Illumination, measured in lux, is the amount of light received per unit area. Candle power, or candela, is a measure of the luminous intensity of a light source in a particular direction. So, there must be a relationship between these two.\n\nI think the formula that connects illumination (E) with candle power (I) and distance (r) is E = I / (r^2). Is that right? It seems familiar; it's similar to the inverse square law for light intensity.\n\nLet me confirm that. Yes, in optics, the illumination intensity on a surface varies inversely with the square of the distance from the light source, assuming the light spreads out uniformly in all directions.\n\nSo, E = I / (r^2), where E is the illumination in lux, I is the candle power, and r is the distance in meters.\n\nGiven that E = 6 lux and r = 5 meters, I can plug these into the equation to solve for I.\n\nSo, 6 = I / (5^2)\n\nThat's 6 = I / 25\n\nNow, I can solve for I by multiplying both sides by 25.\n\nI = 6 * 25\n\nI = 150\n\nSo, the candle power of the lamp is 150 candela.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 30\n\nB. 140.\n\nC. 150.\n\nD. 200.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. 150.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there anything I'm missing here? Let's double-check. The formula E = I / r^2 assumes that the light source is a point source and that the surface is perpendicular to the light rays. Also, it's assuming that there's no absorption or scattering of light in the medium, which is usually the case in ideal problems.\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct. So, the answer should be C. 150.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. If the light isn't shining directly perpendicular to the surface, there would be a cosine factor involved, but the problem states that the point is directly below the lamp, so the light is perpendicular to the surface at that point.\n\nAlso, if the lamp isn't a point source, but has a larger size, that could affect the illumination, but the problem seems to treat it as a point source.\n\nTherefore, the answer should indeed be C. 150.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
