                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a freight train travels at a speed of 20 miles per hour for 6 hours, and I need to figure out how far it will travel. The options are A. 120 miles, B. 80 miles, C. 26 miles, and D. 12 miles.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. I need to find the distance that the train travels. I know that speed is basically how fast something is moving, and time is how long it moves for. So, distance should be speed multiplied by time, right? That makes sense.\n\nSo, distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nGiven that the speed is 20 miles per hour and the time is 6 hours, I should just multiply 20 by 6 to get the distance.\n\nLet me double-check that. If the train goes 20 miles in one hour, then in 6 hours, it should go 20 times 6, which is 120 miles. So, that seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me think about it again to make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other factor that could affect the distance? For example, does the weight of the train or any acceleration or deceleration matter? No, the problem says it travels at a speed of 20 miles per hour, so I assume it's moving at a constant speed without any changes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the units. The speed is in miles per hour, and the time is in hours, so multiplying them should indeed give me miles. So, that checks out.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using a formula from physics. There's the formula d = s \u00d7 t, which is what I used earlier. Alternatively, there's s = d/t, but that's for finding speed when distance and time are known. In this case, I need distance, so d = s \u00d7 t is appropriate.\n\nAnother way could be to think about it in terms of work done or something, but that might be overcomplicating it. The problem seems pretty straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any trick here. Maybe the train doesn't travel for the full 6 hours, but that doesn't seem likely. The question says it travels for 6 hours at 20 miles per hour.\n\nWait, could there be a misdirection in the options? Let's see, option A is 120 miles, which seems correct based on the calculation. Option B is 80 miles, which would be if the train traveled for 4 hours at 20 miles per hour. Maybe someone misread the time.\n\nOption C is 26 miles, which doesn't seem related to the problem. Maybe it's a distractor. Option D is 12 miles, which might be the speed if the time was 1 hour, but that's not the case.\n\nSo, based on the calculations and the given options, it seems like the correct answer should be A. 120 miles.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me plug in the numbers again. Speed is 20 miles per hour, time is 6 hours. 20 \u00d7 6 = 120 miles. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that 120 miles is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 120 \\ \\text{miles}} \\]"
