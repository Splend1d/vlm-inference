                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about matrix dimensions. It says that matrix A is 2 by 7 and matrix B is 7 by 5, and I need to figure out what the dimensions of the product matrix AB will be. The options are 2 by 2, 2 by 5, 5 by 2, or 7 by 7.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit rusty on matrix multiplication, but I remember that when you multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix has to match the number of rows in the second matrix. And the result is a matrix where the number of rows is the same as the first matrix and the number of columns is the same as the second matrix.\n\nSo, if A is 2 by 7, that means it has 2 rows and 7 columns. Matrix B is 7 by 5, which means it has 7 rows and 5 columns. Since the number of columns in A (7) matches the number of rows in B (7), I know that the multiplication is possible.\n\nNow, for the product matrix AB, the number of rows should be the same as A, which is 2, and the number of columns should be the same as B, which is 5. So, that would make AB a 2 by 5 matrix.\n\nLet me double-check that. In matrix multiplication, the dimensions of the product are (rows of A) by (columns of B). So, it's m by n, where m is the number of rows in A and n is the number of columns in B.\n\nIn this case, m is 2 and n is 5, so AB should be 2 by 5. Looking at the options:\n\nA. 2 \u00d7 2\n\nB. 2 \u00d7 5\n\nC. 5 \u00d7 2\n\nD. 7 \u00d7 7\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that it could be something else? Maybe if the matrices aren't standard or something, but no, they're just regular matrices. I don't think there's any trick here.\n\nLet me think about it another way. If I were to multiply A and B, how would I do it? I'd take each row of A and dot it with each column of B. So, for each entry in AB, it's the dot product of the ith row of A and the jth column of B.\n\nGiven that, the number of rows in AB is the same as in A, which is 2, and the number of columns is the same as in B, which is 5. So, again, that points to 2 by 5.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider the general rule for matrix multiplication.\n\nThe general rule is that if you have two matrices, A and B, where A is of size m by n and B is of size p by q, then for the product AB to exist, n must equal p. And the resulting matrix AB will be of size m by q.\n\nIn this problem, A is 2 by 7 and B is 7 by 5. So, n = 7 and p = 7, which matches, and m = 2 and q = 5, so AB should be 2 by 5.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the dimensions in terms of linear transformations, but that might be overcomplicating it. I think the basic rule suffices here.\n\nIs there any possibility of misinterpretation here? Well, maybe if the matrices couldn't be multiplied, but in this case, they can be, so that's not an issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I got confused between rows and columns, but I've double-checked that.\n\nLet me see if I can recall an example to confirm this. Suppose A is 2 by 7, so let's say:\n\nA = [a11 a12 a13 a14 a15 a16 a17]\n\n[a21 a22 a23 a24 a25 a26 a27]\n\nAnd B is 7 by 5:\n\nB = [b11 b12 b13 b14 b15]\n\n[b21 b22 b23 b24 b25]\n\n[b31 b32 b33 b34 b35]\n\n[b41 b42 b43 b44 b45]\n\n[b51 b52 b53 b54 b55]\n\n[b61 b62 b63 b64 b65]\n\n[b71 b72 b73 b74 b75]\n\nThen, AB would be a matrix where each entry is the dot product of a row of A and a column of B.\n\nSo, AB[1,1] = a11*b11 + a12*b21 + a13*b31 + a14*b41 + a15*b51 + a16*b61 + a17*b71\n\nAnd similarly for the other entries.\n\nSince A has 2 rows and B has 5 columns, AB should have 2 rows and 5 columns, which is 2 by 5.\n\nYeah, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nI think I might have overthought this a bit, but it's good to confirm from different angles.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 2 \u00d7 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
