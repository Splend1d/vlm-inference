                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a radio station trying to estimate how much their supporters contribute during a fund-drive. They took a sample of 30 supporters and found that 22 gave $60, six gave $1,000, and two gave $10,000. Now, they want to know which measure of central tendency would be the most useful based on this sample. The options are median, mode, histogram, and ANOVA.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what central tendency means. It's about finding a central value that represents the data set. There are three main measures: mean, median, and mode. The mean is the average, the median is the middle value, and the mode is the most frequent value.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- 22 supporters gave $60\n\n- 6 supporters gave $1,000\n\n- 2 supporters gave $10,000\n\nSo, total supporters: 22 + 6 + 2 = 30\n\nTotal contributions:\n\n(22 * $60) + (6 * $1,000) + (2 * $10,000) = ($1,320) + ($6,000) + ($20,000) = $27,320\n\nNow, the mean would be total contributions divided by the number of supporters: $27,320 / 30 \u2248 $910.67\n\nBut wait, the mean can be influenced by extreme values. Here, the two $10,000 contributions are quite high compared to the $60 contributions. So, the mean might not be the best representation of the typical contribution.\n\nLet's look at the median. In a sorted list of 30 numbers, the median would be the average of the 15th and 16th values.\n\nListing the contributions in order:\n\n22 times $60, then 6 times $1,000, then 2 times $10,000.\n\nSo, the first 22 values are $60, then the next 6 are $1,000, and the last 2 are $10,000.\n\nThe 15th and 16th values are both $60, since only 22 supporters gave $60.\n\nSo, the median is $60.\n\nThe mode is also $60, since that's the most frequent contribution.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Median\n\nB. Mode\n\nC. Histogram\n\nD. ANOVA\n\nBoth median and mode are measures of central tendency, while a histogram is a graphical representation of data, and ANOVA is a statistical test for comparing means among groups.\n\nGiven that the data have some extreme values ($10,000), the mean is skewed upwards. The median and mode are both $60, which seems more representative of the typical contribution since most supporters (22 out of 30) gave $60.\n\nBetween median and mode, both are similar in this case because the distribution is not symmetric due to the outliers. However, the median is less affected by extreme values and provides a central value that splits the data into halves.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, since the majority of contributions are at $60, both median and mode point to $60 as the typical contribution.\n\nI need to decide which one is more useful for the radio station.\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nThe radio station wants to estimate the typical supporter's contribution.\n\n\"Typical\" suggests a common or frequent amount.\n\nGiven that 22 out of 30 supporters gave $60, that's the most frequent amount, so the mode is $60.\n\nThe median is also $60, indicating that half of the supporters gave $60 or less.\n\nThe mean is higher at approximately $910.67, which is influenced by the two $10,000 contributions.\n\nGiven that the data are skewed due to these high contributions, the median is often preferred over the mean as a measure of central tendency in skewed distributions.\n\nMoreover, the median is robust to outliers, whereas the mean is sensitive to them.\n\nTherefore, the median would provide a better representation of the typical contribution.\n\nBut in this case, the mode is also $60, which aligns with the median.\n\nHowever, sometimes the mode can be less informative in certain contexts, especially if there are multiple modes.\n\nIn this data, there is only one mode ($60), but if there were multiple peaks, the mode might not give a clear picture.\n\nAdditionally, the median provides information about the central location of the data, not just the most frequent value.\n\nGiven that, I think the median is the most useful measure here.\n\nBut let's consider the other options.\n\nOption C is a histogram, which is a visual representation of the data distribution.\n\nIt would show the frequency of contributions at different amounts.\n\nIn this case, it would show a bar for $60 with the highest frequency, followed by $1,000 and then $10,000.\n\nWhile a histogram is informative, it's not a measure of central tendency; it's a way to visualize the data.\n\nSo, it's not the best choice for estimating the typical contribution.\n\nOption D is ANOVA, which stands for Analysis of Variance.\n\nANOVA is used to compare means across multiple groups.\n\nIn this context, there's only one group of supporters, so ANOVA isn't applicable here.\n\nTherefore, between the given options, A (median) and B (mode), the median seems more appropriate due to the skewed nature of the data.\n\nMoreover, in statistical practice, the median is often preferred over the mode in skewed distributions because it provides a better sense of the central value.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the median is the most useful measure for the radio station to estimate the typical supporter's contribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
