                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Theresa has 72 marbles, and she puts them into 9 equal groups. I need to find out how many marbles are in each group. Let's see, if she has 72 marbles and she's dividing them into 9 groups, that sounds like division, right? So, probably 72 divided by 9.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. 72 \u00f7 9 = 8\n\nB. 72 \u2013 9 = 63\n\nC. 9 + 72 = 81\n\nD. 9 \u00f7 72 = 0.125\n\nHmm, okay. Option A seems like the right one because it's dividing 72 by 9 to get the number in each group. Let me just double-check why the other options aren't correct.\n\nOption B is 72 minus 9 equals 63. That would mean subtracting 9 from 72, which doesn't make sense in this context. We're trying to find out how many are in each group, not subtracting a number.\n\nOption C is 9 plus 72 equals 81. That's just adding, which doesn't help us divide the marbles into groups.\n\nOption D is 9 divided by 72, which is 0.125. That also doesn't make sense because we're supposed to be dividing the total marbles by the number of groups, not the other way around.\n\nSo, yeah, option A seems correct. Let me just confirm by doing the math. 72 divided by 9. Well, 9 times 8 is 72, so yes, 72 \u00f7 9 = 8. So, each group has 8 marbles.\n\nI think that's it. It was pretty straightforward once I realized it's about division. Just need to remember that when you're dividing into equal groups, division is the way to go.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 72 \\div 9 = 8} \\]"
