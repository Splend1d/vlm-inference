                    "text": "So I'm reading this question about contemporary intelligence researchers complaining that schools focus too much on something. The names mentioned are Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg, who are known for their theories on intelligence. Gardner is famous for his theory of multiple intelligences, which suggests that there are several distinct forms of intelligence beyond just academic abilities, like musical, interpersonal, or bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. Robert Sternberg is known for his triarchic theory of intelligence, which includes components like analytical, creative, and practical intelligence.\n\nThe question is asking about their complaint regarding what schools focus too much on. The options are:\n\nA. nonessential subjects like art and music.\n\nB. encouraging creative thought.\n\nC. the environmental factors that influence the expression of intelligence.\n\nD. traditional subjects and methods.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what these researchers might be criticizing. Given that both Gardner and Sternberg have expanded the concept of intelligence beyond traditional academic measures, it's likely that they're critical of a narrow focus on traditional academic subjects and testing methods.\n\nOption A suggests that schools focus too much on nonessential subjects like art and music. But from what I know, Gardner particularly emphasizes the importance of these subjects as they relate to different types of intelligence. So, it seems unlikely that he would complain about schools focusing too much on them.\n\nOption B says encouraging creative thought. Again, both Gardner and Sternberg's theories place a strong emphasis on creativity as an aspect of intelligence. Sternberg, in particular, has done a lot of work on creative intelligence. So, it doesn't seem plausible that they would complain about schools focusing too much on creativity.\n\nOption C mentions environmental factors that influence the expression of intelligence. While it's true that both researchers acknowledge the role of environment in intelligence, their main criticism of schools seems to be more about the content and methods of teaching rather than ignoring environmental influences.\n\nOption D refers to traditional subjects and methods. This seems the most plausible because both Gardner and Sternberg have argued against a sole focus on traditional academic subjects like math, science, and language arts, which are typically emphasized in schools. Gardner's theory suggests that there are multiple forms of intelligence that should be nurtured, not just the academic ones. Sternberg has also criticized the overreliance on IQ tests and academic performance as the sole measures of intelligence, advocating for a more balanced approach that includes practical and creative skills.\n\nConsidering this, it makes sense that they would complain about schools focusing too much on traditional subjects and methods, as this approach doesn't account for the diverse ways in which individuals can be intelligent.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. If they were complaining about schools focusing too much on traditional subjects and methods, that would align with their theories that emphasize a broader range of intelligences and skills beyond just academic achievements.\n\nAdditionally, Gardner's multiple intelligences theory is often used in educational settings to advocate for a more diverse curriculum that caters to different strengths and learning styles. So, if anything, he would probably argue for less focus on traditional subjects and more on a variety of areas that can foster different intelligences.\n\nSimilarly, Sternberg has been critical of standardized testing and the educational system's overemphasis on test scores, which he believes don't capture the full spectrum of intelligence, especially creative and practical intelligences.\n\nTherefore, based on their theories and advocacy, it's reasonable to conclude that they complain about schools focusing too much on traditional subjects and methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
