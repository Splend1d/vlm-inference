Hmm, I need to figure this out. I think I remember Raggedy Ann from somewhere\u2014oh, it's a classic children's book character, right? Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, Raggedy Ann is a doll who appears in a series of books written by Johnny Gruelle. I think the books were popular in the early 20th century. Raggedy Ann is known for her red yarn hair and her cheerful personality. Now, the question is about her doll brother. That must mean another doll character in the series.\n\nLet me recall the names of some characters from the Raggedy Ann books. There's Raggedy Andy, who is often mentioned alongside Raggedy Ann. I think he's her brother. But let's make sure.\n\nOption A is \"Red.\" That seems plausible because Raggedy Ann has red hair, but I don't remember her brother being named Red. Maybe it's a color reference, but that seems unlikely.\n\nOption B is \"Freckles.\" That could be a possible name for a character, but I don't recall any specific character named Freckles in the Raggedy Ann series.\n\nOption C is \"Randy.\" That doesn't ring a bell immediately, but maybe it's a lesser-known character.\n\nOption D is \"Andy.\" Now, Raggedy Andy is definitely a character in the series. He's Raggedy Ann's brother, I believe. So, that seems like a strong possibility.\n\nLet me double-check this. If Raggedy Ann is the sister and Raggedy Andy is the brother, that makes sense. I think they were created together, and many of the books feature both of them.\n\nSo, based on that, I would say that the correct answer is D. Andy. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other character who could be considered Raggedy Ann's brother.\n\nIs there a possibility that one of the other names could be a brother? For instance, maybe \"Randy\" is a misremembered name or a character from another series.\n\nAlso, \"Red\" might be a reference to the color of Raggedy Ann's hair, but that doesn't seem to fit as a brother's name.\n\n\"Freckles\" could be a nickname for a character, but I don't recall any such character in the Raggedy Ann series.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. Andy, referring to Raggedy Andy, who is indeed Raggedy Ann's doll brother.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
