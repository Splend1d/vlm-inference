A. color constancy B. closure C. shape constancy D. size constancy.\"\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to figure out which of these terms describes the phenomenon where we still see a door as a rectangle, even though its appearance changes when it's open.\n\nFirst, let's think about what's happening here. When the door is closed, it looks like a rectangle, right? But when it's open, depending on the angle, the shape we see can change. Like, if the door is open at a certain angle, it might look like a parallelogram or some other shape, but we still perceive it as a rectangle. So, despite the change in the retinal image, our brain still recognizes it as the same shape.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Color constancy: This is when the perceived color of an object remains the same under different lighting conditions. For example, a red apple still looks red even in dim light or bright sunlight. But in this case, we're talking about shape, not color. So, probably not A.\n\nB. Closure: This is a principle of Gestalt psychology where we tend to see incomplete figures as complete or whole. Like, if there's a circle with a part missing, we still perceive it as a circle. But again, here we're dealing with the consistency of shape perception despite changes in perspective.\n\nC. Shape constancy: This sounds promising. It seems to refer to the ability to recognize and perceive the shape of an object as constant, even when the viewing angle or perspective changes, resulting in different retinal images. So, even if the door appears distorted on the retina because it's open, we still perceive it as a rectangle.\n\nD. Size constancy: This is the perception of an object's size as constant, despite changes in the distance between the observer and the object. For example, a car looks smaller when it's far away but we still know it's the same size as when it's close. But again, here the question is about shape, not size.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, C. shape constancy seems to be the correct answer. It directly relates to perceiving the same shape regardless of the angle or perspective from which we view the object.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any way that color constancy could be related to shape perception? No, color constancy is specifically about color perception under different lighting conditions. Closure seems unrelated because it's about completing incomplete figures, not about consistent shape perception from different angles. Size constancy is clearly about size perception, not shape.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. shape constancy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. shape constancy}} \\]"
