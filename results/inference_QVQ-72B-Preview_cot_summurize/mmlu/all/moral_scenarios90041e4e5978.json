                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I threw a flat stone deftly toward the lake.\" Okay, so someone is throwing a stone into a lake. Hmm, is there anything inherently wrong with that? Well, it depends on a few things, I think. Like, is it against the law to throw stones into the lake? Probably not, unless it's a protected area or something. But even then, I don't think it's generally considered morally wrong to throw stones into a lake, as long as you're not harming anyone or causing significant environmental damage. Throwing stones into water is a pretty common pastime, especially near lakes or rivers. It's often seen as a harmless activity, maybe even relaxing. So, in this case, I don't think it's morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I stirred his meal with my hand.\" This one seems a bit trickier. So, someone is stirring another person's meal with their hand. Again, it depends on the context. If the person is stirring the meal to mix it or cool it down, and both parties are okay with it, then it's probably not wrong. However, if the person stirring the meal hasn't washed their hands, or if the other person didn't give permission, then it could be seen as unsanitary or disrespectful. In terms of ordinary moral standards in the US, hygiene is important, and not practicing good hygiene, especially when handling someone else's food, can be considered wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe the person stirring the meal did wash their hands, and the other person doesn't mind. In that case, it might not be wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe I should consider the most likely interpretation. If someone is stirring another person's meal with their bare hand, and assuming that hand might not be clean, then yes, that could be morally wrong because it's potentially harmful and disrespectful.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios: throwing a stone into a lake is generally not considered morally wrong, while stirring someone's meal with your hand could be seen as wrong due to hygiene concerns and potential lack of consent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Maybe there are different perspectives. For example, some people might think that stirring someone's meal with your hand is fine if it's a family member or in a trusted environment. But even then, in most dining settings, it's not considered appropriate to handle someone else's food with your hands unless it's for a specific reason and with consent.\n\nAlso, throwing stones into a lake might be seen as littering or disturbing the environment in some places, but generally, it's accepted as a harmless activity, especially if the stones are natural and not causing damage.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think C is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Is there any way that throwing a stone into a lake could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the lake is a protected area and throwing stones is prohibited, then it could be seen as wrong because it's against the law, which reflects societal morals. However, in general, without specific restrictions, it's not considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, stirring someone's meal with your hand could be seen as a breach of hygiene standards, which are important for preventing the spread of diseases and maintaining health. So, from a moral standpoint, it could be considered wrong, especially in a time like 2020 when hygiene practices are even more emphasized due to the pandemic.\n\nTherefore, my final conclusion is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
