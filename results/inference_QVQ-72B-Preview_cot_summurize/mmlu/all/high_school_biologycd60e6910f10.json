                    "text": "So I've got this question here about why people can digest starch but not cellulose, even though both are made up of glucose monomers. It's giving me four options, and I need to pick the one that best explains this. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides, and they're both composed of glucose units. But obviously, there's something different about them that makes one digestible and the other not. So, what could that difference be?\n\nOption A says that the bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose. Hmm, that sounds interesting. I recall that in chemistry, the shape of bonds can really affect how molecules interact. Maybe the way these glucose units are connected makes a difference in how our bodies can break them down.\n\nOption B suggests that molecules of starch are much smaller than molecules of cellulose. Well, I'm not entirely sure about that. If starch and cellulose are both polysaccharides, their molecular sizes could vary based on how many glucose units they have. But I don't think that's the primary reason for digestibility differences. Maybe it's not the size that matters here.\n\nOption C mentions that starch is an intracellular molecule, while cellulose is an extracellular molecule. Intracellular means inside the cell, and extracellular means outside the cell. Starch is indeed stored inside plant cells as a form of energy, and cellulose is a component of plant cell walls, which are external structures. But again, I'm not sure if this is the main reason why we can't digest cellulose. Maybe the location isn't as important as the chemical structure.\n\nOption D says that starch is hydrated by water, but cellulose is not. Hydration usually refers to the addition of water molecules to a substance, often in chemical reactions. Both starch and cellulose are composed of glucose monomers linked by glycosidic bonds, and hydrolysis reactions (which involve water) are used to break these bonds during digestion. But I don't think that hydration status is the key difference here.\n\nLet me revisit option A. I think it's pointing towards the type of glycosidic bonds in starch and cellulose. Starch has alpha-glycosidic bonds, while cellulose has beta-glycosidic bonds. These different types of bonds result in different shapes and structures for the two molecules.\n\nHuman enzymes, specifically amylases in our saliva and pancreas, are designed to break down alpha-glycosidic bonds, which is why we can digest starch. On the other hand, we lack the enzymes necessary to break down beta-glycosidic bonds found in cellulose. So, even though both are made of glucose, the different bond types make one digestible and the other indigestible.\n\nWait a minute, but option A says \"the bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose.\" That seems to be referring to the difference between alpha and beta glycosidic bonds, which is accurate. But perhaps it's a bit vague.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's a more direct way to explain this. For example, could it be that our digestive systems have enzymes that can handle one type of bond but not the other? Yes, that seems right. So, perhaps the answer is related to the type of bonds and the enzymes we have to break them.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is the only one that directly addresses the difference in bonds between starch and cellulose. Options B, C, and D seem less relevant to the primary reason for the digestibility difference.\n\nLet me double-check. If starch and cellulose differ in the type of glycosidic bonds\u2014they're alpha in starch and beta in cellulose\u2014and our digestive enzymes are specifically designed to break alpha bonds, then yes, option A makes sense.\n\nHowever, perhaps option C could also be indirectly related. Since starch is intracellular and cellulose is extracellular, maybe our digestive systems interact with them differently. But no, I think the main reason is still the bond type.\n\nSimilarly, option D about hydration doesn't seem directly relevant to digestibility in this context.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think option A is the best explanation. The shape of the bonds linking glucose monomers differs between starch and cellulose, which affects our ability to digest them.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
