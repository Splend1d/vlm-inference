It's important to understand who might be at risk for developing this illness so that we can be aware and possibly prevent it or get help early on.\n\nThe question gives four different scenarios of young women, and I need to determine which one is most likely to develop anorexia nervosa based on the risk factors. Let me first recall what I know about the typical profile of someone who might develop anorexia.\n\nI know that anorexia is more common in females, especially during adolescence and young adulthood. It often starts with a preoccupation with being thin, sometimes triggered by stress or a life event. There are both psychological and social factors that can contribute to its development.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\nA. Maria, a 16-year-old Caucasian female, who is an A student and talented musician, but who feels that her life is out of control.\n\nB. Leticia, a 15-year-old African American female, who is an A student and exceptional athlete, plus an avid reader.\n\nC. Rosa, a 26-year old Hispanic female, who has just received her law degree, is struggling with debt from school, and having difficulty finding employment.\n\nD. Virginia, a 14-year-old Caucasian female, who is a C student, is sexually promiscuous, and is experimenting with drugs.\n\nFirst, considering age, all of these individuals are in the typical age range for anorexia nervosa to develop, which is usually between 12 and 25 years old.\n\nEthnicity can also be a factor. Historically, anorexia was thought to be more prevalent in Caucasian populations, but recent studies suggest that it affects individuals from various ethnic backgrounds equally. So, perhaps ethnicity isn't as big of a factor as it was thought to be.\n\nNow, let's consider other risk factors.\n\nAcademic performance: Being an A student might indicate high standards and perfectionism, which can be risk factors for anorexia. However, being a C student doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility.\n\nTalents and interests: Maria is a talented musician, Leticia is an exceptional athlete and avid reader, Rosa has a law degree, and Virginia is experimenting with drugs. These talents and interests might influence stress levels and self-esteem.\n\nStress and control issues: Maria feels her life is out of control, Rosa is struggling with debt and employment, and Virginia is dealing with academic issues and risky behaviors. Stress and a sense of loss of control are known triggers for eating disorders.\n\nBody image: While none of these scenarios directly mention body image issues, it's likely that underlying dissatisfaction with body image could be a factor in some of these cases.\n\nLet me think about each option more carefully.\n\nOption A: Maria is 16, Caucasian, an A student, talented musician, but feels out of control. High achievement combined with a sense of loss of control could be a recipe for developing unhealthy coping mechanisms like anorexia. Perfectionism and high academic pressure might contribute to this.\n\nOption B: Leticia is 15, African American, an A student, exceptional athlete, and avid reader. While she seems to have a lot going on, there's no indication of stress or control issues that would particularly point towards anorexia. Being an athlete could be a double-edged sword \u2013 sports can promote health, but in some cases, especially in sports that emphasize thinness, they might contribute to eating disorders.\n\nOption C: Rosa is 26, Hispanic, with a law degree, struggling with debt and employment. While she's a bit older than the typical age for onset, anorexia can develop at any age. The stress of debt and unemployment could be significant triggers. However, the focus here might be more on financial and career stresses rather than body image or control issues related to eating.\n\nOption D: Virginia is 14, Caucasian, a C student, sexually promiscuous, and experimenting with drugs. While young age is a risk factor, the behaviors mentioned \u2013 promiscuity and drug use \u2013 suggest other potential issues such as rebellion or seeking escape from problems. There's no direct indication of preoccupation with weight or control issues related to eating.\n\nComparing all these, Option A seems to have a combination of factors that are commonly associated with anorexia nervosa: adolescent age, high academic achievement, talent in a specific area, and a sense of loss of control. These factors together might make Maria more susceptible to developing anorexia as a way to regain a sense of control in her life.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that anyone can develop an eating disorder, and the scenarios presented are just snapshots. In reality, assessing risk would require more information about each individual's mental health, family history, and specific stressors.\n\nBut based on the information given, I would say that Maria (Option A) is the most likely to develop anorexia nervosa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
