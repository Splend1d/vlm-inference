Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThe store owner runs a sporting goods store that specializes in hunting and camping supplies. His friend has been warning him not to leave so much merchandise out in the open, but the owner hasn't been listening. One day, the friend comes into the store to visit and decides to play a joke on the owner because he feels like his warnings have been ignored.\n\nThe friend picks up a hatchet that's lying on a display case and swings it over his head, pretending to be about to strike the owner, who is facing away from him at the register. The friend says, \"All right buddy, one false move and it's over.\" The owner is really scared but isn't actually hurt physically or in any other way.\n\nNow, if the owner decides to make a claim against the friend, what's the most likely outcome? The options are:\n\nA. Recover, because the friend was negligent.\n\nB. Recover, because he feared the friend would hit him.\n\nC. Not recover, because he suffered no physical harm.\n\nD. Not recover, because the friend was only joking.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what kind of legal claim the owner might bring. It seems like this could be a case of assault, but I need to make sure I understand the elements of assault in this context.\n\nAssault is generally defined as the intentional creation of a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm without consent. So, it's not necessarily about causing physical harm but about causing someone to fear that they're about to be harmed.\n\nIn this case, the friend swung a hatchet over his head and made a threatening statement, which certainly could cause the owner to fear imminent harm. The owner was frightened, which suggests that he did indeed apprehend that he might be hit.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the friend committed an assault by intentionally causing the owner to fear imminent harm.\n\nNow, the question is whether the owner can recover damages for this assault. The options suggest that he might recover because of negligence or because he feared being hit, or that he might not recover because there was no physical harm or because it was just a joke.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Recover, because the friend was negligent.\n\nNegligence is a different cause of action from assault. Negligence involves a failure to exercise reasonable care, resulting in foreseeable harm to another person. In this case, the friend was\u6545\u610f\u7684 (intentional) in his actions\u2014he meant to scare the owner by pretending to swing a hatchet at him. It wasn't a case of carelessness or accident.\n\nSo, while the friend's actions might be considered negligent in some contexts, the primary issue here is intentional infliction of fear, which is more directly addressed under the tort of assault.\n\nTherefore, I don't think negligence is the best ground for recovery in this scenario.\n\nB. Recover, because he feared the friend would hit him.\n\nThis seems more on point. As I understood earlier, assault is about creating a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. The owner feared being hit, which aligns with the definition of assault.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, assault can be committed without any physical contact or injury, as long as there's an intentional act that causes someone to fear immediate harm.\n\nSo, if the owner can prove that the friend intentionally created a situation where he feared being hit with a hatchet, that should be sufficient to establish assault.\n\nC. Not recover, because he suffered no physical harm.\n\nThis seems like a common misconception. As I just thought about, assault doesn't require actual physical harm; it's about the fear of imminent harm.\n\nSo, even though the owner wasn't actually hit or injured, the fact that he was put in fear of being hit should be enough to constitute assault.\n\nTherefore, the absence of physical harm shouldn't prevent him from recovering damages for the assault.\n\nD. Not recover, because the friend was only joking.\n\nThis is another interesting point. The friend's intention was to play a joke, not to actually harm the owner. However, that doesn't change the fact that his actions caused the owner to fear for his safety.\n\nIn law, the intent to cause fear is separate from the intent behind the action. Even if the friend was only trying to joke, if his actions reasonably caused the owner to fear imminent harm, that constitutes assault.\n\nSo, the fact that it was a joke shouldn't absolve the friend of liability for assault.\n\nPutting all this together, it seems that the owner should be able to recover damages based on the assault, because he was put in fear of imminent harm, even if no physical harm occurred and even if the friend was only joking.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is that the owner will recover, and the reason is that he feared the friend would hit him, which constitutes assault.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Recover, because he feared the friend would hit him.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
