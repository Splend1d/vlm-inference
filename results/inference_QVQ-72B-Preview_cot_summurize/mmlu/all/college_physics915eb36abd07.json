                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about electromagnetic induction. There's a circular coil with 250 turns and an area of 0.2 square meters. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, and it's increased from 0.01 teslas to 0.06 teslas in 0.25 seconds. I need to find the average induced EMF in the coil during this time interval. The options are 0.04 volts, 0.1 volts, 2.5 volts, and 10 volts.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a changing magnetic field is present in a coil, it induces an electromotive force (EMF) according to Faraday's law of induction. The formula for the induced EMF is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -N \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi_B}{\\Delta t}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) is the induced EMF,\n\n- \\(N\\) is the number of turns in the coil,\n\n- \\(\\Delta \\Phi_B\\) is the change in magnetic flux through the coil,\n\n- \\(\\Delta t\\) is the change in time.\n\nSince the magnetic field is perpendicular to the coil, the magnetic flux \\(\\Phi_B\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_B = B \\cdot A\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength,\n\n- \\(A\\) is the area of the coil.\n\nGiven that the magnetic field changes from 0.01 T to 0.06 T, the change in magnetic flux \\(\\Delta \\Phi_B\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\Phi_B = \\Phi_B(final) - \\Phi_B(initial) = (B_f - B_i) \\cdot A\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\Phi_B = (0.06 T - 0.01 T) \\cdot 0.2 m^2 = 0.05 T \\cdot 0.2 m^2 = 0.01 Wb\n\\]\n\nNow, plugging into Faraday's law:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -250 \\cdot \\frac{0.01 Wb}{0.25 s} = -250 \\cdot 0.04 V = -10 V\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of the induced EMF according to Lenz's law, but since we're asked for the magnitude, it should be 10 volts.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 10 V seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the change in magnetic field is 0.06 T - 0.01 T = 0.05 T.\n\nThen, the area is 0.2 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, \\(\\Delta \\Phi_B = 0.05 T \\cdot 0.2 m^2 = 0.01 Wb\\) (weber).\n\nTime interval is 0.25 seconds.\n\nNumber of turns is 250.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -250 \\cdot \\frac{0.01 Wb}{0.25 s} = -250 \\cdot 0.04 V = -10 V\n\\]\n\nYes, the magnitude is 10 volts.\n\nI think the answer is D. 10 V.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the induced EMF in terms of the rate of change of magnetic flux.\n\nThe induced EMF is equal to the negative of the rate of change of magnetic flux multiplied by the number of turns.\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -N \\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\n\\]\n\nSince the magnetic field is changing linearly with time, the rate of change is constant:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi_B}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{0.01 Wb}{0.25 s} = 0.04 Wb/s\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -250 \\cdot 0.04 V = -10 V\n\\]\n\nAgain, the magnitude is 10 volts.\n\nI don't see any error in this calculation, so I'm confident that the correct answer is 10 volts, which is option D.\n\nMaybe I should also consider the units to ensure consistency.\n\nMagnetic flux is in webers (Wb), area in square meters (m\u00b2), magnetic field in teslas (T), time in seconds (s), and EMF in volts (V).\n\nYes, the units are consistent in my calculations.\n\nJust to be extra sure, perhaps I can recall the formula for magnetic flux.\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_B = B \\cdot A \\cdot \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\nSince the magnetic field is perpendicular to the coil, \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\), so \\(\\cos 0^\\circ = 1\\). Therefore, \\(\\Phi_B = B \\cdot A\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\Delta \\Phi_B = (B_f - B_i) \\cdot A = (0.06 - 0.01) \\cdot 0.2 = 0.05 \\cdot 0.2 = 0.01 Wb\\), which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the average induced EMF is indeed 10 volts.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be D. 10 V.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
