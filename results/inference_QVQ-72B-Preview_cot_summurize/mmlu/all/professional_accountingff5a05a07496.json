                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about a partnership, and I need to figure out if the partnership terminated for tax purposes based on some changes in the partners' interests. The partners are Ross, Stone, and Taylor, with initial percentages of 15%, 35%, and 50%, respectively. Then, on April 9, Stone sold his entire interest to Taylor. The options are:\n\nA. Studio terminated as of January 1.\n\nB. Studio terminated as of April 9.\n\nC. Studio terminated as of December 31.\n\nD. Studio did not terminate.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what constitutes a termination of a partnership for tax purposes. I recall that under U.S. tax law, specifically Section 708 of the Internal Revenue Code, a partnership is considered terminated if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in the partnership's capital and profits within a 12-month period.\n\nSo, in this case, Stone sold his entire 35% interest to Taylor on April 9. Before this sale, the capital interests were:\n\n- Ross: 15%\n\n- Stone: 35%\n\n- Taylor: 50%\n\nAfter the sale:\n\n- Ross: 15%\n\n- Taylor: 50% + 35% = 85%\n\n- Stone: 0%\n\nSo, Taylor now has 85%, Ross has 15%, and Stone has exited the partnership.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this change constitutes a termination of the partnership for tax purposes.\n\nLet me recall the rules:\n\n1. A partnership is terminated if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in the partnership's capital and profits within a 12-month period.\n\n2. The termination is effective on the date when the cumulative sales or exchanges reach or exceed 50%.\n\nIn this scenario, the only change is Stone selling his 35% interest to Taylor on April 9.\n\nSo, the question is whether this 35% change is more than 50% of the total interests.\n\nWait a minute, the total interests are 100%. So, 50% of the total interests is 50%. Since 35% is less than 50%, it seems like this change is less than the threshold required for termination.\n\nBut, I should make sure I'm understanding this correctly. Maybe I should look up the exact IRS rule on partnership termination.\n\nLet me search for IRS Section 708.\n\nOkay, according to IRS Section 708(b)(1)(B), a partnership is considered terminated if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in the partnership capital within a 12-month period.\n\nIn this case, Stone sold his 35% interest to Taylor. So, that's a 35% change in the partnership interests. Since 35% is less than 50%, it wouldn't trigger a termination.\n\nBut, maybe there are other considerations. For example, does the identity of the partners matter, or is it just the percentage of interests?\n\nFrom what I can recall, it's primarily about the percentage of interests sold or exchanged within a 12-month period.\n\nSo, if only 35% was sold, and that's less than 50%, then the partnership should not be terminated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Studio did not terminate.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something about the way the percentages are calculated that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a technicality about the distribution of interests after the sale that could affect the status.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes, when a partner sells their entire interest, it could be considered a deemed sale of the partnership's assets or something like that, but I don't think that applies here.\n\nNo, I think my initial assessment is correct. Since the change in ownership is less than 50% of the total interests, the partnership does not terminate.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Studio did not terminate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
