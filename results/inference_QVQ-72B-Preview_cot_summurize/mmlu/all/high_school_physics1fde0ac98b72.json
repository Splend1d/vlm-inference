                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two ice skaters on frictionless ice, which means no external horizontal forces are acting on them during the collision. One skater is moving west at 4 m/s and weighs 50 kg, while the other is moving north at 2 m/s and weighs 75 kg. After they collide, they stick together, so it's an inelastic collision.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the principles of conservation laws in collisions. There are two main conservation laws that might apply here: conservation of linear momentum and conservation of kinetic energy. But not both necessarily apply in every collision.\n\nOption A says that linear momentum is conserved because the net force on the system is nonzero during the collision. That doesn't sound right. From what I remember, linear momentum is conserved when the net external force is zero. Since the ice is frictionless, and assuming no other external forces like air resistance, the net external force should be zero. So, linear momentum should be conserved.\n\nOption B states that only kinetic energy is conserved because it's an inelastic collision. But in inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved; in fact, some kinetic energy is lost, usually converted into other forms like sound or heat, especially when objects stick together.\n\nOption C says that only kinetic energy is conserved because it's an elastic collision. Wait, but elastic collisions are when both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, and inelastic collisions are when only momentum is conserved. So this option seems contradictory because it says only kinetic energy is conserved in an elastic collision, but in elastic collisions, both are conserved.\n\nOption D claims that linear momentum is conserved because the net force on the system is zero. This seems consistent with what I know. If there's no net external force, linear momentum should be conserved.\n\nGiven that it's an inelastic collision, I know that kinetic energy isn't conserved, but linear momentum is. So, options A and C are likely incorrect, and option D seems correct, but let's verify this further.\n\nLet's calculate the momentum before and after the collision to see if it's conserved.\n\nBefore the collision:\n\n- Skater 1: 50 kg moving west at 4 m/s. Momentum p1 = m1 * v1 = 50 * 4 = 200 kg*m/s west.\n\n- Skater 2: 75 kg moving north at 2 m/s. Momentum p2 = m2 * v2 = 75 * 2 = 150 kg*m/s north.\n\nTotal initial momentum: p_initial = p1 + p2 = 200 west + 150 north.\n\nAfter the collision, they stick together, so their final velocity is the same. Let's call this velocity v_f.\n\nCombined mass: m_total = 50 + 75 = 125 kg.\n\nFinal momentum: p_final = m_total * v_f.\n\nSince momentum is a vector, we can treat the west and north components separately.\n\nSo, p_final west component should equal p1 = 200 kg*m/s, and north component should equal p2 = 150 kg*m/s.\n\nTherefore, v_f west = 200 / 125 = 1.6 m/s, and v_f north = 150 / 125 = 1.2 m/s.\n\nSo, the final velocity v_f is vectorially 1.6 m/s west and 1.2 m/s north, which can also be expressed as 2 m/s in some direction.\n\nNow, let's check kinetic energy before and after.\n\nInitial kinetic energy:\n\nKE1 = (1/2) * 50 * 4^2 = (0.5) * 50 * 16 = 400 J.\n\nKE2 = (1/2) * 75 * 2^2 = (0.5) * 75 * 4 = 150 J.\n\nTotal initial KE = 400 + 150 = 550 J.\n\nFinal kinetic energy:\n\nKE_final = (1/2) * 125 * (1.6^2 + 1.2^2) = (0.5) * 125 * (2.56 + 1.44) = (0.5) * 125 * 4 = 0.5 * 125 * 4 = 250 J.\n\nClearly, KE_initial \u2260 KE_final, so kinetic energy is not conserved, which confirms it's an inelastic collision.\n\nTherefore, linear momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not.\n\nSo, option D is correct: the linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.\n\nTo make sure, let's look back at the options:\n\nA: Linear momentum conserved because net force is nonzero. But our calculation shows that momentum is conserved, so this is incorrect.\n\nB: Only kinetic energy conserved because it's an inelastic collision. But in inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved, so this is incorrect.\n\nC: Only kinetic energy conserved because it's an elastic collision. This is confusing because in elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. But in this case, it's inelastic, so this is incorrect.\n\nD: Linear momentum conserved because net force is zero. This matches our conclusion.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
