                    "text": "Let's see which of these pairs of expressions are equivalent. I need to simplify or expand each one to compare them properly.\n\nStarting with option A: 7(2x) and 9x.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate 7(2x). That's just 7 multiplied by 2x. So, 7 times 2 is 14, so it's 14x. So, 7(2x) equals 14x, and the other expression is 9x. 14x is not equal to 9x, so this pair isn't equivalent.\n\nNext, option B: 3x + 5x and 15x.\n\nI need to add 3x and 5x. Adding like terms, 3x + 5x equals 8x. So, 8x is not equal to 15x. Therefore, this pair isn't equivalent either.\n\nMoving on to option C: 4(2x \u2014 6) and 8x \u2014 24.\n\nFirst, I'll distribute the 4 into the parentheses. So, 4 times 2x is 8x, and 4 times -6 is -24. So, 4(2x \u2014 6) equals 8x \u2014 24, which matches the other expression, 8x \u2014 24. So, this pair seems equivalent.\n\nLastly, option D: x + x + x + x and x\u2074.\n\nAdding x four times is the same as 4x. So, x + x + x + x equals 4x. Now, x\u2074 is x multiplied by itself three more times, which is x times x times x. That's not the same as 4x. So, this pair isn't equivalent.\n\nSo, from all the options, only option C has both expressions equal to each other: 4(2x \u2014 6) equals 8x \u2014 24.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIn option A, 7(2x) is indeed 14x, which is not equal to 9x. That's correct.\n\nOption B: 3x + 5x is 8x, not 15x. That's right.\n\nOption C: Distributing 4 into 2x \u2014 6 gives 8x \u2014 24, which matches the other expression. That seems correct.\n\nOption D: x + x + x + x is 4x, and x\u2074 is x multiplied by itself three more times, which is x\u00b3\u00b7x, which is x\u2074, but that's not equal to 4x. Unless x is 0 or 1, but in general, they are not equal. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
