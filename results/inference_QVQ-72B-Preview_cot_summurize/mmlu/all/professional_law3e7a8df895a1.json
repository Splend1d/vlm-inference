                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether certain testimony is admissible or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a woman who was hitchhiking and got picked up by a man. They were smoking marijuana in a roadside rest area when another car crashed into the man's car. Both the man and the woman were injured, and the woman was briefly unconscious.\n\nNow, the woman is suing the other driver for negligence, claiming injuries from the accident. At trial, she testifies about her injuries and the other driver's negligence.\n\nIn defense, the other driver calls an attorney who lives next door to the woman. This attorney wants to testify that after the accident, the woman consulted him about her claim and asked how she could falsely testify that she wasn't smoking marijuana at the time of the accident.\n\nSo, the woman's attorney objects to this testimony. The question is, is this testimony admissible?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Admissible as an admission.\n\nB. Admissible as a statement against interest.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because it violates the woman's privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because it violates the attorney-client privilege for confidential communications.\n\nOkay, so I need to understand which of these applies here.\n\nFirst, let's consider the nature of the testimony. The attorney is proposing to testify that the woman asked him how to falsely deny smoking marijuana at the time of the accident.\n\nThis seems like something the woman said to her attorney in a confidential setting, possibly during a consultation about her legal claim.\n\nNow, let's think about the attorney-client privilege. That's a legal principle that protects communications between a client and their attorney to ensure confidentiality. The purpose is to encourage open communication without fear of disclosure.\n\nSo, if the woman was consulting with this attorney about her legal claim, anything she said to him in that capacity should be confidential and not admissible in court.\n\nBut wait, there's an exception for admissions. An admission is when a party admits something that's against their interest, and it can be used against them in court.\n\nHowever, I think the attorney-client privilege trumps the admission rule. Even if it's an admission, if it's protected by attorney-client privilege, it shouldn't be admissible.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nI recall that the attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a client and their attorney. So, if the woman was speaking to the attorney in confidence about her claim, including possibly incriminating statements, those communications should remain confidential unless she waives that privilege.\n\nIn this case, it's the attorney who's trying to testify about those confidential communications, and the woman is objecting. So, it seems like the privilege hasn't been waived.\n\nTherefore, the testimony should be inadmissible due to the attorney-client privilege.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says it's admissible as an admission. But as I thought, the privilege protects against disclosing such communications, even if they're admissions.\n\nOption B is admissible as a statement against interest. A statement against interest is one that harms the declarant's legal position and is being offered by the opposing party. However, again, if it's a confidential communication protected by the attorney-client privilege, it shouldn't be admissible.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible because it violates the woman's privilege against self-incrimination. The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being compelled to testify against themselves in criminal cases.\n\nBut in this civil case, it's about negligence and personal injury, not a criminal proceeding. So, I don't think the privilege against self-incrimination directly applies here. Maybe not the right reason.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because it violates the attorney-client privilege for confidential communications. This seems to align with what I was thinking.\n\nSo, between the options, D seems the most appropriate.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions to the attorney-client privilege that might apply here.\n\nOne common exception is when the communication involves future crimes or fraud. If a client is seeking advice to commit a future crime or fraud, the privilege may not apply.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the woman was allegedly asking how to falsely testify, which might be considered an attempt to commit perjury, a crime. So, perhaps there's an exception here.\n\nWait a minute, that complicates things.\n\nIf the woman was seeking advice on how to commit perjury by falsely testifying, then the communication might not be protected by the privilege.\n\nBut, in this case, it's not clear if she was seeking advice on how to commit perjury or just expressing a desire to lie.\n\nAlso, the attorney is testifying that she asked how to falsely testify, not that she actually did it.\n\nMoreover, the communication itself is being offered to show her state of mind or her intent to lie, which could be relevant to her credibility.\n\nBut still, the general rule is that attorney-client communications are privileged, and exceptions are narrowly construed.\n\nGiven that, and without more information about whether the communication was made with the intent to commit a crime, I think the safest answer is that the testimony is inadmissible due to the attorney-client privilege.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
