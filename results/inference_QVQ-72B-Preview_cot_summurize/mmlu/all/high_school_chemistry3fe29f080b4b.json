                    "text": "So I have this question about Lewis structures and resonance. It's asking which of these molecules\u2014CO2, CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-\u2014are best represented by multiple resonance structures. The options are combinations of these molecules.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a resonance structure is. Resonance occurs when a molecule can be depicted by two or more valid Lewis structures that differ only in the placement of electrons, not the atoms. So, for each of these molecules, I should draw their Lewis structures and see if there are multiple ways to arrange the electrons without changing the positions of the atoms.\n\nLet's start with CO2, carbon dioxide. The molecular formula is O=C=O, with carbon in the center bonded to two oxygen atoms via double bonds. Each oxygen also has two lone pairs. Is there another way to draw this without moving the atoms? If I try to add a bond somewhere else, it might violate the octet rule or change the connectivity of the atoms. Hmm, maybe not. So, CO2 seems to have only one resonance structure.\n\nNext, CO32-, carbonate ion. This is a trigonal planar molecule with carbon in the center bonded to three oxygen atoms. One of the oxygens has a double bond to carbon, and the other two have single bonds. Each oxygen has two lone pairs, except the one with the double bond, which has one lone pair. But wait, in reality, all the oxygen atoms in CO32- are equivalent due to resonance. So, there are multiple resonance structures where the double bond can be placed next to each oxygen atom. That means CO32- has multiple resonance structures.\n\nMoving on to NO2-, nitrite ion. This has a central nitrogen atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. One oxygen has a double bond to nitrogen, and the other has a single bond. Nitrogen has one lone pair, and the oxygen with the double bond has one lone pair, while the one with the single bond has two lone pairs. Similar to CO32-, the two oxygen atoms are equivalent, and we can draw another resonance structure where the double bond is switched to the other oxygen atom. So, NO2- also has multiple resonance structures.\n\nLastly, NO3-, nitrate ion. This is similar to CO32- in structure, with nitrogen in the center bonded to three oxygen atoms. All three oxygen atoms are bonded to nitrogen via single bonds, and each oxygen has two lone pairs. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Actually, in NO3-, the nitrogen is bonded to three oxygen atoms, with one double bond and two single bonds. Again, due to resonance, the double bond can be placed next to any of the three oxygen atoms, making multiple resonance structures possible.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- CO2: only one resonance structure\n\n- CO32-: multiple resonance structures\n\n- NO2-: multiple resonance structures\n\n- NO3-: multiple resonance structures\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. CO32-, NO2- and NO3-.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor CO2, is there really only one resonance structure? Well, sometimes people might draw structures where the double bonds are swapped, but that would actually violate the octet rule for carbon, as it would have more than eight electrons. So, no, CO2 doesn't have multiple resonance structures.\n\nCO32- clearly has multiple resonance structures, where the double bond can be placed next to any of the three oxygen atoms, making them all equivalent.\n\nSimilarly, in NO2-, the double bond can be placed next to either oxygen atom, leading to two resonance structures.\n\nAnd in NO3-, the double bond can be placed next to any of the three oxygen atoms, resulting in three resonance structures.\n\nSo, yes, the answer should be D. CO32-, NO2- and NO3-.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
