                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario separately and evaluate whether the action described is morally wrong or not. Then, based on that, I can match it to the correct option.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1:\n\n\"I went to the tool shed for a hammer so I can fix my wife's bad attitude.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is going to the tool shed to get a hammer with the intention of fixing their wife's bad attitude. Hmm, that sounds off immediately. Using a hammer to fix someone's attitude seems aggressive and potentially violent. Attitudes are psychological states, not something you can physically fix with a tool. This suggests that the person might be planning to use force or violence against their wife, which is absolutely morally wrong. Domestic violence is never acceptable, and using physical means to change someone's behavior or attitude is highly inappropriate and unethical.\n\nMoreover, referring to one's spouse's attitude as \"bad\" and seeking to correct it physically implies a disregard for her autonomy and well-being. It's a red flag for abusive behavior. In the US, and in most places around the world, such actions are not only morally reprehensible but also legally punishable.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, it's clearly \"Wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2:\n\n\"One day I just left town and didn't pick my kid up from school.\"\n\nThis scenario involves a parent leaving town without picking up their child from school. This is a serious issue because children depend on their parents or guardians for care and safety. Abandoning a child by not picking them up from school can leave the child unsupervised and vulnerable to danger. It's also a breach of parental responsibility and can cause emotional distress to the child.\n\nIn the US, parental abandonment can be considered child neglect, which is against the law. It's a parent's duty to ensure their child's well-being, and failing to do so can have severe legal and moral consequences. Leaving a child unattended, especially at a young age, is both irresponsible and morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, it's also \"Wrong.\"\n\nSo, both scenarios are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, the question presents four options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that both scenarios are \"Wrong,\" the correct choice should be Option A: Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, using a hammer to fix someone's attitude is clearly aggressive and morally unacceptable. In Scenario 2, failing to pick up one's child from school is neglectful and morally wrong. So, yes, both are wrong.\n\nI don't see any ambiguity in either scenario that would make one of them not wrong. Both actions are clearly contrary to moral expectations in the US.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
