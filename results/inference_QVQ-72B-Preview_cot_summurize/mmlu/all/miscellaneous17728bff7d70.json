                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following heavenly bodies have never had a spacecraft landed on it? A. Venus, B. Mars, C. The Moon, D. Jupiter.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these hasn't had a spacecraft land on it yet.\n\nFirst, let's think about Venus. I remember that Venus is a really hot planet because of its thick atmosphere and greenhouse effect. It's sometimes called Earth's sister planet, but it's way different in terms of climate. Has there been a spacecraft that landed on Venus? I think there have been some Russian missions, like the Venera series, that managed to land probes on Venus. They didn't last long because of the extreme temperatures and pressure, but they did land. So, probably Venus has been landed on by a spacecraft. But I should double-check that.\n\nNext, Mars. Mars is super popular these days with all the rovers and landers. There have been many successful landings on Mars, starting with NASA's Viking landers back in the 1970s. More recently, there's Perseverance and Ingenuity, and the European Space Agency has also tried landing there. So, definitely, Mars has had spacecraft land on it. It's not the answer.\n\nThe Moon. Well, the Moon is the closest celestial body to Earth, and we've sent numerous spacecraft there. The Apollo missions landed astronauts on the Moon, and there have been many unmanned landers and rovers from different countries. So, the Moon has definitely had spacecraft land on it. Not the answer.\n\nNow, Jupiter. Jupiter is a gas giant, and it's massive compared to Earth. It doesn't have a solid surface like Venus, Mars, or the Moon. Most of the missions to Jupiter have been flybys or orbiters, like Galileo and Juno. But has any spacecraft landed on Jupiter? Wait, there was the Galileo probe that was released into Jupiter's atmosphere. But that was more of a probe that descended into the atmosphere and transmitted data before it was destroyed by the pressure and temperature. It didn't land on a solid surface because Jupiter doesn't have one.\n\nSo, considering that Jupiter is mostly gas and doesn't have a solid surface, it's not really possible to land a spacecraft on it in the same way we do on planets like Venus or Mars. Therefore, Jupiter hasn't had a spacecraft land on it because it doesn't have a landable surface.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the question is about moons of Jupiter or something. Jupiter has many moons, like Europa, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, which are sometimes considered separately. Have there been landings on any of Jupiter's moons? I think there have been proposals, but I don't recall any successful landings yet. However, the question specifies \"heavenly bodies,\" which could include moons, but it lists the Moon separately from the planets, so maybe it's referring only to planets.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any spacecraft has landed on one of Jupiter's moons. For example, the Galileo mission included a probe that entered Jupiter's atmosphere, but again, that's not landing on a solid surface. The Europa Clipper mission is planned to study Europa, but I don't think it includes a lander. So, as of now, no spacecraft has landed on any of Jupiter's moons.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, Jupiter itself, being a gas giant without a solid surface, hasn't had a spacecraft land on it, and neither have any of its moons been landed on by a spacecraft yet.\n\nWait, but the question says \"heavenly bodies,\" and it lists Venus, Mars, the Moon, and Jupiter. If we consider the Moon as Earth's natural satellite, separate from the planets, then perhaps the answer is Jupiter, since it's the only gas giant in the options and doesn't have a solid surface to land on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by including the Moon, which is not a planet, and suggesting that it's a heavenly body that hasn't had a spacecraft land on it, but that's not true because Apollo landed there. So, probably not.\n\nLet me see if I can find some additional information to confirm. I recall that the first spacecraft to land on another celestial body was the Soviet Luna 9, which landed on the Moon in 1966. Similarly, Venera 7 landed on Venus in 1970, and Viking 1 landed on Mars in 1976. So, both Venus and Mars have been landed on, as has the Moon.\n\nAs for Jupiter, while several probes have entered its atmosphere, none have landed on a solid surface because there isn't one. So, in that sense, Jupiter hasn't had a spacecraft land on it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Jupiter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
