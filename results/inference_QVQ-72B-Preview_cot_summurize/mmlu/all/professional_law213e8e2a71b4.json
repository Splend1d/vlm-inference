                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nWe have a plaintiff who's suing her home insurer because they denied coverage for water damage caused by a frozen plastic pipe that burst. The insurer claims that the pipe burst due to age, not freezing, and they have an engineer as an expert witness who testifies to that effect. During cross-examination, it comes out that this engineer was convicted of tax fraud five years ago, although he blames it on an accounting error.\n\nNow, the insurer wants to call another witness to testify about the engineer's truthfulness. This witness is supposed to say two things: first, that in their opinion, the engineer is a truthful person; and second, that the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person.\n\nThe question is asking how much of this witness's testimony is admissible. There are four options:\n\nA. All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.\n\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\n\nC. Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\n\nD. None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules regarding character evidence, especially when it comes to witness credibility.\n\nI recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, character evidence can be used to attack or support a witness's credibility. Specifically, Rule 608 allows evidence of a witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\n\nIn this case, the engineer's character for truthfulness is being supported by another witness.\n\nNow, the engineer has a prior conviction for tax fraud, which can be used to attack his credibility. The insurer is trying to rehabilitate his credibility by introducing evidence of his good character for truthfulness.\n\nThe witness wants to offer two types of evidence:\n\n1. Their own opinion about the engineer's truthfulness.\n\n2. The opinions of the engineer's neighbors about his truthfulness.\n\nI need to determine which of these is admissible.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.\n\nIs this correct? Well, both opinion and reputation evidence are generally admissible to support a witness's character for truthfulness.\n\nBut wait, there might be a preference for one over the other in certain situations.\n\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about this. In evidence law, there is a preference for reputation evidence over opinion evidence in some contexts, particularly in civil cases involving character.\n\nLet me think about this. In criminal cases, when a defendant wants to introduce evidence of their good character, they can do so through reputation or opinion evidence. But in some jurisdictions, there's a preference for reputation evidence because it's based on community perception, which is seen as more reliable than an individual's opinion.\n\nHowever, in the context of witness credibility, both reputation and opinion evidence are generally allowed under Rule 608.\n\nSo, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nC. Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\n\nThis is an interesting point. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nIn this case, if the witness is reporting what the neighbors said, that is, that they describe the engineer as truthful, that seems like hearsay. The statement is being offered to prove that the engineer is indeed truthful.\n\nUnless there's an exception that applies, hearsay is generally inadmissible.\n\nSo, if the witness is merely repeating what others said, that would be hearsay.\n\nBut, the witness's own opinion about the engineer's truthfulness is not hearsay, because it's their own belief being offered.\n\nTherefore, the witness's own opinion should be admissible, but not the neighbors' statements.\n\nSo, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nD. None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.\n\nThis seems too extreme. The engineer's truthfulness is directly related to his qualifications as an expert witness, especially since his credibility is being attacked by his prior conviction.\n\nTherefore, some evidence to support his credibility should be admissible.\n\nSo, I don't think this is correct.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, I need to decide which one is right.\n\nOption A says all of the testimony is admissible.\n\nOption B says only the reputation evidence is admissible.\n\nOption C says only the witness's opinion is admissible.\n\nGiven that the neighbors' statements are likely hearsay and thus inadmissible, and that both reputation and opinion evidence are generally admissible to support a witness's character for truthfulness, I think option C is the best answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a preference for reputation evidence over opinion evidence in this context.\n\nLet me check Rule 608 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nRule 608(a) states: \"The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations:\n\n(1) The evidence may not be evidence of specific instances of the witness's conduct.\n\n(2) The evidence is admissible only if the witness is testifying at the trial or hearing.\"\n\nSo, both opinion and reputation evidence are allowed to attack or support a witness's character for truthfulness.\n\nHowever, there might be a preference for reputation evidence in some circumstances.\n\nBut in this case, since the witness is offering both their own opinion and reporting the neighbors' opinions, and the neighbors' statements are hearsay, I think only the witness's own opinion is admissible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nWait, but option B says only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, based on a rule of preference.\n\nIs there such a rule of preference?\n\nI think in some jurisdictions, there is a preference for reputation evidence over opinion evidence, especially in civil cases.\n\nBut in federal evidence law, both are allowed under Rule 608.\n\nPerhaps the answer depends on whether the witness has a basis to testify about the engineer's reputation.\n\nIf the witness is well-acquainted with the engineer and knows about his reputation in the community, then the reputation evidence should be admissible.\n\nHowever, reporting what the neighbors said is still hearsay.\n\nSo, perhaps both the witness's opinion and the reputation evidence are admissible, but the neighbors' statements are not.\n\nBut since the question says \"the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person,\" and the witness is reporting that, it's still hearsay.\n\nTherefore, only the witness's own opinion is admissible.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
