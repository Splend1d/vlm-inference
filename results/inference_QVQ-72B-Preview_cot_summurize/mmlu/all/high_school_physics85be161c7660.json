                    "text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a linear, elastic collision between two objects. One object has a known mass, m1, and it collides with another object that's initially stationary, and I need to find the mass of that second object. The options are giving me different pieces of information, like final speeds or initial speeds, and I need to figure out which one of these would be sufficient to determine the unknown mass.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens in an elastic collision. I know that in an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. So, I have two equations here: one for conservation of momentum and one for conservation of kinetic energy.\n\nLet me define the variables:\n\n- m1: mass of the first object\n\n- m2: mass of the second object (unknown)\n\n- u1: initial velocity of m1\n\n- v1: final velocity of m1\n\n- v2: final velocity of m2\n\nSince the second object is initially stationary, its initial velocity u2 is zero.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n1. Conservation of momentum:\n\nm1 * u1 = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\n\n2. Conservation of kinetic energy:\n\n(1/2) * m1 * u1\u00b2 = (1/2) * m1 * v1\u00b2 + (1/2) * m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nI can simplify both equations by multiplying the momentum equation by 2 to eliminate the denominators:\n\n2 * m1 * u1 = 2 * m1 * v1 + 2 * m2 * v2\n\nAnd for the energy equation:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * v1\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to see which piece of information would allow me to solve for m2.\n\nOption A: The final speed of object 1 (v1)\n\nIf I know v1, can I find m2?\n\nLet me plug v1 into the equations.\n\nFrom momentum equation:\n\nm1 * u1 = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\n\nFrom energy equation:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * v1\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nI have two equations with three unknowns: m2, v2, and u1. Wait, no, u1 is given since it's the initial speed of m1, right? Oh, no, the problem says \"in addition to m1,\" so u1 is known.\n\nSo, knowns are m1 and u1.\n\nIf I know v1, then I have:\n\nMomentum: m1 * u1 = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\n\nEnergy: m1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * v1\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nI can solve these equations for m2.\n\nLet me try to solve them.\n\nFrom momentum equation:\n\nm2 * v2 = m1 * (u1 - v1)\n\nSo, v2 = [m1 * (u1 - v1)] / m2\n\nPlug this into the energy equation:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * v1\u00b2 + m2 * [(m1 * (u1 - v1)) / m2]\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * v1\u00b2 + m2 * [m1\u00b2 * (u1 - v1)\u00b2] / m2\u00b2\n\nSimplify further:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * v1\u00b2 + [m1\u00b2 / m2] * (u1 - v1)\u00b2\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can solve for m2.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 - m1 * v1\u00b2 = [m1\u00b2 / m2] * (u1 - v1)\u00b2\n\nFactor m1:\n\nm1 * (u1\u00b2 - v1\u00b2) = [m1\u00b2 / m2] * (u1 - v1)\u00b2\n\nAssuming u1 \u2260 v1, I can factor (u1 - v1):\n\nm1 * (u1 - v1)(u1 + v1) = [m1\u00b2 / m2] * (u1 - v1)\u00b2\n\nI can cancel (u1 - v1) from both sides:\n\nm1 * (u1 + v1) = [m1\u00b2 / m2] * (u1 - v1)\n\nNow, solve for m2:\n\nm2 = [m1\u00b2 / m1 * (u1 + v1)] / (u1 - v1)\n\nSimplify:\n\nm2 = m1 * (u1 + v1) / (u1 - v1)\n\nSo, if I know v1, I can find m2.\n\nTherefore, option A is sufficient.\n\nOption B: The initial speed of object 1 (u1)\n\nWait, u1 is already known because it's part of the problem setup. The problem says \"in addition to m1,\" so u1 is already given.\n\nSo, knowing u1 doesn't give me new information; it's already known.\n\nTherefore, option B is not necessary.\n\nOption C: The final speed of object 2 (v2)\n\nIf I know v2, can I find m2?\n\nAgain, starting with the equations:\n\nMomentum: m1 * u1 = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\n\nEnergy: m1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * v1\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nI have two equations with three unknowns: m2, v1, and u1.\n\nWait, u1 is known.\n\nSo, knowns are m1 and u1.\n\nIf I know v2, then I have:\n\nFrom momentum: m1 * u1 = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\n\nFrom energy: m1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * v1\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nI need to solve for m2.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom the momentum equation:\n\nm1 * v1 = m1 * u1 - m2 * v2\n\nSo, v1 = u1 - (m2 / m1) * v2\n\nPlug this into the energy equation:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * (u1 - (m2 / m1) * v2)\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nExpand the square:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * (u1\u00b2 - 2 * u1 * (m2 / m1) * v2 + (m2 / m1)\u00b2 * v2\u00b2) + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * u1\u00b2 - 2 * m2 * u1 * v2 + (m2\u00b2 / m1) * v2\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nNow, subtract m1 * u1\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n0 = -2 * m2 * u1 * v2 + (m2\u00b2 / m1) * v2\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nFactor m2:\n\n0 = m2 * [ -2 * u1 * v2 + (m2 / m1) * v2\u00b2 + v2\u00b2 ]\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can solve the momentum equation for v1 and plug into the energy equation.\n\nFrom momentum: v1 = (m1 * u1 - m2 * v2) / m1\n\nPlug into energy:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * [(m1 * u1 - m2 * v2) / m1]\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = (m1 * u1 - m2 * v2)\u00b2 / m1 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by m1 to eliminate denominators:\n\nm1\u00b2 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * (m1 * u1 - m2 * v2)\u00b2 + m1 * m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nExpand the square:\n\nm1\u00b2 * u1\u00b2 = m1 * (m1\u00b2 * u1\u00b2 - 2 * m1 * m2 * u1 * v2 + m2\u00b2 * v2\u00b2) + m1 * m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by m1:\n\nm1 * u1\u00b2 = m1\u00b2 * u1\u00b2 - 2 * m1 * m2 * u1 * v2 + m2\u00b2 * v2\u00b2 + m2 * v2\u00b2\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can solve for m2.\n\nThis seems too involved, and I'm not sure if it's leading me to a straightforward solution.\n\nMaybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the coefficients of the equations to express m2 in terms of known quantities.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming.\n\nGiven that option A allowed me to solve for m2 directly, maybe option C isn't as straightforward.\n\nOption D: Any 2 of the above values\n\nThis suggests that knowing any two of the speeds would be sufficient to find m2.\n\nIs that true?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf I know v1 and v2, then from the momentum equation:\n\nm1 * u1 = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\n\nSo, m2 = (m1 * u1 - m1 * v1) / v2\n\nWait, that's similar to what I did earlier.\n\nBut I already saw that knowing v1 alone is sufficient.\n\nSo, knowing v1 and v2 would also be sufficient, but knowing v1 alone is already enough.\n\nSimilarly, knowing v2 alone might not be sufficient, as my earlier attempt suggests.\n\nWait, but in option D, it says \"any 2 of the above values,\" meaning any two speeds.\n\nBut since knowing one speed is already sufficient, knowing two should also be sufficient.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the minimum necessary information.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is option A, since knowing v1 alone is sufficient to find m2.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A: Knowing v1 allows me to find m2, as shown earlier.\n\nOption B: Knowing u1 doesn't provide new information since it's already known.\n\nOption C: Knowing v2 seems to complicate things, and I couldn't easily solve for m2.\n\nOption D: Any two speeds would allow me to solve for m2, but since knowing one speed is already sufficient, this might not be necessary.\n\nTherefore, the minimum necessary information is option A: the final speed of object 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
