                    "text": "Let's see. Mr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz. He flips a coin before writing each question. If it's heads, he writes a true statement; if tails, a false statement. He does this for all five questions. I need to find the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the sequence is determined. Each question's answer depends on the coin flip before writing it. So, for each question, there's a coin flip that decides whether the statement is true or false.\n\nLet me think about the sequence TFTFT. That means:\n\n- Question 1: True\n\n- Question 2: False\n\n- Question 3: True\n\n- Question 4: False\n\n- Question 5: True\n\nEach of these must correspond to the coin flips before writing each question.\n\nNow, the coin flip before the first question decides the first statement. If heads, it's true; if tails, false. But then, for the second question, he flips the coin again, and so on for each question.\n\nWait a minute, is there a coin flip before each question? The problem says he flips a coin before writing the first question, and then continues until all five statements are written, flipping a coin before each question.\n\nSo, for each question from 1 to 5, there is a separate coin flip determining the answer.\n\nAssuming each coin flip is independent and fair, with probability 1/2 for heads and 1/2 for tails.\n\nSo, for the sequence TFTFT, I need each question to match the specified true or false based on the coin flips.\n\nLet's consider each question one by one.\n\nQuestion 1: True. This corresponds to heads on the first coin flip.\n\nQuestion 2: False. This corresponds to tails on the second coin flip.\n\nQuestion 3: True. Heads on the third coin flip.\n\nQuestion 4: False. Tails on the fourth coin flip.\n\nQuestion 5: True. Heads on the fifth coin flip.\n\nSince each coin flip is independent, the probability for each flip is 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability for the entire sequence TFTFT would be (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, there's 1/32, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any dependency or if I'm missing something.\n\nThe problem says he flips a coin before writing the first question, and continues until all five statements are written, flipping a coin before each question.\n\nSo, it's like five independent coin flips, each determining the answer for that question.\n\nTherefore, the probability should indeed be (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\n\nOption C is 1/32.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the sequence.\n\nIs there any chance that the coin flips are not independent? The problem states he flips a coin before each question, so they should be independent.\n\nAlso, is the first coin flip determining the first question, and so on, without any relation to previous flips.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 1/32 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but option A is 1/6, which seems too high compared to my calculation.\n\nOption B is 1/64, which would be (1/2)^6, but there are only five questions, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is 1/2, which also doesn't fit.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, 1/32 seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let's calculate the total number of possible sequences.\n\nEach question has two possible answers, true or false, determined by the coin flip.\n\nSo, for five questions, the total number of possible sequences is 2^5 = 32.\n\nThe desired sequence is TFTFT, which is only one specific sequence.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/32.\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 1/32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ \\dfrac{1}{32}} \\]"
