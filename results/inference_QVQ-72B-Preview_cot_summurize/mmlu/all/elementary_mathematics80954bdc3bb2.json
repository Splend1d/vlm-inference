                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: 12 over 18 equals what over 9? It's asking me to find the number that makes this statement true. The options are 4, 6, 8, or 12. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that fractions are like parts of something. So, 12 over 18 is the same as something over 9. I need to find out what that something is. I think this has to do with equivalent fractions, where different fractions can represent the same value.\n\nSo, if 12/18 is equal to ?/9, I need to find the value of the question mark. Maybe I can cross-multiply to solve for it. Let's try that.\n\nCross-multiplying means I take the numerator of the first fraction times the denominator of the second fraction and set it equal to the denominator of the first fraction times the numerator of the second fraction. So, 12 times 9 should equal 18 times the unknown number.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n12 * 9 = 18 * ?\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n108 = 18 * ?\n\nNow, to find the value of ?, I can divide both sides of the equation by 18.\n\nSo, ? = 108 / 18\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n18 times 6 is 108.\n\nYes, 18 * 6 = 108.\n\nSo, ? = 6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can plug it back into the original equation to see if it makes sense.\n\nSo, 12/18 = 6/9\n\nI know that both fractions can be simplified. Let's see:\n\n12/18 can be reduced by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6, which would give me 2/3.\n\nSimilarly, 6/9 can be reduced by dividing both by 3, which gives me 2/3.\n\nSo, yes, 12/18 does equal 6/9.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. Maybe use the concept of scaling.\n\nIf I have 12 over 18 equal to some number over 9, I need to see how the denominator changes from 18 to 9. Well, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, the denominator is being halved.\n\nTherefore, to keep the fraction equivalent, I should also halve the numerator.\n\nSo, 12 divided by 2 is 6.\n\nAgain, that suggests that the missing number is 6.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using the concept of equivalent fractions by multiplying or dividing by the same number.\n\nStarting with 12/18, I can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 18.\n\nThe GCD of 12 and 18 is 6.\n\nSo, dividing numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n12 \u00f7 6 = 2\n\n18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n\nSo, 12/18 simplifies to 2/3.\n\nSimilarly, 6/9 can also be simplified.\n\nThe GCD of 6 and 9 is 3.\n\nSo, 6 \u00f7 3 = 2\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\nThus, 6/9 simplifies to 2/3.\n\nThis confirms again that 12/18 equals 6/9.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to express both fractions with the same denominator, I could do that.\n\nThe denominator in the second fraction is 9. How does that relate to 18? 18 divided by 9 is 2, or 9 is 18 divided by 2.\n\nSo, to scale 12/18 to have a denominator of 9, I need to divide both numerator and denominator by 2.\n\nSo, numerator: 12 \u00f7 2 = 6\n\nDenominator: 18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\nAgain, this leads me to 6/9.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the relationship between the denominators.\n\nIf I have 18 and I want to go to 9, I'm dividing by 2.\n\nTo keep the fractions equal, I need to do the same to the numerator: 12 \u00f7 2 = 6.\n\nThis reinforces that the missing number is 6.\n\nJust to make sure there aren't any tricks here, I'll consider if there's another way that 12/18 could equal something over 9.\n\nPerhaps by considering improper fractions or something, but no, since 12/18 is less than one, and 9 is larger than 12, it makes sense that the numerator in the second fraction is less than 9.\n\nAlso, looking back at the options provided: 4, 6, 8, 12.\n\nIf I plug in 4: 12/18 = 4/9\n\nIs that true? Well, 12/18 simplifies to 2/3, and 4/9 is not equal to 2/3.\n\nSimilarly, 8/9 is also not equal to 2/3.\n\n12/18 = 2/3, and 12/9 is greater than 1, which doesn't make sense because 12/18 is less than 1.\n\nSo, the only option that fits is 6.\n\nMoreover, thinking about it in terms of proportions:\n\nIf 12 to 18 is the same as ? to 9, then the ratios should be equal.\n\nSo, 12:18 = ?:9\n\nAgain, this points to ? being 6.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and each one leads me to the conclusion that the missing number is 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
