                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal conundrum. We've got three contiguous lots owned by a homeowner, his daughter, and his sister. The land slopes downward from the homeowner's property to the sister's, meaning water naturally flows in that direction.\n\nFirst, the homeowner and his daughter's lots are in their natural, unimproved state. The sister, however, has been living in a house she built on her property for ten years. So, she's had some development there.\n\nThe daughter decides to build a house on her lot and excavates an eight-foot deep area for a basement. After completing her house, she macadamizes an area for a driveway but doesn't change the natural contours of the land elsewhere.\n\nShortly after, the sister starts complaining to the daughter about flooding in her basement, claiming it used to be free of water. The sister then builds a concrete wall along her border with the daughter's property to prevent rainwater from flowing onto her land from the daughter's side. This action causes the surface water to pool and stagnate on the daughter's land.\n\nThe daughter, understandably upset, demands that the sister remove the wall. When the sister refuses, the daughter takes legal action to compel its removal.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the most likely outcome of this dispute?\n\nOption A says the sister must remove the wall because she has no right to obstruct the flow of surface water.\n\nOption B says the sister must remove the wall at the daughter's expense.\n\nOption C says the sister may leave the wall without being liable to the daughter for money damages.\n\nOption D says the sister may leave the wall but will be liable to the daughter for money damages.\n\nTo figure this out, we need to understand the law regarding water flow between properties, especially when it comes to natural drainage and artificial changes.\n\nGenerally, in property law, there are concepts like natural drainage rights and altered drainage responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the natural flow of water is considered, meaning that a landowner has the right to have water flow across their land as it naturally would. However, when developments are made, like building a house or changing the landscape, this can alter the natural drainage patterns.\n\nIn this case, the daughter excavated her land to build a basement and macadamized a driveway, which could potentially affect the natural drainage. Asphalt or macadam can prevent water from infiltrating the soil, leading to increased runoff.\n\nThe sister, in response to flooding in her basement, built a wall to prevent water from the daughter's land from flowing onto her property. This wall, however, causes water to back up on the daughter's land.\n\nNow, the daughter is seeking to have the wall removed, presumably on the grounds that it's interfering with the natural drainage of her property.\n\nLet's consider the legal principles that might apply here.\n\nOne key principle is the \"rule of reasonable use,\" which balances the rights of upstream and downstream landowners. This rule generally holds that a landowner can make reasonable use of their land but cannot do so in a way that causes substantial and unreasonable harm to neighboring properties.\n\nAnother relevant principle is the \"civil law rule\" or \"modified civil law rule,\" which allows a landowner to alter their property in a reasonable manner, but they must accept any increased drainage that results from such alterations.\n\nGiven that the sister has been living on her property for ten years and presumably has an established drainage pattern, the daughter's recent development might have altered that pattern, leading to increased runoff onto the sister's land.\n\nThe sister's construction of the wall to prevent this runoff could be seen as protecting her property from the increased water flow caused by the daughter's development.\n\nHowever, the daughter's action to have the wall removed suggests that she believes the sister has no right to obstruct the natural flow of water from her property.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, a landowner cannot obstruct the natural drainage from neighboring properties without permission or compensation.\n\nGiven that, option A suggests that the sister must remove the wall because she has no right to obstruct the flow of surface water.\n\nBut is that always the case? What if the daughter's development caused significant harm to the sister's property by increasing the water flow?\n\nIn some legal systems, if a downstream landowner can prove that the upstream development caused increased drainage and resulting damage, they might be permitted to construct barriers to mitigate the harm, provided they do so reasonably and without causing undue harm to the upstream property.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the sister built a wall that causes water to stagnate on the daughter's land, which could lead to issues like waterlogging, damage to vegetation, or other problems.\n\nThis could be seen as an unreasonable use of her property, as it causes harm to the daughter's land.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the court would rule in favor of the daughter, requiring the sister to remove the wall.\n\nOption B adds that the sister must remove the wall at the daughter's expense. This might be possible if the daughter can prove that the wall caused damage to her property and that removal is necessary to restore the natural drainage.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the cost of removal would be borne by the sister, but not necessarily at the daughter's expense, depending on local laws and the specifics of the case.\n\nOption C states that the sister may leave the wall without being liable for money damages. This would imply that the court finds her actions acceptable, perhaps if the daughter's development was unreasonable or caused harm to the sister's property.\n\nOption D says the sister may leave the wall but will be liable for money damages. This suggests that while the wall remains, the sister would have to compensate the daughter for any resulting harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that the daughter's development altered the natural drainage, causing increased runoff onto the sister's property, leading to basement flooding.\n\nThe sister's response was to build a wall to prevent this runoff, but this action caused water to stagnate on the daughter's land.\n\nIn such a scenario, it's likely that the court would consider the daughter's development as the cause of the problem and may require her to mitigate the increased runoff, perhaps by installing drainage systems or other measures.\n\nHowever, the sister's unilateral action to build a wall that affects the daughter's property may be seen as inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the sister must remove the wall because she has no right to obstruct the flow of surface water, as stated in option A.\n\nBut, considering that the daughter's development caused the issue, the court might also order the daughter to implement solutions to manage the increased runoff, such as better drainage systems or permeable surfaces.\n\nHowever, based on the information given, the immediate issue is the wall, and the daughter is seeking its removal.\n\nThus, the sister is likely to be required to remove the wall.\n\nAs for the cost, it's possible that the sister would have to bear the expense of removal, but the exact financial responsibilities might depend on the court's final decision regarding the daughter's responsibility for causing the increased runoff.\n\nTherefore, option A seems the most straightforward answer based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
