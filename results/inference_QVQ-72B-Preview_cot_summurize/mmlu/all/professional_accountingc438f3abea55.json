                    "text": "So I have this question about a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records. The options are:\n\nA. Is absolute.\n\nB. Is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock.\n\nC. Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.\n\nD. Exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged.\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that shareholders have certain rights in a corporation, including the right to inspect books and records under certain circumstances. But I don't think this right is absolute. There must be some conditions or limitations.\n\nOption A says it's absolute. That seems too broad. If it were absolute, anyone who is a shareholder could demand to see all kinds of internal documents without any reason. That doesn't sound right because corporations probably need some protections against frivolous or malicious inspections.\n\nOption B mentions that it's conditioned on the shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock. Hmm, that seems like a specific monetary threshold. I don't recall if there's a universal threshold like that. Maybe it varies by jurisdiction or by the corporation's bylaws.\n\nOption C says that it requires the demand to be for a proper purpose. This sounds familiar. I think shareholders can request to inspect books and records, but they need to have a legitimate reason or purpose related to their interest as a shareholder.\n\nOption D states that the right exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged. That seems too restrictive. I don't think shareholders can only inspect records if there's an accusation of fraud or illegality. They might have other reasons to want to review the corporation's finances or operations.\n\nLet me think about this again. I'm pretty sure that the requirement for a \"proper purpose\" is a key aspect of a shareholder's right to inspect records. Many corporations have provisions that allow shareholders to inspect books and records for any purpose reasonably related to their interest as shareholders.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut let me consider option B again. The $5000 worth of stock ownership requirement. Is that a standard thing? I don't think so. I believe that in many jurisdictions, the right to inspect records is generally accorded to all shareholders, regardless of how much stock they own. There might be some exceptions or specific rules depending on the state or country, but I don't think there's a universal monetary threshold.\n\nMaybe in some cases, there are ownership requirements, like owning a certain percentage of shares or having held the shares for a certain period, but again, I don't think there's a standard $5000 threshold.\n\nOption A, as I thought earlier, is likely incorrect because the right isn't absolute. There are usually procedures to follow and potentially some discretion by the corporation in allowing inspection.\n\nOption D seems too narrow. Shareholders shouldn't only be able to inspect records when there's alleged fraud or illegality. They might want to inspect records for due diligence before a vote, to assess the corporation's financial health, or for other legitimate purposes.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most accurate among the choices provided. The demand to inspect must be for a proper purpose.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll recall some case law or statutory provisions. I think in Delaware, which is a common jurisdiction for corporations, shareholders have the right to inspect books and records for any proper purpose. Similarly, in many other states, there are statutes that allow shareholders to inspect records provided they have a proper purpose.\n\nSo, yes, I believe option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
