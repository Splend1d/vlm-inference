                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to evaluate the sum of the ceiling of the square roots of numbers from 5 up to 29. The ceiling function, denoted by \u2308x\u2309, means I have to round up to the nearest integer. So, for each number n from 5 to 29, I'll find the square root of n, and then round that up to the nearest integer. After that, I'll add all those integers together.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what the square roots of these numbers are and then apply the ceiling function. But doing this for each number from 5 to 29 individually seems time-consuming. There must be a smarter way to approach this.\n\nI recall that the ceiling function of a square root can be simplified if I group numbers that have the same ceiling value. For example, there might be a range of numbers where the ceiling of their square roots is the same.\n\nLet me think about the square roots of perfect squares near 5 and 29. The perfect squares in this range are 4 (which is 2\u00b2), 9 (3\u00b2), 16 (4\u00b2), 25 (5\u00b2), and 36 (6\u00b2). Since 4 is just below 5, I'll start from 5 up to 29.\n\nLet me consider the intervals between these perfect squares:\n\n1. From 5 to 9: the square roots will be between \u221a4 = 2 and \u221a9 = 3. So, the ceiling of \u221an for n in this range will be 3.\n\n2. From 10 to 16: the square roots will be between \u221a9 = 3 and \u221a16 = 4. So, the ceiling of \u221an for n in this range will be 4.\n\n3. From 17 to 25: the square roots will be between \u221a16 = 4 and \u221a25 = 5. So, the ceiling of \u221an for n in this range will be 5.\n\n4. From 26 to 29: the square roots will be between \u221a25 = 5 and \u221a36 = 6. So, the ceiling of \u221an for n in this range will be 6.\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure about the ranges. Specifically, I need to ensure that I'm including the upper limit correctly since it's a ceiling function.\n\nLet me verify for n = 9: \u221a9 = 3, and \u23083\u2309 = 3.\n\nFor n = 10: \u221a10 \u2248 3.162, and \u23083.162\u2309 = 4.\n\nFor n = 16: \u221a16 = 4, and \u23084\u2309 = 4.\n\nFor n = 17: \u221a17 \u2248 4.123, and \u23084.123\u2309 = 5.\n\nFor n = 25: \u221a25 = 5, and \u23085\u2309 = 5.\n\nFor n = 26: \u221a26 \u2248 5.099, and \u23085.099\u2309 = 6.\n\nFor n = 29: \u221a29 \u2248 5.385, and \u23085.385\u2309 = 6.\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, my initial grouping seems accurate.\n\nNow, let's count how many integers are in each group from 5 to 29:\n\n1. From 5 to 9: that's 5,6,7,8,9 \u2014 total of 5 numbers.\n\n2. From 10 to 16: that's 10,11,12,13,14,15,16 \u2014 total of 7 numbers.\n\n3. From 17 to 25: that's 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 \u2014 total of 9 numbers.\n\n4. From 26 to 29: that's 26,27,28,29 \u2014 total of 4 numbers.\n\nNow, using the ceiling values I determined earlier:\n\n- For n from 5 to 9: \u2308\u221an\u2309 = 3\n\n- For n from 10 to 16: \u2308\u221an\u2309 = 4\n\n- For n from 17 to 25: \u2308\u221an\u2309 = 5\n\n- For n from 26 to 29: \u2308\u221an\u2309 = 6\n\nSo, the sum can be calculated as:\n\nSum = (number of terms in first group \u00d7 ceiling value for first group) + (number of terms in second group \u00d7 ceiling value for second group) + ... and so on for all groups.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nSum = (5 \u00d7 3) + (7 \u00d7 4) + (9 \u00d7 5) + (4 \u00d7 6)\n\nNow, let's compute each part:\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n\n7 \u00d7 4 = 28\n\n9 \u00d7 5 = 45\n\n4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n15 + 28 = 43\n\n43 + 45 = 88\n\n88 + 24 = 112\n\nSo, the total sum is 112.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 112\n\nB. 111\n\nC. 2006\n\nD. 110\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me verify the number of terms in each group again:\n\n- From 5 to 9: 5,6,7,8,9 \u2014 that's 5 numbers. Correct.\n\n- From 10 to 16: 10,11,12,13,14,15,16 \u2014 that's 7 numbers. Correct.\n\n- From 17 to 25: 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 \u2014 that's 9 numbers. Correct.\n\n- From 26 to 29: 26,27,28,29 \u2014 that's 4 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnd the ceiling values seem correct based on the square roots.\n\nAlternatively, I could try calculating the sum directly by computing the ceiling of the square root for each number from 5 to 29 and adding them up, but that would be time-consuming. Given that my grouping method seems sound and the calculations check out, I think 112 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]"
