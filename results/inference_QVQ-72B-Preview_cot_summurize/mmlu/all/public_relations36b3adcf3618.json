                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about mass communication theories. It mentions that early theories thought audiences were passive and easy to manipulate through media messages. But now, there's current thinking that seems to contradict that. I need to choose which option best describes current thinking.\n\nLet me read the options again:\n\nA. Audiences are more vulnerable and passive than ever before.\n\nB. Television viewing, in particular, creates increased activity in the right hemisphere of the brain.\n\nC. Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\nD. Technology has led to increasingly passive recipients at the ends of message transmission systems.\n\nHmm. Option A says audiences are more vulnerable and passive now. But if early theories already thought audiences were passive and vulnerable, and current thinking is different, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B talks specifically about television viewing and the right hemisphere of the brain. That sounds like a specific effect of media on the brain, but the question is more general about current thinking on mass communication.\n\nOption C says that active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages. This seems to suggest that audiences are active participants and respond differently to messages, which contradicts the early idea of uniform passivity.\n\nOption D says that technology has led to more passive recipients. Again, if early theories already thought audiences were passive, and now with more technology, audiences might be even more passive, but I'm not sure if that's the current perspective.\n\nWait a minute. Maybe I need to think about this differently. The question says \"current thinking\" is different from early theories that saw audiences as passive and easily manipulated. So perhaps current thinking emphasizes that audiences are more active and less uniformly affected by media messages.\n\nLet me consider each option in that light.\n\nOption A: If current thinking is that audiences are more vulnerable and passive, that would align with early theories, which already saw audiences as passive and vulnerable. So maybe this isn't a shift in thinking.\n\nOption B: This seems to be about a specific effect of television on brain activity. While interesting, it doesn't directly address the general perspective on how audiences receive mass communication messages.\n\nOption C: This option suggests that receivers are active and not uniformly affected. This seems to contradict the early theories that viewed audiences as passive and uniformly influenced. So, this might be a better reflection of current thinking.\n\nOption D: This option proposes that technology has made audiences more passive. If early theories already saw audiences as passive, then saying they're even more passive now might not be a significant shift in thinking.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that with the rise of interactive media and social networks, current communication theories emphasize audience agency and active engagement with media content. So, audiences are seen as active interpreters and even creators of media, not just passive recipients.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to align best with current thinking, as it acknowledges that receivers are active and respond differently to mass communication messages.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should consider some examples.\n\nFor instance, the Uses and Gratifications theory suggests that audiences actively seek out media that meets their individual needs and desires. This would support the idea that receivers are active, not passive.\n\nAnother example is the Cultivation Theory, which looks at how long-term exposure to media can shape perceptions, but even here, it's recognized that different people may interpret and integrate media messages differently based on their backgrounds and beliefs.\n\nSo, again, this points to option C, which says active receivers are not uniformly affected.\n\nOption B might be relevant in a different context, perhaps in media psychology or neuroscience, but it doesn't seem to capture the general current thinking on audience reception in mass communication.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option C: Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
