I need to pick the correct term that refers to prejudice or bias against older adults.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each term means. Starting with option A, Ageism. I've heard this term before. I think it refers to discrimination based on age, especially against older people. But I'm not entirely sure if it encompasses prejudice or bias specifically.\n\nOption B is Oldism. This sounds similar to Ageism but might be a less common term. Maybe it's another way of referring to the same concept, or perhaps it has a different nuance.\n\nOption C is Age bigotry. Bigotry generally means intolerance toward opinions or beliefs different from one's own. So, Age bigotry might refer to intolerance based on age, but I'm not sure if it's the standard term for prejudice against older adults.\n\nOption D is Senilism. Senile is a term sometimes used to describe older adults who are experiencing mental decline, but using it as a suffix in Senilism might not make sense in this context. Maybe it's not the right term here.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. I recall that Ageism is a term coined by Robert N. Butler in the 1960s to describe discrimination against elderly people. It's modeled on racism and sexism, where individuals are treated unfairly based on their age. So, Ageism seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOldism sounds like it could be another term for Ageism, but I'm not familiar with it. Maybe it's not as widely used or recognized.\n\nAge bigotry seems to be more about intolerance or hatred based on age, which could include prejudice against older adults. However, bigotry is often used in reference to religious or political beliefs, so applying it to age might not be standard practice.\n\nSenilism doesn't seem to fit because senile refers to age-related mental decline, and Senilism would probably refer to that condition rather than prejudice against older adults.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think the most appropriate term for prejudice or bias against older adults is Ageism. It's a recognized term in sociology and gerontology, and it directly refers to discrimination based on age.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if any of the other terms are also commonly used or if they might be regional variations. For instance, Oldism might be used in certain contexts, but I don't think so. It seems like Ageism is the more established and widely recognized term.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer should be A. Ageism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Ageism}} \\]"
