                    "text": "So I have this question here about states of matter. It says that one of the states is characterized by a closely packed arrangement of particles, resulting in a stable, definite shape and definite volume. And I need to choose which state of matter that describes: solid, liquid, gas, or plasma.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling what each state of matter is like.\n\nFirst, there's a solid. In solids, the particles are closely packed together, usually in a fixed arrangement. They have a definite shape and a definite volume. So, if I have a solid, like a brick or a piece of metal, it keeps its own shape and doesn't change unless forced to.\n\nThen there's a liquid. Liquids have particles that are close together but not as rigidly arranged as in solids. Liquids have a definite volume but not a definite shape; they take the shape of their container. So, water in a glass takes the shape of the glass but still has a definite volume.\n\nNext is a gas. Gases have particles that are far apart and moving freely in all directions. They have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume; they spread out to fill whatever container they're in. So, if I have gas in a bottle, it will fill the entire bottle, regardless of the bottle's shape or size.\n\nLastly, there's plasma. Plasma is often considered the fourth state of matter. It consists of ionized particles, both positive ions and free electrons, and is typically found in extremely high temperatures or under certain conditions in stars and lightning. Like a gas, plasma has no definite shape or volume and will expand to fill its container.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it describes a state where particles are closely packed, resulting in a stable, definite shape and definite volume. So, based on my understanding:\n\n- Solid: closely packed, definite shape and volume.\n\n- Liquid: closely packed but takes the shape of its container (no definite shape), but has a definite volume.\n\n- Gas: particles are not closely packed, and it has neither a definite shape nor a definite volume.\n\n- Plasma: similar to gas, particles are not closely packed, and it doesn't have a definite shape or volume.\n\nSo, the state that fits the description of being closely packed and having a definite shape and definite volume is a solid.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn solids, the particles are indeed closely packed, often in a crystalline structure, which gives them a definite shape. And because the particles are closely packed and have limited movement, they maintain a fixed volume.\n\nIn liquids, although the particles are closely packed, the bonds between them are not as strong as in solids, allowing the liquid to flow and take the shape of its container. So, even though the particles are close, the liquid doesn't have a definite shape.\n\nGases and plasmas are both fluid states where the particles are not closely packed, and they don't resist compression very well, meaning they don't have a definite volume.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Solid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where another state might also fit this description.\n\nFor example, some liquids can appear quite stable and have a somewhat definite shape, like honey or asphalt, but technically, they are still liquids and will flow over time, even if very slowly.\n\nSome solids can change shape over time due to temperature changes or pressure, like wax melting, but they still maintain their definite volume until they change state.\n\nPlasmas and gases are both highly compressible and don't have a definite shape or volume, so they don't fit the description.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. Solid.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can look up a quick definition to confirm.\n\nAccording to scientific definitions:\n\n- Solid: a state of matter characterized by rigid particles arranged in a close-packed structure, giving it a definite shape and volume.\n\n- Liquid: a state of matter that has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container due to the ability of its particles to flow.\n\n- Gas: a state of matter with particles that are widely spaced and move freely, resulting in no definite shape or volume.\n\n- Plasma: a high-energy state of matter consisting of ionized particles, similar to gas but with electrical properties.\n\nSo, based on these definitions, the description in the question matches perfectly with the characteristics of a solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Solid}} \\]"
