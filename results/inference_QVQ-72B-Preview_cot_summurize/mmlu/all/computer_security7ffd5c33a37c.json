Public-key system\n\nD. All of them\n\nHmm, let's start by understanding what a digital signature is. A digital signature is like a mathematical scheme that verifies the authenticity of a message or document. It's crucial for ensuring integrity and non-repudiation in digital communications.\n\nNow, I need to recall how different key systems work.\n\nFirst, there's the private-key system, also known as symmetric-key cryptography. In this system, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. So, if someone uses a private key to sign a message, they can prove their identity because only they should know that key. But in practice, using a private key for signatures isn't common because it's risky to use the same key for signing and encrypting data.\n\nNext, there's the shared-key system, which I think is similar to symmetric-key cryptography. Wait, maybe it's another name for the same concept. In any case, it's about both parties sharing the same key for encryption and decryption. Using a shared key for digital signatures could be problematic because if the key is shared, anyone with the key could sign messages, which undermines the whole point of authentication.\n\nThen there's the public-key system, also known as asymmetric cryptography. Here, each entity has a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be freely shared, while the private key must be kept secret. In this system, digital signatures are created using the private key and verified using the corresponding public key. This way, anyone can verify the signature without needing access to the private key, which is more secure.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems that a public-key system is best suited for digital signatures because it allows for secure signature creation and verification without compromising the confidentiality of the signing key.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other systems could also be used for digital signatures.\n\nIn a private-key system, since the same key is used for signing and encrypting, if the key is compromised, both confidentiality and authenticity are breached. Moreover, it doesn't scale well in scenarios where multiple parties are involved because managing shared keys becomes complicated.\n\nIn a shared-key system, the issue is similar: if the key is shared among multiple parties, anyone with the key can sign messages, which doesn't provide a strong guarantee of who actually signed the message.\n\nTherefore, the public-key system seems to be the most appropriate for digital signatures because it provides a mechanism for secure signature creation and verification, ensuring both authenticity and non-repudiation.\n\nWait a minute, is there any scenario where a private-key system could be used for digital signatures? Maybe in some specific cases where the risk of key exposure is minimal, but generally, it's not advisable.\n\nAlso, I should check if there are any modern cryptographic techniques that might use combinations of these systems for digital signatures. For example, some protocols might use a hybrid approach, combining symmetric and asymmetric cryptography for different purposes, but even in those cases, the digital signature itself is typically handled by the public-key system.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in some systems, digital signatures might be implemented using hash functions in conjunction with public-key cryptography to ensure the integrity and authenticity of messages. So, while hash functions aren't key systems themselves, they play a crucial role in digital signature schemes.\n\nAdditionally, I should think about the standards and common practices in the field. For instance, standards like RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519 are all public-key cryptosystems that are widely used for digital signatures.\n\nOn the other hand, private-key systems like AES or DES are primarily used for encryption and not for digital signatures.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be C. Public-key system.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the option D: All of them. Is it possible that all types of key systems can be used for digital signatures in some way?\n\nWell, theoretically, you could conceive of a scenario where a private-key or shared-key system is used for signing, but in practice, it's not done because of the security risks involved. Public-key cryptography is specifically designed to handle the requirements of digital signatures safely and efficiently.\n\nHence, the best answer is C. Public-key system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
