                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about a recent revivalist movement in Turkey led by Fetullah G\u00fclen. The options are A. Hizmet, B. Nation of Islam, C. Muslim Brotherhood, D. Sufism. I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that Fetullah G\u00fclen is a Turkish Islamic cleric who has been involved in a movement in Turkey. I think the movement he's associated with is called Hizmet, which is option A. But let me make sure.\n\nThe Nation of Islam is an American Muslim organization, and I don't think it's related to G\u00fclen or Turkey. So, option B probably isn't correct.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood is a transnational organization that originated in Egypt and has spread to many countries, but again, I don't recall it being led by Fetullah G\u00fclen. So, option C seems unlikely.\n\nSufism is a mystical dimension of Islam, and while it's present in Turkey, I don't think it's specifically led by G\u00fclen. So, option D is probably not the right answer.\n\nThat brings me back to option A, Hizmet. I've heard of Hizmet in relation to G\u00fclen. Let me see if I can recall more about it.\n\nHizmet, which means \"service\" in Turkish, is a social movement that promotes education, interfaith dialogue, and community service. It's been influential in Turkey and has branches in other countries. G\u00fclen is often credited as its founder or leader.\n\nBut, I should consider if there's any other movement in Turkey led by G\u00fclen. Maybe he's involved in multiple movements? No, I think Hizmet is the primary one associated with him.\n\nWait a minute, I think there might be some controversy surrounding G\u00fclen and his movement, especially in relation to Turkish politics. The Turkish government under President Erdogan has accused G\u00fclen of being behind a coup attempt in 2016, but that's more about politics than the name of the movement.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, Hizmet seems to be the correct answer for the movement led by Fetullah G\u00fclen in Turkey.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me quickly double-check each option again:\n\nA. Hizmet: As I thought, this is the movement led by G\u00fclen.\n\nB. Nation of Islam: This is an American group, not related to Turkey or G\u00fclen.\n\nC. Muslim Brotherhood: While present in many countries, it's not specifically led by G\u00fclen.\n\nD. Sufism: This is a mystical tradition in Islam, not a revivalist movement led by G\u00fclen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Hizmet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Hizmet}} \\]"
