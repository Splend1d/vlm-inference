                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about inducing polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. The options are penicillin, colchicine, tetracycline, and puromycin. I need to figure out which one of these agents can cause polyploidy.\n\nFirst, I should recall what polyploidy means. Polyploidy is when an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes in its cells. So, instead of being diploid (having two sets), polyploid cells have three sets (triploid), four sets (tetraploid), or more.\n\nNow, I need to think about how these agents affect the cell to induce polyploidy. Generally, polyploidy can be induced by disrupting mitosis, especially during chromosome separation. If chromosomes replicate but fail to separate properly during cell division, this can lead to cells with extra chromosome sets.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Penicillin: I know penicillin is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. But since eukaryotes don't have cell walls, I doubt it would have a direct effect on chromosome separation or cell division in eukaryotes. Maybe it could affect some processes indirectly, but I don't think it's primarily used for inducing polyploidy.\n\nB. Colchicine: This rings a bell. Colchicine is known to interfere with microtubule formation, which is crucial for chromosome movement during mitosis. If microtubules can't form properly, chromosomes won't separate correctly, which could lead to polyploidy. I think this is a likely candidate.\n\nC. Tetracycline: Another antibiotic, tetracycline primarily inhibits protein synthesis in prokaryotes by binding to ribosomes. Similar to penicillin, its main effects are on bacteria, not on eukaryotic cell division processes. So, probably not the right choice for inducing polyploidy in eukaryotes.\n\nD. Puromycin: This is an antibiotic that also inhibits protein synthesis, but in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes by mimicking aminoacyl-tRNA and terminating translation. While it affects protein synthesis in eukaryotes, I don't see a direct link to chromosome separation or polyploidy induction.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, colchicine seems to be the most appropriate agent for inducing polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. Its action on microtubules disrupts mitosis, leading to the formation of polyploid cells.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Is there any possibility that inhibiting protein synthesis could indirectly lead to polyploidy? Well, protein synthesis is essential for many cellular processes, including those involved in cell division. If protein synthesis is inhibited, it might affect cell division, but I don't think it specifically leads to polyploidy. The primary mechanism for polyploidy induction is disrupting the separation of chromosomes during mitosis, which colchicine does by targeting microtubules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Colchicine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
