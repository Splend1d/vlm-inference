                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about a perfectly competitive employer hiring labor. The question is: A perfectly competitive employer hires labor up to the point where...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wage = Marginal factor cost.\n\nB. Wage = Marginal product of labor.\n\nC. Wage = Marginal revenue.\n\nD. Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some basic principles of how a perfectly competitive firm makes hiring decisions. In a perfectly competitive market, both the product and the labor markets are competitive. That means the firm is a price taker for both its output and the labor it hires.\n\nSo, the firm faces a horizontal demand curve for its product, meaning it can sell as much as it wants at the market price. Similarly, in the labor market, it can hire as much labor as it needs at the going market wage rate.\n\nThe goal of the firm is to maximize profits, right? Profit is total revenue minus total costs. To maximize profits, the firm needs to decide how much labor to hire.\n\nNow, the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor is the additional revenue the firm gets from hiring one more unit of labor. It's calculated as the marginal product of labor (MPL) multiplied by the marginal revenue (MR). Since the firm is perfectly competitive in the product market, the marginal revenue equals the price of the product (P). So, MRP = MPL * P.\n\nOn the other hand, the cost of hiring one more unit of labor is the wage rate (W). In a perfectly competitive labor market, the wage rate is the same for all levels of labor hired.\n\nSo, the firm should hire labor up to the point where the marginal revenue product equals the wage rate. That is, MRP = W.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wage = Marginal factor cost.\n\nHmm, marginal factor cost is a concept used in monopsony or imperfectly competitive labor markets. In a perfectly competitive labor market, the marginal factor cost equals the wage rate. So, this option might be true, but it seems a bit indirect.\n\nB. Wage = Marginal product of labor.\n\nThis doesn't directly make sense because the marginal product of labor is in physical units, and wage is in currency units. They're not comparable.\n\nC. Wage = Marginal revenue.\n\nMarginal revenue is related to the revenue from selling one more unit of output, not directly to the cost of hiring labor.\n\nD. Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor.\n\nThis seems to align with what I recalled earlier. MRP is the additional revenue from hiring one more unit of labor, and the wage is the cost of hiring that labor. So, setting MRP equal to W should maximize profits.\n\nWait a minute, in perfectly competitive markets, the marginal factor cost is equal to the wage rate. So, MFC = W.\n\nAnd the profit-maximizing condition is MRP = MFC.\n\nGiven that MFC = W in perfect competition, then MRP = W.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf MRP > W, hiring an additional worker would add more to revenue than to costs, increasing profits.\n\nIf MRP < W, hiring an additional worker would add less to revenue than to costs, decreasing profits.\n\nSo, at the point where MRP = W, profits are maximized.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIn perfectly competitive labor markets, the firm faces a horizontal labor supply curve, meaning it can hire as many workers as it wants at the market wage.\n\nThe firm's demand for labor is derived from the MRP, which is decreasing as more labor is hired, assuming diminishing marginal returns.\n\nEquilibrium in the labor market occurs where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, which is where the labor supply curve intersects the labor demand (MRP) curve.\n\nBut from the firm's perspective, it hires labor up to the point where MRP = W.\n\nSo, yes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Wage = Marginal revenue product of labor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
