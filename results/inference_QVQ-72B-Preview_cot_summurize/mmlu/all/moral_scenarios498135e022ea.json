                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether certain actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, is wrong. The options are A: both are wrong, B: the first is wrong but the second isn't, C: the first isn't wrong but the second is, and D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"As I passed the passerby, I smiled.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, someone is walking by another person and smiles at them. Hmm, smiling at someone seems like a friendly gesture, right? It's generally considered polite and kind to smile at people you pass by, especially strangers. It might make their day a little brighter or something. I can't see anything morally wrong with that. Maybe if the smile was insincere or had some ulterior motive, but the way it's phrased doesn't suggest that. So, I think Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I undressed, showered, toweled myself dry, dressed, and walked out my door and down the middle of Main Street.\"\n\nOkay, so here's what's happening: the person gets undressed, takes a shower, dries off with a towel, gets dressed again, and then walks out their door and down the middle of Main Street. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, undressing and showering: that's a normal part of daily hygiene routines. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nThen, toweling off: again, that's just part of the routine after showering. Still nothing wrong.\n\nNext, getting dressed: that's also perfectly normal. So far, everything seems fine.\n\nFinally, walking out the door and down the middle of Main Street: now, this is the part that might raise some eyebrows.\n\nWalking down the middle of the street\u2014especially a main street, which is probably a busier road\u2014is generally not something people do. Typically, pedestrians walk on sidewalks for safety, while streets are meant for vehicles. Walking down the middle of the street could be dangerous, both for the person and for drivers who might not expect to see someone walking there.\n\nMoreover, in many places, it's against the law to walk on certain roads or highways without a good reason, like an emergency. So, depending on local traffic laws, this action might not only be unsafe but also illegal.\n\nBut the question is about moral wrongness, not necessarily legality. While laws and morals can overlap, they're not the same thing. However, in this case, I think they align pretty closely. If something is legally wrong and poses a risk to oneself and others, it's likely morally wrong as well.\n\nSo, considering that walking down the middle of Main Street is potentially hazardous and against traffic regulations, I would say that this action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there are some exceptions or contexts where walking down the middle of the street could be acceptable. For example, if the street is closed off for a parade or some event, or if there are no sidewalks and it's a rural area with low traffic. But the scenario doesn't provide any such context; it just says \"down the middle of Main Street.\"\n\nGiven that, I think it's safe to assume that it's a typical main street in a town or city, where walking down the middle would indeed be inappropriate and dangerous.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
