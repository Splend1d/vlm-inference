                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement about ex post facto laws is false. Let's see, ex post facto is a Latin term that means \"after the fact.\" In law, it generally refers to laws that retroactively change the legal consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the law. And I know that these laws are generally considered unconstitutional in many legal systems, including the United States, because they can be unfair to individuals.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: They make criminal an act that was innocent when committed.\n\nI think this means that if someone did something that was legal at the time, but then a new law is passed that makes that act a crime, and applies it retroactively to punish the person for something they did before the law was passed. That sounds like a classic example of an ex post facto law. So, this should be true.\n\nOption B: They prescribe greater punishment for an act than was prescribed when it was done.\n\nThis seems similar to Option A but focuses on the severity of the punishment rather than the criminality of the act itself. So, if someone committed a crime, and then the law increases the punishment for that crime after it was committed but before the trial, and applies it retroactively, that would be an ex post facto law. So, this also seems true.\n\nOption C: They increase the evidence required to convict a person than when the act was done.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit different. Let me think about this. If a law increases the evidence required to convict someone for an act that was committed before the law was passed, is that considered an ex post facto law?\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like this would benefit the defendant by making it harder to convict them. However, I recall that ex post facto laws are primarily concerned with worsening the defendant's situation retroactively. So, if a law makes it harder to convict someone by requiring more evidence, that might actually be to the defendant's advantage.\n\nBut wait, the question is about what is false regarding ex post facto laws. So, if ex post facto laws are defined as those that increase the evidence required to convict, that might not align with the standard definition.\n\nLet me double-check. In legal terms, ex post facto laws are those that:\n\n1. Make an act a crime that was not a crime when committed.\n\n2. Increase the punishment for an act after it was committed.\n\n3. Change the rules of evidence to make it easier to convict for acts committed before the change.\n\nSo, actually, ex post facto laws typically make it easier to convict by changing rules of evidence, not harder. Therefore, if a law increases the evidence required to convict, that might not be considered an ex post facto law because it's to the defendant's benefit.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. The question is asking which statement is false about ex post facto laws. So, if Option C says that ex post facto laws increase the evidence required to convict, and I'm thinking that ex post facto laws actually tend to make it easier to convict, then Option C would be false.\n\nLet me see Option D: They alter criminal offenses or punishment in a substantially prejudicial manner for the purpose of punishing a person for some past activity.\n\nThis sounds like a broad description of ex post facto laws. It captures the essence of retroactively changing laws to harm someone for past actions. So, this seems true.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Option C is the false statement about ex post facto laws because ex post facto laws typically make it easier to convict by changing rules of evidence, not harder by increasing the evidence required.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether ex post facto laws can ever increase the evidence required to convict. I think that in most cases, ex post facto laws are about making it easier to prosecute or impose harsher penalties, not protecting the defendant.\n\nFor example, if a new law requires a higher standard of proof for a particular crime, and it's applied retroactively, that might actually benefit defendants who committed the crime before the law was passed. But ex post facto laws are generally about worsening the defendant's situation, not improving it.\n\nTherefore, stating that ex post facto laws increase the evidence required to convict would be incorrect because it suggests that these laws make it harder to convict, which is contrary to their usual purpose.\n\nSo, I believe Option C is the false statement about ex post facto laws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
