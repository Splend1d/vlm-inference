                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder, all of equal mass, are released from rest from the top of a short incline. The surface is so slick that they don't rotate, just slide without any friction to speak of. I need to figure out which one reaches the bottom first. The options are A. the sphere, B. the cube, C. the cylinder, or D. All reach the base at the same time.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's going on here. All three objects are sliding down an incline without rotating, and they have the same mass. Since there's negligible friction and no rotation, I'm thinking that the time it takes for each object to reach the bottom might be the same, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFirst, I should recall the equations that govern motion down an incline. The basic kinematic equations come to mind, especially since they're starting from rest.\n\nThe equation for displacement in uniformly accelerated motion is:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( s \\) is the displacement (the length of the incline in this case),\n\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration,\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time.\n\nIf I can show that the acceleration is the same for all objects, then the time would be the same for all of them.\n\nNow, since the objects are sliding without rotating, I don't have to account for rotational motion. That simplifies things.\n\nLet's consider the forces acting on one of these objects as it slides down the incline. The forces are:\n\n1. The component of the gravitational force parallel to the incline, which is \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of the incline.\n\n2. The normal force perpendicular to the incline, which balances the component of the gravitational force in that direction: \\( mg \\cos \\theta \\).\n\n3. The friction force, which is negligible, as stated in the problem.\n\nSince friction is negligible, the net force down the incline is just \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\).\n\nUsing Newton's second law, \\( F = m a \\), the acceleration \\( a \\) is:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{F}{m} = \\frac{mg \\sin \\theta}{m} = g \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nWait a minute, the mass cancels out, so the acceleration is independent of the mass of the object. That makes sense, because heavier objects aren't necessarily accelerated faster down an incline in the absence of friction and air resistance.\n\nSo, if all objects have the same acceleration \\( g \\sin \\theta \\), and they're sliding down the same incline (same \\( s \\)), then from the equation \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\), the time \\( t \\) would be the same for all of them.\n\nBut hold on, the problem mentions that the objects do not rotate, which is important because if they were rolling without slipping, their acceleration would depend on their moment of inertia. But since they're sliding without rotating, that complication goes away.\n\nHowever, I should make sure that there are no other factors at play here. For example, if the objects were rolling, their acceleration would be \\( a = \\frac{g \\sin \\theta}{1 + \\frac{k^2}{r^2}} \\), where \\( k \\) is the radius of gyration and \\( r \\) is the radius of the object. But since they're not rolling, this doesn't apply.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the shape of the objects. The sphere, cube, and cylinder have different shapes, but since they're all sliding without rotating, does the shape matter? I think not, because only translational motion is involved.\n\nLet me think about the cube specifically. A cube is a rigid body, and when it slides down an incline without rotating, its motion is purely translational. The same should apply to the sphere and the cylinder, as long as they're sliding without rotating.\n\nSo, if all three objects are experiencing the same acceleration down the incline, and they're covering the same distance, they should reach the bottom at the same time.\n\nBut let's double-check this reasoning. Suppose there was some rotational effect even when sliding. For example, if an object tends to rotate while sliding, might that affect its translational motion?\n\nIn reality, when an object slides without rotating, there's no torque acting on it to cause rotation, so it should remain in pure translation. Therefore, the shape shouldn't affect the translational motion in this scenario.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the energy conservation. Since there's negligible friction, the potential energy lost by the object as it descends is entirely converted into kinetic energy of translation.\n\n\\[ mgh = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is the vertical height of the incline, \\( v \\) is the final velocity.\n\nSolving for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\n\nAgain, the mass cancels out, and the velocity depends only on the height and gravity. So, all objects, regardless of shape or mass, would reach the bottom with the same velocity.\n\nBut wait, the question is about time, not velocity. So, to find the time, we can use the kinematic equation:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( s \\) is the length of the incline.\n\nSince \\( a = g \\sin \\theta \\), and this is the same for all objects, then:\n\n\\[ t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2s}{a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2s}{g \\sin \\theta}} \\]\n\nThis time is the same for all objects, as it doesn't depend on mass or shape, given that they all slide without rotating.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the equations of motion in more detail.\n\nThe net force down the incline is \\( mg \\sin \\theta \\), and since there's no friction, this is the only force acting on the object in the direction of motion.\n\nTherefore, the acceleration is indeed \\( g \\sin \\theta \\), and since all objects have the same acceleration and cover the same distance, they should take the same time.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some cases, the shape can affect the moment of inertia, which could influence the acceleration if rotation is involved. But in this problem, rotation is negligible, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nLet me also consider the possibility of static friction. If there were static friction, it could potentially affect the motion, but the problem states that the surface is extremely slick, with negligible friction, and that the objects do not rotate. So, I think it's safe to assume that friction isn't a significant factor here.\n\nAnother angle to consider: if all objects have the same mass and acceleration, and the distance is the same, their velocities at any given time should be the same, leading them to reach the bottom simultaneously.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a difference in how each object interacts with the incline due to its shape. For example, the cube might have a different contact area or something, but given that they're all sliding without rotating, I don't see how that would affect their translational motion.\n\nMaybe I should look at it from the perspective of work-energy. The work done by gravity is \\( mgh \\), and this is converted into kinetic energy \\( \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\). Since mass is the same for all, \\( v \\) should be the same, leading to the same time to reach the bottom.\n\nWait, but in reality, if these objects were rolling, their final velocities would differ based on their moment of inertia. But since they're sliding without rotating, this shouldn't be the case here.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about the equations for rolling motion, even though it's not applicable here. For rolling objects, the acceleration down the incline is \\( a = \\frac{g \\sin \\theta}{1 + \\frac{k^2}{r^2}} \\), where \\( k \\) is the radius of gyration and \\( r \\) is the radius of the object.\n\nBut in this problem, since the objects are sliding without rotating, this formula doesn't apply. So, I don't need to consider the moment of inertia or the radius.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion remains that all objects, being of equal mass and experiencing the same acceleration down the incline, will reach the bottom at the same time.\n\nI think the answer is D. All reach the base at the same time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
