                    "text": "So I've got this question here about public relations theory, and it's asking who argued that if an organization doesn't affect a particular public, then there's no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications. The options are Cutlip (2006), Leitch and Neilson (2001), Amaral and Phillips (2010), and Grunig and Hunt (1984). Hmm, I need to recall which of these authors proposed this specific idea.\n\nFirst off, I know that Grunig and Hunt are well-known figures in PR theory, especially for their work on the Excellence Theory, which includes concepts like two-way symmetric communication. But does their work include the idea that if an organization doesn't affect a public, then that public doesn't need to be considered in communications? Let me think about that.\n\nGrunig and Hunt's Excellence Theory emphasizes the importance of understanding different publics and tailoring communications accordingly. They talk about publics being either latent, aware, or active, based on their level of awareness and involvement with the organization. Maybe there's something in there about not focusing on publics that the organization doesn't affect.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the concept of \"publics\" in PR more broadly. Publics are groups of people who share a common interest or characteristic and are affected by or can affect the achievements of an organization's purposes. So, if an organization doesn't affect a particular public, perhaps that public isn't relevant to the organization's communications efforts.\n\nBut hold on, even if an organization doesn't directly affect a public, that public might still have an impact on the organization, right? For example, stakeholders who aren't directly affected by the organization's actions might still influence its reputation or success in other ways.\n\nLet me consider Cutlip's perspective. Cutlip is another prominent figure in PR, and his book \"Effective Public Relations\" is a classic text. He might have had something to say about which publics to consider in communications. But I don't remember him specifically stating that publics unaffected by the organization can be ignored.\n\nThen there's Leitch and Neilson from 2001. I'm less familiar with their work, but they might have contributed to the discussion on publics in PR. Maybe they proposed a framework where only affected publics are considered in communications.\n\nAmaral and Phillips from 2010 are also options. Their work might build upon earlier theories and could potentially include this idea. But again, I don't recall the exact reference.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should look back at the Excellence Theory by Grunig and Hunt. They developed the concept of publics based on their level of awareness and involvement. Maybe they suggested that resources should be allocated based on the significance of different publics to the organization.\n\nIn their Four Models of Public Relations, Grunig and Hunt discuss different approaches to PR, from Press Agentry to Two-Way Symmetry. In the Two-Way Symmetry model, which is considered the most effective, organizations engage in mutual understanding and problem-solving with their publics. This would involve considering all relevant publics, not just those directly affected by the organization's actions.\n\nBut maybe there's a specific part in their work where they discuss prioritizing publics based on the organization's impact on them. Let me try to recall.\n\nI think Grunig and Hunt talk about publics being categorized based on their relationship with the organization, such as primary and secondary publics, or based on their level of involvement and awareness. Primary publics are those who are directly affected by or can directly affect the organization, while secondary publics are those who are indirectly affected or can indirectly influence the organization.\n\nSo, perhaps they would argue that primary publics should be the main focus of PR efforts, and secondary publics might be considered to a lesser extent. But does that mean that if an organization doesn't affect a public at all, then there's no need to consider them in communications? That seems a bit absolute.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose an organization is a local bakery. Its primary publics would likely include its customers, employees, suppliers, and perhaps the local community. Secondary publics might include industry associations, media, and government agencies. But what about a public that the bakery doesn't affect at all, like astronauts on the International Space Station? Would the bakery need to consider astronauts in their communications? Probably not, since astronauts aren't customers, don't interact with the bakery, and aren't influenced by its actions.\n\nSo, in this case, it makes sense to focus PR efforts on relevant publics and not worry about those who aren't affected by the organization. But is this idea specifically attributed to Grunig and Hunt?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cutlip, in his work on effective public relations, discusses the importance of identifying and prioritizing publics based on their relevance to the organization. He might have suggested that resources should be directed towards publics that have a direct relationship with the organization.\n\nLeitch and Neilson (2001) might have built upon these ideas, perhaps emphasizing the need to focus on publics that are directly affected by the organization's actions. Similarly, Amaral and Phillips (2010) could have contributed to this discussion with more contemporary perspectives.\n\nBut to answer the question accurately, I need to recall which of these authors specifically argued that if an organization doesn't affect a public, then there's no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications.\n\nLet me think about Grunig and Hunt again. In their Excellence Theory, they discuss the importance of segmenting publics based on their relationship with the organization and tailoring communications accordingly. They also emphasize the need for organizations to monitor and adjust their communications based on feedback from publics.\n\nHowever, I don't recall them having a strict stance that unaffected publics should be entirely ignored. Maybe their focus is more on prioritizing communications efforts towards publics that are more directly involved with the organization.\n\nOn the other hand, Cutlip's work in \"Effective Public Relations\" emphasizes the importance of research and planning in PR, including identifying key publics. Perhaps he argues that only publics affected by the organization should be considered in communications planning.\n\nLeitch and Neilson (2001) might have contributed to this discussion by focusing on the efficiency of PR efforts, suggesting that resources shouldn't be wasted on publics that aren't affected by the organization.\n\nAmaral and Phillips (2010) could have further developed these ideas, possibly integrating them with modern communication technologies and practices.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which of these authors is directly associated with the statement in the question. Maybe I should consider the context of the question more carefully.\n\nThe question is phrased as: \"Who argued that if an organization did not affect a public then there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications?\"\n\nThis seems like a principle related to prioritization and efficiency in PR efforts. It suggests that limited resources should be allocated to publics that are relevant to the organization's objectives.\n\nFrom this perspective, Grunig and Hunt's Excellence Theory does emphasize the importance of understanding and segmenting publics based on their relevance and significance to the organization. They might have implied that publics who are not affected by the organization's actions are of lower priority in communications planning.\n\nHowever, their approach also emphasizes monitoring and engaging with a broader range of publics to maintain a positive reputation and address potential issues before they become crises. So, perhaps they wouldn't completely disregard unaffected publics, but rather give them lower priority.\n\nCutlip's work on Effective Public Relations also stresses the importance of research and planning, including identifying key publics. He might have suggested focusing on publics that have a direct relationship with the organization, thereby implying that unaffected publics are not a priority.\n\nLeitch and Neilson (2001) and Amaral and Phillips (2010) are more recent authors, and their work might build upon earlier theories by Grunig and Hunt and Cutlip, possibly refining the ideas around public segmentation and prioritization.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Grunig and Hunt are the ones who originally proposed the idea that unaffected publics don't need to be considered in communications. But I'm still not entirely confident about that.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider the definition of a \"public\" in PR. A public is a group of people who share a common interest or characteristic and are affected by or can affect the achievements of an organization's purposes.\n\nBased on this definition, if a public is neither affected by nor can affect the organization's purposes, then perhaps they are not considered a relevant public for communications purposes.\n\nIn that case, it would make sense not to allocate resources to communicating with such a public.\n\nBut in reality, even publics that aren't directly affected by the organization might still influence the organization indirectly through their perceptions or opinions about the organization.\n\nFor example, suppose a local bakery doesn't directly affect astronauts, but if there's a perception that the bakery doesn't care about astronauts, that could potentially affect the bakery's reputation among space enthusiasts, who might be a part of its customer base. So, in that case, ignoring astronauts completely might not be the best strategy.\n\nThis suggests that even publics that aren't directly affected by the organization might still be relevant in some way and should be considered, at least to some extent, in communications planning.\n\nPerhaps the statement in the question is an oversimplification of the authors' positions. It's possible that all of these authors recognize the importance of considering a range of publics, but prioritize those that are directly affected or can directly influence the organization.\n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is Grunig and Hunt (1984), as they are foundational figures in PR theory and their Excellence Theory includes discussions on public segmentation and prioritization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is Cutlip (2006), given his emphasis on effective PR practices and targeting key publics.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"if an organization did not affect a public then there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications,\" and given that Grunig and Hunt are known for their work on public segmentation and prioritization, I'm leaning towards D. Grunig and Hunt (1984).\n\nHowever, I should confirm this by recalling a specific reference or concept from their work that supports this idea.\n\nLet me try to recall Grunig and Hunt's Publics Matrix, which categorizes publics based on their level of awareness and involvement. They classify publics into four types:\n\n1. Latent publics: Low awareness and low involvement.\n\n2. Aware publics: High awareness but low involvement.\n\n3. Action publics: High involvement but low awareness.\n\n4. Active publics: High involvement and high awareness.\n\nIn this matrix, latent publics are those who are not yet aware of the organization or its actions, and they have low involvement. Perhaps these are the publics that the organization doesn't affect, and thus, according to Grunig and Hunt, there's no need to consider them in communications.\n\nHowever, Grunig and Hunt also emphasize the importance of monitoring and engaging with publics to prevent latent publics from becoming aware and involved in negative ways. So, perhaps they don't completely disregard latent publics, but rather suggest that minimal resources be allocated to them.\n\nGiven that, maybe the statement in the question is an oversimplification of their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Cutlip (2006) is the one who argues more strongly that unaffected publics don't need to be considered in communications.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe Leitch and Neilson (2001) or Amaral and Phillips (2010) have a more definitive stance on this.\n\nSince I don't have specific references to their work, I'll have to make an educated guess based on what I know about each author.\n\nCutlip is a renowned figure in PR, and his work on Effective Public Relations is considered a classic text. He might have emphasized the importance of focusing on key publics to maximize the effectiveness of PR efforts.\n\nLeitch and Neilson (2001) could have contributed to the discussion on PR strategy and resource allocation, possibly advocating for a more targeted approach to communications.\n\nAmaral and Phillips (2010) might have built upon earlier theories, incorporating contemporary perspectives on public engagement and digital communications.\n\nHowever, given that Grunig and Hunt are foundational figures in PR theory and their work includes detailed discussions on public segmentation and prioritization, I'm leaning towards them being the ones who argued that if an organization doesn't affect a public, then there's no need to consider that public in its communications.\n\nTherefore, my answer is D. Grunig and Hunt (1984).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
