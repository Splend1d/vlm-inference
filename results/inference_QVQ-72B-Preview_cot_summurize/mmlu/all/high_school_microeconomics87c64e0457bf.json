                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements is true for a firm in a perfectly competitive industry. I'm not super familiar with all this economics stuff, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what a perfectly competitive industry is. From what I remember, in perfect competition, there are lots of buyers and sellers, all selling identical products, and no single firm can influence the market price. So, each firm is a price taker, meaning they have to accept the market price as given.\n\nOkay, so for such a firm, what does that imply for its revenue concepts like total revenue, marginal revenue, and average revenue?\n\nLet me start by recalling what these terms mean.\n\nTotal revenue (TR) is the total income a firm earns from selling its product, which is price multiplied by quantity sold: TR = P \u00d7 Q.\n\nMarginal revenue (MR) is the additional revenue from selling one more unit of the product.\n\nAverage revenue (AR) is the revenue per unit, which is TR divided by Q.\n\nIn perfect competition, since the firm is a price taker, the market determines the price, and the firm can sell as much as it wants at that price.\n\nWait, actually, is that entirely accurate? I think in perfect competition, a firm faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price, meaning it can sell any quantity at that price.\n\nSo, if the price is fixed, and the firm can sell more units at the same price, what happens to total revenue as quantity increases?\n\nWell, if price is constant and quantity increases, total revenue should increase linearly, right? Because TR = P \u00d7 Q, and P is constant.\n\nSo, option A says total revenue increases and then decreases. That doesn't seem right. In perfect competition, as long as the firm sells more, TR should keep increasing. There's no point where it decreases unless the price changes, which it doesn't in perfect competition.\n\nOkay, so A is probably false.\n\nNext, option B: marginal revenue is decreasing.\n\nIn perfect competition, MR is equal to the price, because the firm can sell additional units at the same price without having to lower the price.\n\nSo, MR should be constant and equal to P, not decreasing.\n\nWait, but is that right? I think in perfect competition, MR equals P, because the firm doesn't have to lower the price to sell more quantity.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, B is also false.\n\nOption C: average revenue is initially negative and then becomes positive.\n\nHmm, average revenue is TR divided by Q, which is P. Since price is positive, AR should always be positive, as long as Q is positive.\n\nSo, AR can't be negative, unless P is negative, which doesn't make sense in perfect competition.\n\nTherefore, C is false.\n\nOption D: average revenue equals marginal revenue.\n\nFrom what I recall, in perfect competition, MR equals P, and AR also equals P. So, yes, MR should equal AR.\n\nSo, D seems to be true.\n\nWait, but is there any other possibility? Maybe I need to double-check.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the firm is a price taker, then P = MR = AR.\n\nSo, yes, AR and MR should be equal in perfect competition.\n\nIs there any scenario in perfect competition where AR and MR would differ?\n\nI don't think so. Unless there are increasing marginal costs, but that's more about the supply side, not the revenue side.\n\nSo, based on this, D is the correct statement.\n\nJust to make sure, let's see if there's any other perspective.\n\nMaybe I should consider the relationship between TR and MR.\n\nIn perfect competition, TR = P \u00d7 Q, and MR = \u0394TR/\u0394Q = P.\n\nSo, MR is constant and equal to P.\n\nSimilarly, AR = TR/Q = P.\n\nSo, AR is also equal to P.\n\nTherefore, MR equals AR.\n\nSo, D is indeed true.\n\nI think I've covered all the options, and D seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
