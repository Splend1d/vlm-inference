Jerry Beck\u2014wait, no, it's Jeff Beck\u2014and D. Keith Richards.\" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one of these famous guitarists ventured into the world of fashion, specifically designing neckties.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall some basic information about each of these musicians to see if there's any connection to fashion or design work. Starting with Eric Clapton: He's a legendary blues rock guitarist, known for his work with bands like Cream and Derek and the Dominos, and also for his solo career. He's famous for his guitar playing and songwriting, but I don't remember hearing anything about him designing neckties or getting involved in fashion design.\n\nNext is Jerry Garcia. He was the lead guitarist and vocalist for the Grateful Dead, a band that's iconic for its long-lasting career and dedicated fan base. The Grateful Dead had a unique style, and their merchandise was always colorful and psychedelic, reflecting their music. Jerry Garcia himself had a distinctive fashion sense, often wearing colorful shirts and ties on stage. Maybe he was involved in designing some of his own stage attire, including ties?\n\nThen there's Jeff Beck. He's another renowned guitarist, having been a member of the Yardbirds and later forming his own bands and pursuing a solo career. He's known for his innovative guitar techniques and influences from various music genres. While he's definitely a respected musician, I don't recall any specific involvement in fashion design or tie-making.\n\nLastly, there's Keith Richards, the legendary guitarist from the Rolling Stones. He's famous for his riff-driven rock and roll and his iconic stage presence. Keith has a distinctive style, often wearing scarves and bandanas, but I don't think he's known for designing neckties.\n\nConsidering all this, Jerry Garcia seems like the most likely candidate. His band, the Grateful Dead, was known for its colorful and psychedelic imagery, and Garcia himself had a unique fashion sense that included wearing ties on stage. It makes sense that he might have been involved in designing a line of neckties, especially given the band's influence on fashion and counterculture.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if any of the others have had similar ventures. Eric Clapton is known for his love of guitars and music, but I don't think he's ventured into fashion design. Jeff Beck has focused primarily on his music career, and while he's experimental with his sound, I don't recall any fashion design projects. Keith Richards has been involved in various fashion-related events and collaborations, but again, nothing specific about designing a line of neckties.\n\nSo, after thinking about it, I'm pretty confident that Jerry Garcia is the one who designed a colorful line of men's neckties. The answer should be B. Jerry Garcia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Jerry Garcia}} \\]"
