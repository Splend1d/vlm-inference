                    "text": "So I have this problem here: If 30,000 is divided by 10 and then divided by 10 again, what will be the resulting number? The options are A. 3, B. 30, C. 300, D. 3,000.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to divide 30,000 by 10 first and then take that result and divide it by 10 again. Seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand what's happening here.\n\nFirst division: 30,000 divided by 10.\n\nWell, dividing by 10 usually just shifts the decimal point one place to the left. So, 30,000 is the same as 30,000.0, right? So, 30,000.0 divided by 10 would be 3,000.0.\n\nWait, but let me think about it in terms of place value. 30,000 is thirty thousand, which is like 3 followed by four zeros. Dividing by 10 once removes one zero, so that would be 3,000.\n\nLet me confirm this with actual division. 30,000 divided by 10 is indeed 3,000. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to divide that result, 3,000, by 10 again.\n\nAgain, dividing by 10 should shift the decimal one place to the left. So, 3,000 divided by 10 would be 300.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 300 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I can think about the exponents.\n\nI know that 30,000 is 3 multiplied by 10 to the power of 4, because 10^4 is 10,000, and 3 times 10,000 is 30,000.\n\nDividing by 10 is the same as multiplying by 10 to the power of negative one, so 10^-1.\n\nSo, first division: 3 * 10^4 divided by 10^1 is 3 * 10^(4-1) = 3 * 10^3 = 3,000.\n\nSecond division: 3,000 divided by 10 is 3 * 10^3 / 10^1 = 3 * 10^(3-1) = 3 * 10^2 = 300.\n\nThis confirms the previous result. So, again, the answer should be 300.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe if I divide by 10 twice in one step, like dividing by 100.\n\nWait a second, if I divide 30,000 by 10 and then by 10 again, that's the same as dividing 30,000 by 100, right?\n\nLet me check that. Dividing by 10 and then by 10 again is the same as dividing by 100, because 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nSo, 30,000 divided by 100 is 300. Yep, that matches my previous results.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's try this with actual division steps.\n\nFirst division: 30,000 \u00f7 10.\n\n30,000 divided by 10 is 3,000.\n\nSecond division: 3,000 \u00f7 10.\n\n3,000 divided by 10 is 300.\n\nAgain, the result is 300.\n\nI think it's pretty clear that the correct answer is 300, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any trick here.\n\nIs there a possibility that the question is trying to trick me into thinking that dividing by 10 twice would lead to a different result?\n\nHmm, no, I don't think so. The operations seem straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding of the order of operations, but no, it's clear: divide by 10 and then divide by 10 again.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the number of zeros. 30,000 has four zeros. Dividing by 10 removes one zero, leaving three zeros, which is 3,000. Dividing again by 10 removes another zero, leaving two zeros, which is 300.\n\nYes, that visual approach also confirms the answer.\n\nI can't see any other perspective that would change this result. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 300.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
