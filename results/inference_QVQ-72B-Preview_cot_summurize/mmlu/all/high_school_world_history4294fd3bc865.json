He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.\n\u2026\nHe looked to the West and prayed, \"I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal.\" When he had prayed he bowed again.\nFrom Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s\nIn which of the following ways does the excerpt above most complicate historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang, and it's referring to an excerpt from \"Journey to the West\" by Wu Chengen, written around the 1590s. The question is asking in which way this excerpt most complicates historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career. The options are:\n\nA. It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments.\n\nB. It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived.\n\nC. It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang.\n\nD. It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First off, I know that Xuanzang was a real historical figure, a Buddhist monk who traveled from China to India to fetch Buddhist scriptures. He lived during the Tang dynasty, which was from 618 to 907 CE. \"Journey to the West\" is a famous Chinese novel that was written much later, in the late Ming dynasty, around the 1590s.\n\nSo, option B suggests that the book was written long after Xuanzang's time. That seems to be the case, since Xuanzang lived in the 7th century, and the book was written in the 16th century. But does this complicate historians' understanding of his career? Well, it might, because later writings could include inaccuracies or embellishments.\n\nOption A says that the excerpt highly fictionalizes Xuanzang's accomplishments. I know that \"Journey to the West\" is a work of fiction that builds upon the historical figure of Xuanzang. It includes many mythical elements and characters, like the Monkey King, who are not part of historical records. So, yes, the novel fictionalizes his story, but is this the most complicating factor for historians?\n\nOption C suggests that the excerpt casts doubt on Xuanzang's actual existence. But I thought Xuanzang was a real person, and his travels are well-documented in historical texts. So, I'm not sure about this one. Maybe the novel adds some legendary aspects, but it doesn't necessarily doubt his existence.\n\nOption D says that the book is widely considered to be a forgery by scholars. I don't think that's the case. \"Journey to the West\" is a recognized literary work and is not considered a forgery. It's clearly a fictional retelling of Xuanzang's journey.\n\nSo, between options A and B, both seem relevant, but I need to choose the one that most complicates historians' understanding.\n\nLet me think about this. If the book was written long after Xuanzang's time (option B), that could mean that the account is not reliable due to the passage of time and potential loss of accurate details. On the other hand, option A points out that the story is highly fictionalized, which means that even if it was written closer to his time, the fictional elements would still make it unreliable for historical research.\n\nBut, considering that Xuanzang's travels are well-documented in other, more reliable sources from his own time, such as his own writings and government records, the fictionalization in \"Journey to the West\" might be more of a complication for understanding the specific details of his journey rather than his existence or the broad strokes of his travels.\n\nWait a minute, the question is about complicating historians' understanding of his career. His career being his travels and his role in bringing Buddhist scriptures to China.\n\nSo, if \"Journey to the West\" is a fictionalized account written centuries after his death, it might mix historical facts with legends, making it difficult for historians to separate what's real and what's not.\n\nBut, again, since there are earlier, more reliable sources about Xuanzang, perhaps the primary complication is the fictionalization, not just the temporal distance.\n\nLet me consider this differently. If I were a historian studying Xuanzang, which aspect of this excerpt would cause me the most trouble in understanding his actual career?\n\nWell, the fact that it's fictionalized means that I can't trust it as a factual account. Even if it was written closer to his time, if it's filled with myths and legends, it's not reliable. But since it was written much later, that compounds the issue, as memories and stories can change over time.\n\nHowever, I think the fictionalization is the more significant issue here. After all, even if \"Journey to the West\" had been written during Xuanzang's lifetime, but was still a work of fiction, it wouldn't be a reliable source for historical facts.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is the best answer: it highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments, thereby complicating historians' understanding of his career.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any evidence that \"Journey to the West\" is considered a forgery (option D)? No, I don't think so. It's a celebrated work of literature, not a forgery. So, option D is out.\n\nOption C suggests it casts doubt on his actual existence. But as far as I know, Xuanzang's existence is well-established through other historical records. So, I don't think the novel would cast doubt on that.\n\nOption B, that it was written long after his time, is true, but again, I think the fictionalization is the bigger issue. Even if a book is written long after someone's time, if it's based on accurate records or oral traditions, it can still be useful. But if it's fictionalized, it's harder to use for historical research.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the most accurate answer. The highly fictionalized nature of the excerpt complicates historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
