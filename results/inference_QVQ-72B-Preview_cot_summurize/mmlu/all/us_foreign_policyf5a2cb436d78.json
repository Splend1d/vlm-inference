Jimmy Carter, and D. Ronald Reagan. Hmm, I need to think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that China became a communist state in 1949 under Mao Zedong. And relations between the United States and China were pretty chilly after that for a while. So, there was a period when there wasn't much contact between the two countries.\n\nBut then, in the early 1970s, there was a shift in policy. I think it was during the Cold War, and the U.S. started to realize that engaging with China might be beneficial to counterbalance the Soviet Union's influence.\n\nNow, looking at the presidents during that time:\n\n- Richard Nixon was president from 1969 to 1974.\n\n- Gerald Ford was president from 1974 to 1977.\n\n- Jimmy Carter was president from 1977 to 1981.\n\n- Ronald Reagan was president from 1981 to 1989.\n\n- George H. W. Bush was president from 1989 to 1993.\n\nWait, but the question is about visiting communist China. So, I should focus on the earlier part of this period.\n\nI recall that Richard Nixon made a historic visit to China in 1972, which was a big deal because it was the first time a U.S. president had visited China since it became communist. That trip is often credited with normalizing relations between the two countries.\n\nLet me double-check that. If Nixon was president from 1969 to 1974 and he went to China in 1972, that would make sense. And I don't think any U.S. president had visited China before that since the communist takeover in 1949.\n\nJimmy Carter was president after Nixon and Ford, and I think he did a lot to further improve relations with China, like establishing full diplomatic relations in 1979. But that was after Nixon's visit.\n\nRonald Reagan was later, in the 1980s, and George H. W. Bush was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. So, they came after Nixon's historic visit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Richard Nixon.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that none of the other presidents visited China before Nixon. For example, did Dwight D. Eisenhower or John F. Kennedy visit China during their presidencies? Eisenhower was president from 1953 to 1961, and Kennedy from 1961 to 1963. But relations were strained during that time, so it's unlikely.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there was any presidential visit to China during the Truman administration, from 1945 to 1953. Truman was president when China became communist in 1949, and relations deteriorated after that, so I don't think he visited.\n\nSo, confirming my initial thought, Richard Nixon was indeed the first American president to visit communist China in 1972.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Richard Nixon}} \\]"
