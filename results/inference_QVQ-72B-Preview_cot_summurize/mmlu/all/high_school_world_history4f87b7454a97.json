                    "text": "So I've got this poem here, \"To Roosevelt\" by Ruben Dario, written in 1904. It's pretty intense and seems to be directed at the United States, specifically Theodore Roosevelt, who was president around that time. The poem is filled with a lot of imagery and historical references, and it's clear that the poet is defending Latin America and criticizing American imperialist actions.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the context in which this poem was written. In 1904, there was a lot going on in relations between the United States and Latin American countries. Roosevelt was known for his interventionist policies in the region, believing in what was called \"The Monroe Doctrine\" and his own corollary to it, which essentially said that the U.S. had the right to intervene in Latin American affairs to preserve stability and order.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram\n\nB. The embargo of Cuba after Castro\u2019s revolution\n\nC. U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence\n\nD. U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution\n\nI need to see which of these events would have been relevant in 1904.\n\nLet's look at each one:\n\nA. The Zimmerman Telegram was discovered during World War I, specifically in 1917. That's more than a decade after 1904, so it's unlikely to be the prompt for this poem.\n\nB. The embargo of Cuba after Castro\u2019s revolution happened in the 1960s, which is again much later than 1904.\n\nC. U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence occurred in 1903, which is just a year before the poem was written in 1904. This seems plausible.\n\nD. The Haitian Revolution took place from 1791 to 1804, which is well before 1904. While there might be some residual tensions, it seems a bit too far back to be the direct prompt for the poem.\n\nGiven these timelines, option C, U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence in 1903, seems the most likely event to have prompted Dario to write this poem in 1904.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the content of the poem to see if it aligns with this event.\n\nIn the poem, Dario is defending Latin American cultures and histories, referencing figures like Montezuma, the Inca, and Cuauht\u00e9moc, who are all associated with pre-Columbian civilizations in Mexico and South America. He also mentions Christopher Columbus, highlighting the complexity of the relationship between Latin America and Europe.\n\nThe poem is filled with pride in Latin American heritage and a sense of resistance against American imperialism. Phrases like \"Viva Spanish America!\" and \"there are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion\" suggest a rallying cry against external domination.\n\nNow, considering the Panama context, in 1903, the United States supported and facilitated a revolt in Panama, which led to Panama's separation from Colombia. This was done primarily to secure a route for building the Panama Canal, which was of strategic and economic importance to the U.S.\n\nMany in Latin America saw this as a clear act of American interventionism and a violation of Colombian sovereignty. This action would have been fresh in people's minds in 1904, making it a likely catalyst for Dario's poetic response.\n\nMoreover, Dario's reference to \"you men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul\" could be seen as a critique of Anglo-Saxon imperialism, which was often how the U.S. was perceived in Latin America at the time.\n\nTherefore, based on both the timing and the thematic content of the poem, it's reasonable to conclude that U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence in 1903 prompted Dario to compose this piece.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
