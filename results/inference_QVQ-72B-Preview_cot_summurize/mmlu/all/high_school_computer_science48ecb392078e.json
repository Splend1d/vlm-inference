                    "text": "So I have this problem here about hexadecimal numbers. It says that the characters 0 through 9 and A through F are used in hexadecimal, where A is 10, B is 11, and so on up to F being 15. The question is asking for the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a two-digit hexadecimal number means. In hexadecimal, each digit represents a value from 0 to 15, since A is 10, B is 11, and so on up to F being 15. So, a two-digit hexadecimal number would look like something such as 14 or 3A, as mentioned in the problem.\n\nI recall that in any base, each digit represents a power of the base. For hexadecimal, which is base 16, the rightmost digit is the units place (16^0), and the next digit to the left is the sixteens place (16^1). So, a two-digit hexadecimal number can be represented as:\n\n```\n\nd1 * 16^1 + d0 * 16^0\n\n```\n\nWhere d1 and d0 are digits from 0 to F (0 to 15 in decimal).\n\nTo find the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number, I need to maximize this sum. That means I should choose the largest possible values for d1 and d0.\n\nThe largest possible digit in hexadecimal is F, which is 15 in decimal. So, the largest two-digit hexadecimal number would be FF.\n\nNow, I need to convert FF hexadecimal to base-10.\n\nFF in hexadecimal is:\n\nF * 16^1 + F * 16^0\n\nSince F is 15, this becomes:\n\n15 * 16 + 15 * 1\n\nCalculating that:\n\n15 * 16 = 240\n\n15 * 1 = 15\n\nAdding them up: 240 + 15 = 255\n\nSo, the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number is 255.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 32\n\nB. 225\n\nC. 255\n\nD. 256\n\nIt seems like the correct answer is option C. 255.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, confirm the range of two-digit hexadecimal numbers. The smallest two-digit hexadecimal number is 10 (which is 16 in decimal), and the largest is FF (which we calculated as 255). So, yes, 255 is the maximum.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that a two-digit hexadecimal number can represent values from 0 to FF, which is 0 to 255 in decimal.\n\nSo, the largest value is indeed 255.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to consider anything beyond that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{255} \\]"
