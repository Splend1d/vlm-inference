                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question that asks which pair of expressions is equivalent for any variable value greater than zero. The options are:\n\nA. 3(x+2) and 3x+2\n\nB. 4d + 2e and 8d + e\n\nC. f + f + f + g and 3fg\n\nD. b + b + 3c and 2b + 3c\n\nOkay, so I need to check which of these pairs are equal no matter what positive value I plug in for the variables.\n\nLet's start with option A: 3(x+2) and 3x+2.\n\nI should simplify 3(x+2) first. Distributing the 3, I get 3x + 6. So, 3(x+2) is equal to 3x + 6, not 3x + 2. So, these are not equivalent. Maybe I'll plug in a value to confirm. Let's say x = 1.\n\n3(1+2) = 3(3) = 9\n\nAnd 3(1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nThey are not equal, so option A is out.\n\nNext, option B: 4d + 2e and 8d + e.\n\nThese are already simplified, so I can just check with some values. Let's try d = 1 and e = 1.\n\n4(1) + 2(1) = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n8(1) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nNot equal. So, option B is not equivalent.\n\nOption C: f + f + f + g and 3fg.\n\nFirst, simplify f + f + f + g. That's 3f + g.\n\nSo, is 3f + g equal to 3fg? Not necessarily. Let's test with f = 1 and g = 2.\n\n3(1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n3(1)(2) = 6\n\nNot equal. So, option C is out.\n\nLastly, option D: b + b + 3c and 2b + 3c.\n\nSimplify b + b + 3c: that's 2b + 3c.\n\nSo, it looks like 2b + 3c is equal to 2b + 3c. That seems equivalent.\n\nLet me check with some values to be sure. Let's say b = 1 and c = 1.\n\n2(1) + 3(1) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nAnd 2(1) + 3(1) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThey are equal. Let's try another value, say b = 2 and c = 3.\n\n2(2) + 3(3) = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nAnd 2(2) + 3(3) = 4 + 9 = 13\n\nStill equal. So, it seems like option D is the correct one.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that for other values they might not be equal? Probably not, because 2b + 3c is always equal to 2b + 3c, no matter what b and c are.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. b + b + 3c and 2b + 3c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
