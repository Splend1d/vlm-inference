                    "text": "So I've got this question here about gender roles in the workplace based on current research. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's consistent with the research. Let me think through each one.\n\nOption A says that in about a quarter of households with children, men stay home with the children so their wives can work. Hmm, I've heard mixed things about this. I know that the number of stay-at-home dads is increasing, but I'm not sure if it's up to a quarter of all households with children yet. Maybe it's more like 10% or something like that. I should check that.\n\nOption B states that most women believe there is equal opportunity today between men and women in career choice, advancement, and income. Really? I thought there was still a gender pay gap, and that women often face barriers to advancement in certain fields. I doubt that most women think everything is equal now. Maybe some do, but I suspect that many still see inequalities.\n\nOption C says that most men believe that women should be homemakers because men earn more money. Hmm, that seems a bit old-fashioned. I think attitudes have changed a lot in recent years. Many men support gender equality and don't hold to traditional roles. So, I'm not sure if most men would agree with that statement.\n\nOption D suggests that most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives. This one rings true to me. Even though more men are helping out at home, I've read that women still tend to do more of the unpaid work. It's called the \"second shift\" or something like that, where women work all day and then come home to more work. So, I think this is a real issue.\n\nLet me see if I can find some data to back up my thoughts. Starting with Option A, the percentage of stay-at-home dads. According to some recent statistics, about 7% of fathers in the U.S. are stay-at-home dads, which is up from around 4% in the past, but definitely not close to 25%. So, Option A seems incorrect based on this data.\n\nFor Option B, numerous surveys show that many women still perceive inequalities in the workplace. For example, the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report indicates that gender parity is still not achieved in many countries, including in areas like economic participation and opportunity. Additionally, studies show that the gender pay gap persists, and women are less likely to hold top management positions. So, it's unlikely that most women believe there is equal opportunity today.\n\nOption C is tricky. While there might be some men who hold traditional views, modern surveys suggest that the majority of men support gender equality. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research Center found that most men agree that women should have equal rights in the workplace and at home. So, it's probably not accurate to say that most men believe women should be homemakers because men earn more money.\n\nOption D seems to align with research findings. The same Pew survey indicates that while more men are participating in housework and childcare, women still shoulder a disproportionate amount of these responsibilities. This is often referred to as the \"caregiving burden\" and can lead to stress and challenges in balancing work and family life.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look up some specific numbers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in dual-income households, women spend about twice as much time on housework and childcare as men do. So, that supports Option D pretty strongly.\n\nAlso, another study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reports that even when both parents work full-time, mothers do significantly more unpaid work at home than fathers.\n\nTherefore, based on this research, Option D seems to be the most accurate statement reflecting current gender roles in the workplace.\n\nTo sum it up, the correct answer is D: Most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
