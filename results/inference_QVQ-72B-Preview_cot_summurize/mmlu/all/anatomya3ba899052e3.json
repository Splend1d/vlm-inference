Parasympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons\n\nB. Sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons\n\nC. Parasympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs\n\nD. Sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about the autonomic nervous system. There are two main divisions: the parasympathetic and the sympathetic systems.\n\nIn the parasympathetic system, the pre-ganglionic neurons use acetylcholine (ACh) as their neurotransmitter at both the ganglionic synapse and at the effector organs. So, between pre- and post-ganglionic neurons in parasympathetic, it's ACh, and between post-ganglionic neurons and target organs, it's also ACh.\n\nIn the sympathetic system, the pre-ganglionic neurons also use ACh at the ganglionic synapse. But then, the post-ganglionic neurons typically use noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine) as their neurotransmitter at the effector organs.\n\nWait a minute, I think there's an exception here. Some sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons do use ACh, like those innervating sweat glands. But the majority use noradrenaline.\n\nSo, based on that, option A is parasympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons, which should be ACh, not noradrenaline.\n\nOption B is sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons. Pre-ganglionic are ACh, and post-ganglionic are noradrenaline. So, between pre- and post-ganglionic in sympathetic, it's ACh, but between post-ganglionic and target organs, it's noradrenaline.\n\nOption C is parasympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs, which is ACh.\n\nOption D is sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs, which is noradrenaline.\n\nSo, if I'm correct, the answer should be D. Sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs.\n\nBut let me double-check. In the sympathetic system, the pre-ganglionic fibers release ACh onto the post-ganglionic neurons in the ganglia. Then, the post-ganglionic neurons release noradrenaline onto the target organs, like the heart, smooth muscles, and glands.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter between sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and their target organs.\n\nI should also remember that in some cases, sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons can release other neurotransmitters, like ACh in sweat glands, or neuropeptides, but the most common one is noradrenaline.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Parasympathetic: ACh at both ganglionic and effector sites\n\n- Sympathetic: ACh at ganglionic synapses, noradrenaline at effector organs\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
