                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What nationality was Karl Marx?\" and the options are A. Russian, B. German, C. Danish, D. English. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not super familiar with Karl Marx, but I think I've heard of him before. He was a philosopher, right? Or maybe an economist? Let me think.\n\nFirst off, I know that Karl Marx is famous for his theories on communism and capitalism. I think he wrote a book called \"Das Kapital,\" which is about the economy and class struggles. But that's just background information; it doesn't tell me about his nationality.\n\nLet me consider the options one by one. Starting with A. Russian. I don't recall Marx being Russian. I think the Russian Revolution happened after his time, didn't it? Marx was born in the 19th century, and the Russian Revolution was in 1917. So, maybe not Russian.\n\nNext is B. German. This seems plausible. I think Marx was from Germany. He was born in Trier, which is a city in Germany, right? Plus, his name sounds German. But I should double-check this because I don't want to get it wrong.\n\nOption C is Danish. I don't remember any connection between Marx and Denmark. I don't think he lived there or was born there. So, probably not Danish.\n\nLastly, D. English. Again, I don't think so. Marx spent some time in England, especially in London, but he wasn't born there. I think he moved to England later in his life, but his nationality was German.\n\nWait a minute, now I'm a bit confused. Was he actually a German citizen his whole life? I think he might have become a British citizen since he lived in London for many years. Let me see if I can recall.\n\nUpon thinking more, I believe that Marx was born in Germany, but due to his political activities, he was exiled and ended up in England. However, I'm not sure about his official nationality at the time of his death. Maybe he remained a German citizen, or perhaps he became a British citizen.\n\nI need to find a reliable source to confirm this. Since this is a multiple-choice question, and I have to pick one answer, I'll go with the most likely option based on my knowledge.\n\nGiven that he was born in Germany, and his family was German, I think the correct answer is B. German. Even if he lived in England later on, his original nationality was German.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly recap what I know about Karl Marx's biography. He was born in Trier, which is in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, in 1818. His father was a lawyer, and his mother was from Holland. He studied law and philosophy at the University of Berlin. Later, due to his radical ideas, he was forced to leave Germany and Belgium and finally settled in London, where he spent most of his adult life.\n\nDespite living in England, I don't think he changed his nationality. I believe he remained a German citizen throughout his life. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. German.\n\nTo confirm, I'll check a few key points:\n\n1. Place of birth: Trier, Germany\n\n2. Early education and career: Germany\n\n3. Exile and later life: Belgium and England\n\n4. Nationality: Born German, likely remained German\n\nYes, this seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. German.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
