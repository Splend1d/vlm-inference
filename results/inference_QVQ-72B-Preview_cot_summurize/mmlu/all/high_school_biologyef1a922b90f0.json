                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which group is composed entirely of individuals who maintained that species are fixed (i.e., unchanging)?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck\n\nB. Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck\n\nC. Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck\n\nD. Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out which of these scientists believed that species don't change over time. The term \"fixed species\" means that they thought species don't evolve or change into other species.\n\nI remember that Charles Darwin is famous for his theory of evolution, but he's not in any of these options. So, these are all scientists who were around before Darwin or who didn't accept his ideas.\n\nLet me think about each person mentioned:\n\n1. Aristotle: He was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist. He did a lot of work on classification of living things but I don't recall him talking about evolution. He probably thought species were fixed.\n\n2. Cuvier: He was a French naturalist in the 1800s. I think he was against the idea of evolution and believed in fixed species.\n\n3. Lamarck: He was also a French naturalist in the 1800s. He actually had ideas about evolution, like the inheritance of acquired characteristics. So, he didn't think species were fixed.\n\n4. Linnaeus: He was a Swedish botanist who developed the binomial nomenclature for classifying organisms. I think he believed in fixed species.\n\n5. Lyell: He was a British geologist who proposed uniformitarianism, which suggests that geological processes happen at a constant rate. I'm not sure about his views on species being fixed.\n\nOkay, so let's see:\n\n- Aristotle: likely believed in fixed species.\n\n- Cuvier: against evolution, so believed in fixed species.\n\n- Lamarck: had ideas about evolution, so didn't believe in fixed species.\n\n- Linnaeus: believed in fixed species.\n\n- Lyell: not sure, but maybe he didn't strongly support fixed species since he was involved in geology and might have seen evidence of change over time.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for a group that all believed in fixed species, I need to exclude Lamarck because he believed in evolution.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck\n\nB. Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck\n\nC. Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck\n\nD. Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier\n\nIn all the options except D, Lamarck is included. But since Lamarck didn't believe in fixed species, any option with Lamarck is incorrect.\n\nSo, option D: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier.\n\nAccording to my earlier thoughts, all three of them believed in fixed species.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Aristotle: Yes, he classified organisms but didn't talk about evolution.\n\n- Linnaeus: Yes, his classification system assumes fixed species.\n\n- Cuvier: Yes, he was against the idea of evolution.\n\nSo, D seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about Lyell in option C? I wasn't sure about his views. If he didn't believe in fixed species, then option C would be incorrect, which it should be because it includes Lamarck anyway.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think about Lyell.\n\nLyell was a geologist who proposed uniformitarianism, which suggests that the same geological processes operate today as in the past. His work influenced Darwin. However, did he believe in fixed species?\n\nI think Lyell initially believed in fixed species, but later, after Darwin's work, he accepted evolution. So, depending on the context, he might have believed in fixed species at some point, but perhaps not later on.\n\nBut since the question is about who maintained that species are fixed, and assuming that Lyell did hold that view at some point, but given that he might have changed his mind later, perhaps his views evolved.\n\nHowever, in the options provided, Lyell is only in option C, which includes Lamarck, who definitely didn't believe in fixed species.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier\u2014all believed in fixed species.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut let me make sure again.\n\nAristotle: Yes, believed in fixed species.\n\nLinnaeus: Yes, his classification system is based on fixed species.\n\nCuvier: Yes, he was a strong opponent of evolution.\n\nSo, D is correct.\n\nWait, but in option A, Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck\u2014are all three believed in fixed species? No, because Lamarck didn't.\n\nSimilarly, option B: Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck\u2014again, Lamarck didn't.\n\nOption C: Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck\u2014Lamarck didn't.\n\nOption D: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier\u2014all believed in fixed species.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
