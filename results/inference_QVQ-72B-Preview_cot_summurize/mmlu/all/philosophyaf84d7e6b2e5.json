                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about the notion of \"meaning in life.\" It's asking what it refers to, and the options are external meaning, God's plan, internal meaning, or meaning in an afterlife. Hmm, this seems a bit philosophical, but let's try to make sense of it.\n\nFirst off, I think \"meaning in life\" is a pretty broad concept. It could mean different things to different people. Some might believe that life has an inherent meaning or purpose, while others might think that meaning is something we create for ourselves.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. External meaning \u2013 This might refer to meaning that comes from outside ourselves, like societal expectations, cultural norms, or some higher power.\n\nB. God's plan \u2013 This suggests a religious perspective, where life has meaning as part of a divine plan or purpose set by a god or gods.\n\nC. Internal meaning \u2013 This probably means meaning that we find or create within ourselves, through our own thoughts, experiences, or personal growth.\n\nD. Meaning in an afterlife \u2013 This implies that life's meaning is connected to some existence beyond our current lives, perhaps in a spiritual or supernatural realm.\n\nNow, if I had to choose one of these, I'd need to think about what the question is really asking. Is it asking for a general definition, or is it referring to a specific philosophical or religious viewpoint?\n\nMaybe it's best to consider what \"meaning in life\" generally refers to in philosophical discussions. Often, philosophers discuss the concept of \"the meaning of life\" in terms of purpose, value, or reason for existence. Some argue that meaning is subjective and varies from person to person, while others believe there is an objective meaning applicable to all.\n\nConsidering that, perhaps \"internal meaning\" is the most fitting answer because it suggests that meaning is something found or constructed within each individual, which aligns with many modern existentialist views.\n\nBut wait, \"God's plan\" is also a common belief, especially in religious contexts. Many people believe that their lives have meaning as part of a larger divine plan, and that their purpose is connected to their faith and spiritual beliefs.\n\n\"External meaning\" could also be a valid perspective, where meaning is derived from external factors such as one's contributions to society, family, or career achievements.\n\n\"Meaning in an afterlife\" is another interesting option. Some belief systems focus on the idea that our current life is just a preparation for the afterlife, and that the true meaning of our existence will be revealed in the hereafter.\n\nGiven all that, it's tricky to pick just one correct answer because \"meaning in life\" can refer to any of these concepts depending on the context and individual belief system.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to test understanding of a particular philosophical stance. Perhaps it's referring to the idea that meaning in life is something that each person must discover or create for themselves, which would point towards \"internal meaning.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the question is about a more objective or universal meaning, then \"God's plan\" or \"external meaning\" could be considered.\n\nBut considering that the question is phrased generally without specifying a particular perspective, I think \"internal meaning\" is the most appropriate answer. It emphasizes personal interpretation and agency in finding or creating meaning in one's life, which is a widespread view in contemporary philosophy and psychology.\n\nMoreover, the other options seem more specific to certain belief systems or worldviews. For example, \"God's plan\" is specific to theistic religions, and \"meaning in an afterlife\" depends on beliefs in life after death, which not everyone holds.\n\nTherefore, choosing \"internal meaning\" would be the most inclusive and broadly applicable answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider some examples. Suppose someone asks, \"What gives your life meaning?\" You might respond with things like your relationships, your career, your hobbies, or your personal growth \u2013 all of which are forms of internal meaning.\n\nOn the other hand, if you believe that your life has meaning because it's part of a larger cosmic plan, that would be more aligned with \"God's plan\" or \"external meaning.\"\n\nGiven that, I still think \"internal meaning\" is the best answer, as it captures the idea that meaning is derived from within, based on personal values, experiences, and reflections.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the notion of \"meaning in life\" primarily refers to internal meaning \u2013 that is, the significance or purpose that individuals find or create within themselves through their thoughts, experiences, and personal growth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. internal meaning}} \\]"
