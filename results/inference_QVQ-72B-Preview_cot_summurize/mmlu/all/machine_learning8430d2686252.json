                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand AdaBoost, which is a boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong one. It assigns weights to each training example and adjusts these weights based on the performance of the weak classifiers.\n\nStatement 1 says: \"In AdaBoost, weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor.\"\n\nI need to figure out if this is true or false.\n\nFrom what I recall, in AdaBoost, after each weak classifier is trained, the weights of the training examples are adjusted. Specifically, the weights of the examples that were misclassified by the current weak classifier are increased, so that the next weak classifier focuses more on those examples.\n\nThe way it's phrased, it says \"by the same multiplicative factor.\" Does that mean that all misclassified examples have their weights increased by multiplying them by the same factor?\n\nLet me think about the formula for updating weights in AdaBoost.\n\nThe weight update formula in AdaBoost is:\n\nD_t+1(i) = D_t(i) * beta_t if the example is correctly classified,\n\nD_t+1(i) = D_t(i) * (1 / beta_t) if the example is misclassified,\n\nwhere beta_t = 0.5 * (1 - epsilon_t) / epsilon_t, and epsilon_t is the weighted error rate of the t-th weak classifier.\n\nSo, for misclassified examples, their weights are increased by dividing by beta_t, which is like multiplying by 1 / beta_t.\n\nBut is this factor the same for all misclassified examples?\n\nLooking at the formula, beta_t is the same for all examples in a given iteration because it depends on epsilon_t, the error rate of the weak classifier.\n\nWait, but in the weight update formula, D_t+1(i) = D_t(i) / beta_t for misclassified examples.\n\nSince beta_t is the same for all misclassified examples in a given iteration, yes, the multiplicative factor is the same for all misclassified examples in that iteration.\n\nSo, statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, statement 2: \"In AdaBoost, weighted training error e_t of the t-th weak classifier on training data with weights D_t tends to increase as a function of t.\"\n\nSo, does the weighted training error e_t increase as t increases?\n\nI think I need to recall how AdaBoost works.\n\nIn AdaBoost, at each iteration t, a weak classifier is trained using the current weights D_t.\n\nThe weighted error rate e_t is the sum of the weights of the misclassified examples.\n\nAfter training, the weights are updated: correctly classified examples have their weights decreased, and misclassified examples have their weights increased.\n\nThen, the next weak classifier is trained on the updated weights.\n\nThe idea is that each subsequent weak classifier focuses more on the examples that the previous ones got wrong.\n\nGiven this, I would expect that the weighted error rate e_t should decrease or at least not increase significantly, because the algorithm is supposed to improve over time.\n\nIf e_t were to increase, that would suggest that the weak classifier is performing worse, which contradicts the purpose of boosting.\n\nMoreover, in the AdaBoost algorithm, the selection of the weak classifier at each step is based on minimizing the weighted error.\n\nTherefore, it's designed to decrease the error rate, not increase it.\n\nHence, statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. True, False.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn AdaBoost, the weighted error rate e_t is used to compute the weight of the t-th weak classifier in the final combined classifier.\n\nSpecifically, the weight alpha_t of the t-th weak classifier is alpha_t = 0.5 * ln((1 - e_t) / e_t).\n\nThis alpha_t is then used to adjust the weights of the examples for the next iteration.\n\nIf e_t were to increase, that would imply that the weak classifier is performing worse, which would lead to a smaller alpha_t, potentially harming the overall performance.\n\nBut since AdaBoost is designed to minimize the weighted error, it's unlikely that e_t would increase over iterations.\n\nIn fact, one of the key properties of AdaBoost is that the training error should decrease exponentially with the number of iterations, under the assumption that the weak learners are slightly better than random guessing.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is indeed false.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
