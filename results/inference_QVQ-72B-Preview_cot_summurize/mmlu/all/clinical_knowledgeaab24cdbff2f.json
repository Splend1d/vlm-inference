                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Which organ secretes insulin?\" and there are four options to choose from. Let me see, option A says \"The gastric parietal cells.\" Hmm, I think gastric parietal cells are in the stomach, right? They mainly secrete hydrochloric acid and some enzymes, but not insulin. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B is \"The pancreas.\" I know that the pancreas is involved in producing hormones like insulin and glucagon. In fact, I think the beta cells in the pancreas are responsible for producing insulin. Let me double-check that. Yes, the pancreas has clusters of cells called the islets of Langerhans, which contain the beta cells that secrete insulin in response to high blood sugar levels. So, this seems like a likely answer.\n\nOption C is \"The walls of the large intestine.\" The large intestine is mainly responsible for absorbing water from undigested food and forming feces. I don't recall it being involved in hormone secretion, especially not insulin. Maybe it produces some other hormones, but insulin is not one of them. So, I think I can eliminate this option.\n\nOption D is \"The autonomic nervous system.\" The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary functions in the body, like heart rate, digestion, and respiration. While it does play a role in regulating insulin secretion by the pancreas, it doesn't actually produce insulin itself. So, it's more of a controller than a producer of insulin. Therefore, this shouldn't be the correct answer.\n\nBased on my knowledge, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is option B, the pancreas. But just to be thorough, let me think about any possible exceptions or special cases where another organ might also secrete insulin. For example, there's been some research suggesting that other tissues might produce small amounts of insulin-like substances, but the primary and most significant producer of insulin in the human body is definitely the pancreas.\n\nSo, to sum it up, insulin is primarily secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Which organ secretes insulin?\" is the pancreas, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
