                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"Given that the sample has a standard deviation of zero, which of the following is a true statement?\"\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The standard deviation of the population is also zero.\n\nB. The sample mean and sample median are equal.\n\nC. The sample may have outliers.\n\nD. The population has a symmetric distribution.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what it means for a sample to have a standard deviation of zero. The standard deviation measures the spread or variation in a set of values. If it's zero, that means there's no variation at all in the data points. In other words, all the values in the sample are exactly the same.\n\nSo, option A says that the standard deviation of the population is also zero. Well, just because our sample has no variation doesn't necessarily mean the entire population does. The sample could be a specific subset where, by chance, all values are the same, but the population might have variation. So, I don't think we can conclude that the population's standard deviation is zero. Maybe it is, but we can't be sure from this information alone. So, I'd be cautious about option A.\n\nOption B says that the sample mean and sample median are equal. Now, in a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean and median are indeed equal. But is this always the case when the standard deviation is zero?\n\nWait a minute, if all the values in the sample are the same, then the mean is just that value, and the median is also that value since all values are equal. So, in this specific case, yes, the mean and median are equal. But is this the only reason they are equal? Not necessarily. They could be equal in other distributions as well. However, given that the standard deviation is zero, which implies no variation, it forces the mean and median to be equal because there's only one value. So, perhaps option B is true in this context.\n\nOption C says that the sample may have outliers. Hmm. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from other observations. If all the values in the sample are identical, then there are no data points that stand out as outliers. So, in this case, the sample does not have outliers. Therefore, option C is not true.\n\nOption D says that the population has a symmetric distribution. Again, similar to option A, just because our sample has no variation doesn't mean the population is symmetric. The population could have any distribution; it could be skewed, bimodal, anything. The sample with no variation doesn't provide enough information to conclude anything about the population's symmetry. So, option D is probably not true.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A: Can't conclude population SD is zero based on a sample.\n\n- Option B: Mean and median are equal in the sample because there's no variation; all values are the same.\n\n- Option C: No outliers in the sample since all values are identical.\n\n- Option D: Can't conclude population is symmetric based on a sample with no variation.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement among these options is B: The sample mean and sample median are equal.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Is there any chance that in a sample with zero standard deviation, the mean and median could differ? No, because they both must be equal to the common value of all the data points. So, yes, they are equal.\n\nAlright, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
