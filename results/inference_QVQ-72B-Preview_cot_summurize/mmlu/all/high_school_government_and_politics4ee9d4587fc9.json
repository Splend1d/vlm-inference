                    "text": "So I have this question about redrawing congressional district boundaries every 10 years. It says this has to happen to reflect population shifts indicated by the national census. Okay, that makes sense because the census counts how many people live where, right? So, if some areas have grown a lot in population and others have shrunk, the boundaries probably need to be adjusted to make sure each district has roughly the same number of people. That way, each person's vote carries about the same weight.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure. Option B says it's to guarantee the turnover of the majority of congressional seats. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Redrawing boundaries might influence who wins seats, but it's not about guaranteeing turnover. In fact, sometimes redistricting can entrench incumbents if they manipulate the boundaries to their advantage, which is called gerrymandering.\n\nOption C says to make sure each state's congressional delegation exactly mirrors its residents' party affiliations. Well, that seems like a tall order. It's not practical or even possible to perfectly align every district with party preferences, especially since people's political leanings can vary widely within small areas. Plus, this seems more about achieving a certain political outcome rather than fair representation based on population.\n\nOption D is about determining which party's leader will be named Speaker of the House. That's a separate issue altogether. The Speaker is elected by the members of the House, typically from the party that holds the majority of seats. Redistricting can influence which party has more seats, but it doesn't directly determine who the Speaker will be.\n\nSo, going back to option A, it seems the most accurate. Redistricting is necessary to reflect population shifts identified by the census, ensuring that each congressional district has approximately equal representation based on population. This is a fundamental principle of democracy, often referred to as \"one person, one vote.\"\n\nI think the answer is A. Reflect population shifts indicated by the national census.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
