                    "text": "So I've got this problem: \"What is the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321?\" And the options are 6, 121, 18107, and 54,320. Hmm, interesting. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what a factor is. A factor of a number is another number that divides into it evenly, right? So, for 54,321, I'm looking for the largest number that can divide it without leaving a remainder, and it has to be less than 54,321 itself.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. Every number has 1 and itself as factors. So, for 54,321, 1 and 54,321 are factors. But the question is asking for the largest factor less than 54,321, so 54,320 is an option here. But is it a factor?\n\nWell, maybe I should start by checking if 54,320 is a factor of 54,321. Wait, but 54,320 is just one less than 54,321. Let me see: 54,321 divided by 54,320 would be almost exactly 1 with a remainder of 1, right? So, 54,320 isn't a factor of 54,321 because it doesn't divide evenly. So, option D is probably out.\n\nNext, option C is 18,107. Is that a factor? Hmm, maybe I should try dividing 54,321 by 18,107 to see if it divides evenly. Let me calculate that. 54,321 divided by 18,107. Well, 18,107 times 3 is 54,321, because 18,107 times 3 is 54,321. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 18,107 times 3 is 54,321. Yes, that's correct. So, 18,107 is a factor of 54,321.\n\nNow, option B is 121. Is 121 a factor of 54,321? Let me see. 121 times 10 is 1,210, times 100 is 12,100, times 400 is 48,400, plus 12,100 is 60,500, which is more than 54,321. So, 121 times 450 would be 54,450, which is close but a bit too high. Let me try 450 minus 1, so 449. 121 times 449. Well, 121 times 400 is 48,400, and 121 times 49 is 6,000 minus 49, so 5,889. Adding up, 48,400 plus 5,889 is 54,289, which is less than 54,321 by 32. So, 121 is not a factor of 54,321.\n\nOption A is 6. Is 6 a factor of 54,321? Let's see, 54,321 divided by 6. Well, 6 times 9,000 is 54,000, and 9,000 times 6 is 54,000, so 9,000 times 6 is 54,000, and 54,321 minus 54,000 is 321. Then, 6 times 53 is 318, with a remainder of 3. So, 6 does not divide evenly into 54,321; there's a remainder of 3. Therefore, 6 is not a factor.\n\nSo, among the options, only 18,107 is a factor of 54,321, and it's the largest one listed. But wait, is there a possibility of larger factors than 18,107?\n\nLet me think about how to find all the factors of 54,321. One way is to factorize 54,321 into its prime factors. Once I have the prime factorization, I can find all possible products of those primes to get all factors.\n\nFirst, let's try dividing 54,321 by the smallest prime, which is 2. 54,321 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2. Next is 3. To check if it's divisible by 3, I can add up the digits: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so 54,321 is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, 54,321 divided by 3 is 18,107. Wait a minute, that's option C. So, 54,321 = 3 \u00d7 18,107. Now, is 18,107 a prime number? If it is, then the factors of 54,321 are 1, 3, 18,107, and 54,321.\n\nBut is 18,107 a prime number? Let's check. The square root of 18,107 is approximately 134.56, so we need to check divisibility by primes up to 134.\n\nLooking at small primes: 18,107 divided by 7 is approximately 2,586.714, not an integer. Divided by 11: 11 times 1,600 is 17,600, plus 11 times 400 is 4,400, totaling 22,000, which is too high. Wait, maybe I should use the method I used earlier: 121 times 150 is 18,150, which is close but higher than 18,107. So, 121 times 150 is 18,150, which is 43 more than 18,107. So, 121 times 149 is 121 times 150 minus 121, which is 18,150 minus 121 equals 18,029. That's less than 18,107 by 78. So, 121 doesn't divide evenly into 18,107.\n\nWhat about 13? 13 times 1,300 is 16,900, plus 13 times 100 is 1,300, totaling 18,200, which is 93 more than 18,107. So, 13 times 1,385 would be 13 times 1,300 is 16,900, plus 13 times 85 is 1,105, totaling 18,005, which is 18,107 minus 18,005 equals 102. Not divisible.\n\nNext, 17: 17 times 1,000 is 17,000, times 200 is 3,400, totaling 20,400, which is higher than 18,107. 17 times 1,000 is 17,000, plus 17 times 60 is 1,020, totaling 18,020, which is 87 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n19: 19 times 1,000 is 19,000, which is higher than 18,107. 19 times 900 is 17,100, plus 19 times 50 is 950, totaling 18,050, which is 57 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n23: 23 times 800 is 18,400, which is higher than 18,107. 23 times 700 is 16,100, plus 23 times 90 is 2,070, totaling 18,170, which is 63 higher than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n29: 29 times 600 is 17,400, plus 29 times 30 is 870, totaling 18,270, which is 163 higher than 18,107. 29 times 600 is 17,400, plus 29 times 25 is 725, totaling 18,125, which is 18,125 minus 18,107 equals 18. Not divisible.\n\n31: 31 times 600 is 18,600, which is higher than 18,107. 31 times 500 is 15,500, plus 31 times 80 is 2,480, totaling 17,980, which is 127 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n37: 37 times 500 is 18,500, which is higher than 18,107. 37 times 400 is 14,800, plus 37 times 90 is 3,330, totaling 18,130, which is 23 higher than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n41: 41 times 400 is 16,400, plus 41 times 40 is 1,640, totaling 18,040, which is 67 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n43: 43 times 400 is 17,200, plus 43 times 20 is 860, totaling 18,060, which is 47 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n47: 47 times 300 is 14,100, plus 47 times 80 is 3,760, totaling 17,860, which is 247 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n53: 53 times 300 is 15,900, plus 53 times 40 is 2,120, totaling 18,020, which is 87 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n59: 59 times 300 is 17,700, plus 59 times 10 is 590, totaling 18,290, which is 183 higher than 18,107. 59 times 300 is 17,700, plus 59 times 7 is 413, totaling 18,113, which is 18,113 minus 18,107 equals 6. Not divisible.\n\n61: 61 times 300 is 18,300, which is higher than 18,107. 61 times 200 is 12,200, plus 61 times 90 is 5,490, totaling 17,690, which is 417 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n67: 67 times 200 is 13,400, plus 67 times 70 is 4,690, totaling 18,090, which is 18,090 minus 18,107 equals -17. Not divisible.\n\n71: 71 times 200 is 14,200, plus 71 times 50 is 3,550, totaling 17,750, which is 357 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n73: 73 times 200 is 14,600, plus 73 times 50 is 3,650, totaling 18,250, which is 143 higher than 18,107. 73 times 200 is 14,600, plus 73 times 40 is 2,920, totaling 17,520, which is 587 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n79: 79 times 200 is 15,800, plus 79 times 30 is 2,370, totaling 18,170, which is 63 higher than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n83: 83 times 200 is 16,600, plus 83 times 20 is 1,660, totaling 18,260, which is 153 higher than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n89: 89 times 200 is 17,800, plus 89 times 5 is 445, totaling 18,245, which is 138 higher than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\n97: 97 times 200 is 19,400, which is higher than 18,107. 97 times 100 is 9,700, plus 97 times 80 is 7,760, totaling 17,460, which is 647 less than 18,107. Not divisible.\n\nSo, none of the primes up to 134 divide evenly into 18,107, which suggests that 18,107 is a prime number. Therefore, the factors of 54,321 are 1, 3, 18,107, and 54,321.\n\nAmong these, the largest factor less than 54,321 is 18,107, which is option C.\n\nWait a second, but option D is 54,320, which is larger than 18,107, but as I checked earlier, 54,320 is not a factor of 54,321. So, even though 54,320 is larger than 18,107, it's not a factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 18,107, which is option C.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, I confirmed that 18,107 is a factor because 3 \u00d7 18,107 = 54,321. Then, I checked that 18,107 is a prime number by testing divisibility by primes up to its square root, which is approximately 134.56, and none of those primes divided evenly into 18,107. So, yes, 18,107 is the largest factor of 54,321 less than itself.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18107} \\]"
