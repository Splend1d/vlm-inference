                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: 14 \u00d7 3 = 42. And it's asking which statement correctly interprets the expression. Let me look at the options.\n\nOption A says: 14 is 3 more than 42. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. If 14 is 3 more than 42, that would mean 14 = 42 + 3, which is 45. But that's not true because 14 isn't equal to 45. So, A is definitely wrong.\n\nOption B: 42 is 14 more than 3. Let's check that. If 3 plus 14 is 17, but 42 is not 17. So, that can't be right either. Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like B is also incorrect.\n\nOption C: 14 is 3 times as many as 42. Okay, so if 14 is 3 times 42, that would mean 14 = 3 \u00d7 42. Let's calculate that: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126, which is not equal to 14. So, that doesn't make sense. C is out too.\n\nOption D: 42 is 3 times as many as 14. So, if 42 is 3 times 14, then 3 \u00d7 14 = 42. That matches the original equation, 14 \u00d7 3 = 42. Wait, but is that the correct interpretation?\n\nLet me think about this. Multiplication can be interpreted in different ways, but in this context, it seems like it's asking for the relationship between 14, 3, and 42.\n\nLet me consider what multiplication means here. When we say 14 \u00d7 3 = 42, it means that if you have 14 groups of 3, you have a total of 42. Alternatively, 3 groups of 14 also make 42, but in standard multiplication, the order matters in terms of the interpretation.\n\nBut looking at the options, only D seems to align with this. It says 42 is 3 times as many as 14, which matches the multiplication of 14 \u00d7 3 = 42, because 3 times 14 is 42.\n\nWait a minute, but is that the correct way to interpret it? Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the question is testing whether I understand that multiplication is commutative, meaning 14 \u00d7 3 = 3 \u00d7 14, but their interpretations are different.\n\nIn option C, it says 14 is 3 times as many as 42, which would correspond to 14 = 3 \u00d7 42, which is 126, but that's not equal to 14. So, that's incorrect.\n\nOption D says 42 is 3 times as many as 14, which is 3 \u00d7 14 = 42, which matches the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to see if I understand that 42 is three times fourteen, which is indeed 42.\n\nI think D is the correct answer. But just to be sure, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nPerhaps the question is about scaling or comparison. For example, if 42 is three times as many as 14, that means that 14 is being multiplied by 3 to get 42. That seems accurate.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consider 14 being three times 42, which is what option C says, that would be 14 = 3 \u00d7 42, which is 126, but 14 is not equal to 126. So, that's incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option A suggests that 14 is 3 more than 42, which would be 42 + 3 = 45, but 14 is not equal to 45. So, that's wrong.\n\nOption B says 42 is 14 more than 3, which is 3 + 14 = 17, but 42 is not equal to 17. So, that's also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, by elimination, option D is the correct choice. 42 is three times as many as 14, which aligns with the multiplication 14 \u00d7 3 = 42.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think of an example. Suppose I have 14 apples, and each apple has 3 seeds. Then, the total number of seeds is 14 \u00d7 3 = 42. So, in this context, 42 seeds are three times as many as the 14 apples, because each apple contributes 3 seeds.\n\nAlternatively, if I have 3 boxes, and each box contains 14 pencils, then the total number of pencils is 3 \u00d7 14 = 42. But in this case, the relationship is that 42 is three times 14, which again is consistent with option D.\n\nI don't think there's any other interpretation that would make the other options correct. Therefore, I'm confident that option D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
