                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is asking about an animated character who has a crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl. The options are Richie Rich, Charlie Brown, Bugs Bunny, and Jonny Quest. Hmm, I need to recall which one of these characters has a crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl.\n\nFirst, I should probably identify which character is associated with the Little Red-Haired Girl. I think the Little Red-Haired Girl is a character from the Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. She's famously known as the object of Charlie Brown's affection. In the comics, Charlie Brown never actually sees her face because she's always seen from behind or her face is obscured in some way. She's kind of a mythical figure to him, and he has a big crush on her.\n\nSo, if the Little Red-Haired Girl is from Peanuts and Charlie Brown has a crush on her, then maybe the answer is Charlie Brown. But let me double-check. Is there any chance that another character from a different animated series also has a crush on her? That seems unlikely, as the Little Red-Haired Girl is specifically from Peanuts.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Richie Rich. He's from a different comic series, isn't he? Richie Rich was created by Harvey Comics, and his main love interest was Gloria, I believe. So, I don't think Richie Rich has a crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl.\n\nNext is Charlie Brown. As I thought earlier, he is known for having a crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl. In fact, it's a central theme in the Peanuts comics and animated specials. He often talks about her and even writes letters to her, though they usually end up being delivered to the wrong person or not sent at all.\n\nThen there's Bugs Bunny. Bugs Bunny is from the Looney Tunes series, and his main love interest is Lola Bunny. He also has interactions with other female characters like Honey Bunny, but I don't recall any connection between Bugs Bunny and the Little Red-Haired Girl.\n\nLastly, Jonny Quest. Jonny Quest is from the animated series of the same name, where he goes on adventures with his scientist father and a friend named Hadji. I don't remember any specific love interest for Jonny in the series, let alone a connection to the Little Red-Haired Girl.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems pretty clear that Charlie Brown is the animated character who has a crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl. The other characters don't have any known association with her.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about whether there's any possibility of crossover or misinterpretation. For example, maybe in some parody or fan art, one of these characters might have a crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl, but that wouldn't make it canonical.\n\nNo, I don't think that's the case here. The question is straightforward, and based on the official storylines, Charlie Brown is the one who has a crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Charlie Brown.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Charlie Brown}} \\]"
