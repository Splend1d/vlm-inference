I think it's PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, starting with Parentheses:\n\nThere's (12 \u2022 4). That means 12 multiplied by 4. Let's calculate that:\n\n12 \u00d7 4 = 48\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n5 + 2 \u2022 15 + 48\n\nNext, there are no exponents here, so we move on to Multiplication.\n\nThere are two multiplications: 2 \u2022 15 and the one we just did, which was 12 \u2022 4, but we've already handled that.\n\nSo, 2 \u2022 15 is 2 multiplied by 15:\n\n2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to:\n\n5 + 30 + 48\n\nNow, it's just Addition and Subtraction left. There are no subtraction signs here, so just addition.\n\nI can add them from left to right:\n\n5 + 30 = 35\n\nThen, 35 + 48 = 83\n\nSo, the final answer should be 83.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nOriginal expression: 5 + 2 \u2022 15 + (12 \u2022 4)\n\nHandled parentheses first: 12 \u2022 4 = 48\n\nThen multiplication: 2 \u2022 15 = 30\n\nThen addition: 5 + 30 + 48 = 83\n\nLooks good to me.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 78\n\nB. 83\n\nC. 131\n\nD. 153\n\nSo, option B. 83 should be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, let's make sure there are no tricks here. Is there any chance that the \u2022 symbol could represent something else besides multiplication?\n\nHmm, in standard mathematical notation, \u2022 usually represents multiplication, especially in algebra textbooks. So, I think it's safe to assume that's multiplication.\n\nAlso, ensuring that there are no other operations hidden or misinterpreted.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the units. If 5 is, say, units, then multiplying 2 by 15 gives 30 units, and 12 by 4 gives 48 units, and adding them up gives 83 units.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a different order of operations, like if the multiplications were meant to be done together first, but according to PEMDAS, multiplications and divisions are done from left to right.\n\nSo, 2 \u2022 15 is 30, then adding 48 is correct.\n\nI don't think there's another way to interpret this expression.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 83, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{83} \\]"
