I need to find out which of these multiple-choice answers it corresponds to. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should plug in the values of a, b, and c into the expression. So, a is 5, b is 3, and c is 2.\n\nSo, (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2 becomes:\n\n(2\u00b2 - 3\u00b2)\u00b2 + 5\u00b2\n\nWait, actually, I need to be careful with the order of operations here. Exponents come before subtraction, right? So, c squared is 2\u00b2, which is 4, and b squared is 3\u00b2, which is 9. Then, 4 - 9 is -5. So, (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2) is -5.\n\nNow, (-5)\u00b2 is 25.\n\nThen, add a\u00b2, which is 5\u00b2, which is 25.\n\nSo, 25 + 25 equals 50.\n\nBut let me double-check that I'm doing this correctly. Maybe I should consider if there are any parentheses or exponents that I might have misinterpreted.\n\nLet me write down the expression again: (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2.\n\nPlugging in c = 2 and b = 3:\n\n(2\u00b2 - 3\u00b2)\u00b2 + 5\u00b2\n\nYes, 2\u00b2 is 4, and 3\u00b2 is 9, so 4 - 9 is -5.\n\nThen, (-5)\u00b2 is indeed 25.\n\nAnd 5\u00b2 is 25.\n\nSo, 25 + 25 is 50.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the subtraction is inside the parentheses or not. Let me see.\n\nActually, the expression is (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2.\n\nI think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this, like expanding the expression first and then plugging in the values.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, expand (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nThat would be (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 = c\u2074 - 2c\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u2074.\n\nThen, add a\u00b2, so the expression becomes c\u2074 - 2c\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u2074 + a\u00b2.\n\nNow, plug in c = 2, b = 3, and a = 5.\n\nSo, 2\u2074 - 2*(2\u00b2)*(3\u00b2) + 3\u2074 + 5\u00b2.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n2\u2074 is 16.\n\n2\u00b2 is 4.\n\n3\u00b2 is 9.\n\nSo, 2*(4)*(9) is 72.\n\n3\u2074 is 81.\n\n5\u00b2 is 25.\n\nNow, put it all together: 16 - 72 + 81 + 25.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n16 - 72 = -56.\n\n-56 + 81 = 25.\n\n25 + 25 = 50.\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nSo, the expression evaluates to 50.\n\nLooking back at the multiple-choice options:\n\nA. 194\n\nB. 18\n\nC. 50\n\nD. 0\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 50.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
