Mainbocher.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is Italian. I'm not entirely sure about all of them, but let me think one by one.\n\nFirst, Escada. I've heard of Escada before. I think it's a fashion brand, maybe German? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me recall... I think Escada was founded in Germany. So, that would make it a German design firm, not Italian. So, probably not the answer.\n\nNext, Fendi. Oh, Fendi is definitely Italian. I remember Fendi is known for luxury fashion, especially their famous bags and accessories. They're based in Rome, Italy. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nThen, Ghost. I'm not very familiar with Ghost in the fashion context. Let me think... Is there a fashion brand called Ghost? I think there might be a clothing brand named Ghost, but I'm not sure about its origin. Maybe it's British? I'm not certain, but it doesn't ring as Italian.\n\nLastly, Mainbocher. I've heard this name before, but again, I'm not sure about the origin. Let me try to recall... I think Mainbocher is an American fashion designer's name. So, that would make it an American design firm, not Italian.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Fendi is definitely Italian, and the others seem to be from different countries. Therefore, the answer should be B. Fendi.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, let me double-check. Escada is German, Fendi is Italian, Ghost might be British, and Mainbocher American. Yes, that seems consistent. So, B. Fendi is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Fendi}} \\]"
