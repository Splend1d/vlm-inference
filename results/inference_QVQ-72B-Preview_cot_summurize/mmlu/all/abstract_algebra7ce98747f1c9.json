I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a homomorphic image is. If we have a group \\( G \\) and another group \\( H \\), and there's a homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\rightarrow H \\), then the image of \\( \\phi \\), which is \\( \\phi(G) \\), is called a homomorphic image of \\( G \\). So, basically, any group that can be obtained by applying a homomorphism to \\( G \\).\n\nNow, a factor group, or quotient group, is something we get by taking \\( G \\) and dividing it by a normal subgroup \\( N \\). The result is denoted \\( G/N \\), and it consists of the cosets of \\( N \\) in \\( G \\). So, factor groups are a specific way of constructing new groups from \\( G \\) by modding out by normal subgroups.\n\nStatement 1 says: \"Every homomorphic image of a group \\( G \\) is isomorphic to a factor group of \\( G \\).\"\n\nHmm, that sounds familiar. I think there's a theorem in group theory that relates homomorphic images to factor groups. Oh, right! It's the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups. It states that if \\( \\phi: G \\rightarrow H \\) is a group homomorphism, then \\( \\phi(G) \\) is isomorphic to \\( G/\\ker(\\phi) \\), where \\( \\ker(\\phi) \\) is the kernel of \\( \\phi \\).\n\nSince the kernel of any homomorphism is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), this means that every homomorphic image of \\( G \\) is indeed isomorphic to a factor group of \\( G \\), specifically \\( G \\) modulo the kernel of the homomorphism.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\nNow, Statement 2 says: \"The homomorphic images of a group \\( G \\) are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of \\( G \\).\"\n\nThis seems a bit stronger than Statement 1. Statement 1 says that every homomorphic image is isomorphic to some factor group, but Statement 2 is saying that the collection of all homomorphic images is exactly the same as the collection of all factor groups, up to isomorphism.\n\nWait a minute, is that accurate? Let me think about this.\n\nWe know from the First Isomorphism Theorem that every homomorphic image is isomorphic to a factor group. But does that mean that every factor group is also a homomorphic image?\n\nWell, if we take a normal subgroup \\( N \\) of \\( G \\), then the quotient group \\( G/N \\) can be realized as a homomorphic image by considering the natural projection \\( \\pi: G \\rightarrow G/N \\) defined by \\( \\pi(g) = gN \\). This is a surjective homomorphism, and its kernel is \\( N \\). So, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, \\( G/N \\) is isomorphic to \\( G/\\ker(\\pi) \\), which is \\( G/N \\) again. So, yes, every factor group is isomorphic to a homomorphic image.\n\nBut is every homomorphic image isomorphic to every factor group? No, that's not necessarily the case. Different homomorphisms can have different kernels, and thus their images can be different groups, all isomorphic to their respective factor groups.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Statement 2 is saying that the set of all homomorphic images of \\( G \\) (up to isomorphism) is the same as the set of all factor groups of \\( G \\) (up to isomorphism).\n\nGiven that every homomorphic image is isomorphic to a factor group, and every factor group is isomorphic to a homomorphic image, it seems that these two sets are indeed the same, up to isomorphism.\n\nBut is that correct? Let's consider an example.\n\nTake \\( G = \\mathbb{Z} \\), the integers under addition. The factor groups of \\( G \\) are of the form \\( \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\) for \\( n \\geq 1 \\), which are all cyclic groups of order \\( n \\), and \\( G \\) itself.\n\nNow, consider homomorphisms from \\( G \\) to other groups. For instance, a homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\) can be defined by \\( \\phi(k) = k + n\\mathbb{Z} \\), which is surjective, and its image is \\( \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\), which is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nSimilarly, any homomorphic image of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) will be isomorphic to some \\( \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\), which are exactly the factor groups of \\( G \\).\n\nSo, in this case, it seems that the homomorphic images and the factor groups are the same, up to isomorphism.\n\nBut is this always the case for any group \\( G \\)?\n\nLet's think about a finite group. Suppose \\( G \\) is a finite group of order \\( n \\). Then, its factor groups are of the form \\( G/N \\), where \\( N \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\). By Lagrange's theorem, the order of \\( N \\) divides \\( n \\), so \\( |G/N| = n/|N| \\), which must divide \\( n \\).\n\nNow, consider a homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\rightarrow H \\). The image \\( \\phi(G) \\) is a subgroup of \\( H \\), and by the First Isomorphism Theorem, \\( \\phi(G) \\cong G/\\ker(\\phi) \\), where \\( \\ker(\\phi) \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\). So, again, the order of \\( \\phi(G) \\) is \\( n/|\\ker(\\phi)| \\), which divides \\( n \\).\n\nThus, every homomorphic image has an order that divides \\( n \\), and is isomorphic to a factor group \\( G/N \\), where \\( N \\) is the kernel of some homomorphism.\n\nMoreover, every factor group \\( G/N \\) can be realized as a homomorphic image via the projection \\( \\pi: G \\rightarrow G/N \\).\n\nTherefore, the set of all homomorphic images of \\( G \\) (up to isomorphism) is exactly the set of all its factor groups (up to isomorphism).\n\nSo, Statement 2 also seems to be true.\n\nWait, but the question is giving options where one statement could be true and the other false, or both true or both false. Given my reasoning, both statements seem to be true.\n\nOption A is \"True, True\", which would correspond to both statements being true.\n\nOption B is \"False, False\", which doesn't match.\n\nOption C is \"True, False\", which doesn't match.\n\nOption D is \"False, True\", which doesn't match.\n\nSo, the answer should be Option A: True, True.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any group for which not all homomorphic images are isomorphic to factor groups?\n\nAs I recalled the First Isomorphism Theorem, it should hold for any group and any homomorphism, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nAnd for the second statement, is it always true that the homomorphic images are the same as the factor groups, up to isomorphism?\n\nYes, because every homomorphic image is isomorphic to a factor group, and every factor group can be realized as a homomorphic image via the natural projection.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
