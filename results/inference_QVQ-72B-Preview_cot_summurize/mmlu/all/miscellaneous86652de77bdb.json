                    "text": "Let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, I need to figure out how many moles of HCl must be added to enough water to make 3 liters of a 2 M HCl solution. The options are 1 mol, 2 mol, 3 mol, or 6 mol. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solution concentration calculations, but I think I can work it out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what molarity means. Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. So, if I have a 2 M solution of HCl, that means there are 2 moles of HCl per liter of solution. But in this problem, I need to find out how many moles of HCl are needed for 3 liters of this solution.\n\nOkay, so if 1 liter of solution contains 2 moles of HCl, then 3 liters should contain 3 times that amount. Let me do the math: 2 moles/L \u00d7 3 L = 6 moles. So, according to this, I need 6 moles of HCl to make 3 liters of a 2 M HCl solution.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something. Is there any other factor I should consider, like the volume of the solute itself? I mean, when I add HCl to water, does the volume of the HCl affect the total volume of the solution? I think in dilute solutions, the volume of the solute is usually negligible, especially if HCl is being dissolved in water. So, probably, the total volume is just the volume of water plus a tiny bit from the HCl, but for the purposes of this problem, maybe I can ignore that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the HCl is being dissolved in water to make exactly 3 liters of solution, and I don't need to account for any volume changes upon mixing. If that's the case, then my initial calculation should hold.\n\nLet me double-check the units to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Molarity is moles per liter, so moles = molarity \u00d7 liters. Plugging in the values: 2 M \u00d7 3 L = 6 moles. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let's consider if the HCl solution being added has its own volume. Suppose I have a concentrated HCl solution that I'm diluting to make a 2 M solution. In that case, the volume of the concentrated solution would need to be accounted for when calculating the final volume. However, the problem states that I'm adding HCl to sufficient water to form 3 liters of solution, implying that the final volume is already accounted for and is 3 liters.\n\nSo, I think the straightforward approach is correct here. Add 6 moles of HCl to enough water to make 3 liters of solution, and you'll have a 2 M HCl solution.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the concentration calculation. The formula for molarity is:\n\n\\[M = \\frac{\\text{moles of solute}}{\\text{liters of solution}}\\]\n\nRearranging for moles:\n\n\\[\\text{moles} = M \\times \\text{liters}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\\text{moles} = 2 \\, \\text{mol/L} \\times 3 \\, \\text{L} = 6 \\, \\text{moles}\\]\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the answer should be 6 moles, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question. It says, \"how many moles of HCl must be added to sufficient water to form 3 liters of a 2 M HCl solution?\" It seems clear: you're starting with water, adding HCl, and ending up with 3 liters of 2 M solution. So, no tricks there.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps thinking about dilution formula, but since we're starting from water and adding HCl, dilution might not apply directly. Usually, dilution involves taking a concentrated solution and adding water to reduce its concentration, but here, we're building the solution from scratch.\n\nStill, for completeness, let's consider the dilution equation:\n\n\\[M_1 V_1 = M_2 V_2\\]\n\nBut in this scenario, I don't have an initial molarity or volume, just the final molarity and volume. So, this equation might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to prepare this solution in the lab, I'd measure out the required amount of HCl (in moles or grams), dissolve it in water, and then dilute to the final volume of 3 liters. So, again, that points to 6 moles of HCl in 3 liters to achieve 2 M.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each one leads me back to the answer being 6 moles. Therefore, the correct choice is D. 6 mol.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
