                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether a state court should hear this case. Let me try to understand all the parts.\n\nThere's a plaintiff and a defendant, both residing in the same state. The plaintiff is suing the defendant in that state's court. The plaintiff is claiming a cause of action based on a federal statute. There's also a similar cause of action under state law, but the plaintiff is choosing to go with the federal one. The federal statute says that claims under it can be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. And importantly, no federal court has interpreted this statute yet.\n\nAlright, so the question is whether the state court should hear this case. The options are:\n\nA. No, because cases arising under federal law must be decided in federal court.\n\nB. No, because state courts must abstain in cases arising under federal law until a federal court has decided the federal issue.\n\nC. Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n\nD. Yes, because the parties cannot proceed in federal court since there is no diversity of citizenship.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about jurisdiction in the U.S. legal system.\n\nThere are two main types of jurisdiction: federal and state.\n\nFederal courts have jurisdiction over cases involving federal questions, meaning cases that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. They also have jurisdiction over cases where there is diversity of citizenship between the parties, meaning both sides are from different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nState courts, on the other hand, have jurisdiction over most other cases, including those arising under state law.\n\nBut in this scenario, the plaintiff is bringing a claim under a federal statute, but both parties are from the same state, so there's no diversity of citizenship. That means, in theory, neither federal nor state courts have mandatory jurisdiction based on the usual rules.\n\nHowever, the federal statute itself says that claims under it can be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. That suggests that Congress intended these claims to be heard in any court that has the capacity to handle them, which could include state courts.\n\nNow, option A says that cases arising under federal law must be decided in federal court. But that's not always the case. While federal courts have jurisdiction over federal questions, state courts can also hear cases involving federal law under certain circumstances.\n\nOption B says that state courts must abstain from deciding cases arising under federal law until a federal court has decided the federal issue. Abstention is a doctrine where courts may choose not to decide certain issues, particularly if they involve novel questions of federal law or if there are ongoing parallel proceedings. However, it's not a blanket rule that state courts must abstain in all federal law cases until a federal court decides the issue.\n\nOption C says yes, state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law. This seems to suggest that state courts are obligated to hear federal claims on equal terms with state claims, without discrimination.\n\nOption D says yes, because the parties cannot proceed in federal court since there is no diversity of citizenship. This implies that without diversity jurisdiction, the federal court wouldn't have jurisdiction over the federal claim, hence the case must be heard in state court.\n\nHmm, I need to think more carefully.\n\nI recall that in some cases, state courts are required to hear federal claims if they have jurisdiction over the subject matter. Also, there's a principle that state courts must apply federal law when it's relevant to a case before them.\n\nMoreover, there's the Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution, which provides that federal law supersedes state law. So, state courts must apply federal law when it's applicable, even if the case is primarily based on federal law.\n\nBut, there might be exceptions or specific doctrines that would prevent a state court from hearing a federal claim, especially if the federal statute in question provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction or if there are complex federal issues that are better handled by federal courts.\n\nIn this case, the federal statute allows claims to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. That seems to suggest that Congress intended these claims to be heard in both federal and state courts, as long as the court has the competence to hear the matter.\n\nGiven that, and considering that both parties are from the same state, the state court should have jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\nBut wait, option D says \"yes, because the parties cannot proceed in federal court since there is no diversity of citizenship.\" While it's true that without diversity, federal courts might not have jurisdiction, but in reality, federal courts can hear cases based on federal questions regardless of diversity.\n\nWait, but I thought federal courts have jurisdiction over federal questions regardless of diversity. So, even if both parties are from the same state, if the case arises under federal law, federal courts can hear it.\n\nBut the statute says claims can be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, which might include state courts.\n\nI need to reconcile these points.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the federal statute allows for claims to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, which could include state courts. So, even if federal courts have jurisdiction based on the federal question, the statute seems to give plaintiffs the choice to bring the case in state court if they prefer.\n\nGiven that, and considering that state courts are generally competent to hear federal claims, especially when authorized by the statute itself, the state court should hear the case.\n\nOption C seems relevant because it mentions that state courts may not discriminate against federal claims. So, if a state court can hear similar state law claims, it should not discriminate against federal claims and should hear them as well.\n\nOption D seems misleading because, actually, federal courts can hear federal questions regardless of diversity.\n\nWait, maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nYes, federal district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. This is called federal question jurisdiction. So, even without diversity, if the case arises under federal law, federal courts can hear it.\n\nBut in this scenario, the federal statute allows claims to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, which likely includes state courts.\n\nSo, the plaintiff has the option to bring the case in state court, and the state court should hear it.\n\nUnless there's some abstention doctrine that applies, but the scenario says the statute hasn't been interpreted by any federal court yet. That might make a state court reluctant to decide the case, but it's not a absolute rule.\n\nOption B suggests that state courts must abstain until a federal court decides the federal issue, but that's not accurate. Abstention is discretionary, not mandatory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C or D, but D seems to be based on an incorrect premise about diversity jurisdiction.\n\nWait, maybe D is trying to say that since there's no diversity, the case can't go to federal court, hence it must go to state court. But that's not quite right because, as I said, federal courts can hear federal questions regardless of diversity.\n\nSo, perhaps D is incorrect for that reason.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n\nThat makes sense because if state courts can hear similar state law claims, they shouldn't discriminate against federal claims, especially when the federal statute allows it.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
