                    "text": "So I have this problem here about generating a random integer within a specified range using the `Math.random()` function in Java. The method is called `nextIntInRange` and it takes two parameters: `low` and `high`, and it's supposed to return a random integer that's inclusive between `low` and `high`.\n\nThe problem provides four options for the expression to use in the method, and I need to figure out which one will always satisfy the postcondition, meaning it will always return a value within the specified range.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how `Math.random()` works. `Math.random()` generates a pseudorandom double-precision floating point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). So, it can return any number in the range [0, 1), where 0 is included and 1 is not.\n\nMy goal is to transform this number into an integer in the range [low, high], inclusive.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: `(int)(Math.random() * high) + low;`\n\nHere's what happens step by step:\n\n1. `Math.random()` gives a number between 0 and 1.\n\n2. Multiply by `high`: This gives a number between 0 and `high`.\n\n3. Cast to `int`: This truncates the decimal part, so I get an integer between 0 and `high-1`.\n\n4. Add `low`: So, the final range is from `low` to `high-1 + low`, which is `low` to `high-1 + low`.\n\nWait a minute, if I add `low` to `high-1`, it becomes `high-1 + low`. But I want the range to go up to `high`, not `high-1 + low`. Depending on the values of `low` and `high`, this might not cover the entire desired range.\n\nFor example, if `low` is 5 and `high` is 10, then `high-1 + low` would be 9 + 5 = 14, but since I'm starting from 5 and going up to 14, which is actually 5 to 14, but I only want 5 to 10. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: `(int)(Math.random() * (high - low)) + low;`\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. `Math.random()` gives a number between 0 and 1.\n\n2. Multiply by `(high - low)`: This gives a number between 0 and `(high - low)`.\n\n3. Cast to `int`: Truncate to an integer between 0 and `(high - low) - 1`.\n\n4. Add `low`: So, the final range is from `low` to `(high - low - 1) + low`.\n\nLet's plug in some numbers to see what happens.\n\nTake `low` = 5 and `high` = 10.\n\nThen, `(high - low) = 5`.\n\nSo, `Math.random() * 5` gives a number between 0 and 5.\n\nCast to `int`: possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nAdd `low` (5): resulting values are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nBut I want values up to 10, inclusive. So, this is missing 10.\n\nWait, `Math.random()` can generate numbers up to, but not including, 1 because it's exclusive. So, `Math.random() * 5` can be up to, but not including, 5. When you cast to `int`, you get 0 to 4, and adding 5 gives 5 to 9.\n\nBut I need to include 10. So, this option doesn't cover the entire range up to `high`.\n\nOption C: `(int)(Math.random() * (high - low + 1)) + low;`\n\nLet's analyze this:\n\n1. `Math.random()` gives a number between 0 and 1.\n\n2. Multiply by `(high - low + 1)`: This gives a number between 0 and `(high - low + 1)`.\n\n3. Cast to `int`: Truncate to an integer between 0 and `(high - low + 1) - 1`, which is 0 to `high - low`.\n\n4. Add `low`: So, the final range is from `low` to `(high - low) + low`.\n\nLet's use `low` = 5 and `high` = 10 again.\n\n`(high - low + 1) = 6`.\n\n`Math.random() * 6` gives a number between 0 and 6.\n\nCast to `int`: possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nAdd `low` (5): resulting values are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nPerfect! This gives me exactly the range I want: 5 to 10, inclusive.\n\nLet me check another example to be sure.\n\nSuppose `low` = 1 and `high` = 1.\n\nThen, `(high - low + 1) = 1`.\n\n`Math.random() * 1` gives a number between 0 and 1.\n\nCast to `int`: 0.\n\nAdd `low` (1): resulting value is 1.\n\nThis is correct; I wanted to generate 1.\n\nAnother example: `low` = -5 and `high` = -1.\n\n`(high - low + 1) = (-1) - (-5) + 1 = 5`.\n\n`Math.random() * 5` gives a number between 0 and 5.\n\nCast to `int`: possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nAdd `low` (-5): resulting values are -5, -4, -3, -2, -1.\n\nAgain, this covers the desired range from -5 to -1, inclusive.\n\nOption D: `(int)(Math.random() * (high + low)) + low;`\n\nLet's see what this does.\n\n1. `Math.random()` gives a number between 0 and 1.\n\n2. Multiply by `(high + low)`: This gives a number between 0 and `(high + low)`.\n\n3. Cast to `int`: Truncate to an integer between 0 and `(high + low) - 1`.\n\n4. Add `low`: So, the final range is from `low` to `(high + low - 1) + low`, which is `low` to `high + 2*low - 1`.\n\nThis seems off because the upper limit is `high + 2*low - 1`, which doesn't match the desired range of `low` to `high`.\n\nFor example, with `low` = 5 and `high` = 10:\n\n`(high + low) = 15`.\n\n`Math.random() * 15` gives a number between 0 and 15.\n\nCast to `int`: possible values are 0 to 14.\n\nAdd `low` (5): resulting values are 5 to 19.\n\nBut I only want values up to 10. So, this is not correct.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, option C seems to be the correct choice as it always returns a value within the desired range [low, high], inclusive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
