                    "text": "So I've got this question here about women in the labor force, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me read them one by one and see what I can find.\n\nFirst option: Most women work in agriculture. Hmm, I thought that in many developed countries, women are more involved in service sectors like education, healthcare, or finance rather than agriculture. Maybe in some developing countries, agriculture is still a significant sector for employment, but I'm not sure about \"most women\" worldwide. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption B: The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide. I thought that over the years, more women have been entering the workforce and becoming economically active. There's been a lot of talk about increasing female participation in the labor market, especially with more women getting higher education and professional jobs. So, this seems counterintuitive. Maybe not true.\n\nOption C: The percentage of women in the total labor force declined. This is similar to option B. If more women are joining the workforce, why would their percentage in the total labor force decline? Unless there's a significant increase in the male workforce, which I don't think is the case globally, this seems unlikely. Maybe not true.\n\nOption D: Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia. This is interesting. I've heard that women often carry a double burden of paid work and unpaid work like household chores and childcare. So, it makes sense that they might spend more hours working in total. But the exception here is Anglo America and Australia. I wonder why that is. Maybe in those regions, there's more equality in sharing household responsibilities, or perhaps different labor market structures.\n\nGiven that the other options seem contradictory to what I know about trends in women's participation in the labor force, option D seems the most plausible. It aligns with the idea that women often handle both paid and unpaid work, which can amount to longer working hours per day compared to men, except possibly in regions where there might be more gender equality in household responsibilities.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
