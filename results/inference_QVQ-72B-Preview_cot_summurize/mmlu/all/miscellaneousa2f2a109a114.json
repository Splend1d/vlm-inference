                    "text": "So I watched this movie called \"West Side Story,\" and it was really intense. It's like a modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet, but set in New York City in the 1950s, I think. The story revolves around two rival gangs: the Jets, who are Caucasian, and the Sharks, who are Puerto Rican. The main characters are Tony, who used to be part of the Jets, and Maria, who is the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks.\n\nThroughout the movie, there's a lot of tension between these two gangs. Tony and Maria fall in love, which is complicated because of their affiliations. There's a big rumble, or fight, between the gangs, and things go wrong. I think someone gets killed during that rumble, and then there's another tragedy later.\n\nAt the end of the film, there's a scene where Tony is killed. I remember that much, but I'm a bit fuzzy on who exactly kills him. The options are Riff, Chino, Bernardo, or that he kills himself. Let me try to recall what happened.\n\nFirst, I need to remember who these characters are:\n\n- Riff is the leader of the Jets.\n\n- Bernardo is the leader of the Sharks.\n\n- Chino is another member of the Sharks, I believe he might be Maria's fianc\u00e9 or something like that.\n\nAs for the rumble, I think Riff and Bernardo agree to fight, but somehow Tony gets involved too. I think Tony tries to stop the fight, but then Bernardo stabs Riff, and in retaliation, Tony kills Bernardo. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I have it mixed up.\n\nLet me think again. After the rumble, I recall that Tony is devastated because of the deaths, and Maria is heartbroken too. But then, there's another incident where someone else dies.\n\nWait, maybe Chino shoots Tony. I think Chino blames Tony for Bernardo's death, even though Tony didn't mean for that to happen. So, in a fit of grief and anger, Chino shoots Tony.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was Riff who killed Tony. But no, I think Riff dies in the rumble. So, if Riff is already dead, he couldn't have killed Tony later.\n\nLet me consider the sequence of events more carefully.\n\n1. The gangs agree to a rumble.\n\n2. During the rumble, Bernardo stabs Riff.\n\n3. Tony, in a fit of anger, kills Bernardo.\n\n4. After the rumble, tensions are even higher.\n\n5. Chino, who might have been engaged to Maria or something, is furious with Tony for killing Bernardo.\n\n6. Chino seeks revenge and ends up shooting Tony.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, according to this recollection, Chino is the one who kills Tony.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Maybe I'm confusing it with another version of the story.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific scenes or dialogues.\n\nI think there's a part where Tony goes to see Maria after the rumble, and they plan to run away together. But then Chino shows up, looking for Tony to exact revenge for Bernardo's death. In the ensuing confrontation, Chino shoots Tony.\n\nYes, that seems to align with my earlier thoughts. So, it was Chino who killed Tony.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility it could have been someone else.\n\nCould it have been Bernardo who killed Tony? But no, Bernardo is killed by Tony in the rumble. So, Bernardo can't have killed Tony after that.\n\nWhat about Riff? But Riff is also killed in the rumble, so he couldn't have killed Tony later on.\n\nCould Tony have killed himself? That doesn't seem likely, as the tragedy is more about him being killed by someone else, causing Maria immense sorrow.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is that Chino kills Tony at the end of the film \"West Side Story.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ Chino} \\]"
