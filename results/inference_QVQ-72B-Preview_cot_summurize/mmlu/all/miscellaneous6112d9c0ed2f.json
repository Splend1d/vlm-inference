                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Cheese is a necessary ingredient in which of these dishes? A. sushi, B. french fries, C. veal parmigiano, D. chicken pot pie.\" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one of these dishes absolutely requires cheese as an ingredient.\n\nLet me start by thinking about each dish one by one.\n\nFirst, sushi. Sushi is a Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice combined with various ingredients like fish, vegetables, and sometimes egg. There are many types of sushi, and while some may include cheese, like in sushi rolls with cream cheese, it's not a universal ingredient in all sushi. In fact, traditional sushi doesn't even use cheese. So, I don't think cheese is a necessary ingredient for sushi. Maybe it's used in some modern variations, but it's not essential.\n\nNext, french fries. French fries are basically deep-fried potato slices. The classic preparation involves cutting potatoes into strips, blanching them, and then frying them until crispy and golden brown. Cheese isn't a typical ingredient in french fries themselves. Sometimes, people might sprinkle cheese on top as a seasoning, but that's more of a personal preference than a required component of the dish. So, probably not a necessary ingredient here either.\n\nNow, veal parmigiano. This sounds familiar; it's an Italian dish, right? Yes, veal parmigiano, also known as veal parmesan, is a dish consisting of breaded veal cutlet topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, often served with parmesan cheese grated on top. Wait, does it always have cheese? Let me double-check. From what I recall, the name \"parmigiano\" refers to parmesan cheese, which suggests that cheese is a key component. Mozzarella and parmesan are both traditional ingredients in this dish. So, it seems like cheese is indeed a necessary ingredient for veal parmigiano.\n\nLastly, chicken pot pie. This is a comfort food from American or British cuisine, consisting of a filling made with chicken, vegetables like carrots and peas, and sometimes cream or gravy, all enclosed in a pastry crust. Cheese isn't a typical ingredient in chicken pot pie. It's more about the savory flavors of the chicken and vegetables, enriched with cream or gravy, and enclosed in a flaky pastry. While some recipes might include cheese in the pastry or as a topping, it's not an essential component of the dish.\n\nSo, comparing all four options, it seems that cheese is a necessary ingredient in veal parmigiano, whereas in the other dishes, it's either optional or not included at all.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there are any variations of these dishes that do include cheese. For example, in sushi, as I mentioned, some rolls contain cream cheese, but that's a modern American twist, not traditional sushi. Similarly, in french fries, you might have cheese fries where cheese is melted on top, but again, that's a variation, not the standard dish.\n\nAs for chicken pot pie, while some recipes might call for cheddar cheese in the pastry or as an addition to the filling, it's not a universal ingredient. The classic chicken pot pie doesn't require cheese.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward answer is that cheese is a necessary ingredient in veal parmigiano.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. veal parmigiano}} \\]"
