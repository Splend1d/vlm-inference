Will never change\n\nHmm, I thought I knew the answer to this, but now I'm a bit confused. Let me think carefully.\n\nI remember that Social Security is a government program that provides retirement benefits to workers who have paid into the system through taxes. The full retirement age, which is when you can receive full benefits, used to be 65. But I've heard somewhere that it's changed over the years.\n\nLet me consider option A: 62. I know that 62 is the earliest age you can start receiving Social Security benefits, but I don't think it's the full benefit amount. If you start at 62, your benefits are reduced compared to what they would be at full retirement age. So, probably, 62 is not the correct answer here.\n\nOption B: 65. This seems familiar. For a long time, 65 was the standard retirement age for full Social Security benefits. But I think that in recent years, the age has been adjusted because people are living longer now.\n\nOption C: Has been increasing. This sounds plausible. I recall that the full retirement age was gradually increased from 65 to 66, and I think it's scheduled to go up to 67 for people born after 1960.\n\nOption D: Will never change. This seems unlikely, given that life expectancies are increasing, and the Social Security system has to adjust to that.\n\nSo, between options B and C, I'm leaning towards C because I believe the full retirement age has been going up over time.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the age at which one can receive full benefits from Social Security. It's phrased in the present tense, so maybe it's asking for the current full retirement age. If that's the case, then perhaps it's 66 or 67, depending on when you were born.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"has been increasing\" is the best answer because it reflects the trend over time.\n\nLet me try to recall some specific information. I think that for people born in 1937 or earlier, the full retirement age was 65. For those born in 1938, it was 65 and 2 months, and it increases by two months for each year until reaching 66 for those born in 1943 to 1954. Then it increases gradually again until it reaches 67 for those born in 1960 or later.\n\nSo, in that case, the full retirement age isn't a fixed number anymore; it depends on the year you were born.\n\nGiven that, option C, \"has been increasing,\" seems to accurately describe the situation, as the full retirement age has been gradually increasing over the years.\n\nOption B, \"is 65,\" was true in the past but isn't the current standard for everyone.\n\nOption A, \"is 62,\" is the earliest age to receive reduced benefits, not full benefits.\n\nOption D, \"will never change,\" contradicts the reality of the gradual increase in retirement age.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Has been increasing.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that the full retirement age could stabilize or decrease in the future.\n\nI don't think the full retirement age is set to decrease; it's more likely to keep increasing as life expectancies rise. However, there are discussions about further increases in the future, but nothing definitive yet.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the best answer is C. Has been increasing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
