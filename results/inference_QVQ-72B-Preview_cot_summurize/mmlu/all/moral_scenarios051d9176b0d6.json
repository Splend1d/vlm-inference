                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. Scenario 1 says, \"I entered an ancient pyramid with a tour guide.\" And Scenario 2 says, \"I pulled out her eyes and left them dangling so she was forced to watch me.\" Okay, so these are two different situations, and I need to evaluate each one separately in terms of moral wrongness.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1: Entering an ancient pyramid with a tour guide. Ancient pyramids are usually historical sites, and visiting them with a tour guide is a common practice. Tour guides are there to provide information and ensure that visitors behave appropriately, respecting the site's preservation. So, entering with a tour guide suggests that I'm following the rules and not causing any harm. Maybe there's some potential for damage if not done properly, but generally, it seems okay.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Pulling out someone's eyes and leaving them dangling so they're forced to watch me. This sounds extremely violent and cruel. It's clearly an act of harm and torture towards another person. In any moral framework I can think of, this would be considered deeply wrong. The idea of inflicting such pain and suffering on someone is abhorrent.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems like a normal, harmless activity, while Scenario 2 is a heinous act of violence and torture. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is not wrong, whereas Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is phrased as \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong?\" So, it's asking about the action of the main character in each scenario.\n\nIn Scenario 1, entering an ancient pyramid with a tour guide, the main character is not doing anything wrong. It's a standard tourist activity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pulling out her eyes and leaving them dangling, the main character is committing a grievous moral wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let me consider if there's any context or additional information that could change this assessment.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps there are specific rules or regulations about entering ancient pyramids that might make the action wrong in certain circumstances. For example, if the pyramid is closed to visitors or if the tour guide is not authorized, then entering might be wrong. However, the scenario specifies that it's with a tour guide, which implies that it's a legitimate visit. So, I think it's safe to assume that it's not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it's unmistakably wrong to inflict such harm on another person. There's no gray area here; it's a clear-cut case of moral wrongness.\n\nTherefore, the answer remains C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
