                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle. It says that the length is twice its width, and the length of the diagonal is \\(5\\sqrt{5}\\). I need to find the area of the rectangle. The options are 2500, 2, 50, and 25. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and they bisect each other. Also, the relationship between the length, width, and the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem because the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and the width.\n\nLet's denote the width of the rectangle as \\(w\\). Since the length is twice the width, the length would be \\(2w\\). The diagonal, which is \\(5\\sqrt{5}\\), can be related to the length and width via the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nSo, the Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal is the hypotenuse, and the length and width are the other two sides.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation as:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(d = 5\\sqrt{5}\\), \\(l = 2w\\), we can substitute these into the equation:\n\n\\[\n5\\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{(2w)^2 + w^2} = \\sqrt{4w^2 + w^2} = \\sqrt{5w^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\cdot w\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(5\\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{5} \\cdot w\\). Now, I can divide both sides by \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) to solve for \\(w\\):\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{5\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} = 5\n\\]\n\nGreat, so the width is 5. Since the length is twice the width, \\(l = 2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n\nNow, to find the area of the rectangle, I multiply the length by the width:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = l \\times w = 10 \\times 5 = 50\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, 50 is one of them, which is option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I denoted width as \\(w\\) and length as \\(2w\\), which seems correct.\n\nThen, using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2} = 5\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(l = 2w\\):\n\n\\[\n5\\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{(2w)^2 + w^2} = \\sqrt{4w^2 + w^2} = \\sqrt{5w^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\cdot w\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{5\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} = 5\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(l = 2 \\times 5 = 10\\), so area is \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\).\n\nThat seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can approach the problem differently to confirm.\n\nLet me think about it again. If the length is twice the width, and the diagonal is \\(5\\sqrt{5}\\), perhaps I can set up equations based on the properties of the rectangle.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n\\[\nl = 2w \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d = 5\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n(5\\sqrt{5})^2 = (2w)^2 + w^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the squares:\n\n\\[\n25 \\times 5 = 4w^2 + w^2 \\rightarrow 125 = 5w^2\n\\]\n\nNow, solving for \\(w^2\\):\n\n\\[\nw^2 = \\frac{125}{5} = 25 \\rightarrow w = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\(w = 5\\), and \\(l = 10\\), so area is 50.\n\nAlright, this confirms my previous result.\n\nMaybe I can consider the ratios or use trigonometry, but that might be unnecessary at this point.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the properties of similar triangles or other geometric relationships, but given that this is a straightforward rectangle problem, I think the approach I've taken is sufficient and accurate.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 50, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
