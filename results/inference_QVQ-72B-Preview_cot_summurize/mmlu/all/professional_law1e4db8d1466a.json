                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about two groves, an orange grove and a grapefruit grove, that are next to each other. The citrus grower owns the orange grove and has some rights to cross the grapefruit grove, which is owned by a farmer. The question is asking how to best describe the citrus grower's property interest in that right of way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a right of way is. A right of way is a type of easement that gives someone the right to pass over someone else's land for a specific purpose. So, in this case, the citrus grower has been granted the right to cross the grapefruit grove on foot, by bicycle, or by automobile.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA. license\n\nB. easement in gross\n\nC. easement appurtenant\n\nD. prescriptive easement\n\nI need to figure out which one of these best describes the citrus grower's property interest.\n\nLet's start by eliminating the ones that don't fit.\n\nFirst, a license is generally a revocable permission to use land, but it's not a property interest. It's more of a personal privilege that can be taken away at any time. Since the citrus grower has a written agreement granting this right, it seems more permanent than a license, which is usually informal and revocable.\n\nNext, a prescriptive easement is one that's acquired through long-term, open, and continuous use without the owner's permission. But in this scenario, the citrus grower has a written agreement granting him the right of way, so it's not a prescriptive easement, which is based on use without permission.\n\nSo now, it's between an easement in gross and an easement appurtenant.\n\nAn easement appurtenant is one that benefits a particular piece of land, and it's attached to the land, passing with it if the land is sold. It's typically for the benefit of one landowner over another.\n\nAn easement in gross, on the other hand, is a personal easement that benefits an individual or entity rather than a particular piece of land. It's not attached to any land and doesn't pass with the land if sold.\n\nIn this scenario, the citrus grower owns the orange grove and has a right of way across the grapefruit grove. The right of way is likely for the benefit of the orange grove, perhaps to access it more easily or to connect it to other parts.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the easement is appurtenant to the orange grove. It's for the benefit of the orange grove, not just for the personal benefit of the citrus grower.\n\nBut wait, the citrus grower maintains both his dwelling house and his business on the orange grove. So, the right of way is probably for the benefit of the property, allowing access to and from the property.\n\nMoreover, the agreement is in writing, which suggests it's a formal easement, likely appurtenant to the orange grove.\n\nBut let's double-check. If it were an easement in gross, it would be more personal to the citrus grower, not necessarily attached to the orange grove.\n\nHowever, if the easement is appurtenant, it's attached to the orange grove, and if the orange grove is sold, the easement would pass to the new owner.\n\nGiven that the citrus grower has a fee simple ownership of the orange grove and has a right of way for crossing the grapefruit grove, it makes sense that the easement is appurtenant to the orange grove.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he lives and operates his business there suggests that the easement is for the benefit of the property, not just for his personal use.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the citrus grower's property interest in the right of way across the grapefruit grove is an easement appurtenant.\n\nI think the answer is C. easement appurtenant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
