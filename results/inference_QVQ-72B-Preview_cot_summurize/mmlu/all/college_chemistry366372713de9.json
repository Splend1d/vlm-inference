                    "text": "So I have this question here about paramagnetic quenchers, and it's asking which metal ion cannot be used as one. The options are Ti\u00b3\u207a, Cr\u00b3\u207a, Fe\u00b3\u207a, and Zn\u00b2\u207a. I need to figure out which one of these isn't paramagnetic.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a paramagnetic quencher is. From what I recall, paramagnetic substances have unpaired electrons, which means their electron spins aren't all paired up. This leads them to be attracted to magnetic fields. So, a paramagnetic quencher would be something that, due to its unpaired electrons, can interact with and quench certain excited states in materials, maybe in fluorescence or phosphorescence processes.\n\nSo, to answer this question, I need to determine which of these metal ions has no unpaired electrons, meaning it would be diamagnetic and thus not paramagnetic.\n\nLet me recall the electronic configurations of these ions.\n\nStarting with Ti\u00b3\u207a:\n\nTitanium has an atomic number of 22, so its electronic configuration is 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 3d\u00b9.\n\nWhen it forms Ti\u00b3\u207a, it loses three electrons, likely the 4s\u00b2 and one of the 3d electrons, so the configuration should be 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 3d\u2070. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Actually, the electron configuration of Ti\u00b3\u207a is 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 3d\u2070. Wait, but I think I'm mistaken. Let's double-check.\n\nThe neutral titanium atom has the configuration [Ar] 3d\u00b2 4s\u00b2. When it forms Ti\u00b3\u207a, it likely loses the two 4s electrons and one 3d electron, resulting in [Ar] 3d\u00b9. So, that should have one unpaired electron, making it paramagnetic.\n\nOkay, so Ti\u00b3\u207a has one unpaired electron.\n\nNext, Cr\u00b3\u207a:\n\nChromium has an atomic number of 24, and its electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d\u2075 4s\u00b9. But when it forms Cr\u00b3\u207a, it loses three electrons, probably the 4s\u00b9 and two 3d electrons, resulting in [Ar] 3d\u00b3. Now, 3d\u00b3 has three unpaired electrons, I believe, due to Hund's rule, which states that electrons fill orbitals singly before pairing up. So, Cr\u00b3\u207a should be paramagnetic with three unpaired electrons.\n\nFe\u00b3\u207a:\n\nIron has an atomic number of 26, and its electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d\u2076 4s\u00b2. When it forms Fe\u00b3\u207a, it loses the two 4s electrons and one 3d electron, resulting in [Ar] 3d\u2075. The 3d\u2075 configuration has five unpaired electrons, again following Hund's rule. So, Fe\u00b3\u207a is paramagnetic.\n\nZn\u00b2\u207a:\n\nZinc has an atomic number of 30, and its electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070 4s\u00b2. When it forms Zn\u00b2\u207a, it loses the two 4s electrons, resulting in [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070. Now, 3d\u00b9\u2070 has all orbitals filled and paired, meaning no unpaired electrons. Therefore, Zn\u00b2\u207a is diamagnetic, not paramagnetic.\n\nSo, based on this, Zn\u00b2\u207a is the metal ion that cannot be used as a paramagnetic quencher because it has no unpaired electrons.\n\nI think the answer is D. Zn\u00b2\u207a.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check the electronic configurations.\n\nTi\u00b3\u207a: [Ar] 3d\u00b9 \u2192 one unpaired electron.\n\nCr\u00b3\u207a: [Ar] 3d\u00b3 \u2192 three unpaired electrons.\n\nFe\u00b3\u207a: [Ar] 3d\u2075 \u2192 five unpaired electrons.\n\nZn\u00b2\u207a: [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 no unpaired electrons.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Zn\u00b2\u207a.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
