                    "text": "So I have this question here about group behavior, and it's asking which term describes the phenomenon where like-minded groups take more extreme positions than the individuals that make up the group. The options are social facilitation, deindividuation, groupthink, and group polarization. I need to figure out which one fits this description.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. Starting with social facilitation, I think it's about how the presence of others can improve an individual's performance on tasks. Like, if you're doing something you're good at, having an audience might make you do it better. But that doesn't sound like groups taking more extreme positions. So, maybe not A.\n\nNext is deindividuation. I recall that this is when people in a group lose their sense of individual identity and might do things they wouldn't do alone, sometimes behaving more impulsively or aggressively. It's like when people in a crowd start acting differently because they feel anonymous. That doesn't seem to match the description of groups taking more extreme positions based on their shared views. So, probably not B.\n\nNow, groupthink. I've heard of this before. It's when a group makes decisions without critically evaluating all the options because there's too much cohesion and pressure to conform. It can lead to poor decision-making because dissenting opinions are suppressed. While this involves groups making decisions that might not be the best, it's not specifically about taking more extreme positions based on the group's existing views. It's more about consensus and avoiding conflict. So, maybe not C.\n\nThat leaves group polarization. I think this is when a group's prevailing opinions become stronger or more extreme after discussion. So, if a group is already inclined towards a certain view, discussing it among themselves can make that view even more extreme. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing\u2014like-minded groups taking more extreme positions than the individuals themselves.\n\nTo make sure, let me double-check. The question says \"like-minded groups taking more extreme positions than the individuals that comprise the group.\" So, it's about groups becoming more extreme in their positions after discussion or interaction, and group polarization seems to fit this description.\n\nSocial facilitation is more about individual performance in the presence of others, deindividuation is about loss of individual identity in groups, and groupthink is about decision-making processes in highly cohesive groups. None of these directly describe the phenomenon of groups becoming more extreme in their positions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. group polarization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
