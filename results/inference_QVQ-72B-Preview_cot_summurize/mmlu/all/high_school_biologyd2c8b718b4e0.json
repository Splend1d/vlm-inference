                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about genetics. It says that on average, 46% of the loci in a species' gene pool are heterozygous, and it wants to know what the average homozygosity should be. The options are 23%, 46%, 54%, and 92%. Hmm, I need to recall some basic genetics concepts here.\n\nI remember that in genetics, a locus (plural loci) is a specific position on a chromosome where a gene is located. So, loci are like addresses for genes on chromosomes. Now, heterozygous refers to a condition where an individual has two different alleles for a particular gene. For example, if a gene has two alleles, say A and a, being heterozygous would mean having one A and one a allele.\n\nConversely, homozygous refers to having two identical alleles for a particular gene. So, if an individual has either two A's or two a's, they are homozygous for that gene.\n\nThe question is giving me the percentage of loci that are heterozygous, which is 46%, and asking for the average homozygosity. Homozygosity would be the percentage of loci that are homozygous.\n\nI think of heterozygosity and homozygosity as complementary concepts. That is, if I know one, I can find the other by subtracting from 100%. So, if heterozygosity is 46%, then homozygosity should be 100% - 46% = 54%.\n\nLet me double-check that. In a diploid organism, each locus has two alleles. If 46% of the loci are heterozygous, that means that at those loci, the two alleles are different. Therefore, the remaining percentage should be homozygous, where the two alleles are the same.\n\nSo, yes, homozygosity should be 100% - 46% = 54%.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Maybe I should think about the Hardy-Weinberg principle. That's a fundamental concept in population genetics that relates allele frequencies to genotype frequencies.\n\nAccording to Hardy-Weinberg, in a large, randomly mating population that is not evolving, the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remain constant from generation to generation. The formula is:\n\np\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nWhere:\n\n- p\u00b2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype\n\n- 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype\n\n- q\u00b2 is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype\n\n- p is the frequency of the dominant allele\n\n- q is the frequency of the recessive allele\n\n- p + q = 1\n\nIn this question, we're given the average heterozygosity, which is 46%, so 2pq = 46%.\n\nIf 2pq = 46%, then the total homozygosity would be p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 100% - 46% = 54%, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe calculating p and q first.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for p and q.\n\nGiven 2pq = 46%, then p + q = 1.\n\nWe can solve these equations to find p and q.\n\nFrom 2pq = 46%, pq = 23%.\n\nNow, p + q = 1.\n\nLet\u2019s set up the equation:\n\np(1 - p) = 23%\n\nSo, p - p\u00b2 = 23%\n\nRearranged: p\u00b2 - p + 23% = 0\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's correct that.\n\nActually, p(1 - p) = 23%, so p - p\u00b2 = 23%.\n\nThen, p\u00b2 - p + 23% = 0.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the quadratic equation would be p\u00b2 - p + 0.23 = 0.\n\nBut solving this quadratic equation:\n\np\u00b2 - p + 0.23 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\np = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 - 0.92)] / 2\n\n\u221a(0.08) \u2248 0.2828\n\nSo, p = [1 + 0.2828]/2 \u2248 1.2828/2 \u2248 0.6414\n\nOr p = [1 - 0.2828]/2 \u2248 0.7172/2 \u2248 0.3586\n\nSo, p \u2248 0.6414 or p \u2248 0.3586\n\nThen q = 1 - p, so q \u2248 0.3586 or q \u2248 0.6414\n\nNow, homozygosity is p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate both:\n\nIf p \u2248 0.6414, then q \u2248 0.3586\n\nHomozygosity = (0.6414)\u00b2 + (0.3586)\u00b2 \u2248 0.411 + 0.128 \u2248 0.539 or 53.9%\n\nSimilarly, if p \u2248 0.3586, q \u2248 0.6414\n\nHomozygosity = (0.3586)\u00b2 + (0.6414)\u00b2 \u2248 0.128 + 0.411 \u2248 0.539 or 53.9%\n\nSo, again, homozygosity is approximately 54%, which aligns with my initial calculation.\n\nWait, but one of the options is 54%, which is C, and another is 92%, which might be 2 times 46%, but that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could think that homozygosity is twice the heterozygosity or something, but that doesn't make sense genetically.\n\nNo, I think the straightforward approach is correct. Heterozygosity and homozygosity are complementary, so homozygosity = 100% - heterozygosity.\n\nTherefore, if heterozygosity is 46%, homozygosity is 54%.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 54%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
