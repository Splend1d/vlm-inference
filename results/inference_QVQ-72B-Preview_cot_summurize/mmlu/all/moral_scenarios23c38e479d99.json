                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. Scenario 1 says, \"I engineered the bridge to stand up to a hurricane.\" So, someone designed a bridge to withstand a hurricane. That sounds like a good thing, right? Engineers are supposed to build structures that can handle natural disasters for public safety. So, at face value, this doesn't seem morally wrong. But maybe there's more to it? Perhaps there are some ethical considerations I'm missing here.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I was cheering during the game.\" This seems straightforward. Cheering during a game is a common and expected behavior, especially in sports events. It's a way to support your team and create a lively atmosphere. Again, at first blush, this doesn't appear to be morally wrong. But maybe there are context-specific factors that could change this perception. For example, if the cheering was disrespectful to the opposing team or if it involved some form of harassment, that could be considered morally wrong. However, the scenario doesn't provide any such details, so I should assume that the cheering was in good spirit.\n\nNow, considering both scenarios, I need to decide whether either of them is morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let me think about what those standards might be. In general, moral wrongs involve actions that harm others, violate ethical principles, or break societal norms in a significant way.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1, engineering a bridge to withstand a hurricane seems like a responsible and ethical action. It's part of ensuring public safety and infrastructure resilience. Unless there's some negligence or corruption involved, which isn't indicated here, it's hard to see how this would be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cheering during a game is a normal and acceptable behavior. It's part of the cultural fabric of sports and events, and unless the cheering is malicious or discriminatory, which isn't suggested here, it shouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios seem to be \"Not wrong\" from a moral standpoint. Therefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For instance, perhaps in certain contexts, engineering a bridge to withstand hurricanes could be considered morally wrong if it's at the expense of other necessary public services or if it's done with improper materials, but again, the scenario doesn't provide any information to suggest that.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, cheering is generally acceptable, but if the cheering was excessive and disruptive, it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, without specific details indicating that, it's reasonable to assume that cheering is an acceptable behavior in this context.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I conclude that neither scenario describes an action that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
