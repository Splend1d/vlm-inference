                    "text": "So I have this problem here about titrations. There's a student who did five titrations and got a mean result of 0.110 M, and the standard deviation is 0.001 M. The actual concentration is supposed to be 0.100 M. And I need to figure out which statement is true about the titration results: accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, both accurate and precise, or neither accurate nor precise.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what accuracy and precision mean in this context. Accuracy refers to how close the measured values are to the true or actual value. Precision, on the other hand, refers to how close the measured values are to each other.\n\nSo, if the measurements are close to each other but far from the actual value, they're precise but not accurate. If they're close to the actual value but spread out, they're accurate but not precise. If both are close to each other and to the actual value, they're both accurate and precise. And if they're spread out and far from the actual value, they're neither accurate nor precise.\n\nGiven that, I need to look at the mean result and compare it to the actual value to assess accuracy, and look at the standard deviation to assess precision.\n\nThe mean result is 0.110 M, and the actual concentration is 0.100 M. So, the mean is different from the actual value. That suggests that the measurements are not accurate because they're not close to the true value.\n\nNow, the standard deviation is 0.001 M. Standard deviation measures the spread of the data points around the mean. A low standard deviation means that the data points are close to the mean, indicating high precision.\n\nSo, with a standard deviation of 0.001 M, which is quite low, it seems that the measurements are precise because they're consistently close to each other.\n\nTherefore, the measurements are precise but not accurate.\n\nLet me double-check that. The mean is 0.110 M, which is different from the actual 0.100 M, so not accurate. But the standard deviation is low, meaning the individual measurements are close to the mean, so precise.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. Precise but not accurate.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
