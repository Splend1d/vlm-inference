                    "text": "Alright, I've got this passage from Mikhail Gorbachev's book \"Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World\" from 1987. He's talking about perestroika, which means \"restructuring,\" and why it's necessary for the Soviet Union at that time. Let me try to understand what he's saying here.\n\nSo, he starts by saying that perestroika is an urgent necessity arising from profound processes of development in our socialist society. That means that there are deep changes happening in the society, and because of these changes, restructuring is urgently needed. It's not something optional; it's a must-do thing.\n\nThen he says, \"This society is ripe for change. It has long been yearning for it.\" So, the people have been wanting change for a while now. It's not like this is a new desire; it's been building up over time. Any delay in starting perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future. \"Exacerbated\" means making a bad situation worse. So, if they don't start restructuring, things could get a lot worse soon.\n\nHe goes on to say that this potential worsening could lead to serious social, economic, and political crises. So, not only could there be problems within the country, but these could affect different aspects of life\u2014society, the economy, and politics. And he puts it bluntly: not doing perestroika could bring about crises that are serious.\n\nNow, the question is asking what one can infer from this passage about Gorbachev's argument regarding the need for perestroika. The options are:\n\nA. the need for perestroika had come upon Soviet society suddenly\n\nB. the need for perestroika had been exaggerated\n\nC. the need for perestroika was long in the making\n\nD. the time for perestroika had passed\n\nLet me look back at the passage to see which one fits.\n\nHe says that the society has long been yearning for change, which suggests that the desire for perestroika has been building up over time. It's not something that just appeared suddenly. So, option A seems incorrect because it says the need came upon suddenly, but Gorbachev says it's been a long-time coming.\n\nOption B says the need had been exaggerated. But in the passage, Gorbachev is emphasizing that perestroika is urgently needed and that delaying it could lead to serious crises. So, he's actually downplaying any exaggeration and stressing its importance. Maybe I need to think differently about this option.\n\nWait, no. He's saying that perestroika is urgently needed and that delaying it could lead to crises. That sounds like he's emphasizing its necessity, not downplaying it. So, option B seems incorrect because he's saying the need is real and pressing, not exaggerated.\n\nOption C says the need for perestroika was long in the making. This aligns with what he says about the society having long yearned for change. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says the time for perestroika had passed. But Gorbachev is saying that perestroika is urgently needed and that delaying it could lead to serious problems. So, he's arguing that the time for perestroika is now, not that it's too late.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to be the correct inference: the need for perestroika was long in the making.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nHe says that perestroika is an urgent necessity arising from profound processes of development in our socialist society. These processes are deep and significant, suggesting that they've been developing over time, not suddenly.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"it has long been yearning for it\" indicates that the desire for change isn't new but has been present for a while.\n\nSo, based on this, it's reasonable to infer that Gorbachev believed the need for perestroika was the result of long-term developments and desires within Soviet society.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. the need for perestroika was long in the making.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
