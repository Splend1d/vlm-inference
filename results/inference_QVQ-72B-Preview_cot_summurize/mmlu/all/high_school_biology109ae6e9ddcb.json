                    "text": "So I have this question about where glucose is mainly reabsorbed in the kidney. The options are the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, or collecting duct. I need to pick the primary site. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that glucose reabsorption happens in the kidneys, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact location. Let me recall what each part of the nephron does.\n\nStarting with the glomerulus, that's where filtration occurs. Blood is filtered, and things like glucose, water, and small molecules pass into the Bowman's capsule to become part of the urine. But reabsorption happens after filtration, right?\n\nSo, after the glomerulus, the fluid passes into the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). I think this is where a lot of reabsorption takes place. Glucose is reabsorbed here, isn't it? Let me think.\n\nI remember something about the proximal tubule being important for reabsorbing glucose. There are transporters there that move glucose back into the blood from the filtrate. What are they called? Glut transporters? No, wait, that's for glucose transport across cell membranes in general. I think the specific ones in the kidney are SGLT1 and SGLT2. Yeah, sodium-glucose cotransporters.\n\nSo, SGLT2 is primarily expressed in the proximal convoluted tubule, and it's responsible for reabsorbing most of the filtered glucose. Like, about 90% of the glucose is reabsorbed here. Is that right?\n\nLet me double-check. If the proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs the majority of glucose, then option B would be the answer. But just to be sure, what about the loop of Henle and the collecting duct?\n\nThe loop of Henle is involved in creating the osmotic gradient in the kidney, which helps in concentrating the urine. It's mainly about water reabsorption and solute transport. I don't recall any significant glucose reabsorption happening here. Maybe a small amount, but not the primary site.\n\nThen there's the collecting duct. This is where fine-tuning of water reabsorption occurs, regulated by hormones like ADH. Again, glucose reabsorption isn't a major function here. I think any remaining glucose that wasn't reabsorbed in the proximal tubule might be reabsorbed here, but it's a much smaller amount.\n\nSo, based on this, the proximal convoluted tubule seems to be the main place where glucose is reabsorbed. But just to make sure, maybe I should look up a textbook or a reliable source to confirm.\n\nWait, I don't have a textbook right now, but I can try to recall some key points. I know that in healthy people, almost all filtered glucose is reabsorbed, and only when blood sugar levels are very high does some glucose spill over into the urine. This is called glycosuria. The threshold for glucose reabsorption is around 180 mg/dL of blood glucose.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the proximal tubule handles the majority of glucose reabsorption, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the glomerulus again. No, filtration is just the process of separating blood components based on size and charge. Glucose, being small, is freely filtered, but reabsorption happens downstream in the tubules.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the primary site of glucose reabsorption is the proximal convoluted tubule. Therefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
