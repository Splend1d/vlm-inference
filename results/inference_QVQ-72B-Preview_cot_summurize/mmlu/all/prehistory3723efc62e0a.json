                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about ancient South American civilizations, and it's asking which of these they didn't develop: monumental works, irrigation technology, a written language, or significant armies. Hmm, I need to recall what I know about these civilizations.\n\nFirst off, I know that ancient South America had several prominent cultures, like the Inca, Maya, and Aztec, right? Wait, actually, the Maya were more in Central America and Mexico, and the Aztec were in Mexico too. The Inca were definitely in South America, in what's now Peru and other nearby countries. But I think there were other civilizations in South America as well, like the Moche or the Nazca culture.\n\nOkay, so the question is general, referring to none of the civilizations in ancient South America developing one of these things. That means I need to consider all the major civilizations in that region and time period.\n\nLet me think about monumental works. The Inca are famous for Machu Picchu, which is a massive stone citadel in the Andes Mountains. That's definitely a monumental work. And the Nazca lines, those giant geoglyphs in the desert, are also considered monumental works, though they're more earthworks than buildings. So, it seems like monumental works were developed in ancient South America.\n\nNext, irrigation technology. The Inca and other Andean civilizations were known for their sophisticated irrigation systems, like the aqueducts and terraced fields that helped them farm in the mountains. The Nasca culture also had complex irrigation canals. So, irrigation technology was definitely developed there.\n\nNow, a written language. This is a tricky one. I know that the Inca had a system called quipu, which used knots in strings to record information. But was quipu a written language? I think it was more of a numerical and administrative recording system rather than a fully developed writing system used for literature or historical records. As for the Maya, they had a fully developed writing system, but they were in Central America and Mexico, not South America. The Nazca culture had some pictographic symbols, but I don't think they had a fully developed written language either.\n\nSo, compared to other civilizations that had fully developed writing systems like the Egyptians with hieroglyphics or the Sumerians with cuneiform, ancient South American civilizations seem to lack a fully developed written language.\n\nLastly, significant armies. The Inca had a large and well-organized army that allowed them to build their extensive empire. Other civilizations in the region also had armies, though perhaps not as large or organized as the Inca's. So, significant armies were developed in ancient South America.\n\nBased on this, it seems that the one thing none of the ancient South American civilizations developed was a fully developed written language.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check. Maybe there were other writing systems that I don't know about. For example, the Olmec civilization in Mexico had some inscriptions, but again, they were in Central America and Mexico, not South America. What about the Moche civilization in Peru? They were known for their detailed pottery depicting various scenes, but I don't think they had a fully developed writing system.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that perhaps written languages did exist in ancient South America, but the evidence hasn't survived, or they haven't been discovered yet. But based on current archaeological knowledge, it appears that fully developed writing systems were not prevalent in ancient South America.\n\nSo, to answer the question: none of the civilizations of ancient South America appear to have developed a written language.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. a written language}} \\]"
