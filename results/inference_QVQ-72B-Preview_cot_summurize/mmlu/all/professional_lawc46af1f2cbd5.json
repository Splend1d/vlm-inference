                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal conundrum. So, back in 1996, an investor bought a 100-acre tract in a northern county and divided it into 100 one-acre residential lots. The subdivision plan was recorded in 1997, and over the next few years, all these lots were sold to individual buyers. Each deed had a restriction stating that the lots could only be used for residential purposes. Fast-forward to 2009, and the area around the subdivision was rezoned for commercial and business uses. Now, one of the lot owners wants to open a small beauty parlor in her home's basement. The homeowners are trying to stop this, citing the residential-only restriction in the deeds. The question is, what will the court likely decide?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key elements here. There's a recorded subdivision plan with specific restrictions in the deeds that say the lots are for residential use only. These restrictions are part of each deed, so they're likely covenant, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) that bind each owner.\n\nNow, in 2009, the surrounding area was rezoned for commercial and business uses. Rezoning is a change in land use regulations by the local government, allowing different types of development in that area. However, rezoning typically affects the property it's applied to, not necessarily private restrictions like deed covenants.\n\nThe lot owner wants to open a beauty parlor in her home, which seems like a commercial activity, but it's in her basement. The restriction says \"no lot shall be used except for residential purposes.\" So, the question is whether operating a beauty parlor in the home violates this restriction.\n\nOption A says the residency restriction is no longer enforceable because of the change in the character of the neighborhood surrounding the development. But, generally, changes in the neighborhood don't automatically invalidate deed restrictions. These restrictions are private agreements between property owners and are binding unless they violate some law or public policy.\n\nOption B says the restriction is no longer enforceable because the area surrounding the development was rezoned for commercial use. Rezoning is about land use regulations imposed by the government, whereas deed restrictions are private agreements. Typically, rezoning doesn't nullify deed restrictions. The two are separate: you can have a property that's zoned for commercial use but still bound by deed restrictions that limit its use to residential purposes.\n\nOption C says the residency restriction is enforceable, thus preventing any commercial use. This seems straightforward. If the deeds clearly state that the lots are for residential use only, and operating a beauty parlor is a commercial use, then it violates the restriction. But, I need to consider if there's any exception or if the restriction allows for certain types of uses.\n\nOption D suggests that operating a beauty parlor wouldn't violate the residency restriction. Hmm, that seems unlikely at first glance because it's a commercial activity. But maybe there's a nuance here. Perhaps the restriction allows for some commercial activities within a home, like home offices or small businesses, as long as they don't change the residential character of the property.\n\nI need to look closer at the language of the restriction. It says, \"no lot shall be used except for residential purposes.\" That seems pretty clear: only residential use is permitted. Operating a beauty parlor is typically considered a commercial activity, so it would violate this restriction.\n\nBut maybe there's case law that interprets such restrictions to allow for certain home-based businesses under certain conditions. For example, if the business is incidental to the residential use, doesn't generate excessive traffic, or doesn't change the character of the neighborhood.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the surrounding area has been rezoned for commercial and business uses, which might make the court consider whether the original restriction is still enforceable or if the changed circumstances render it unenforceable.\n\nBut, generally, deed restrictions are enforceable unless they're illegal or against public policy. Rezoning alone doesn't make the restriction unenforceable. The restriction was part of the original agreement when the lots were sold, and each subsequent owner is bound by it.\n\nMoreover, just because the surrounding area is now zoned for commercial use doesn't mean that the restrictions on this particular subdivision are invalid. The homeowners association or the original restrictor could still enforce the restrictions.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, such restrictions run with the land and are enforceable by the homeowners association or other lot owners. So, if one owner violates the restriction, the others can sue to enforce it.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most straightforward: the restriction is enforceable, and operating a beauty parlor would violate it.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any exception that might apply. For instance, perhaps the restriction allows for home-based businesses under certain conditions. However, the language provided is quite clear: \"no lot shall be used except for residential purposes.\" There's no exception mentioned for home-based businesses.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the surrounding area was rezoned for commercial and business uses might make the court consider whether the restriction is still reasonable. If the entire neighborhood is shifting towards commercial use, maybe continuing to enforce a residential-only restriction would be unfair or no longer in line with the area's character.\n\nHowever, generally, courts tend to enforce clear deed restrictions unless there's a compelling reason not to. The change in zoning might be a factor, but it's not necessarily determinative.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the restriction serves a legitimate purpose. If the restriction was intended to maintain the area as a residential enclave, and the surrounding area is now commercial, perhaps the restriction no longer serves its original purpose.\n\nBut again, that might not be enough to invalidate the restriction. The original agreement was clear, and subsequent owners agreed to it when they purchased their lots.\n\nPerhaps the court would balance the interests of the individual lot owner who wants to operate a beauty parlor against the interests of the other homeowners who want to maintain the residential character of the neighborhood.\n\nIn such cases, courts often look at the specific language of the restriction, the intent behind it, and whether enforcing it would serve the community's best interests.\n\nGiven that, I think the most likely outcome is that the court will enforce the restriction and prevent the commercial use of the lot. Therefore, option C seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any precedent or legal principle that might lead the court to decide otherwise.\n\nFor example, in some cases, courts have held that restrictions are unenforceable if the character of the neighborhood has significantly changed, making the restriction obsolete. However, this is typically a high bar to meet, and the restriction would still be enforceable unless the changes are fundamental.\n\nIn this case, the surrounding area was rezoned for commercial and business uses, but the subdivision itself remains under the original restrictions. So, it's possible that the restriction is still valid and enforceable within the subdivision.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the lot owner wants to operate a beauty parlor in her home might be seen as a violation of the residential-only restriction, as it's clearly a commercial activity.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option C: the residency restriction is enforceable, thus preventing any commercial use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
