                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"What is the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the United States who reported being in a physical fight at school, one or more times during the past 12 months as of 2015?\" And there are four options to choose from: A. 15%, B. 35%, C. 55%, D. 75%.\n\nHmm, okay, first things first, I need to find out the exact percentage or at least the range where it falls into. The question is specifically about children aged 13-15 in the United States and it's about physical fights at school over the past 12 months as of 2015.\n\nI remember that there are various organizations that collect data on youth violence and school safety, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and other government agencies. So, I should probably look into reports or surveys conducted by these organizations around 2015.\n\nLet me think about the data sources. One of the prominent surveys is the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) by the CDC, which monitors priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults, including violence. This survey is conducted every two years, and I believe the 2015 data is available.\n\nI should check the YRBSS website or look for the 2015 YRBSS report. Specifically, I need to find the percentage of students in the age group 13-15 who reported being in a physical fight on school property during the 12 months preceding the survey.\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure about the age group. YRBSS typically surveys students in grades 9 through 12, but the question specifies ages 13-15, which would include students in grades 7 through 10, approximately. So, I need to see if the data is available for that specific age group.\n\nMaybe I should look for the YRBSS national report from 2015 and see if it breaks down the data by age or grade. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different survey that focuses on middle school students or specifically on ages 13-15.\n\nAnother resource could be the Indicators of School Crime and Safety report, which is a joint publication by the NCES and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. This report provides comprehensive data on crime and safety in U.S. schools, including physical fights.\n\nI should also consider whether the data is for public schools only or includes private schools as well. The question doesn't specify, so I might need to look for data that covers all schools unless specified otherwise.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've come across any specific percentages before. I seem to remember that in the early 2000s, the percentage of students involved in physical fights was higher, maybe around 30-40%, but I'm not sure about the exact figures or whether that's for the same age group and time frame.\n\nGiven that the question is as of 2015, I need to find the most recent data available around that year. If the survey was conducted in 2015, the data would reflect the situations from the previous 12 months.\n\nPerhaps I should search for \"YRBSS 2015 physical fights school\" or something similar to find the exact statistic.\n\nAlternatively, I could look up the CDC's website and navigate to the YRBSS section, then find the 2015 national report or data tables.\n\nOnce I find the data, I need to make sure I'm looking at the correct age group or grade level. Since the question specifies ages 13-15, which would typically include grades 7, 8, and part of 9 or 10, depending on the school system, I should look for data that includes these grades.\n\nIf the data is only available for higher grades, I might need to make an educated guess based on that information.\n\nAssuming I find the relevant data, I can then match it to one of the provided options: 15%, 35%, 55%, or 75%.\n\nLet me consider what percentage ranges these options represent. 15% is relatively low, meaning only one in about seven students were in a physical fight. 35% is higher, about one in three, 55% is more than half, and 75% is three out of four students.\n\nGiven the trends in school safety over the years, I would think that efforts to reduce violence in schools have been somewhat effective, so the percentage might be lower than some might expect.\n\nBut, again, I need to rely on the actual data rather than assumptions.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can look at multiple sources to cross-verify the information. If multiple reputable sources point to a similar percentage, that would give me more confidence in my answer.\n\nI should also consider whether the data is national or if it varies significantly by state or region. The question asks for the United States as a whole, so I need national statistics rather than state-specific data.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that the data is from 2015 or as close as possible to that year. If the survey was conducted in 2015, it would cover the 12 months preceding that, so approximately from 2014 to 2015.\n\nI should also pay attention to how \"physical fight\" is defined in the survey. For example, does it include verbal altercations or only those that resulted in injury? The question specifies \"physical\" fight, so likely it's referring to actual physical altercations, not just verbal arguments.\n\nMoreover, the location is specified as \"at school,\" which probably includes both inside school buildings and on school grounds during school hours.\n\nNow, let's suppose I find the relevant data and it shows that, for example, 35% of students aged 13-15 reported being in a physical fight at school one or more times in the past 12 months as of 2015. That would make option B the correct answer.\n\nBut I need to confirm this with actual data. Maybe I can recall that in recent years, the percentage has been decreasing, so perhaps it's closer to 15% or 20%. However, without concrete data, I shouldn't assume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the context. With increased focus on anti-bullying programs and conflict resolution in schools, the percentage might be on the lower side, say around 15% to 25%.\n\nOn the other hand, considering that some areas may still struggle with higher rates of violence, it's possible that the percentage is higher, around 35% or even 55%.\n\nTo avoid speculation, I should really look up the data.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I can look at the trends over time. For example, if I find data from previous years, I can see if there's a pattern or a direction in which the percentage is moving.\n\nFor instance, if in 2005, the percentage was 40%, and in 2015, it decreased to 20%, then I could conclude that efforts are paying off. But again, without actual data, this is just hypothetical.\n\nWait, maybe I can recall that according to some reports, the percentage of students involved in physical fights has been decreasing over the years. If that's the case, then perhaps the percentage in 2015 was around 20% to 25%, which would lean towards option B, 35%, but that seems higher than what I'm thinking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm underestimating the prevalence of physical fights in schools.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Suppose I look at the YRBSS data for grade 9 students, who would be around 14-15 years old, and grade 8 students, around 13-14 years old. If I can find data for these grades, I can combine them to get an idea for the 13-15 age group.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too involved for a multiple-choice question. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nPerhaps I can look for summary reports or key findings from the YRBSS 2015 that highlight the percentage of students in physical fights at school.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for state-specific data and see if there's a national average provided.\n\nWait, I recall that the YRBSS provides both national and state-level data. So, if I can access the national report from 2015, that should give me the information I need.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've seen any infographics or quick stats from the CDC around that time that mention the percentage of students in physical fights.\n\nIf I can't find the exact percentage, maybe I can look for related data, such as the percentage of students who reported being in a fight on school property during the past 12 months, regardless of age, and see if that gives me a clue.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies ages 13-15, I need to be as precise as possible.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can look at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data on school safety. They often publish reports on crime and safety in schools, which include statistics on physical fights.\n\nIf I can find the Indicators of School Crime and Safety report from around 2015, that might provide the necessary data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for academic journals or research studies that have analyzed youth violence trends around 2015, but those might not be as up-to-date or specific to the question.\n\nTime is ticking, and I need to make a decision. Maybe I should go with my initial gut feeling.\n\nI think that 35% (option B) is a plausible percentage based on what I've heard about youth violence trends in the past. So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
