                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a woman who owns a four-unit apartment building and lives in one of them. She's renting out another unit and puts an ad in the local paper that says, \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred.\" Now, she has her reasons for this preference: she wants a mix of tenants from different genders and racial backgrounds. Currently, one unit is rented to an African American man and another to a Pacific Islander woman. She lives in one herself. So, the question is, based on these facts, which statement is true regarding the federal Fair Housing Act?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Fair Housing Act is all about. I know that it's a federal law in the United States that prohibits discrimination in housing based on certain protected characteristics. These include race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. So, right off the bat, I can see that race and gender are protected under this act.\n\nOption A says that the federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender. That sounds straightforward. The act does prohibit discrimination based on these characteristics. So, if she refuses to rent to someone because of their race or gender, that would be against the law.\n\nBut wait, the woman's intention is to have a diverse mix of tenants. She's not necessarily refusing to rent to anyone based on race or gender, but she's expressing a preference for a white male in the ad. Does that make a difference?\n\nOption B says that her motive absolves her from any liability under the Fair Housing Act. Well, intentions might be considered in some legal contexts, but I don't think that's the case here. The act is pretty clear about not stating preferences based on protected characteristics in advertisements. So, even if her intent is to have a diverse tenant mix, expressing a preference for a white male could still be seen as discriminatory.\n\nOption C says there are no violations of any federal laws under these facts. But I think that's unlikely because the Fair Housing Act does regulate what can be said in rental advertisements.\n\nOption D states that under the Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement. This seems accurate because the act prohibits advertising that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe the correct answer is Option D. The Fair Housing Act does not allow landlords to state preferences based on race or gender in their advertisements. While the woman may have had well-intentioned reasons for wanting a diverse tenant mix, the law is clear in prohibiting such statements in ads.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that the Fair Housing Act was amended in 1988 to include advertising standards that prevent landlords from making discriminatory statements in their ads. So, even if she doesn't act on the preference and discriminates in practice, just stating it in the ad is illegal.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that while the woman's intent might be to promote diversity, the law is designed to prevent any practices that could lead to discrimination, intentional or not. So, expressing a preference for a white male could deter other applicants who don't fit that description, even if that wasn't her primary goal.\n\nTherefore, the statement that accurately reflects the situation is Option D: Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
