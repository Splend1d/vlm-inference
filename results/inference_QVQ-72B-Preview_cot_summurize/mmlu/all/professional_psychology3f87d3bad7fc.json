                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about heteroscedasticity in a scattergram. I have to pick which statement it suggests. Let me first make sure I understand what heteroscedasticity means. I remember that \"hetero-\" means different and \"scedasticity\" relates to the variance or spread of data points. So, heteroscedasticity refers to a situation where the variance of the error terms or residuals isn't constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n\nOption A says that the relationship between the predictor and the criterion can't be described by a straight line. Hmm, I thought heteroscedasticity affects the consistency of the variance, but it doesn't directly imply that there isn't a linear relationship. Maybe I need to think differently here.\n\nOption B mentions a restriction of range of scores on the predictor and/or the criterion. Restriction of range means that the data doesn't cover the full possible range of values. While this can affect the relationship observed in the scatterplot, I don't think it's directly related to heteroscedasticity. Maybe it's a distractor.\n\nOption C states that the variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor. This sounds a lot like what heteroscedasticity is about. If the spread of the data points around the regression line changes as the predictor variable changes, that's exactly what heteroscedasticity describes. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D says there's a statistically significant correlation between the predictor and the criterion. Well, heteroscedasticity can occur in data with or without a significant correlation. Just because the variance isn't constant doesn't necessarily mean there's a significant correlation. In fact, heteroscedasticity is more about the shape of the data spread rather than the presence or absence of a correlation.\n\nLet me double-check. In statistics, especially in regression analysis, heteroscedasticity is a condition where the variance of the error term isn't constant across observations. This is in contrast to homoscedasticity, where the variance is constant. In a scatterplot, if you see that the points are more spread out in some areas and less spread out in others, that's indicative of heteroscedasticity.\n\nSo, relating back to the options, it seems like option C is the correct choice because it directly describes what heteroscedasticity looks like in a scatterplot: the range of scores on the criterion (the dependent variable) changes depending on the value of the predictor (the independent variable).\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe option A could be related if the varying variance is due to a nonlinear relationship, but that seems indirect. And option B, restriction of range, might affect the appearance of heteroscedasticity, but it's not the same thing.\n\nOption D is definitely not correct because heteroscedasticity doesn't imply a significant correlation; it's about the consistency of variance, not about the strength or significance of the relationship between variables.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option C: the variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
