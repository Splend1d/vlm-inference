                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about social mobility. It talks about a man whose father was a bricklayer, and this man becomes a teacher at a medical school, gets promoted to a tenured professor, and then moves to another school for another tenured professor position. I need to identify the type of mobility at each step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what intergenerational and intragenerational mobility mean. Intergenerational mobility refers to changes in social status between generations, like from parents to children. Intragenerational mobility refers to changes in social status within a person's own lifetime.\n\nSo, the first part is about the son compared to his father. The father was a bricklayer, which is typically a working-class job, and the son becomes a teacher at a medical school, which is a professional position. This seems like a significant upward shift in social status. So, this should be intergenerational upward mobility.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, horizontal mobility, horizontal mobility\n\nB. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility\n\nC. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility\n\nD. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, horizontal mobility, upward mobility\n\nThe first part should be intergenerational upward mobility, so options A and C have intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, but option C specifies upward mobility, which fits.\n\nWait, option A says \"intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, horizontal mobility, horizontal mobility.\" But that doesn't seem right because the son's first move is upward, not horizontal.\n\nOption C says \"intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility.\" This seems more accurate for the first two steps.\n\nBut let's look at the second and third steps. The son becomes a teacher at a medical school, then gets promoted to a tenured professor, and then moves to another school for another tenured professor position.\n\nPromotion to tenured professor is likely an upward move in his career, as tenure is a significant benefit and a mark of advancement in academia. So, this should be upward mobility.\n\nThen, moving to another school for another tenured professor position: if he's moving from one tenured professor position to another, it's probably a horizontal move, assuming the positions have similar status and responsibilities.\n\nSo, the sequence should be:\n\n1. Intergenerational upward mobility (son vs. father)\n\n2. Intragenerational upward mobility (teacher to tenured professor)\n\n3. Intragenerational horizontal mobility (tenured professor to tenured professor at another school)\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, horizontal mobility, horizontal mobility\n\nB. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility\n\nC. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility\n\nD. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, horizontal mobility, upward mobility\n\nOption C seems to match my understanding: intergenerational upward mobility first, then upward mobility, then horizontal mobility.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Option D says intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, which would encompass all three moves, but it specifies horizontal mobility followed by upward mobility, which doesn't match the sequence I thought of.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the first move is intergenerational, and the next two are intragenerational.\n\nOption C has intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, followed by upward mobility and horizontal mobility, which could make sense if the upward mobility is intragenerational.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\n- First move: son vs. father \u2192 intergenerational upward mobility\n\n- Second move: teacher to tenured professor \u2192 intragenerational upward mobility\n\n- Third move: tenured professor at one school to tenured professor at another school \u2192 intragenerational horizontal mobility\n\nSo, the second and third moves are both intragenerational, but option C only specifies upward mobility and horizontal mobility without specifying intragenerational.\n\nOption D says intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, horizontal mobility, upward mobility, which doesn't match the sequence.\n\nOption B says intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility, which doesn't account for the third move being horizontal.\n\nOption A has intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, horizontal mobility, horizontal mobility, which misses the upward mobility.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is C, even though it doesn't explicitly say intragenerational for the second and third moves. But by process of elimination, it seems the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is structured to consider the son's career progression separately from the intergenerational comparison.\n\nLet me try rephrasing it in my mind.\n\nThe son's career path:\n\n1. Becomes a teacher at a medical school\n\n2. Promoted to tenured professor at the same school\n\n3. Moves to another school as a tenured professor\n\nCompared to his father, who was a bricklayer, the son's initial position as a teacher is already higher in social status, so that's intergenerational upward mobility.\n\nThen, within the son's career:\n\n- Teacher to tenured professor: upward mobility\n\n- Tenured professor to tenured professor at another school: horizontal mobility\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n- Intergenerational upward mobility (son vs. father)\n\n- Intragenerational upward mobility (teacher to tenured professor)\n\n- Intragenerational horizontal mobility (tenured professor to tenured professor)\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, horizontal mobility, horizontal mobility\n\nB. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility\n\nC. intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility\n\nD. intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, horizontal mobility, upward mobility\n\nOption C matches this sequence.\n\nOption D has intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, but the first move is intergenerational, so that doesn't fit.\n\nOption B has intragenerational upward mobility twice, missing the horizontal move.\n\nOption A has intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, but then two horizontal mobilities, which doesn't account for the upward move in the son's career.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
