Both forms of memory show a fairly consistent, gradual decline over the adult life span.\n\nB. Implicit memory capacity declines with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable.\n\nC. Explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable.\n\nD. Both forms of memory remain stable, except when affected by a disease process like Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAlright, I need to recall what I've learned about explicit and implicit memory and how they're affected by aging.\n\nFirst, explicit memory is the type where you consciously recall information, like remembering what you had for breakfast or recalling a specific event from your past. Implicit memory, on the other hand, is more about automatic processes, like remembering how to ride a bicycle or certain skills and habits that you've learned over time without really thinking about them.\n\nSo, the question is asking about how these two types of memory change as people age, particularly over the adult life span.\n\nLet me think about what research has shown in this area. I remember that explicit memory seems to be more susceptible to decline with age compared to implicit memory. So, that would suggest that explicit memory capacity decreases as people get older, but implicit memory might stay relatively stable.\n\nThat would point towards option C: explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable.\n\nLet me double-check this because I want to make sure I'm not mixing things up. I recall that in studies on aging and memory, explicit memory tasks, like recalling a list of words or events, show more age-related declines than implicit memory tasks, such as completing word fragments or performing skills that don't require conscious recall.\n\nFor example, in one study, researchers found that older adults performed similarly to younger adults on implicit memory tests like priming tasks, where previous exposure to stimuli influences later responses without conscious awareness. However, on explicit memory tests like recall or recognition, older adults showed significant declines.\n\nAnother piece of information I have is that implicit memory relies more on procedural memory systems, which seem to be less affected by aging, whereas explicit memory relies on declarative memory systems, which are more prone to age-related declines.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that explicit memory is more likely to decline with age, while implicit memory remains relatively stable.\n\nLet me consider option A: both forms of memory show a fairly consistent, gradual decline over the adult life span. But from what I just recalled, it seems that implicit memory doesn't decline as much with age, so this option might not be accurate.\n\nOption B says that implicit memory capacity declines with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable. This contradicts what I think I know, as I believe explicit memory is more affected by aging.\n\nOption D says that both forms of memory remain stable, except when affected by a disease process like Alzheimer\u2019s. That doesn't seem right because there is evidence of age-related declines in explicit memory, even in the absence of dementia or other neurological disorders.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate option seems to be C: explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about some possible exceptions or nuances. For example, in some very old age groups or in specific cognitive domains, maybe there are changes in implicit memory as well. However, generally speaking, across the adult life span, implicit memory seems to hold up better than explicit memory.\n\nAlso, I should consider that different types of implicit memory might be affected differently. For instance, priming might be preserved, but other forms of implicit memory could show some decline. However, overall, the consensus seems to be that implicit memory is more resilient to aging compared to explicit memory.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
