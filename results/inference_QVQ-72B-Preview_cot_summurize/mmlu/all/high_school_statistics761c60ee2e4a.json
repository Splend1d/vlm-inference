                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about correlation. It says that the correlation between two variables is r = 0.19. Then it asks what the new correlation would be if we do a few things to these variables: add 0.23 to all values of the x-variable, double all values of the y-variable, and then interchange the two variables. The options are A. 0.19, B. 0.42, C. 0.84, D. -0.19.\n\nHmm, I need to recall how correlation is affected by linear transformations and variable interchange. Let's start by remembering what correlation measures. Correlation, especially Pearson's correlation coefficient, measures the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate a strong positive linear relationship, values close to -1 indicate a strong negative linear relationship, and values around 0 indicate no linear relationship.\n\nNow, the problem mentions adding 0.23 to all values of the x-variable and doubling all values of the y-variable. I think these are linear transformations being applied to the variables. I need to recall how correlation is affected by linear transformations.\n\nI remember that the Pearson correlation coefficient is invariant under linear transformations of the variables. That is, if you add or subtract a constant from all values of one variable or multiply all values by a constant, the correlation remains the same. So, adding 0.23 to all x-values shouldn't change the correlation, and neither should doubling all y-values.\n\nWait, but let's think about this step by step. First, adding 0.23 to all x-values. This is a linear shift, and I think correlation shouldn't be affected by shifts. Similarly, doubling all y-values is another linear transformation, which should also leave the correlation unchanged.\n\nBut then, the problem also mentions interchanging the two variables. So, after performing these transformations, we swap x and y. I need to recall what happens to correlation when we swap the variables.\n\nLet's consider the formula for Pearson's correlation coefficient. It's defined as:\n\n\\[ r_{xy} = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}} \\]\n\nIf we interchange x and y, the correlation coefficient becomes:\n\n\\[ r_{yx} = \\frac{\\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})(x_i - \\bar{x})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} \\]\n\nWait a minute, this is the same as r_{xy}, just with x and y swapped. So, \\(\\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})(x_i - \\bar{x})\\) is the same as \\(\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})\\), and similarly, \\(\\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\) and \\(\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\) are just the variances of y and x, respectively.\n\nTherefore, swapping x and y doesn't change the correlation coefficient. So, after all these transformations\u2014adding a constant to x, multiplying y by a constant, and then swapping x and y\u2014the correlation should remain the same as the original correlation.\n\nBut let's double-check this reasoning. First, adding a constant to x: that's a horizontal shift, which shouldn't affect the correlation. Doubling y: that's a scaling transformation, which also shouldn't affect the correlation. And finally, swapping x and y: since correlation is symmetric, that shouldn't affect it either.\n\nSo, based on this, the new correlation should be the same as the original, which is 0.19. Therefore, the answer should be A. 0.19.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility that the correlation could change. Suppose the variables have different scales or units; would that affect the correlation? No, because correlation is a unitless measure; it's all about the linear relationship, not the units of the variables.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that correlation measures the extent to which one variable linearly depends on the other, regardless of the scale or the units. So, transforming the variables linearly shouldn't change this relationship.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the properties of Pearson's correlation coefficient again. It's based on covariance, normalized by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables. Since adding a constant to a variable shifts all values equally, it doesn't affect the covariance between x and y. Similarly, multiplying y by a constant scales the covariance by that constant, but it also scales the standard deviation of y by the same constant, so when you normalize, the correlation remains the same.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is A. 0.19.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.19} \\]"
