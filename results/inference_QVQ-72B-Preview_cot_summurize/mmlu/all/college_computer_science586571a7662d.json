                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a recursive procedure P that is guaranteed to terminate. I need to figure out which of the three statements must be true. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, P is recursive, meaning it calls itself during its execution. But it's also guaranteed to terminate, which means it doesn't go into an infinite loop where it keeps calling itself over and over without stopping.\n\nSo, what does it mean for a recursive procedure to terminate? It means that there's some condition under which the procedure doesn't call itself again and returns, ending that path of recursion.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. P has a local variable.\n\nII. P has an execution path where it does not call itself.\n\nIII. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.\n\nI need to determine which of these must be true if P is guaranteed to terminate.\n\nLet's consider statement I: P has a local variable.\n\nIs this necessarily true? Well, a procedure can be recursive and terminate without having any local variables. For example, in some simple recursive functions, you might just have parameters and no local variables. So, I don't think this has to be true. Maybe it's not required for termination.\n\nWhat about statement II: P has an execution path where it does not call itself.\n\nThis seems plausible. If P is guaranteed to terminate, there must be some path where it doesn't call itself, right? Because if it always calls itself without ever stopping, it would run forever. So, there must be at least one path where it doesn't call itself to ensure termination.\n\nWait, but in some recursive algorithms, like tail recursion, the recursive call is the last thing that happens, and it can be optimized by compilers to avoid stack overflow. But even in tail recursion, there is still a base case where the recursion stops. So, even if the recursive call is the last thing, there is still a path where the procedure doesn't call itself in the base case.\n\nSo, I think statement II must be true for P to terminate.\n\nNow, statement III: P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. Does a recursive procedure need to refer to a global variable or have parameters to terminate?\n\nWell, a procedure can be recursive and terminate without using global variables or having parameters. For example, consider a procedure that just checks a condition and returns without any data passed via parameters or global variables.\n\nWait, but in practice, recursive procedures often use parameters to pass data down the recursion tree or use local variables to keep track of state. But is it absolutely necessary to have a global variable or parameters?\n\nLet me think of a simple example.\n\nSuppose I have a procedure P that just counts down from a number to zero:\n\nprocedure P(n):\n\nif n == 0:\n\nreturn\n\nelse:\n\nP(n-1)\n\nIn this case, P is recursive and terminates for any non-negative integer n. Here, P has a parameter n, so it satisfies the \"has at least one parameter\" part of statement III.\n\nBut what if I don't pass any parameter?\n\nprocedure P():\n\nif some_condition:\n\nreturn\n\nelse:\n\nP()\n\nIn this case, if some_condition is eventually true, P will terminate. But this seems a bit contrived because some_condition needs to be updated somewhere for it to become true eventually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P modifies a global variable:\n\nglobal count = 10\n\nprocedure P():\n\nif count == 0:\n\nreturn\n\nelse:\n\ncount = count - 1\n\nP()\n\nHere, P refers to a global variable count and terminates when count reaches zero.\n\nSo, in both cases where P has parameters or refers to global variables, termination is achieved.\n\nBut is there a way for P to terminate without referring to any global variables or having parameters?\n\nLet's see.\n\nSuppose P doesn't have any parameters and doesn't refer to any global variables.\n\nprocedure P():\n\n# No parameters, no global variables\n\nif should_stop():\n\nreturn\n\nelse:\n\nP()\n\nNow, the question is, can should_stop() ever return true without involving parameters or global variables?\n\nIn most programming languages, functions can have local variables, but in this case, P doesn't have any local variables.\n\nWait, maybe P could have a local variable, but the problem says P has no local variables, so perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P relies on external inputs or system variables, but those might not be considered global variables in the same sense.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe in reality, for P to make a decision to stop recursing, it needs some state, which is usually tracked via parameters or global variables.\n\nSo, perhaps statement III is true: P must refer to a global variable or have at least one parameter to terminate.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where P counts down from a number, it has a parameter, and in another example, it uses a global variable.\n\nBut is there a scenario where P doesn't have parameters or global variables and still terminates?\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose P is called only once, and inside it, it calls itself a fixed number of times, but eventually, there's a condition to stop.\n\nBut without parameters or global variables to track state, it's hard to see how P can decide to stop recursing.\n\nMaybe in functional programming, where recursion is heavy, but even there, recursive functions usually have parameters to track the state.\n\nSo, perhaps statement III is indeed true: P must refer to a global variable or have at least one parameter to terminate.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that statement II must be true: P has an execution path where it does not call itself.\n\nCombining these, it seems that both II and III must be true for P to terminate.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. I and II only\n\nD. II and III only\n\nSo, if both II and III must be true, then the answer would be D. II and III only.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs statement I necessary? No, as I thought earlier, P doesn't need to have a local variable to terminate.\n\nSo, statement I can be false while P still terminates.\n\nBut statements II and III seem necessary.\n\nWait, but is statement III absolutely necessary?\n\nMaybe there's a way for P to terminate without referring to global variables or having parameters.\n\nLet's try to think of such a scenario.\n\nSuppose P is called with no parameters and doesn't refer to any global variables.\n\nInside P, it calls itself a certain number of times, and then stops.\n\nFor example:\n\nprocedure P():\n\nif recursion_depth > max_depth:\n\nreturn\n\nelse:\n\nP()\n\nBut in this case, recursion_depth and max_depth need to be defined somewhere.\n\nIf recursion_depth is a local variable, but the problem says P has no local variables.\n\nIf max_depth is a constant or defined elsewhere, but without parameters or global variables, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P is called in a way that it naturally terminates without needing parameters or global variables.\n\nBut I'm struggling to think of such an example.\n\nTherefore, perhaps statement III is indeed necessary for P to terminate.\n\nHence, the answer should be D. II and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
