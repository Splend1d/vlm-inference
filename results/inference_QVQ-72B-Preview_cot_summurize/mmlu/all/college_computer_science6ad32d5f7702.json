Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list in half, sorts each half recursively, and then merges them back together. The merging part is crucial because it combines the sorted halves into a single sorted list.\n\nFirst, let's recall that mergesort's time complexity is O(n log n) because it splits the list into halves repeatedly until each sublist contains only one element. Then, it merges these sublists in a sorted manner. The merging step is where most of the work happens, and it's essential that this step can be performed efficiently.\n\nNow, let's consider each data structure one by one.\n\n**I. Singly Linked List:**\n\nIn a singly linked list, each node points only to the next node. To perform mergesort on a singly linked list, we need to split the list into two halves and sort each half. The merging process involves comparing elements from both halves and linking them in order. However, one issue with singly linked lists is that splitting the list into two halves requires traversing the list to find the midpoint, which takes O(n) time. But more importantly, merging two sorted linked lists can be done efficiently by traversing both lists and linking the smaller elements first, which can be done in O(n) time for two halves of size n/2.\n\nBut wait, the overall mergesort on a singly linked list is indeed O(n log n). Each level of recursion processes n elements, and there are log n levels of recursion. So, it should be O(n log n). But let's confirm this again.\n\nActually, in mergesort on a singly linked list, the splitting can be done in O(n) time per level, and merging can also be done in O(n) time per level. Since there are log n levels, the total time should be O(n log n). So, it seems that singly linked lists can handle mergesort in O(n log n) time.\n\n**II. Doubly Linked List:**\n\nA doubly linked list has both forward and backward pointers, which might make some operations faster, like traversing in both directions or reversing the list. However, for mergesort, the key operations are splitting the list into halves and merging them back together.\n\nSplitting a doubly linked list into two halves can be done by finding the midpoint, similar to a singly linked list, which takes O(n) time. Merging two sorted doubly linked lists can also be done efficiently by comparing elements and linking them in order, similar to the singly linked list case.\n\nTherefore, mergesort on a doubly linked list should also be O(n log n). The additional backward pointers don't seem to affect the time complexity negatively in this context.\n\n**III. Array:**\n\nArrays are perhaps the most common structure for implementing mergesort. Splitting an array into two halves is straightforward and can be done in O(1) time if we consider that we're just passing references to the subarrays. However, the actual copying of elements during splitting and merging can take O(n) time per level.\n\nIn standard mergesort implementation on arrays, the algorithm recursively splits the array into halves until each subarray has one element, and then merges them back together. Each merge operation takes O(n) time, and there are log n levels of recursion, resulting in O(n log n) time complexity.\n\nBut sometimes, people might implement mergesort in-place without creating new arrays for each subarray, but even then, the time complexity remains O(n log n) because each merge step still takes O(n) time.\n\nSo, all three data structures can support mergesort in O(n log n) time.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in some contexts, linked lists might have some advantages or disadvantages compared to arrays in terms of performance for certain operations.\n\nFor example, in arrays, random access is O(1), whereas in linked lists, accessing an arbitrary element requires traversing from the head, which is O(n). However, in mergesort, we primarily deal with splitting and merging, which are sequential operations. So, in linked lists, these operations can still be done efficiently in linear time because we're processing elements in order.\n\nIn arrays, merging two sorted subarrays requires copying elements, which is also O(n), but it's still efficient enough to keep the overall complexity at O(n log n).\n\nIs there any scenario where one of these structures wouldn't support mergesort in O(n log n) time? I can't think of any right now.\n\nLet me check some online resources to confirm my understanding.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that mergesort is indeed implemented on arrays, singly linked lists, and doubly linked lists with O(n log n) time complexity. For example, in the case of linked lists, the merging process is efficient because it involves changing pointers rather than copying elements, which can be an advantage in terms of space and time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any potential issue with one of these structures that might make mergesort not achieve O(n log n) time.\n\nFor singly linked lists, since we only have forward pointers, splitting the list into two halves requires traversing the list to find the midpoint, which is O(n). Merging two sorted linked lists is O(n), and since there are log n levels of recursion, the total time is O(n log n).\n\nFor doubly linked lists, the same logic applies, and the additional backward pointers don't seem to affect the time complexity.\n\nFor arrays, standard mergesort implementations achieve O(n log n) time complexity, whether they're implemented with extra space for temporary arrays or in-place with careful merging.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
