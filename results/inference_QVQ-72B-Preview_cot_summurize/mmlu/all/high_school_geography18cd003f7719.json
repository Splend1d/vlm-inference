                    "text": "So I have this question here about migration, and it's asking about the tendency for migration to decrease with distance. The options are push factors, pull factors, distance decay, and migration selectivity. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these terms correctly describes this concept.\n\nFirst, let's recall what migration is. Migration refers to the movement of people from one place to another, usually over long distances, with the intention of settling in the new location. Now, the question is about the tendency for migration to decrease as the distance increases. So, the farther away a destination is, the less likely people are to migrate there.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Push factors.\n\nI know that push factors are those conditions in the original location that encourage people to leave. Things like economic hardship, political instability, or environmental disasters can push people to migrate. But this doesn't directly relate to the distance of migration. Push factors might affect whether someone migrates at all, but they don't specifically address how distance influences migration rates. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nB. Pull factors.\n\nPull factors are the attractive elements of a new location that draw people to migrate there. Opportunities for better jobs, higher wages, better education, or a safer environment are all pull factors. Again, these factors relate to why someone\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9 a particular destination, but they don't inherently consider the distance of the migration. So, similar to push factors, pull factors don't directly explain the decrease in migration with increasing distance.\n\nC. Distance decay.\n\nThis sounds interesting. Distance decay is a geographical concept that suggests that interaction or movement between places decreases as the distance between them increases. So, in the context of migration, this would mean that the likelihood of someone migrating decreases the farther away the destination is. This seems to align perfectly with the tendency described in the question.\n\nD. Migration selectivity.\n\nI'm not as familiar with this term. Migration selectivity, from what I can recall, refers to the characteristics of migrants compared to non-migrants. For example, migrants might be healthier, better educated, or of a certain age group. This has more to do with who migrates rather than how far they migrate or the relationship between migration rates and distance.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, distance decay seems to be the most appropriate answer. It directly relates to the idea that migration decreases as distance increases, which matches the question's description.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any way that push or pull factors could be indirectly related to distance? For example, perhaps stronger push factors might lead to longer migrations, or stronger pull factors might attract people from farther away. But even then, it's not the distance itself that's the determining factor; it's the strength of the push or pull that overcomes the barrier of distance.\n\nIn contrast, distance decay is a concept that specifically deals with the relationship between distance and interaction or movement, making it the most fitting answer for the question at hand.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way that migration selectivity could relate to distance. Maybe in some contexts, migrants over longer distances have different characteristics than those who migrate shorter distances. For instance, longer-distance migrants might be more likely to be highly skilled or have greater financial resources to afford the move. However, this still doesn't change the fact that the likelihood of migration decreases with distance, which is the main point of the question.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. distance decay.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
