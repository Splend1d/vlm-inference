                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Pure Land Buddhism belongs to which school? A. Vajrayana B. Theravada C. Mahayana D. Mahavira.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not an expert on Buddhism, but I do know a bit about its different schools.\n\nFirst off, I recall that Buddhism has several main traditions: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Mahavira, on the other hand, sounds familiar but I think it's related to Jainism, not Buddhism. So maybe D. Mahavira isn't the right answer here.\n\nNow, between Theravada and Mahayana, I remember that Mahayana is known for its emphasis on the bodhisattva ideal and includes schools like Zen, Tibetan Buddhism, and Pure Land Buddhism. Theravada, on the other hand, is more common in Southeast Asia and is considered one of the oldest Buddhist traditions.\n\nPure Land Buddhism is a form of Buddhism that focuses on devotion to Amitabha Buddha and the hope of being reborn in his pure land, a blissful realm where one can attain enlightenment more easily. It's particularly popular in East Asian countries like China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nGiven that, I think Pure Land Buddhism is part of the Mahayana tradition. Let me double-check that. I know that Mahayana Buddhism has various schools, including Pure Land, Zen, and Tibetan Buddhism, which is sometimes also called Vajrayana.\n\nWait a minute, Vajrayana is often considered a separate tradition within Buddhism, sometimes seen as a part of Mahayana but with its own distinct practices involving tantra and other esoteric elements. So, is Pure Land considered Vajrayana?\n\nI don't think so. Pure Land is more about faith and recitation of Amitabha Buddha's name, whereas Vajrayana involves more complex rituals and initiations. So, probably not A. Vajrayana.\n\nTheravada seems unlikely because it's more focused on individual enlightenment through meditation and following the teachings of the Buddha as preserved in the Pali Canon. Pure Land Buddhism, with its emphasis on Amitabha Buddha and rebirth in his pure land, seems more aligned with Mahayana's broader pantheon of buddhas and bodhisattvas.\n\nMahavira, again, I believe is associated with Jainism, which is a separate religion from Buddhism, so that definitely doesn't fit.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, it seems like C. Mahayana is the correct answer. But just to be sure, maybe I should look up a reliable source to confirm.\n\nLet me search for \"Pure Land Buddhism school\" or something like that. Okay, according to various sources, Pure Land Buddhism is indeed a part of the Mahayana tradition. It's one of the major schools within Mahayana Buddhism, known for its focus on Amitabha Buddha and the pure land.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Mahayana.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Mahayana}} \\]"
