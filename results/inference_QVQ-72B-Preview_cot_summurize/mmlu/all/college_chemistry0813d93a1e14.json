                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem about optical isomerism in coordination complexes. I need to figure out which statement is true regarding optical isomerism in complexes that contain achiral ligands. None of the ligands are chiral, which means they don't have mirror image isomers themselves. But the complex as a whole might still be chiral due to the way the ligands are arranged around the central metal ion.\n\nFirst, I should recall what optical isomerism is. It's a type of stereoisomerism where molecules are non-superimposable mirror images, meaning they're chiral. So, for a complex to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be chiral.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:** Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n\nI know that square planar complexes have the general formula ML\u2084, where M is the metal ion and L are the ligands. If all four ligands are identical, meaning MLLLL, it's possible to have a chiral arrangement. For example, in cis and trans isomers, the cis form can be chiral if the ligands are different, but here it says all four are identical.\n\nWait, if all four ligands are identical, like in PtCl\u2084\u00b2-, which is square planar, it's symmetric, and I think it's achiral. Actually, PtCl\u2084\u00b2- is planar and symmetric, so it shouldn't be chiral. Maybe this option is false.\n\nLet me think again. In square planar complexes with four identical ligands, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it shouldn't be chiral. Therefore, option A seems incorrect.\n\n**Option B:** Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n\nTetrahedral complexes have the formula ML\u2084, where L are the ligands. For a tetrahedron, which is chiral in nature, having different ligands can lead to chiral complexes. For example, if all four ligands are different, like MABCD, the tetrahedral complex can exist as enantiomers because the arrangement is chiral.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\" That seems too broad. Maybe it's not considering that tetrahedral complexes can be chiral.\n\nBut in reality, tetrahedral complexes can be chiral when they have four different ligands. So, this statement is false.\n\n**Option C:** Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nLinear complexes are usually diatomic, like ML\u2082, where M is the central metal and L are the ligands. If the ligands are different, like MA and MB, the complex is linear and symmetric. But linear molecules are generally achiral because they have a plane of symmetry.\n\nWait, in a linear arrangement, if you have two different ligands, it's like having MA and MB on opposite ends. This arrangement is symmetric and shouldn't be chiral. Therefore, this option is probably false.\n\n**Option D:** Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nOctahedral complexes have the general formula ML\u2086, ML\u2085X, ML\u2084X\u2082, etc., where M is the metal, L are the ligands, and X is another type of ligand. For optical isomerism to occur, the arrangement must lack a plane of symmetry.\n\nLet's consider different cases:\n\n1. **ML\u2086:** If all six ligands are identical, the complex is achiral due to high symmetry.\n\n2. **ML\u2085X:** Here, five L and one X are present. This can have a C\u2085 axis, and depending on the arrangement, it might be chiral. Wait, in octahedral geometry, replacing one ligand with X doesn't necessarily make the complex chiral. For example, [CoCl(NH\u2083)\u2085]\u00b2\u207a is achiral.\n\n3. **ML\u2084X\u2082:** This can have different isomers based on the arrangement of the X ligands. If the two X ligands are trans, it's achiral; if cis, it might be chiral depending on the ligands.\n\n4. **ML\u2083X\u2083:** This can have fac (facial) and mer (meridional) isomers. The fac isomer can be chiral.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"at least three different ligands.\" So, for example, ML\u2083X\u2083 would have three different ligands if L and X are different.\n\nLet me think about [Co(en)\u2083]\u00b3\u207a, where en is ethylenediamine. This is a chiral complex because the en ligands are bidentate, but the question specifies monodentate ligands. So, en is bidentate, which complicates things.\n\nWait, the problem specifies monodentate ligands. So, en is bidentate, so this example doesn't apply here.\n\nLet's consider [Co(NH\u2083)\u2083Cl\u2083]. Here, NH\u2083 and Cl are monodentate ligands. This complex can exist in fac and mer forms. The fac isomer can be chiral.\n\nSo, in octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands, having at least three different ligands can lead to chiral complexes.\n\nBut the statement says \"only when they have at least three different ligands.\" Does that mean that with fewer than three different ligands, they can't exhibit optical isomerism?\n\nWell, in ML\u2084X\u2082, if L and X are different, and the complex is cis, it can be chiral. So, in this case, there are only two different ligands, but the complex can still be chiral.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"at least three different ligands.\" So, does that mean that with only two different ligands, like in ML\u2084X\u2082, it can't be chiral? But as I thought, cis-ML\u2084X\u2082 can be chiral.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me look up the conditions for optical isomerism in octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands.\n\nUpon checking, octahedral complexes can exhibit optical isomerism when they have a dissymmetric arrangement of ligands. Specifically:\n\n- For tris-chelate complexes like [M(AA)\u2083]\u207f\u207a, where AA is a chelating ligand, they can be chiral even if the ligands are identical, but here we're dealing with monodentate ligands.\n\n- For complexes with monodentate ligands, such as ML\u2083X\u2083, the fac isomer can be chiral.\n\n- However, in ML\u2084X\u2082, the cis isomer can be chiral.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"only when they have at least three different ligands.\" So, does that include cases like ML\u2083X\u2083, ML\u2082X\u2082Y, etc.?\n\nI think the key is that with at least three different ligands, meaning three or more different types of ligands, the complex can be chiral.\n\nBut in ML\u2084X\u2082, with only two different ligands, it can still be chiral in the cis arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is not entirely accurate because optical isomerism can occur in octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands even when there are only two different ligands, as in ML\u2084X\u2082.\n\nSo, option D is incorrect.\n\nGiven that all other options seem to be incorrect, perhaps there is a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nOption A: Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n\nFrom my understanding, square planar complexes with all four identical ligands are achiral due to symmetry.\n\nOption B: Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n\nActually, tetrahedral complexes can be chiral, especially when they have four different ligands.\n\nOption C: Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nLinear complexes with two different ligands are symmetric and achiral.\n\nOption D: Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nBut as I saw, ML\u2084X\u2082 with two different ligands can be chiral in the cis arrangement.\n\nTherefore, none of the options seem to be correct based on my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nMaybe I misremembered about tetrahedral complexes.\n\nLet me consider tetrahedral ML\u2084 complexes.\n\nIn tetrahedral geometry, if all four ligands are different, like MABCD, the complex can exist as enantiomers because the arrangement is chiral.\n\nSimilarly, in square planar complexes, having all four identical ligands makes them achiral due to symmetry.\n\nWait, perhaps option A is incorrect because square planar complexes can exhibit optical isomerism in certain cases, but not when all four ligands are identical.\n\nFor example, in cis and trans isomers of ML\u2082X\u2082, the cis form can be chiral if L and X are different.\n\nWait, in square planar ML\u2082X\u2082, cis and trans isomers exist. The cis isomer can be chiral if L and X are different.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is incorrect because square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if not all four ligands are identical.\n\nSimilarly, option B is incorrect because tetrahedral complexes can be chiral when they have four different ligands.\n\nOption C is incorrect because linear complexes with two different ligands are achiral.\n\nOption D is incorrect because octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands can be chiral even with only two different ligands, as in ML\u2084X\u2082.\n\nTherefore, none of the provided options seem to be correct based on my understanding.\n\nBut perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the options.\n\nLet me read option D again: \"Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\"\n\nThis seems to suggest that having at least three different ligands is a necessary condition for optical isomerism in octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, ML\u2084X\u2082 with two different ligands can exhibit optical isomerism in the cis arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is too restrictive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that with at least three different ligands, certain arrangements can be chiral, but it's not the only condition.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option B, since tetrahedral complexes can indeed be chiral under certain conditions, contrary to the statement in option B.\n\nBut the question asks which statement is true, and if option B is false, then none of the options are true.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the question might have a typo or that I'm missing something fundamental.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the context of the question, they are considering only specific types of ligands or specific conditions that I'm not accounting for.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is option D, acknowledging that with at least three different ligands, octahedral complexes can exhibit optical isomerism, even though it's not the only condition.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}"
