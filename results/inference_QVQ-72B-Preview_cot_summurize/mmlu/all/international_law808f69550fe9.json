Custom, general principles of law and theory\n\nC. Treaties, custom and general principles of law\n\nD. Treaties, custom and General Assembly Resolutions\n\nI need to pick which ones are the formal sources of international law. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that international law is primarily based on treaties and customs. Treaties are agreements between states, and customs are practices that are followed consistently over time and are recognized as law. So, both treaties and customs are definitely sources of international law.\n\nThen, there's the concept of general principles of law. I think these are principles that are common to the legal systems of most countries, like good faith or equity. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has referred to these principles in its judgments, so they must be considered a source of international law as well.\n\nJudicial decisions also come into play. The ICJ's decisions are influential, and while they are binding only between the parties involved, they can set precedents that other courts and tribunals might follow. However, I'm not sure if judicial decisions are considered a primary source of international law in the same way that treaties and customs are.\n\nAs for theories, I'm a bit confused. Theories in international law refer to academic ideas and concepts that help explain or interpret the law, but they aren't directly a source of law themselves. So, I don't think theory is a formal source of international law.\n\nGeneral Assembly resolutions are interesting. The UN General Assembly passes resolutions on various issues, and while they can be influential and reflective of state practice and opinio juris, they aren't strictly legally binding in the same way that treaties are. So, I'm not sure if they're considered formal sources of international law.\n\nLet me summarize what I have so far:\n\n- Treaties: definitely a source\n\n- Customs: definitely a source\n\n- General principles of law: seem to be a source\n\n- Judicial decisions: maybe not a primary source\n\n- Theory: probably not a formal source\n\n- General Assembly resolutions: maybe not a formal source\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA includes custom, treaties, and judicial decisions\n\nB includes custom, general principles of law, and theory\n\nC includes treaties, custom, and general principles of law\n\nD includes treaties, custom, and General Assembly Resolutions\n\nGiven that treaties, customs, and general principles of law seem to be the primary formal sources, option C looks promising.\n\nBut let me double-check. I remember that the Statute of the International Court of Justice lists the sources of international law. Let me try to recall it.\n\nArticle 38 of the ICJ Statute says that the Court shall apply:\n\n1. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n\n2. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n\n3. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n\n4. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\n\nSo, according to this, the primary sources are:\n\n- International conventions (treaties)\n\n- International custom\n\n- General principles of law\n\nJudicial decisions and academic writings are subsidiary means, not primary sources.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and D include elements that are not primary sources.\n\nOption A includes judicial decisions, which are subsidiary.\n\nOption B includes theory, which is not a formal source.\n\nOption D includes General Assembly resolutions, which, while influential, are not a primary formal source of international law.\n\nOption C includes treaties, custom, and general principles of law, which match the primary sources listed in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that General Assembly resolutions aren't considered formal sources in some contexts. For example, some resolutions might have more weight if they're adopted unanimously or if they reflect customary international law.\n\nHowever, in general, resolutions of the General Assembly are not considered formal sources of international law. They can influence the development of international law and reflect state practice or opinio juris, but they themselves are not binding unless they are incorporated into a treaty or reflect customary law.\n\nTherefore, including General Assembly resolutions in the list of formal sources would be incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, judicial decisions are important, but they are subsidiary means according to the ICJ Statute. They don't constitute a primary formal source.\n\nTheory is even less of a formal source; it's more about academic interpretation and analysis.\n\nSo, sticking to the primary formal sources, option C is the correct choice: treaties, custom, and general principles of law.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
