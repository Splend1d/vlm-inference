                    "text": "So I have these two statements about integral domains and their characteristics, and I need to figure out which ones are true. I'm a bit rusty on integral domains and characteristics, so I should probably start by recalling what an integral domain is and what characteristic means.\n\nFirst off, an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity (so it has a multiplicative identity, usually denoted as 1) that has no zero divisors. That means if you have two elements a and b in the ring, and their product is zero, then either a is zero or b is zero. So, no non-trivial ways to multiply things and get zero.\n\nNow, the characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n times the unity element is zero. If no such n exists, then the characteristic is said to be 0. So, if I take the unity and add it to itself n times and it equals zero, then n is the characteristic.\n\nStatement 1 says: Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.\n\nHmm, okay. So, if an integral domain has characteristic 0, that means that no finite multiple of the unity element sums to zero. That suggests that there's no minimal positive integer n such that n*1 = 0. In other words, the multiples of the unity element don't wrap around to zero.\n\nLet me think about the integers, Z. That's an integral domain with characteristic 0, right? Because if you take any positive integer n, n*1 is just n, which is not zero. So, Z is infinite, which seems to support the statement.\n\nBut is every integral domain with characteristic 0 infinite? Maybe I should look for a counterexample. Suppose I have an integral domain D with characteristic 0. Since it's an integral domain, it's a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors.\n\nConsider the subring generated by the unity element, 1. This subring is isomorphic to the integers Z because n*1 for n in Z are all distinct, given that the characteristic is 0. Now, since D contains a copy of Z, and Z is infinite, does that make D infinite?\n\nWait, not necessarily. D could be larger than Z, but even if it's just Z, it's still infinite. But can there be a finite integral domain with characteristic 0?\n\nLet me suppose D is finite and has characteristic 0. Then, every element in D is either a unit or zero, but in a finite integral domain, every nonzero element is a unit because the cancellation law holds. So, every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nBut if D is finite and every nonzero element has an inverse, then D is a field. And fields have prime power characteristics, meaning their characteristic is a prime number or 0. Wait, but we're assuming characteristic 0. So, is there a finite field with characteristic 0?\n\nI think all finite fields have prime characteristics. For example, finite fields of order p^n, where p is prime. So, if D is finite and an integral domain, it must have prime characteristic, not 0. Therefore, there can't be a finite integral domain with characteristic 0.\n\nSo, it seems that every integral domain with characteristic 0 must be infinite. That supports Statement 1 being true.\n\nNow, Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.\n\nOkay, so if D is an integral domain with prime characteristic, say p, where p is a prime number, what does that imply?\n\nFirst, the characteristic being p means that p*1 = 0, and for any smaller positive integer k < p, k*1 \u2260 0. Since p is prime, the subring generated by 1 is isomorphic to the integers modulo p, i.e., Z/pZ.\n\nNow, Z/pZ is a field when p is prime, which is also an integral domain. So, D contains a copy of Z/pZ.\n\nBut is D necessarily finite? Let's see.\n\nConsider the polynomial ring over Z/pZ in one variable, say Z/pZ[x]. This is an integral domain with characteristic p, but it's infinite because it includes all polynomials in x with coefficients in Z/pZ.\n\nSo, here's a counterexample to Statement 2: Z/pZ[x] is an integral domain with prime characteristic p, but it's infinite.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait, but maybe there are some integral domains with prime characteristic that are finite. For example, finite fields of order p^n, where p is prime and n is a positive integer. So, in that case, they are finite.\n\nBut the statement says \"every\" integral domain with prime characteristic is finite, which is not true because there are infinite ones like polynomial rings over finite fields.\n\nSo, since there exists at least one counterexample, the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be C. True, False.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me confirm Statement 1 again. If an integral domain has characteristic 0, it contains a copy of the integers Z, which is infinite. Since D is an integral domain, it can't collapse Z into a finite set without introducing zero divisors. Therefore, D must be infinite. So, Statement 1 is indeed true.\n\nFor Statement 2, as shown with Z/pZ[x], there are infinite integral domains with prime characteristic, so Statement 2 is false.\n\nYes, I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
