                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here. It's about a theory that suggests there are three levels of moral reasoning, and these levels depend on a person's cognitive capacity. The options are A. Egoism, B. Cognitive moral development, C. Power distance, and D. Uncertainty avoidance. I need to fill in the blank with the correct term.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the question is asking. It's talking about a theory that has three stages or levels of moral reasoning, and these levels are based on how capable a person is cognitively to understand and evaluate ethical issues. So, it's about how people think about right and wrong, and there are different stages of sophistication in that thinking.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A is Egoism. I know that egoism is a ethical theory that suggests individuals should act in their own self-interest. It's more about the motivation behind actions rather than stages of moral development. So, I don't think this fits the description of having three levels of moral reasoning based on cognitive capacity.\n\nOption B is Cognitive moral development. This sounds promising. I recall that there is a theory called moral development that proposes different stages through which people progress in their ability to understand and apply moral reasoning. Let me see if I can remember more details about this theory.\n\nI think the most famous theory of moral development is Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development. Kohlberg proposed that moral reasoning develops in six stages, arranged in two levels: Preconventional, Conventional, and Postconventional. Wait, but the question mentions three levels, not six stages. Hmm, maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nLet me think again. Kohlberg's theory does have three levels, each containing two stages. So, perhaps the way I'm thinking about it needs adjustment. The three levels are:\n\n1. Preconventional morality: This level is characterized by self-interest and obedience to authority to avoid punishment.\n\n2. Conventional morality: Here, individuals conform to social norms and expectations to gain approval and maintain order.\n\n3. Postconventional morality: This level involves abstract reasoning and principled thinking, where individuals make decisions based on universal ethical principles.\n\nYes, that sounds like three distinct levels of moral reasoning, each building on the previous one and requiring greater cognitive capacity to reach. So, Cognitive moral development seems to fit the description in the question.\n\nOption C is Power distance. I'm familiar with this concept from Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. Power distance refers to the extent to which a society accepts and expects power imbalances. It's more about cultural values and how authority is perceived in a society, not about individual moral reasoning development. So, this doesn't seem relevant to the question.\n\nOption D is Uncertainty avoidance. Also from Hofstede's cultural dimensions, this refers to how a society deals with ambiguity and uncertainty. It's about comfort with unknown situations and the need for rules and structure. Again, this is more about cultural tendencies rather than individual moral development stages.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate choice seems to be B. Cognitive moral development. However, I should double-check because the question mentions \"three levels of moral reasoning,\" and Kohlberg's theory is often referred to as having six stages, even though they are grouped into three levels.\n\nMaybe the question is referring to another theory. Let me consider if there are other theories of moral development that propose three levels.\n\nAnother well-known theory is Carol Gilligan's ethics of care, which complements Kohlberg's theory by emphasizing relational and caring aspects of moral development. But I don't remember it being structured into three levels.\n\nThere's also the idea of moral reasoning in the context of business ethics or other fields, but again, I don't recall a specific three-level theory.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the question is referring to James Rest's components of moral judgment, which include moral sensitivity, moral judgment, and moral action. But that's a different framework, and it doesn't fit the three-level structure mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to Kohlberg's three levels: Preconventional, Conventional, and Postconventional, each representing a significant shift in moral reasoning. So, in that case, Cognitive moral development would still be the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider the other options again to make sure. Egoism is a ethical theory focused on self-interest, not stages of moral development. Power distance and Uncertainty avoidance are cultural dimensions, not related to individual moral reasoning stages.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Cognitive moral development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Cognitive moral development}} \\]"
