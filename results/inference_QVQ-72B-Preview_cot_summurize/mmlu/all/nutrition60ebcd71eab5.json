                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following foods do not contain free sugars?\" And the options are A. Cow's milk, B. Natural unsweetened orange juice, C. Honey, and D. Agave nectar. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these doesn't have free sugars.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what free sugars are. From what I recall, free sugars are sugars that are added to foods or drinks, like table sugar (sucrose) or high-fructose corn syrup, and also include sugars naturally present in honey and syrups. So, they're not the sugars that are naturally found in whole fruits or vegetables.\n\nOkay, so the task is to identify which of these options doesn't contain free sugars. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. Cow's milk: Milk contains lactose, which is a type of sugar, but is it considered a free sugar? I think lactose is a natural component of milk and isn't added; it's inherent in the milk. So, maybe cow's milk doesn't have free sugars.\n\nB. Natural unsweetened orange juice: This sounds promising. It's natural and unsweetened, which means no sugar has been added. The sugar in oranges is fructose, which is a natural sugar found in fruits. But wait, are these natural sugars in fruits considered free sugars? I think they are only considered free sugars if they're added to the food. So, since it's natural and unsweetened, it probably doesn't have free sugars.\n\nC. Honey: Honey is mostly composed of sugars like glucose and fructose. It's a natural sweetener, and I believe it does contain free sugars. So, this might be one that does have free sugars.\n\nD. Agave nectar: Similar to honey, agave nectar is also a natural sweetener, primarily consisting of fructose and glucose. So, it likely contains free sugars as well.\n\nFrom this reasoning, it seems like options A and B might not contain free sugars, while C and D do.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In the case of cow's milk, lactose is indeed a natural sugar present in milk, and it's not added; it's just part of the milk's composition. So, it shouldn't be considered a free sugar.\n\nFor natural unsweetened orange juice, the sugars come directly from the oranges themselves without any added sugars. So, those sugars are naturally occurring in the fruit and not added, which means they shouldn't be classified as free sugars.\n\nOn the other hand, honey and agave nectar are both natural sweeteners that are often used to add sweetness to foods and drinks. Their primary purpose is to sweeten, which suggests that the sugars they contain are intended as added sugars. Therefore, they would contain free sugars.\n\nSo, based on this understanding, the correct answers should be A. Cow's milk and B. Natural unsweetened orange juice.\n\nBut the question asks for the food that does not contain free sugars, and it's a single-choice question, so maybe one of these is the best answer. Wait, but both seem to fit the criteria. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the distinction lies in the fact that in cow's milk, lactose is an integral part of the milk, whereas in orange juice, even if it's natural and unsweetened, the act of juicing separates the juice from the fiber, which might affect the sugar content or its classification.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in whole oranges, the sugar is bound within the cells and fiber, which slows down absorption, but in juice form, even without adding sugar, the sugar is more readily available, making it similar to free sugars.\n\nWait a minute, maybe that's the difference. In cow's milk, lactose is part of the milk's matrix and is accompanied by other nutrients like protein and fats, which might affect its metabolic impact compared to free sugars.\n\nIn contrast, natural unsweetened orange juice has sugars that are easily absorbed because the fiber has been removed during juicing, which could make them behave more like free sugars.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps natural unsweetened orange juice does contain free sugars, whereas cow's milk does not.\n\nLet me see if I can find some guidance or standards on this.\n\nI recall that the World Health Organization (WHO) defines free sugars as all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.\n\nSo, according to this definition, cow's milk would not contain free sugars because lactose is an intrinsic part of the milk and not added.\n\nNatural unsweetened orange juice, however, would contain free sugars because the sugars are naturally present in the fruit juice, even if no sugar has been added.\n\nHoney and agave nectar fall under the category of syrups and honey, which are included in the definition of free sugars.\n\nTherefore, based on this, the correct answer should be A. Cow's milk, as it does not contain free sugars.\n\nBut wait, the question seems to suggest that multiple options might be possible, but it's formatted as a single-choice question. Maybe I need to consider another angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say that among these options, which one does not contain free sugars, considering that some foods may have sugars added during processing.\n\nBut in the case of cow's milk, it's unlikely to have added sugars unless specified, so it should still be A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B. Natural unsweetened orange juice, but according to the WHO definition, fruit juices contain free sugars because the sugars are liberated from the cellular structure of the fruit.\n\nThat would make sense, so perhaps cow's milk is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both A and B are correct, but since it's a single-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different perspective.\n\nLet me consider the nutritional content.\n\nIn cow's milk, lactose is about 5% of its composition. It's a disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose.\n\nIn natural unsweetened orange juice, the primary sugar is fructose, with some glucose and sucrose.\n\nHoney is about 35% fructose and 35% glucose, with some sucrose and maltose.\n\nAgave nectar is mostly fructose, with some glucose and higher saccharides.\n\nNow, according to the WHO, free sugars include all monosaccharides and disaccharides that are added to foods, plus those naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.\n\nSo, in cow's milk, lactose is a disaccharide, but it's not added; it's an intrinsic part of the milk.\n\nIn contrast, orange juice has sugars that are naturally present in the fruit, but when the juice is extracted, the fibers that would normally slow down sugar absorption are removed, making the sugars more readily available, similar to free sugars.\n\nTherefore, according to this reasoning, cow's milk does not contain free sugars, while natural unsweetened orange juice does contain free sugars due to the liberated sugars in the juice.\n\nThus, the answer should be A. Cow's milk.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not missing something, let me check some resources.\n\nUpon checking, I find that the WHO indeed classifies sugars in fruit juices as free sugars because the sugars are present in the liquid portion outside of the intact cells of the fruit.\n\nIn contrast, whole fruits have fibers that encapsulate the sugars, which are then digested more slowly, making them less impactful in terms of blood sugar spikes.\n\nTherefore, natural unsweetened orange juice would contain free sugars, whereas cow's milk does not.\n\nSo, the final answer should be A. Cow's milk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
