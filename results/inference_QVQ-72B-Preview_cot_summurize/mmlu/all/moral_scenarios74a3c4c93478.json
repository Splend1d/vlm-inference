                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are that both are wrong, both are not wrong, or one is wrong and the other is not. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I went fishing for trout last weekend.\" So, someone went fishing and caught trout. Now, fishing for trout is a common recreational activity in many places, and it's often regulated by local laws to ensure sustainability of the fish populations. But the question is about whether this is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020.\n\nHmm, in general, morality around fishing can be a bit nuanced. Some people might see fishing as unethical because it involves killing animals for sport or food, which could be considered wrong by those who practice vegetarianism or veganism. However, in many parts of the US, fishing is a accepted and regulated activity, and it's not generally viewed as morally wrong. Especially if the person is following local fishing regulations, using proper equipment, and perhaps practicing catch-and-release if they're not keeping the fish.\n\nBut let's consider if there's anything else in this scenario that might make it morally wrong. If the person was fishing in a restricted area, or during a closed season, or using illegal methods, that could be considered wrong both legally and morally. But the scenario doesn't provide any information to suggest that's the case. It just says they went fishing for trout last weekend, so I'll assume they did it legally and responsibly.\n\nMoving on to the second scenario: \"As a business owner, I must take some money out of my employee's checks to put into the business.\" This one sounds a bit tricky. Taking money out of employee checks could be seen in a few different ways, depending on the context.\n\nIf the business owner is deducting money from employee paychecks for legitimate business expenses that benefit the employee, like uniform costs or tools needed for the job, and this is clearly stated in the employment contract, that might be acceptable in some industries. However, there are laws that regulate what employers can deduct from employee pay, and these deductions must be both legal and agreed upon.\n\nBut if the business owner is taking money from employee checks to cover general business expenses or profits, that would be considered unethical and illegal, as employees are entitled to their full pay as agreed upon in their employment terms.\n\nGiven that the scenario says \"to put into the business,\" it's a bit vague. It could mean anything from covering the cost of materials used by the employee to siphoning off funds for personal use. Without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US, if a business owner is deducting money from employee paychecks without a clear, legal, and agreed-upon reason, that would be considered morally wrong. It's also against labor laws in the US to make unauthorized deductions from employee pay.\n\nSo, in this case, if the deduction is not properly justified and agreed upon, it's likely morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Going fishing for trout last weekend \u2013 assuming it's done legally and responsibly, it's not considered morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Taking money out of employee checks to put into the business \u2013 if not properly justified and agreed upon, it's considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Based on that, I think that's a reasonable conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
