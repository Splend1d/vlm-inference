                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: find the smallest whole number that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. The options are 67, 43, 57, and 37. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about finding a number that satisfies three specific conditions related to division and remainders. This sounds like a system of congruences, which is a concept in number theory. I think I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here, but I'm not entirely sure about that yet. Maybe I'll start by writing down what each condition means in mathematical terms.\n\nSo, let's denote the number we're looking for as \\(n\\). The conditions are:\n\n1. \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\)\n\n2. \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\)\n\n3. \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\nAlright, so \\(n\\) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by both 4 and 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. I need to find the smallest whole number \\(n\\) that satisfies all three of these congruences simultaneously.\n\nLet me think about the first two congruences: \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\) and \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\). If \\(n\\) is congruent to 1 modulo both 4 and 3, that means \\(n\\) is congruent to 1 modulo the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 3. The LCM of 4 and 3 is 12, so \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}\\).\n\nNow, I have two congruences:\n\n1. \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}\\)\n\n2. \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\nSo, \\(n = 12k + 1\\) for some integer \\(k\\), and this must also satisfy \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\).\n\nLet's substitute \\(n = 12k + 1\\) into the second congruence:\n\n\\(12k + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\nI can simplify this by reducing 12 modulo 5. Since 12 divided by 5 is 2 with a remainder of 2, this becomes:\n\n\\(2k + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(2k + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\(2k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\nNow, I need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 5, which is the number that, when multiplied by 2, gives 1 modulo 5. The inverse of 2 modulo 5 is 3, because \\(2 \\times 3 = 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\).\n\nSo, multiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\(k \\equiv 3 \\times 1 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\n\\(k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\nThis means \\(k = 5m + 3\\) for some integer \\(m\\).\n\nNow, substitute back into \\(n = 12k + 1\\):\n\n\\(n = 12(5m + 3) + 1 = 60m + 36 + 1 = 60m + 37\\)\n\nSo, \\(n \\equiv 37 \\pmod{60}\\)\n\nTherefore, the possible values of \\(n\\) are 37, 97, 157, etc., all differing by 60.\n\nBut the problem asks for the smallest whole number, so the smallest value is 37.\n\nWait a minute, but 37 is one of the options. Let me check if 37 satisfies all the original conditions.\n\nFirst, divide 37 by 4: 37 \u00f7 4 = 9 with a remainder of 1. Good.\n\nDivide by 3: 37 \u00f7 3 = 12 with a remainder of 1. Good.\n\nDivide by 5: 37 \u00f7 5 = 7 with a remainder of 2. Perfect.\n\nSo, 37 satisfies all three conditions.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure there isn't a smaller number that also satisfies the conditions.\n\nOption D is 37.\n\nOption C is 57.\n\nOption B is 43.\n\nOption A is 67.\n\nLet's check 57:\n\n57 \u00f7 4 = 14 with a remainder of 1.\n\n57 \u00f7 3 = 19 with a remainder of 0. It should have a remainder of 1, so 57 doesn't satisfy the second condition.\n\nTherefore, 57 is not a solution.\n\nNow, 43:\n\n43 \u00f7 4 = 10 with a remainder of 3. Should be 1, so it doesn't satisfy the first condition.\n\nNot a solution.\n\n67:\n\n67 \u00f7 4 = 16 with a remainder of 3. Should be 1.\n\nNot a solution.\n\nSo, among the given options, 37 is the smallest whole number that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nWait, but in theory, is there a possibility of a smaller number outside of these options? For example, if I take \\(n = 37 - 60 = -23\\), that would also satisfy \\(n \\equiv 37 \\pmod{60}\\), but since it's negative, it's not considered as a whole number (assuming whole numbers are non-negative integers).\n\nTherefore, 37 is indeed the smallest whole number that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{37} \\]"
