                    "text": "So I've got this question about fractures, and I need to figure out which type of fracture matches the description: a fracture where the radius is bent but not displaced, and the skin is intact. The options are:\n\nA. Closed, greenstick\n\nB. Complex, comminuted\n\nC. Compound, transverse\n\nD. Open, spiral\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means in the context of fractures.\n\nStarting with \"closed\" and \"open\": \n\n- Closed fracture means that the skin over the broken bone remains intact; there's no open wound communicating with the break.\n\n- Open fracture, on the other hand, involves a break in the skin, either because the bone pierces through the skin or due to severe soft tissue damage.\n\nGiven that the problem states the skin is intact, it should be a closed fracture. So, options C and D, which mention \"compound\" and \"open,\" respectively, seem less likely.\n\nBut let's look closer. \"Compound\" fracture typically refers to an open fracture, where the bone protrudes through the skin. So, since the skin is intact, it shouldn't be compound.\n\nNow, between options A and B:\n\nA. Closed, greenstick\n\nB. Complex, comminuted\n\nI need to understand what \"greenstick\" and \"comminuted\" mean.\n\n\"Greenstick fracture\" is a type of incomplete fracture, commonly seen in children, where the bone is bent and partially broken, similar to breaking a greenstick in wood, which bends and splinters rather than breaking cleanly. This usually occurs without significant displacement of the bone fragments.\n\n\"Comminuted fracture\" is a more severe type of break where the bone is shattered into three or more pieces. \"Complex\" might refer to the involvement of multiple fragments or complications in the fracture.\n\nGiven that the radius is bent but not displaced, a greenstick fracture seems more fitting because it involves bending without complete separation of the bone, and no displacement of fragments.\n\nOn the other hand, a comminuted fracture involves multiple fragments, which isn't described here.\n\nTherefore, option A, closed greenstick fracture, seems the most appropriate choice based on the description provided.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider \"transverse\" and \"spiral\" fractures as well.\n\n- Transverse fracture: a straight across break, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone.\n\n- Spiral fracture: a break that occurs when a twisting force causes the bone to fracture in a spiral pattern.\n\nNeither of these seems to match the description of a bent but not displaced radius.\n\nAdditionally, \"closed\" matches the intact skin, and \"greenstick\" matches the bending without displacement.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Closed, greenstick.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
