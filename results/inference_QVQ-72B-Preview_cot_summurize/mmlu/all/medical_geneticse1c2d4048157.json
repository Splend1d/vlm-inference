                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about genetics. It says that both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, and I need to find out the probability that each of their children will be affected. The options are 1 in 4, 1 in 2, 2 in 3, or 1. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on genetics, but I remember some basics about dominant and recessive traits.\n\nFirst off, I know that autosomal recessive means that the disorder is caused by a recessive gene on one of the autosomes, not the sex chromosomes. So, both males and females can be affected equally. Now, if both parents are affected, that means they both must have two copies of the recessive allele, right? Because for a recessive disorder, you need two copies to express the condition.\n\nSo, let's denote the alleles. Let's say the dominant allele is A, which confers normal function, and the recessive allele is a, which causes the disorder when present in two copies. So, both parents are aa, meaning they have two recessive alleles and are expressing the disorder.\n\nNow, when they have children, what are the possible combinations? Well, each parent can pass on only a to their child because that's the only allele they have. So, the child will receive one a from each parent, making the child aa, which is affected.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. If both parents are aa, then the child has to be aa. So, does that mean the probability is 1, as in 100%? But let's think carefully. Maybe there are exceptions or other factors at play here.\n\nLet me consider if there could be any other possibilities. For example, could there be a dominant allele present somehow? No, the question states that it's an autosomal recessive disorder, so the dominant allele should be normal. But just to be sure, let's assume that both parents are homozygous recessive, meaning they both have two a alleles.\n\nIn Mendelian genetics, when two homozygous recessive individuals mate, all of their offspring should also be homozygous recessive, meaning they will express the disorder. So, in this case, the probability should be 1, meaning 100% of the children will be affected.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something about incomplete penetrance or variable expression, but the question doesn't mention that. It seems like a straightforward Mendelian inheritance pattern.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be D. 1, meaning 100% probability that each child will be affected.\n\nWait, but one of the options is \"1 in 4,\" which is typical in genetics problems, like when both parents are heterozygous carriers, the probability of having an affected child is 1 in 4. But in this case, both parents are homozygous recessive, so that shouldn't apply here.\n\nAnother option is \"1 in 2,\" which would be if one parent is heterozygous and the other is homozygous recessive, but again, that's not the case here. And \"2 in 3\" seems arbitrary in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should indeed be D. 1, meaning that every child will be affected if both parents are affected with an autosomal recessive disorder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
