                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a store that bought five sofas on August 4 for $7,000, with terms 2/10, n/30. They paid the invoice on August 13, and I need to figure out how much they paid. The options are $7,140, $7,000, $6,860, and $6,300.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"terms 2/10, n/30\" means. I remember that in accounting, these terms refer to the payment conditions of the invoice. Specifically, \"2/10\" means there's a 2% discount if the invoice is paid within 10 days, and \"n/30\" means the full amount is due in 30 days if the discount isn't taken.\n\nSo, the invoice amount is $7,000. If the store pays within 10 days, they get a 2% discount. If they pay after 10 days, they have to pay the full amount.\n\nNow, the invoice was purchased on August 4, and paid on August 13. Let me calculate the number of days between these dates. From August 4 to August 13 is 9 days. So, it's within the 10-day period, which means the store can take the 2% discount.\n\nTo find the discount amount, I need to calculate 2% of $7,000. Let's see, 2% of $7,000 is (2/100) * 7000 = $140.\n\nSo, the discount is $140. Therefore, the amount they need to pay is the invoice amount minus the discount. That is $7,000 - $140 = $6,860.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The terms are 2/10, n/30, which means if they pay within 10 days, they get a 2% discount. The payment was made on August 13, which is the 9th day from August 4, so yes, they qualify for the discount.\n\nAlso, just to be sure, I should confirm if the discount is calculated on the total invoice amount or if there's any other calculation involved. In standard terms, it's straightforward: pay within 10 days, get 2% off.\n\nSo, $7,000 minus 2% is $6,860. That would be the answer.\n\nWait, but one of the options is $6,300. Is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe there's tax involved or some other fees, but the problem doesn't mention any additional costs. It only mentions the invoice amount and the payment terms.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider if the discount applies to the total amount or if there are other considerations, but again, based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might think that the discount applies to the total amount including tax or something, but again, the problem doesn't provide any information about tax or other additions to the invoice amount.\n\nAlso, considering the payment date, which is within the discount period, so the discount should apply.\n\nLet me see the other options:\n\nA. $7,140 \u2013 that seems higher than the invoice amount. Maybe if there was interest or something, but the problem doesn't mention any interest or late fees.\n\nB. $7,000 \u2013 that's the full invoice amount. But since the payment was within 10 days, they should get the discount, so paying the full amount wouldn't be correct.\n\nC. $6,860 \u2013 which is $7,000 minus 2%, which matches our calculation.\n\nD. $6,300 \u2013 that's $7,000 minus $700, which would be a 10% discount, but the terms specify a 2% discount, not 10%.\n\nSo, unless there's a miscalculation, $6,860 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any compounding or other financial calculations that might change this, but given the straightforward terms, it's unnecessary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. $6,860.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
