Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's about which factor contributed least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa between 1750 and 1900. The options are the invention of the machine gun, vaccines for tropical diseases, the development of the joint-stock company, and the invention of steam-powered ships. I need to pick the one that mattered the least in this context.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what \"penetrate\" means in this historical context. I think it refers to Europe's increased involvement and control over African territories during that period, leading up to the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century.\n\nSo, Europe was trying to exert more influence and eventually colonize parts of Africa. To do that, they needed certain advantages or tools that gave them an edge over the local populations.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. The invention of the machine gun.\n\nI know that the machine gun was invented in the late 19th century. It was a significant advancement in weaponry, allowing for rapid fire and greater lethality. If Europe was using this technology against African armies that didn't have access to the same weapons, it would give them a massive military advantage. This could have been crucial in subduing resistance and establishing control.\n\nBut, since the question is about the period from 1750 to 1900, and the machine gun was invented towards the end of that period, maybe it didn't have as big an impact throughout the entire period. However, even if it was only towards the end, it might still have been a significant factor in accelerating European dominance.\n\nB. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases.\n\nDisease has always been a big obstacle for Europeans trying to operate in tropical climates. Things like malaria, yellow fever, and sleeping sickness were major killers, making it dangerous for Europeans to spend extended periods in Africa. If they couldn't stay healthy, they couldn't effectively administer or exploit the regions.\n\nVaccines for these diseases would have made it safer for Europeans to live and work in Africa, thereby facilitating longer-term presence and deeper involvement.\n\nBut when were these vaccines invented? I think vaccines for some tropical diseases were developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, a vaccine for yellow fever was developed in the early 20th century, which is just after our period. Malaria vaccines have been more recent developments.\n\nSo, perhaps during the 1750-1900 period, vaccines for tropical diseases weren't widely available or effective enough to make a big difference. If that's the case, then this factor might not have contributed as much to European penetration of Africa compared to the other options.\n\nC. The development of the joint-stock company.\n\nA joint-stock company is a business entity where individuals can own shares and invest in the company, sharing in its profits and risks. This form of organization was crucial for raising capital for large-scale ventures, like exploration, trade, and colonization.\n\nCompanies like the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company were joint-stock companies that played significant roles in establishing European presence in Asia and Africa. They had the financial backing and the organizational structure to undertake long-term projects and manage risks.\n\nIn the context of Africa, joint-stock companies could have been involved in trade, resource extraction, and even colonization efforts. They provided the necessary funds and infrastructure to penetrate deeper into African territories.\n\nSo, the development of the joint-stock company seems like a pretty important factor in enabling European expansion into Africa.\n\nD. The invention of steam-powered ships.\n\nBefore the invention of steam-powered ships, maritime transportation relied on sail power, which was dependent on wind conditions and could be unreliable for long voyages.\n\nSteam-powered ships, which emerged in the early 19th century, revolutionized sea travel by providing a more consistent and faster means of transportation, less dependent on wind and currents.\n\nThis technological advancement made it easier for Europeans to transport troops, supplies, and goods to and from Africa more efficiently. It also allowed for better communication and control over distant territories.\n\nTherefore, steam-powered ships were a game-changer in Europe's ability to penetrate and control African regions.\n\nNow, to answer the question: which of these contributed least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa from 1750 to 1900?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Machine gun: invented late in the period, but still a significant military advantage.\n\nB. Vaccines for tropical diseases: not widely available or effective until after 1900.\n\nC. Joint-stock companies: developed early on and played a major role in financing and organizing European expansion.\n\nD. Steam-powered ships: invented in the early 19th century and greatly improved maritime capabilities.\n\nGiven that vaccines for tropical diseases weren't effectively developed until after 1900, they likely had less impact during the specified period compared to the other innovations and developments listed.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nMachine guns were indeed invented in the late 19th century and were used in various colonial conflicts, giving Europeans a significant military edge.\n\nJoint-stock companies were already in place by the 17th century and continued to be important throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nSteam-powered ships became increasingly common from the early 19th century onwards, greatly facilitating maritime trade and movement.\n\nVaccines for tropical diseases, however, weren't developed until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and their widespread use came after 1900.\n\nTherefore, during the period from 1750 to 1900, vaccines for tropical diseases wouldn't have had as big an impact as the other factors listed.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
