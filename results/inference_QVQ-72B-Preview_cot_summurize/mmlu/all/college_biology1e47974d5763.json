                    "text": "Let's see. I'm studying plant embryogenesis, and I have this question here with four statements. I need to find out which one is incorrect. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst statement: \"The suspensor is derived from the basal cell.\" I remember that during early embryogenesis in plants, the zygote divides to form two cells: the apical cell and the basal cell. The apical cell gives rise to the embryo proper, while the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor. So, this seems correct.\n\nSecond statement: \"Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell.\" Cotyledons are part of the embryo and are involved in nutrient absorption from the seed. Since the apical cell gives rise to the embryo proper, it makes sense that cotyledons come from the apical cell. So, this also seems right.\n\nThird statement: \"Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.\" Hmm, I think I need to recall the sequence of events. Meristems are regions of active cell division in plants, and the shoot apical meristem is responsible for stem and leaf growth. In embryogenesis, the embryo develops within the seed, and after germination, the seedling emerges. I think the shoot apical meristem is formed during embryogenesis, not after seed formation. So, this statement might be incorrect.\n\nFourth statement: \"Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis.\" Plant tissues are typically divided into three systems: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. Embryogenesis involves the development of the basic body plan of the plant, so it's likely that the precursors to these tissue systems are established during this phase. Therefore, this seems correct.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the third statement seems to be incorrect because the shoot apical meristem is formed during embryogenesis, not after seed formation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. I found that the shoot apical meristem is indeed established during embryogenesis in angiosperms. It's a crucial part of the embryo, and it's responsible for post-embryonic growth. So, the statement saying it occurs after seed formation is probably wrong.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll confirm the other statements again. The suspensor does come from the basal cell, cotyledons from the apical cell, and tissue system precursors are formed during embryogenesis. Yes, all of these seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is C: Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
