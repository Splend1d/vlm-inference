                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this ladder problem. A 26-foot ladder is leaning against a building, and the foot of the ladder is moving away from the building at 3 feet per second. When the foot is 10 feet from the building, I need to find out how fast the top of the ladder is moving down at that moment. The options are A. 46/3, B. 3/4, C. 5/4, D. 5/2.\n\nOkay, first things first, this sounds like a related rates problem, right? So, I need to use calculus, specifically implicit differentiation, to relate the rates of change of different parts of the ladder.\n\nLet me define some variables. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let x be the distance from the foot of the ladder to the building.\n\n- Let y be the height of the top of the ladder from the ground.\n\nWe know that the ladder is 26 feet long, so by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 26\u00b2\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 676\n\nNow, I need to find dy/dt, the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down, when x = 10 feet.\n\nGiven that dx/dt = 3 ft/s (since the foot is moving away from the building).\n\nI need to find dy/dt when x = 10.\n\nAlright, so I need to differentiate the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 676 with respect to time t.\n\nDifferentiating both sides:\n\nd(x\u00b2)/dt + d(y\u00b2)/dt = d(676)/dt\n\nWhich gives:\n\n2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0\n\nBecause 676 is a constant, its derivative is zero.\n\nNow, I can plug in the known values.\n\nFirst, find y when x = 10.\n\nFrom x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 676,\n\n10\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 676\n\n100 + y\u00b2 = 676\n\ny\u00b2 = 676 - 100\n\ny\u00b2 = 576\n\ny = 24 feet (since y is positive)\n\nNow, plug in x = 10, y = 24, and dx/dt = 3 ft/s into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(10)(3) + 2(24) dy/dt = 0\n\n60 + 48 dy/dt = 0\n\n48 dy/dt = -60\n\ndy/dt = -60 / 48\n\ndy/dt = -5/4 ft/s\n\nThe negative sign indicates that y is decreasing, which makes sense because the top of the ladder is moving down.\n\nSo, the rate is 5/4 ft/s downward.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 46/3\n\nB. 3/4\n\nC. 5/4\n\nD. 5/2\n\nSo, option C. 5/4 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 676 is correct for the ladder.\n\nDifferentiating it gives 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0, which seems right.\n\nPlugging in x = 10 and y = 24, dx/dt = 3, and solving for dy/dt gives -5/4, which makes sense because the top is moving down.\n\nSo, yes, the rate is 5/4 ft/s downward, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{4}} \\]"
