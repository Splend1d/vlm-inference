Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children.

                    "text": "So I've got this case of a 5-year-old girl who's been having some issues. Her parents are worried because she seems to get injured a lot, especially since she started walking later than usual at 14 months. Now, she's having chest pain when she exercises and her knees and ankles hurt or swell after playing soccer. She also wears glasses, and there's a family history of some pretty serious health problems. Her brother had to have surgery for a rotator cuff injury from just taking a shower, and her maternal cousin died young from a ruptured aortic aneurysm. That's really heavy stuff.\n\nToday, she's walking with a limp, and her left ankle is swollen and tender. She's really tall for her age, being at the 99th percentile, but her weight is average. When the doctor listened to her heart, they heard something called a midsystolic click, which might be important. Also, her joints are extra flexible, like her knees bend backward more than normal, her thumbs can touch her forearms, and she can bend over and touch the floor easily with straight knees. All these signs point towards a possible connective tissue disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what connective tissue disorders could cause these symptoms. One that comes to mind is Marfan syndrome. Marfan's is known for affecting the connective tissue in various parts of the body, including the eyes, bones, heart, and blood vessels. Let's see how the symptoms fit:\n\n- Late walking: Could be due to joint laxity making it harder to balance.\n\n- Recurrent injuries and clumsiness: Again, joint laxity could lead to frequent falls and injuries.\n\n- Chest pain with exertion: This could be related to cardiovascular issues, possibly aortic root dilation, which is common in Marfan's.\n\n- Pain and swelling in knees and ankles after exercise: Could be due to joint instability or overuse injuries because of lax ligaments.\n\n- Wearing glasses: Many people with Marfan's have eye problems like myopia or ectopia lentis, where the lens is displaced.\n\n- Family history: Her brother had a rotator cuff injury from a simple activity, which could suggest joint laxity or weakness in connective tissues. Her cousin died young from a ruptured aortic aneurysm, which is a major complication of Marfan's.\n\n- Physical examination: She's tall with long limbs, which is a common feature in Marfan's. The midsystolic click could be from mitral valve prolapse, which is also associated with the condition.\n\n- Hypermobile joints, including genu recurvatum (knees that bend backward), thumbs that can touch the forearms, and easy forward bending with straight knees: All these point to generalized ligamentous laxity, a key feature of Marfan's.\n\nAnother condition that can present with similar symptoms is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), particularly the hypermobility type. EDS is also characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. However, EDS typically doesn't involve the eyes or the cardiovascular system as prominently as Marfan's does.\n\nGiven the family history of aortic aneurysm and the presence of a midsystolic click, which could indicate mitral valve prolapse, Marfan's seems higher on the differential here compared to EDS.\n\nLet me consider other possibilities. Stickler syndrome is another connective tissue disorder that can cause early-onset myopia and joint problems, but it's less likely to cause the cardiovascular issues seen in Marfan's.\n\nNeurofibromatosis can sometimes affect connective tissues, but it's more known for its effects on the nervous system and skin.\n\nSo, leaning towards Marfan's, what would be the next best step in diagnosis?\n\nOption A is a skeletal survey. A skeletal survey involves taking multiple X-rays of the bones to look for fractures, malformations, or other abnormalities. While this might show some skeletal features of Marfan's, like long, slender bones or arachnodactyly (long, thin fingers), it's not the most specific or sensitive test for diagnosing Marfan's syndrome.\n\nOption B is echocardiography. This is an ultrasound of the heart that can visualize the structure and function of the heart's valves and chambers. In Marfan's syndrome, common cardiac findings include dilation of the aortic root, mitral valve prolapse, and aortic regurgitation. Given that the patient has a midsystolic click, which could indicate mitral valve prolapse, and considering the family history of aortic aneurysm, echocardiography seems particularly relevant here. It could help confirm whether there are any cardiac manifestations of Marfan's syndrome.\n\nOption C is a bone scan. A bone scan involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the bloodstream and then using a special camera to detect areas of increased activity, which might indicate fractures, infections, or tumors. While this could potentially show areas of bone stress or injury, it's not specific to Marfan's syndrome and doesn't directly assess the connective tissue abnormalities seen in this condition.\n\nOption D is an MRI of the shoulder. Given that the patient's brother had a rotator cuff injury, and she hasn't reported any specific shoulder issues, this seems less relevant at this stage. Unless there's a specific concern about the shoulder, which isn't indicated in the current presentation, an MRI of the shoulder wouldn't be the first choice for evaluating a suspected connective tissue disorder like Marfan's.\n\nConsidering all this, echocardiography seems like the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. It can help evaluate for cardiac involvement, which is crucial in Marfan's syndrome, especially given the family history of aortic aneurysm and the patient's symptoms of chest pain with exertion.\n\nAdditionally, if Marfan's is suspected, genetic testing could be considered to confirm the diagnosis, as it's caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. However, echocardiography is a non-invasive test that can provide important information quickly and is essential for managing potential cardiac complications.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Echocardiography.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
