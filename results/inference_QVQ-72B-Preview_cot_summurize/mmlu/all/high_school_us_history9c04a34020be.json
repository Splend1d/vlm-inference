                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this poem by Phillis Wheatley, and I need to compare its point to one of these famous documents or speeches. Let me see. First, I should probably understand what the poem is saying.\n\nThe title is \"On Being Brought from Africa to America.\" Hmm, that suggests that the poet is reflecting on her experience of being brought from Africa to America, probably as a slave, given the historical context. She mentions that it was mercy that brought her from her \"Pagan land\" and taught her soul to understand that there is a God and a Savior. She says she didn't know about redemption before.\n\nSo, she's grateful for being introduced to Christianity, which is interesting because often we think of slavery as a terrible institution, which it was. But here, she's finding some positivity in it, at least in terms of her spiritual awakening.\n\nThen she addresses the fact that some people look down on her race, saying that their dark skin is a \"diabolic die,\" meaning maybe that it's marked by the devil or something evil. But she counters that by saying that even people as dark as Cain (from the Bible) can be refined and join the angelic train, meaning they can be saved and become as pure as angels.\n\nSo, her main point seems to be about the equality of souls before God, regardless of skin color. She's arguing that black people can be just as pious and saved as white people.\n\nNow, I need to compare this point to the options given:\n\nA. The Declaration of Independence\n\nB. Jonathan Edwards's sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\"\n\nC. The Seneca Falls Declaration of Rights and Sentiments\n\nD. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\u201d speech\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nA. The Declaration of Independence states that \"all men are created equal\" and have certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. While this does touch on equality, it's more about political freedom and independence from British rule. It doesn't specifically address racial equality or the idea of equality before God in the way Wheatley does.\n\nB. Jonathan Edwards's sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\" is about the idea that sinners are hanging over the fires of hell by a thin thread, and only God's mercy prevents them from falling. It's a very different theme from Wheatley's poem. It's more about the wrath of God and the need for repentance, not about racial equality or the potential for redemption of a particular group.\n\nC. The Seneca Falls Declaration of Rights and Sentiments is a document from the women's rights movement, outlining the inequalities faced by women and arguing for their equal rights, including the right to vote. Again, while it's about equality, it's focused on gender equality rather than racial equality.\n\nD. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\u201d speech is perhaps the most famous civil rights speech, calling for an end to racism and inequality, especially regarding African Americans. He talks about a future where people are judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. This seems very similar to Wheatley's message that black people can be just as pious and worthy of salvation as white people.\n\nSo, comparing all these, I think the one that most closely aligns with Wheatley's point is Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech. Both are advocating for the equality of black people, emphasizing that skin color should not determine a person's worth or opportunities, whether in terms of salvation or civil rights.\n\nWheatley is making a religious argument for equality before God, while King is making a broader social and political argument for equality before the law. But both share the underlying theme of equality regardless of race.\n\nI think the answer is D. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
