                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are 190 guests at a wedding, and I need to figure out the least number of circular tables needed to seat all of them, with each table seating exactly 8 people. The options are 22, 23, 24, or 25 tables.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. I need to divide 190 guests into groups of 8, since each table seats 8 people. So, if I divide 190 by 8, that should give me the number of tables needed.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 190 divided by 8.\n\n190 \u00f7 8 = 23.75\n\nHmm, so that means I need 23 tables to seat 184 people (since 23 \u00d7 8 = 184), and then I'd have 6 people left over (190 - 184 = 6). So, I'd need an additional table for those 6 people. Therefore, total tables needed would be 24.\n\nWait a second, but 23.75 suggests that I need 24 tables, but let's double-check that.\n\nIf I have 23 tables, each seating 8 people, that's 23 \u00d7 8 = 184 seats. But there are 190 guests, so 190 - 184 = 6 guests are left without seats. So, I need one more table to seat those 6, making it 24 tables in total.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way to arrange it differently, maybe using the fact that tables can't be partially used or something like that.\n\nNo, tables can only seat exactly 8 people; they can't be partially filled in this context. So, every table must have exactly 8 people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to minimize the number of tables further, but I don't think so. Since 190 divided by 8 is 23.75, and you can't have a fraction of a table, you have to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 24 tables.\n\nLet me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have 23 tables, each seating 8 people; that's 184 seats. The remaining 6 guests need one more table. So, yes, 24 tables are needed.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again:\n\nA. 22\n\nB. 23\n\nC. 24\n\nD. 25\n\nSo, according to my calculation, 24 is the correct answer. But let's see if 23 tables could work in some way.\n\nIf I have 23 tables, each seating 8 people, that's 184 seats, but there are 190 guests. So, 6 guests are left without seats, which isn't acceptable. Therefore, 23 tables are not enough.\n\nWhat if I have 22 tables? That would be 22 \u00d7 8 = 176 seats. But there are 190 guests, so 190 - 176 = 14 guests are left without seats. That's even worse.\n\nWhat about 25 tables? That would be 25 \u00d7 8 = 200 seats, which is more than enough, but it's probably not the least number of tables needed.\n\nSo, between 24 and 25, 24 seems more efficient. But let's confirm again.\n\n190 guests divided by 8 seats per table equals 23.75. Since you can't have a fraction of a table, you need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 24.\n\nTherefore, the least number of tables needed is 24.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
