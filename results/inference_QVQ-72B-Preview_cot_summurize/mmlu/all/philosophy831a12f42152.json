                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The view that art is defined by its form is known as _____.\" And the options are A. informalism, B. expressionism, C. formalism, D. structuralism. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these terms refers to the idea that art is defined by its form.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand what \"art is defined by its form\" means. I think it means that the way art looks\u2014its visual elements like color, shape, line, texture, and composition\u2014are what make it art. So, it's more about the formal properties rather than the content or the emotions it conveys.\n\nOkay, with that in mind, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Informalism: I'm not super familiar with this term in the context of art. Let me think... informalism sounds like it might be related to a lack of form or structure, maybe emphasizing spontaneity or randomness in art. If that's the case, it doesn't seem to fit the idea that art is defined by its form.\n\nB. Expressionism: I know expressionism is an art movement that emphasizes the artist's emotional state and personal perspective. It's more about expressing feelings and ideas through distorted forms rather than focusing solely on the formal properties of the art. So, again, not directly about defining art by its form.\n\nC. Formalism: This one seems promising. Formalism in art is often associated with a focus on the formal elements\u2014the visual components like line, color, shape, etc. It emphasizes that these elements are what make something art, rather than its subject matter or the artist's intentions. So, this aligns pretty closely with the idea that art is defined by its form.\n\nD. Structuralism: I associate structuralism more with the study of structures in human culture, like language or social systems. In art, it might refer to works that explore the underlying structures or patterns. While it does involve form, it seems a bit different from the notion that art is defined purely by its formal properties.\n\nSo, based on this, it looks like C. formalism is the best answer. But just to be sure, maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other context that could change this. For example, could \"informalism\" actually refer to a focus on form in a negative way? No, that doesn't seem right. Informalism might suggest a rejection of strict formal rules, perhaps, but it doesn't directly equate to defining art by its form.\n\nExpressionism is clearly about expression of emotion and ideas, which is more about the content or the message of the art, not just its form.\n\nStructuralism, while it does involve analyzing structures, is more about the systems behind art rather than the formal properties themselves.\n\nFormalism, on the other hand, is directly concerned with the formal aspects of art\u2014the visual or aesthetic components that make up the work.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. formalism.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should think about some examples. For instance, abstract art often focuses on form without representing real-world objects. That would be an example of formalism in action, where the art is defined by its visual elements rather than its subject matter.\n\nAnother example could be the work of artists like Kazimir Malevich or Piet Mondrian, who emphasized geometric forms and minimalistic designs. Their art is defined by formal properties like shape, color, and composition, reinforcing the idea that art can be defined by its form.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I've got it. The view that art is defined by its form is known as formalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. formalism}} \\]"
