                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which of these people is considered unemployed. The options are Mary, who quit her job to look for another; John, who retired early at age 45; and Diane, who works part-time but wants a full-time job. The choices are A. I only, B. II only, C. III only, D. I and III.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall the definition of unemployment. Unemployment is when someone is without a job but is willing and able to work, and is actively seeking employment. So, it's not just about not having a job, but also being available for work and looking for a job.\n\nLet's apply this to each person:\n\nI. Mary quit her job to look for another. She's actively seeking employment, so she should be considered unemployed, right? Wait, but did she quit voluntarily? I think that matters sometimes, like if someone quits without good cause, they might not be eligible for unemployment benefits, but I don't think that affects the unemployment status. As long as she's looking for work, she should be considered unemployed.\n\nII. John retired early at 45. Retirement typically means you're not looking for work anymore. So, even if he's not working, he's not seeking employment. That would mean he's not unemployed; he's just retired.\n\nIII. Diane works part-time but wants full-time work. So, she has some employment, but not as much as she'd like. Is this considered underemployment rather than unemployment? I think underemployment is when someone is working fewer hours than they would like, but they still have a job. Unemployment is when you have no job at all and are looking for work.\n\nSo, based on this, Mary should be considered unemployed because she quit her job and is looking for another job. John is retired and not seeking work, so he's not unemployed. Diane is working part-time and wants more hours, which might make her underemployed, but not necessarily unemployed since she has some form of employment.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if part-time workers who want full-time jobs are considered unemployed. Let me think. I think there's a category called \"involuntary part-time workers\" who are considered unemployed because they want full-time work but can only find part-time jobs. So, perhaps Diane could be considered unemployed in that sense.\n\nBut, in standard unemployment statistics, typically, if you have any form of employment, you're not considered unemployed. Unemployment is for those who have no job at all and are looking for work. So, Diane might be underemployed, but not unemployed.\n\nLet me double-check that. Unemployment rate is usually measured as the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labor force. The labor force includes all people who are employed or unemployed but looking for work. So, if Diane is working part-time and not looking for a new job, she might still be considered employed, even if she's underemployed.\n\nBut, there might be different definitions depending on the context. Maybe there's a concept of \"involuntary part-time employment\" where people are considered unemployed because they're working part-time for economic reasons, like inability to find full-time work.\n\nI think in many economic analyses, underemployment and unemployment are distinct concepts. So, for the purpose of this question, it's likely that only Mary is considered unemployed, since she has no job and is looking for work.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. I only.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider if there's any other perspective. Maybe in some definitions, underemployment is included in unemployment statistics. But I think in standard terms, unemployment refers to those without any employment who are seeking work.\n\nSo, I'll stick with my initial conclusion that only Mary is considered unemployed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
