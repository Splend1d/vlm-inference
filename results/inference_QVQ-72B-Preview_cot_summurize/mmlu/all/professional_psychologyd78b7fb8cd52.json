                    "text": "So I have this question about confidentiality, and I need to pick the correct statement. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that confidential information may be revealed to others only with the consent of the client. That sounds right. In general, therapists are supposed to keep client information private unless the client gives permission to share it.\n\nOption B says that in public lectures, it's unethical to relate vignettes about clients. Hmm, I thought that as long as you disguise the identity of the client, it's acceptable to use examples from practice in lectures. But maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption C says that case material may be discussed with colleagues concerned with the case only when a formal release of information has been obtained from the client. Wait, I thought that therapists can discuss cases with colleagues for consultation purposes without a formal release, as long as they don't reveal identifying information.\n\nOption D says that there are exceptions to the obligation to maintain confidentiality. That also sounds correct. I know that in certain situations, like if there's a risk of harm to the client or others, therapists might be required to break confidentiality.\n\nSo, I need to figure out which one of these is a correct statement about confidentiality. Maybe more than one is correct, but I need to pick the one that's most accurate.\n\nLet me think about option A again. It says that confidential information may be revealed to others only with the consent of the client. That's generally true, but there might be exceptions where the law requires disclosure without consent, like in cases of suspected abuse or when subpoenaed by a court. So, maybe it's not entirely accurate because it doesn't account for those exceptions.\n\nOption B says that in public lectures, it's unethical to relate vignettes about clients. But I thought that using anonymized case examples for educational purposes was acceptable, provided that the client's identity is protected. Maybe the concern is that even with anonymization, someone could still be identified, especially if the case is unique. Perhaps it's better to get client consent before using their case studies in public lectures. But I'm not sure if it's always required.\n\nOption C says that case material may be discussed with colleagues concerned with the case only when a formal release of information has been obtained from the client. But I thought that therapists can discuss cases with other professionals involved in the client's care without a formal release, as long as it's for treatment purposes and they take steps to maintain confidentiality. For example, in a multidisciplinary team meeting, they might discuss a client's progress without needing written consent each time.\n\nOption D seems straightforward: there are exceptions to the obligation to maintain confidentiality. That's true, as I mentioned earlier, in cases where there's a duty to warn or report, like with imminent harm or child abuse.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is asking for the single correct statement, not multiple. In that case, perhaps option D is the best answer because it's a general truth about confidentiality\u2014that there are times when disclosure is necessary or permitted by law.\n\nBut let's double-check. Option A is almost correct, but it doesn't account for legal exceptions. Option B might be too strict; it's generally acceptable to use anonymized case studies in lectures with proper precautions. Option C is also too restrictive because therapists often consult with colleagues or other professionals without a formal release, as long as they protect the client's identity.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the most accurate statement: there are exceptions to the obligation to maintain confidentiality. That's a fundamental principle in the field of psychology and therapy.\n\nI think the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
