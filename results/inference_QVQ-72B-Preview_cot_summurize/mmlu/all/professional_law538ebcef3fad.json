                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this evidence law problem. It's about the admissibility of a statement made by someone who's not present in court. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nSo, there's a defendant on trial for robbing a bank with his best friend. The best friend has skipped town and can't be found. The prosecutor wants to call the best friend's mom to testify about a conversation she had with her son the day before he left the country. She begged him not to go, but he said, \"Mom, I have to go. I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don't want them to catch me.\" The prosecutor also has other evidence showing that the defendant and the best friend were together on the morning of the robbery.\n\nThe question is, is this statement by the best friend to his mom admissible in court?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause.\n\nB. No, because the friend's statement to his mother was not corroborated.\n\nC. Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\nD. Yes, as a statement of the friend's state of mind that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the rules about hearsay and the confrontation clause.\n\nHearsay is generally not admissible unless there's an exception that allows it. The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment says that the accused has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against them. So, if a witness is testifying against the defendant, the defendant has the right to cross-examine that witness.\n\nNow, the statement in question is the best friend's statement to his mom: \"I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don't want them to catch me.\"\n\nThis is clearly hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is that the best friend was involved in the robbery.\n\nBut, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One of them is the statement against penal interest exception.\n\nThe statement against penal interest exception allows for the admission of a statement that, at the time it was made, was against the declarant's penal interest and was made under circumstances that indicate reliability.\n\nIn this case, the best friend's statement admits his involvement in a robbery, which is against his penal interest because it could lead to his prosecution for the crime.\n\nHowever, for this exception to apply, the declarant must be unavailable to testify, which he is since he's fled the country and can't be found.\n\nSo, the statement seems to fit the criteria for a statement against penal interest.\n\nBut, there's also the confrontation clause to consider. The Supreme Court has held that testimonial statements require the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, unless there's a recognized exception.\n\nSo, is this statement testimonial?\n\nTestimonial statements are those that are made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\n\nExamples include police interrogations, depositions, and affidavits.\n\nIn this case, the statement was made by the best friend to his mom during a private conversation, not in response to police questioning or in any formal setting.\n\nSo, it seems like this statement was not made for the purpose of creating a record for use at trial; it was a personal conversation between mother and son.\n\nTherefore, it's likely not testimonial, and the confrontation clause shouldn't bar its admission, provided that other exceptions to hearsay apply.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause.\n\nBut, according to Crawford v. Washington, statements against penal interest can be admissible without violating the confrontation clause, especially if they were not made testimonially. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nB. No, because the friend's statement to his mother was not corroborated.\n\nCorroboration might be relevant for the reliability of the statement, but it's not a direct requirement for admissibility under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. The fact that there's other evidence showing the defendant and the best friend were together on the morning of the robbery might provide some context, but it's not necessarily corroboration of the statement itself.\n\nC. Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\nThis seems accurate. The statement is against the declarant's penal interest, and it was not made testimonially, so it should be admissible.\n\nD. Yes, as a statement of the friend's state of mind that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\nThis suggests that the statement is being offered to show the friend's state of mind, perhaps to explain why he fled, but not necessarily to prove that he actually committed the robbery.\n\nHowever, in this context, the statement seems to be offered to prove that the best friend was involved in the robbery, which directly implicates the defendant since they were together that morning.\n\nSo, while the statement does reflect the friend's state of mind, its primary probative value is in establishing his involvement in the crime, which in turn supports the prosecution's case against the defendant.\n\nTherefore, it's being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is that the best friend was involved in the robbery.\n\nSo, while the state of mind exception to hearsay exists (where a statement is offered to prove the declarant's state of mind and not the truth of the matter asserted), in this case, it seems like the statement is being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nTherefore, the state of mind exception might not be the most appropriate here.\n\nGiven that, option C seems more accurate because the statement is against the penal interest of the declarant and was not made testimonially.\n\nOption D might be a bit of a stretch because, although the statement reflects a state of mind, it's being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is that the best friend was involved in the robbery.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C: Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
