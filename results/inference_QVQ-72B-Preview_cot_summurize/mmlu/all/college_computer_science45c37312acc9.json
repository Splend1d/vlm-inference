                    "text": "So I've got this problem about graph theory, and I need to figure out which of these three statements must be true for any connected, undirected graph G = (V, E). Let me try to understand each statement one by one.\n\nFirst, statement I says that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in the graph is even. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think there's a theorem in graph theory that says the sum of all vertex degrees is equal to twice the number of edges. So, if you have E edges, each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices (since it's undirected), so the total sum of degrees should be 2|E|. And since 2 times any integer is even, this sum must be even. So, statement I seems to be true.\n\nNext, statement II says that the number of edges is greater than or equal to the number of vertices minus one, i.e., |E| \u2265 |V| - 1. Now, I know that in a tree, which is a connected graph with no cycles, the number of edges is exactly |V| - 1. So, if G is a tree, then |E| = |V| - 1. But if there are cycles, then you'd need additional edges beyond |V| - 1 to connect all the vertices in a cycle. So, in that case, |E| > |V| - 1. Since the graph is connected, it can't have fewer edges than |V| - 1 because then it wouldn't be connected. So, this statement also seems to be true.\n\nNow, statement III says that the graph has at least one vertex with degree one. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I can think of connected graphs where no vertex has degree one. For example, a complete graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In K_3, which is a triangle, all vertices have degree two. Or a square, K_4, where again all vertices have degree three. So, in those cases, there are no vertices with degree one. Therefore, statement III must not be true for all connected, undirected graphs.\n\nSo, from this, it seems like statements I and II are always true, while statement III isn't necessarily true. But wait, the question is asking which of these must be true, and the options are given. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II\n\nBased on my reasoning, I and II are both true, so the answer should be D. I and II.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. For statement I, the sum of degrees being even is a well-known property in graph theory, so that's solid. For statement II, in a connected graph, you need at least |V| - 1 edges, and possibly more if there are cycles, so that also holds. And for statement III, as I thought of counterexamples where no vertex has degree one, it's not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
