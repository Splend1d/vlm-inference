                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1, which is from the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia in 1819. The article says, \"The Republics of Venezuela and New Granada are from this day on united in a single one under the glorious title of Republic of Colombia....\" So, basically, they're combining to form one country, Gran Colombia.\n\nThe question is asking which option would most undermine the expectations of this union expressed in that article. In other words, which of these options would most likely cause problems or lead to the breakdown of this newly formed union between Venezuela and New Granada.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries.\n\nHmm, this seems relevant because external interventions could affect the stability of newly formed nations. If powerful countries like the United States or European powers get involved, they might have their own interests that could disrupt the unity of Gran Colombia. For example, if one power supports one region and another supports another region, that could lead to divisions within the country.\n\nBut wait, in 1823, the United States issued the Monroe Doctrine, which warned European powers against intervening in the newly independent American republics. So, actually, US intervention might have been more about protecting the independence of these countries from European influence rather than causing divisions among them. Still, there could be influences and interventions that might not be directly military but could still cause problems.\n\nOption B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity between the former Spanish colonies of South America.\n\nThis seems contradictory at first glance. If nationalism is pressing for stronger unity, shouldn't that support the idea of Gran Colombia? Well, maybe not entirely. Nationalism can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can bring people together under a common identity, but on the other hand, it can also highlight differences and lead to separatist movements.\n\nIn the context of Gran Colombia, which was a union of different regions with their own distinct histories and cultures, rising nationalism in those regions could potentially lead to demands for greater autonomy or even separation. For example, if nationalism in Venezuela\u5f3a\u8c03 their unique identity, they might push for more control over their own affairs rather than being part of a larger union.\n\nOption C: Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent Latin American states.\n\nThis is an interesting point. Slave rebellions could certainly cause instability within a country. In the case of Gran Colombia, slavery was prevalent, especially in certain regions. If there were slave uprisings, that could lead to internal conflicts and possibly regional divisions, as different areas might handle the situations differently.\n\nHowever, I need to think about how directly this would undermine the expectations of the union expressed in Article 1. The union was about combining Venezuela and New Granada into one republic, and slave rebellions might distract the government or lead to tensions, but it's not immediately clear how they would directly cause the union to fall apart.\n\nOption D: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states.\n\nSectionalism refers to the dominance of regional interests over national interests. If elites in different territories of Gran Colombia prioritized their local concerns over the good of the entire country, this could lead to policies that benefit one region at the expense of others, causing resentment and divisions.\n\nMoreover, elites often hold significant political and economic power, so if they're divided along regional lines, that could make it very difficult to govern the country effectively as a single unit.\n\nNow, considering all these options, I need to determine which one would most undermine the expectations of the union expressed in Article 1.\n\nLet me consider the timing. The Fundamental Law was passed in 1819, and the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil was in 1824. So, we're looking at the early 19th century, a time when many Latin American countries were gaining independence from Spain and trying to establish stable governments.\n\nIn the case of Gran Colombia, it was a federation that included present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. However, this federation didn't last long; it dissolved in 1831 due to regional tensions and differences.\n\nGiven that, it seems that internal divisions were a significant factor in the breakup of Gran Colombia. External interventions might have played a role, but the primary causes were more likely internal.\n\nBetween options B and D, both relate to internal divisions, but I think sectionalism of elites (option D) might be more directly related to the breakdown of the union. Elites holding power in different regions could have different visions and interests, making it hard to maintain a unified national government.\n\nNationalism (option B) could cut both ways: it could foster unity based on a common national identity or it could highlight regional differences and lead to separatism. In the case of Gran Colombia, it seems that regional nationalisms were stronger than the idea of a single Colombian nation.\n\nSlave rebellions (option C) were indeed a issue in the region, particularly in places like Cuba and Brazil, but I'm not sure how directly they affected Gran Colombia. Slavery was present, but I don't recall any major slave uprisings in those specific territories during that period.\n\nExternal interventions (option A) could have been a factor, but again, the primary challenges to Gran Colombia were internal.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option D, sectionalism of elites in the various territories, is the most likely answer. It directly relates to the internal divisions that made it difficult to maintain the union between Venezuela and New Granada as envisioned in Article 1 of the Fundamental Law.\n\nTo confirm, I'll look up a bit about the history of Gran Colombia. I recall that Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was a key figure in its creation, but even he faced challenges in keeping the different regions together. Differences in economic interests, cultural identities, and political ambitions led to tensions and ultimately to the dissolution of the federation.\n\nSo, yes, sectionalism among elites, who likely represented these regional differences, would have been a major obstacle to the expected unity and cooperation under the new republic.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
