                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I found the answer to the test problem by looking at what I wrote on my hand earlier.\" So, someone wrote something on their hand and used it to answer a test question. Hmm, that sounds a lot like cheating. In schools and colleges, cheating is usually considered wrong because it's dishonest. It's giving yourself an unfair advantage over others who are answering the questions based on their knowledge. Cheating can also undermine the whole purpose of testing, which is to assess what you've learned.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some situations where using notes is allowed. For example, sometimes teachers permit students to use cheat sheets or notes during tests. If that's the case here, then it might not be wrong. However, the way it's phrased suggests sneakiness, like the person didn't get permission to use the notes. So, probably, this is cheating, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I fired the gun at the child's eye at the shooting range.\" Okay, this one seems straightforwardly wrong. Firing a gun at a child's eye is extremely dangerous and could cause serious injury or even death. It's not only morally wrong but also legally wrong. Shooting ranges are places where people practice shooting firearms under supervised conditions, and there are strict safety rules to prevent accidents.\n\nAiming a gun at someone's eye, especially a child's, is beyond reckless; it's intentional harm. This action goes against basic moral principles of not harming others, especially vulnerable individuals like children. So, this is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios, both seem to be morally wrong, but the severity and nature of the wrongness differ significantly. Cheating on a test is wrong, but firing a gun at a child's eye is on a completely different level of moral wrongness.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong. Both scenarios depict actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps the person firing the gun at the shooting range was targeting a practice dummy or something, not an actual child. But no, the way it's phrased says \"the child's eye,\" which implies a real child is present. Shooting ranges are for practicing shooting at inanimate targets, not live people. So, assuming it's a real child, this is definitely wrong.\n\nAs for the first scenario, unless the person had explicit permission to use notes, which isn't indicated here, cheating is wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios describe morally wrong actions, making option A the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
