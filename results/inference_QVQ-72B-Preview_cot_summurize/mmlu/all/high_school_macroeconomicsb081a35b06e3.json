                    "text": "Let's see here. So, the question is about what happens to the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output if consumer confidence increases, assuming an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. The options are:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\n\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nD. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some macroeconomics here. Aggregate demand and aggregate supply determine the equilibrium price level and output in the economy. If consumer confidence increases, that should lead to an increase in consumption spending, right? Because people are more optimistic about the future, they tend to spend more.\n\nSo, an increase in consumer confidence would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, because there's more demand at every price level.\n\nNow, the aggregate supply curve is assumed to be upward sloping. That means that as the price level increases, producers are willing to supply more output.\n\nGiven these, let's think about the effects graphically.\n\nInitially, there's an equilibrium where the aggregate demand curve intersects the aggregate supply curve at a certain price level and quantity of output.\n\nWhen consumer confidence increases, the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right. This shift should lead to a new equilibrium with a higher price level and a higher quantity of output.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure about the shape of the aggregate supply curve. In the short run, the aggregate supply curve is typically upward sloping, which means that as the price level increases, firms are willing to produce more because higher prices make it more profitable to hire more workers and use more resources.\n\nSo, if aggregate demand increases, leading to higher prices, firms should respond by increasing production, which would increase the quantity of output.\n\nTherefore, both the price level and the quantity of output should increase.\n\nLooking back at the options, that would be option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any possibility that the quantity of output could decrease in this scenario?\n\nWell, in the long run, the aggregate supply curve is vertical, meaning that changes in aggregate demand only affect the price level, not the quantity of output. But in the short run, with an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve, both price level and output can increase.\n\nMoreover, if the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, an increase in aggregate demand should lead to higher prices and higher output, not lower output.\n\nSo, option A suggests that price level increases while quantity decreases, which doesn't make sense in this context, because with higher demand and higher prices, firms should produce more, not less.\n\nOption B suggests price level decreases while quantity increases, which would happen if aggregate supply increased, but in this case, it's aggregate demand that's increasing.\n\nOption D suggests both price level and quantity decrease, which also doesn't align with the typical response to increased aggregate demand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: both the equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where increased consumer confidence could lead to a different outcome.\n\nFor example, if increased consumer confidence leads to higher interest rates because of increased borrowing, that could crowd out investment spending, potentially offsetting some of the increase in consumption. However, in the short run, this effect is likely to be secondary to the direct increase in aggregate demand from consumption.\n\nAlso, if the economy is already operating at full capacity, then an increase in aggregate demand might lead to higher prices but not much increase in output, as there's no spare capacity. In this case, the quantity of output might not increase significantly, but it's still likely to rise somewhat, even if only marginally.\n\nGiven that, option C still seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the bases here. Increased consumer confidence shifts aggregate demand to the right, leading to higher prices and higher output in the short run with an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
