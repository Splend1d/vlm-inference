                    "text": "So I have this question about De Broglie's hypothesis. It's asking about the relationship between the linear momentum and the wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant, the Rydberg constant, and the speed of light. I need to figure out which one of these constants relates momentum and wavelength in this context.\n\nFirst, I should recall what De Broglie proposed. I remember that De Broglie suggested that particles, like electrons, have wave-like properties, similar to photons. He proposed that there's a wavelength associated with moving particles, which is now known as the De Broglie wavelength.\n\nSo, the De Broglie wavelength (\u03bb) is related to the momentum (p) of the particle. I think the formula is:\n\n\u03bb = h / p\n\nWhere h is Planck's constant. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, I believe that's the correct relationship. So, the wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle, and the constant of proportionality is Planck's constant.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Planck\u2019s constant\n\nB. Boltzmann\u2019s constant\n\nC. The Rydberg constant\n\nD. The speed of light\n\nIt seems like option A, Planck's constant, is the one that relates momentum and wavelength according to De Broglie's hypothesis.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what the other constants are and whether they would relate to this relationship.\n\nBoltzmann's constant (k) is related to heat and thermodynamics. It appears in equations like the ideal gas law in terms of kinetic theory or in entropy calculations. It doesn't seem directly related to the wavelength of particles based on their momentum.\n\nThe Rydberg constant (R) is associated with atomic spectroscopy, particularly in the calculation of wavelengths of spectral lines in the hydrogen atom. While it does relate to wavelengths, it's specific to atomic transitions and doesn't generally relate momentum and wavelength for free particles.\n\nThe speed of light (c) is a fundamental constant in physics, primarily relating to electromagnetic waves and the theory of relativity. In De Broglie's equation, the wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum, but the speed of light doesn't fit into this relationship directly for massive particles.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, Planck's constant (option A) is the correct choice for relating linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle according to De Broglie's hypothesis.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about the derivation or the concept again. De Broglie proposed that particles exhibit wave-particle duality, meaning they have both particle-like and wave-like properties. The wavelength associated with a particle is given by the formula \u03bb = h / p, where p is the momentum (mass times velocity for a non-relativistic particle).\n\nThis formula clearly shows that Planck's constant is the constant that relates the wavelength to the momentum of the particle.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is option A, Planck's constant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
