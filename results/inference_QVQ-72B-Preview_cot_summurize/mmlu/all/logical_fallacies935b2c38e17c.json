                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what an _a priori_ fallacy is, and I've got these options to choose from. Let me see if I can understand which one fits.\n\nFirst off, I know that _a priori_ generally means \"from what is already known\" or \"from pre-existing knowledge.\" In logic and philosophy, _a priori_ knowledge is independent of experience or empirical evidence. So, an _a priori_ fallacy might involve making an argument based on preconceived notions or assumptions without considering empirical evidence.\n\nLooking at option A, it talks about asking a question that includes either an unproven assumption or more than one question, making a straightforward yes or no answer meaningless. This sounds like the fallacy of complex question or loaded question, where the question itself contains an assumption that hasn't been established yet. For example, \"Have you stopped hitting your brother?\" assumes that you were hitting your brother in the first place. So, this seems more like a fallacy of ambiguity or presumption, not directly related to _a priori_ reasoning.\n\nOption B mentions arguing that something is inferior just because it doesn't do something it was never intended to do. This sounds like a straw man fallacy, where someone misrepresents another's argument to make it easier to attack. But I don't see a direct connection to _a priori_ reasoning here. Maybe it's related to expecting something to be true based on preconceived notions, but it's not immediately clear.\n\nOption C says arguing that a claim must be true because there is no evidence that it is false. This sounds a lot like the appeal to ignorance fallacy, where the lack of evidence is used as proof. For example, saying \"There's no proof that aliens aren't real, so they must exist.\" This is indeed a fallacious argument, but again, not obviously related to _a priori_ reasoning.\n\nOption D describes reasoning that determines the conclusion one wants first, then accepts only evidence supporting that conclusion, or interprets all evidence as support for that conclusion. This sounds very much like confirmation bias, where people favor information that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses. While this is a common cognitive bias and can lead to fallacious reasoning, it's not specifically an _a priori_ fallacy.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem to directly address what an _a priori_ fallacy is. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps an _a priori_ fallacy involves making an argument based solely on pre-existing knowledge or assumptions without considering empirical evidence or reality testing.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose someone argues that humans cannot travel faster than the speed of sound because it's against natural laws, based on their understanding of physics at the time. Later, we develop supersonic aircraft, proving that such travel is possible with the right technology. In this case, the original argument was based on _a priori_ knowledge of physics without considering technological advancements or empirical evidence that might contradict it.\n\nAnother example could be arguing that the sun revolves around the Earth based on everyday observations and _a priori_ reasoning, without considering astronomical evidence that shows the Earth orbits the sun.\n\nSo, in both cases, the fallacy lies in relying on pre-existing knowledge or assumptions without considering empirical evidence or the possibility of new information that could challenge those assumptions.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them perfectly fit this description of an _a priori_ fallacy. Option D comes closest, as it involves accepting only evidence that supports a pre-determined conclusion, which aligns with relying on pre-existing beliefs without considering contradictory evidence.\n\nHowever, I feel like there might be a more precise definition for an _a priori_ fallacy. Maybe it's not a standard term in logical fallacies, or perhaps it's being used here in a specific context.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misinterpreting the term _a priori_. In philosophy, _a priori_ knowledge is that which is known independently of experience, whereas _a posteriori_ knowledge is derived from experience or empirical evidence. A fallacy involving _a priori_ reasoning might be one where someone claims to know something is true based on pure reason or definition, without needing empirical evidence, but does so incorrectly.\n\nFor example, a definitional fallacy, where someone defines a term in a way that makes their argument tautological or circular. Or perhaps a rationalist fallacy, where too much confidence is placed in pure reason without empirical verification.\n\nBut again, none of the options seem to fit this exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term _a priori_ is being used here to refer to a specific type of fallacy related to timing or precedence. Like assuming something is true before considering all the evidence.\n\nWait, option A mentions including an unproven assumption in a question, which is like assuming something is true before it's been established, which could be seen as an _a priori_ assumption.\n\nSimilarly, option C assumes something is true because there's no evidence to the contrary, which is also a kind of _a priori_ assumption about the state of knowledge.\n\nBut I still think option D is the closest to what an _a priori_ fallacy might be, as it involves starting with a conclusion and only accepting evidence that supports it, effectively disregarding any empirical evidence that contradicts one's pre-existing beliefs.\n\nLet me check a reliable source to see if there's a standard definition for an _a priori_ fallacy.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that _a priori_ reasoning is generally considered valid in philosophy when it's based on necessary truths or logical deductions that don't depend on empirical evidence. However, fallacies can occur when such reasoning is applied incorrectly or when it's assumed that something is true based on definitions or logical structures alone, without proper justification.\n\nFor example, a common mistake in _a priori_ reasoning is to overextend the applicability of logical deductions to the real world, ignoring empirical facts that might not align with theoretical constructs.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the _a priori_ fallacy in question is related to relying solely on pre-existing knowledge or assumptions without considering empirical evidence, which aligns with option D: reasoning that determines the conclusion one wants first, then accepts only evidence supporting that conclusion, or interprets all evidence as support for that conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I would select option D as the best description of an _a priori_ fallacy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
