                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about an object in free fall, but it says the object experiences drag force proportional to its speed and that it strikes the ground before reaching terminal speed. Okay, so first things first, what does it mean to have drag force proportional to speed?\n\nI remember that drag force is a resistive force that acts against the motion of an object moving through a fluid, like air. The proportionality to speed means that the drag force increases linearly with speed. So, drag force F_d = k * v, where k is some constant and v is the speed.\n\nNow, in free fall, the primary force is gravity, which pulls the object downward with a constant acceleration g, right? But here, there's also this drag force acting upward, opposing the motion.\n\nThe net force on the object is the weight minus the drag force. So, F_net = mg - k*v.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law, F_net = m*a, where a is the acceleration.\n\nSo, mg - k*v = m*a.\n\nI can solve this for a: a = g - (k/m)*v.\n\nInteresting. This equation tells me that the acceleration decreases as the speed increases because the drag force increases with speed, which in turn reduces the net force and thus the acceleration.\n\nNow, the question says the object strikes the ground before reaching terminal speed. Terminal speed is when the drag force equals the weight, so F_d = mg, which means v_terminal = mg/k.\n\nBut since the object hits the ground before reaching terminal speed, it means it never gets to that point where drag force equals weight. So, throughout its fall, the drag force is less than the weight, meaning there's always a net downward force, and thus the object is accelerating downward.\n\nBut according to the equation a = g - (k/m)*v, as speed increases, acceleration decreases. So, it starts with a certain acceleration (probably close to g initially when speed is low), and as speed increases, acceleration decreases.\n\nWait a minute, at t=0, when the object is just released, v=0, so a = g - 0 = g. So, initial acceleration is g.\n\nAs time progresses, speed increases, so acceleration decreases, but it's still positive, meaning the object is still accelerating downward, just less rapidly.\n\nSo, overall, the speed is increasing, but the rate of increase (acceleration) is decreasing.\n\nSo, in terms of the options:\n\nA. It will fall with increasing speed and increasing acceleration.\n\nB. It will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nC. It will fall with decreasing speed and increasing acceleration.\n\nD. It will fall with decreasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nBased on my reasoning, the correct description is B: increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that the speed could be decreasing at some point?\n\nWell, if the drag force became greater than the weight, then the net force would be upward, and acceleration would be upward, meaning the object would slow down. But in this scenario, since it hits the ground before reaching terminal speed, which is when drag force equals weight, the drag force never equals weight, so the net force is always downward, meaning acceleration is always downward, and speed is always increasing downward.\n\nSo, no, the speed doesn't decrease in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: it will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
