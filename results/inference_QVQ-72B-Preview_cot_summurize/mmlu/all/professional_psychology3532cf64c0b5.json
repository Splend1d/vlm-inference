                    "text": "So I have this question here about the 1976 Tarasoff decision. It's asking which of these options it established. Let me see, I remember hearing about Tarasoff in my psychology class, but it's been a while. I think it was a legal case that had implications for psychologists and their duties beyond just patient confidentiality.\n\nOption A says it's about the right of a parent to inspect and request modifications to their child's school records. Hmm, that sounds more like something related to education law, maybe the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), but I'm not sure about the year. Let me think\u2014FERPA was enacted in 1974, I believe. So that might be a different thing.\n\nOption B mentions a psychologist's \"duty to protect\" the intended victim of a therapy client. This rings a bell. I think the Tarasoff case established that if a therapist determines their client poses a serious risk of violence to a identifiable victim, they have a duty to warn that person or take reasonable steps to protect them. Yeah, that seems familiar.\n\nOption C refers to the \"80% rule\" for determining the fairness of a selection test or employment procedure. I think that's related to employment law, specifically Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and maybe the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures from 1978. So that seems like a different area and a different time frame.\n\nOption D is about a psychologist's duty to report suspected or known cases of child abuse. I know that therapists are mandatory reporters for child abuse, but I think that stems from various state laws and regulations, and I'm not sure about the specific year that was established.\n\nGiven that, I think the Tarasoff decision is most closely associated with option B: a psychologist's \"duty to protect\" the intended victim of a therapy client. Let me double-check that.\n\nI recall that in the Tarasoff case, a therapy client threatened to kill his girlfriend, and the therapist didn't warn her or take sufficient action, and she was later killed by him. As a result, the court ruled that therapists have a duty to protect foreseeable victims of their clients' violence. So, that aligns with option B.\n\nOption A seems to be more about educational records, which isn't directly related to the Tarasoff case. Option C is about employment testing fairness, which is a different legal area. And option D is about child abuse reporting, which is important but not directly connected to the Tarasoff ruling.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option B: a psychologist's \"duty to protect\" the intended victim of a therapy client.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
