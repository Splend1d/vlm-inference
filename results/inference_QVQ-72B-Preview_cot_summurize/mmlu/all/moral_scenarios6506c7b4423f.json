                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I took my novel checkbook and went shopping.\" Okay, so someone took a checkbook that belongs to them and went shopping. A checkbook is typically used for writing checks to pay for things. If it's their own checkbook, meaning they're using their own money, then is there really anything morally wrong with that? I mean, it's their own property and their own funds. Unless there's some context missing, like maybe they're not supposed to use it without permission or something, but as presented, it seems like they're just using their own checkbook for shopping. That doesn't sound morally wrong to me.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"As my parents were sleeping, I unlocked their gun safe.\" This one seems more delicate. So, while parents are sleeping, the person unlocks their gun safe. Unlocking someone else's safe without their permission, especially when they're asleep and unaware, feels like an invasion of privacy at the very least. Moreover, gun safes are typically locked for a reason, to prevent unauthorized access, especially to firearms. If the person is accessing the safe without the knowledge or consent of their parents, that could be considered morally wrong, and potentially legally wrong as well, depending on the circumstances.\n\nBut wait, is the gun safe the property of the parents, and the person is their child? Assuming that, yes. So, a child unlocking their parents' gun safe without their parents' knowledge or consent while they're asleep. That seems like a clear violation of trust and respect for their parents' wishes and safety measures. It's not just about the act of unlocking the safe, but about the potential dangers involved, especially with firearms.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Using one's own checkbook to go shopping. This seems morally acceptable because it's using one's own property and funds.\n\n- Scenario 2: Unlocking parents' gun safe without their knowledge while they're asleep. This seems morally wrong due to the invasion of privacy, disregard for safety protocols, and potential risks involved.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1. If someone takes their own checkbook to go shopping, is there any moral issue there? Unless they're spending money they shouldn't be, or perhaps the checkbook contains sensitive information that shouldn't be used carelessly, but as presented, it seems fine.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even if the person doesn't take anything from the safe, just unlocking it without permission seems morally questionable. It's entering a private, secured space without consent, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
