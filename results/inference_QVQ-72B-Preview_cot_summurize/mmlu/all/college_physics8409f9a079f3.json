                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a horizontal, massless spring attached to a wall on one end and a 0.30 kg mass on the other end. The mass is displaced 0.030 meters from its equilibrium position and then released. It passes through the equilibrium position with a speed of 0.040 m/s. We're supposed to find the total mechanical energy of the system in the absence of friction.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the mechanical energy of a spring-mass system consists of. Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy. In this case, the potential energy is stored in the spring when it's stretched or compressed, and the kinetic energy is the energy the mass has due to its motion.\n\nThe problem states that there's no friction, so mechanical energy should be conserved. That means the total mechanical energy at any point in the motion should be the same.\n\nLet's think about the situation. When the mass is displaced 0.030 m from equilibrium and released, it starts from rest, so initially, all the mechanical energy is in the form of potential energy stored in the spring. As it moves towards the equilibrium position, the spring potential energy converts into kinetic energy of the mass. When it passes through the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is at its maximum.\n\nSo, the total mechanical energy should be equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is when the spring is stretched by 0.030 m.\n\nThe formula for the potential energy stored in a spring is:\n\n\\[\nU = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(U\\) is the potential energy,\n\n- \\(k\\) is the spring constant,\n\n- \\(x\\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nBut we don't know the spring constant \\(k\\). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since at equilibrium, all the potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy, and we know the mass and its velocity at equilibrium, we can find the kinetic energy at that point, which should be equal to the total mechanical energy.\n\nThe formula for kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(K\\) is the kinetic energy,\n\n- \\(m\\) is the mass,\n\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity.\n\nGiven that, we can calculate the kinetic energy when the mass passes through equilibrium:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.30 \\, \\text{kg} \\times (0.040 \\, \\text{m/s})^2\n\\]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, \\(0.040^2 = 0.0016 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2\\)\n\nThen, \\(0.30 \\times 0.0016 = 0.00048 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2 = 0.00048 \\, \\text{J}\\)\n\nSo, \\(K = 0.00048 \\, \\text{J}\\)\n\nSince mechanical energy is conserved, this kinetic energy should be equal to the total mechanical energy of the system.\n\nBut wait, is that the only way to look at it? Let's see if we can confirm this by considering the potential energy at maximum displacement.\n\nAt maximum displacement \\(x = 0.030 \\, \\text{m}\\), the potential energy is:\n\n\\[\nU = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0.030)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k \\times 0.0009 \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nBut again, we don't know \\(k\\). Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the conservation of energy principle directly. Since there's no friction, the sum of kinetic and potential energies should be constant.\n\nAt the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is \\(K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), which we've already calculated as \\(0.00048 \\, \\text{J}\\).\n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy \\(E\\) is equal to this kinetic energy at equilibrium, which is \\(0.00048 \\, \\text{J}\\).\n\nBut looking back at the options, they are in millijoules (mJ), so I need to convert joules to millijoules.\n\nSince \\(1 \\, \\text{J} = 1000 \\, \\text{mJ}\\), then \\(0.00048 \\, \\text{J} = 0.48 \\, \\text{mJ}\\).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.24 mJ\n\nB. 0.38 mJ\n\nC. 0.48 mJ\n\nD. 0.75 mJ\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the answer should be C. 0.48 mJ.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure there isn't a mistake somewhere.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the total mechanical energy at the initial position when the mass is displaced and then released.\n\nInitially, the mass is at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the total mechanical energy is equal to the potential energy stored in the spring at that displacement.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nE = U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\\]\n\nBut again, we don't know \\(k\\). Maybe I can find \\(k\\) using the information given at equilibrium.\n\nAt equilibrium, the spring force is zero, but the mass has velocity \\(v\\). The angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the simple harmonic motion is related to the spring constant by:\n\n\\[\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\n\\]\n\nAnd the velocity \\(v\\) at equilibrium can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nv = \\omega A\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the oscillation, which is the maximum displacement, \\(0.030 \\, \\text{m}\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nv = \\omega A \\implies \\omega = \\frac{v}{A}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\omega\\) back into the expression for \\(\\omega\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\implies k = m \\left( \\frac{v}{A} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nk = 0.30 \\times \\left( \\frac{0.040}{0.030} \\right)^2 = 0.30 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right)^2 = 0.30 \\times \\frac{16}{9} = 0.30 \\times 1.777\\ldots = 0.5333\\ldots \\, \\text{N/m}\n\\]\n\nNow, using this spring constant, we can find the potential energy at maximum displacement:\n\n\\[\nU = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.5333 \\times (0.030)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.5333 \\times 0.0009\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0.26665 \\times 0.0009 = 0.000239985 \\, \\text{J} \\approx 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, this gives a different result from the previous calculation. In the first approach, I got 0.48 mJ, and now I'm getting approximately 0.24 mJ using this method.\n\nThere must be a mistake in one of these approaches.\n\nLet me check the first approach again. If the kinetic energy at equilibrium is \\(0.00048 \\, \\text{J} = 0.48 \\, \\text{mJ}\\), and since mechanical energy is conserved, shouldn't that be the total mechanical energy?\n\nBut according to the second approach, using the spring constant, I get approximately 0.24 mJ.\n\nThere's inconsistency here. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating \\(k\\).\n\nLet me recalculate \\(k\\):\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\omega = \\frac{v}{A} = \\frac{0.040}{0.030} = \\frac{4}{3} \\, \\text{rad/s}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nk = m \\omega^2 = 0.30 \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right)^2 = 0.30 \\times \\frac{16}{9} = 0.30 \\times 1.777\\ldots = 0.5333\\ldots \\, \\text{N/m}\n\\]\n\nNow, potential energy at maximum displacement:\n\n\\[\nU = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.5333 \\times (0.030)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.5333 \\times 0.0009 = 0.26665 \\times 0.0009 = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\n\\]\n\nBut this contradicts the first approach, where I got 0.48 mJ.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the total mechanical energy should be the sum of both kinetic and potential energies at any point.\n\nAt equilibrium, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is just the kinetic energy, which is \\(0.00048 \\, \\text{J} = 0.48 \\, \\text{mJ}\\).\n\nAt maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy should be the potential energy, which is \\(0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\\).\n\nBut these should be equal if energy is conserved, which they're not. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in calculating the spring constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocity at equilibrium is not just \\(v = \\omega A\\), but there's more to it.\n\nWait, in simple harmonic motion, the velocity \\(v\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nv = \\omega \\sqrt{A^2 - x^2}\n\\]\n\nBut at equilibrium, \\(x = 0\\), so \\(v = \\omega A\\), which is what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the total mechanical energy can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2\n\\]\n\nWhich should be equal to the kinetic energy at equilibrium, which is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\\]\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\implies kA^2 = mv^2 \\implies k = \\frac{mv^2}{A^2}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\(k\\) using this formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{0.30 \\times (0.040)^2}{(0.030)^2} = \\frac{0.30 \\times 0.0016}{0.0009} = \\frac{0.00048}{0.0009} = 0.5333\\ldots \\, \\text{N/m}\n\\]\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation for \\(k\\).\n\nNow, total mechanical energy \\(E\\) should be:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.5333 \\times (0.030)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.5333 \\times 0.0009 = 0.26665 \\times 0.0009 = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\n\\]\n\nBut earlier, using the kinetic energy at equilibrium, I got \\(E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 0.00048 \\, \\text{J} = 0.48 \\, \\text{mJ}\\).\n\nThere's clearly a inconsistency here. Both methods should give the same result if done correctly.\n\nLet me check the units to make sure I'm not making a mistake there.\n\nMass \\(m = 0.30 \\, \\text{kg}\\), displacement \\(x = A = 0.030 \\, \\text{m}\\), velocity \\(v = 0.040 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\n\nCalculating kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.30 \\times (0.040)^2 = 0.5 \\times 0.30 \\times 0.0016 = 0.15 \\times 0.0016 = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\n\\]\n\nWait, earlier I mistakenly calculated \\(K = 0.00048 \\, \\text{J}\\), but that was an error. Let's recalculate:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.30 \\times (0.040)^2 = 0.5 \\times 0.30 \\times 0.0016 = 0.15 \\times 0.0016 = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\n\\]\n\nSo, both methods now give the same result: \\(E = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\\).\n\nI must have made an arithmetic error earlier when calculating \\(K\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct total mechanical energy is \\(0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\\), which corresponds to option A.\n\nTo confirm:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = 0.26665 \\times 0.0009 = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\n\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 0.5 \\times 0.30 \\times (0.040)^2 = 0.00024 \\, \\text{J} = 0.24 \\, \\text{mJ}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. 0.24 mJ.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.24\\ \\text{mJ}} \\]"
