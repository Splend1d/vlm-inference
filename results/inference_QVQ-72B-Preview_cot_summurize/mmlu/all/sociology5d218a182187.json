Fathers are more likely to be absent from their children's lives.\n\nB. One parent has total responsibility for the child's welfare and socialization.\n\nC. Both parents are expected to co-operate in the continued care of their children.\n\nD. Parents must provide for all of their children in equal measure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"custodial\" and \"joint parenthood\" mean in this context.\n\n\"Custodial\" typically refers to custody, where one parent has the primary responsibility for the child, including decision-making and care. This usually means that the child lives primarily with one parent, and the other parent might have visitation rights.\n\n\"Joint parenthood,\" on the other hand, suggests that both parents share responsibilities and decision-making regarding their children, even after divorce. This could involve joint legal custody, where both parents have equal say in important decisions about the child's life, such as education, health care, and religious upbringing.\n\nGiven this background, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Fathers are more likely to be absent from their children's lives.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive for a shift towards joint parenthood. If anything, moving towards joint parenthood would imply that both parents are more involved in their children's lives, not less. So, this option doesn't seem to align with the concept of joint parenthood.\n\nB. One parent has total responsibility for the child's welfare and socialization.\n\nThis sounds like sole custody, where one parent makes all the major decisions and has primary care of the child. Joint parenthood is supposed to involve both parents in these responsibilities, so this option contradicts the idea of joint parenthood.\n\nC. Both parents are expected to co-operate in the continued care of their children.\n\nThis seems to directly align with the definition of joint parenthood. It emphasizes cooperation and shared responsibility between both parents for the well-being of their children, even after divorce.\n\nD. Parents must provide for all of their children in equal measure.\n\nThis option is a bit vague. Providing for children can include financial support, emotional support, time, and resources. Joint parenthood might involve equal involvement and support, but it's not necessarily about providing \"in equal measure\" in every single aspect. Sometimes, one parent might provide more financial support while the other provides more time, depending on circumstances.\n\nConsidering these analyses, option C seems to be the most accurate description of the shift from custodial to joint parenthood after divorce. It emphasizes the cooperation and shared responsibility between both parents for the continued care of their children, which is the essence of joint parenthood.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
