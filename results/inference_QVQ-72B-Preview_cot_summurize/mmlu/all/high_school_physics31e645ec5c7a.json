                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about electric fields and potential differences. The electric field E is given as a function of the radius r from the origin, and I need to find the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4). The options are A. \u2013165 V, B. \u2013120 V, C. 64 V, and D. 185 V.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between electric field and potential. I know that the electric field is related to the potential through the gradient operator. Specifically, the electric field is the negative gradient of the potential:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V\\]\n\nBut since the problem gives E as a function of r, and r is the distance from the origin, I should probably work in spherical coordinates or at least express things in terms of r.\n\nThe problem gives E_r as a function of r: E_r = \u20136r^2 + 4r + 3.\n\nI need to find the potential difference between the origin (r=0) and the point (3,4). First, I should find the distance r from the origin to the point (3,4). Wait, is this in two dimensions? The point is (3,4), so assuming it's in Cartesian coordinates, r is the distance from the origin, so r = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5 meters.\n\nSo, the point is at r = 5 meters from the origin.\n\nNow, to find the potential difference between the origin and this point, I can integrate the electric field over the path from the origin to the point. But since E is only given in the radial direction, I should integrate E_r with respect to r from r=0 to r=5.\n\nWait, but electric field is a vector, and potential is scalar. The relationship between E and V is:\n\n\\[E_r = -\\frac{dV}{dr}\\]\n\nSo, to find the potential difference, I can integrate E_r with respect to r from r=0 to r=5.\n\nGiven that, the potential difference V is:\n\n\\[V = -\\int E_r \\, dr = -\\int_{0}^{5} (-6r^2 + 4r + 3) \\, dr\\]\n\nLet me compute that integral.\n\nFirst, integrate term by term:\n\n\\[\\int (-6r^2 + 4r + 3) \\, dr = -6 \\int r^2 \\, dr + 4 \\int r \\, dr + 3 \\int dr = -6 \\cdot \\frac{r^3}{3} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{r^2}{2} + 3r + C\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[= -2r^3 + 2r^2 + 3r + C\\]\n\nNow, evaluate from 0 to 5:\n\n\\[V = -[ (-2(5)^3 + 2(5)^2 + 3(5)) - (-2(0)^3 + 2(0)^2 + 3(0)) ]\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nAt r=5:\n\n\\[-2(125) + 2(25) + 3(5) = -250 + 50 + 15 = -185\\]\n\nAt r=0:\n\n\\[0\\]\n\nSo, V = -(-185) = 185 V\n\nLooking at the options, D. 185 V seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my assumption about the coordinates. The point is (3,4), which is in the xy-plane, and r is the distance from the origin, which is indeed sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 5. So that seems correct.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the electric field is only in the radial direction, which seems to be the case from the given equation E_r = \u20136r^2 + 4r + 3.\n\nIf there were components in other directions, I would need to integrate those as well, but since only E_r is given, I think integrating only the radial component is sufficient for finding the potential difference along the radial path.\n\nTherefore, the potential difference is 185 V, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
