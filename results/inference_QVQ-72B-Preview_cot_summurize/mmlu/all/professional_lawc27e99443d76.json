                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a haberdashery owner who placed an order for cashmere socks over the phone, and now there's a dispute over the quantity ordered. The supplier is suing the man for the difference in price after he rejected the delivery of 36 dozen socks instead of the three dozen he claims he ordered. The question is whether the statute of frauds can be used as a defense in this situation.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what the statute of frauds is. It's a legal principle that requires certain agreements to be in writing to be enforceable. In the context of sales contracts, especially those involving goods, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) has provisions similar to the statute of frauds. Under the UCC, contracts for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more need to be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nIn this case, the agreed price was $250 per dozen, and the total price for three dozen would be $750, which is over $500. So, yes, a written confirmation would be necessary to satisfy the statute of frauds.\n\nThe supplier sent a confirmation letter stating \"36 dozen cashmere socks\" at $250 per dozen, totaling $9,000. The man glanced at it but didn't notice the quantity error and didn't respond to it.\n\nNow, the supplier is suing for the $1,000 difference after reselling the socks for $8,000 instead of the original $9,000.\n\nThe man is considering pleading the statute of frauds as a defense, arguing that the contract isn't enforceable because there's no proper written agreement.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the statute was not satisfied by the supplier's tender of the goods, which were rejected by the man, and the supplier did not rely on the oral agreement other than by attempting delivery.\n\nB. Yes, because the agreed price for three dozen socks was over $500, and the supplier's written memo incorrectly stated the quantity of goods ordered.\n\nC. No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.\n\nD. No, because the supplier's written memo operated as an acceptance, with proposals for additional terms that became part of the contract after the man failed to object to such additional terms within a reasonable time.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, under the UCC, a written confirmation can satisfy the statute of frauds if it is sent in good faith and the recipient doesn't object to it within a reasonable time, typically 10 days.\n\nIn this case, the supplier sent a confirmation that specified the quantity as 36 dozen, but the man claims he ordered only three dozen. He glanced at the letter but didn't notice the discrepancy and didn't respond.\n\nIf the confirmation is considered a written confirmation under the UCC, and the man didn't object within a reasonable time, it might be enforceable against him.\n\nHowever, there's a mistake in the quantity stated in the confirmation. The man thought he ordered three dozen, but the confirmation says 36 dozen.\n\nIs this a mutual mistake, or is it a unilateral mistake?\n\nIt seems like a unilateral mistake on the part of the man, as he didn't read the confirmation carefully and failed to notice the error in quantity.\n\nUnder the UCC, a written confirmation can serve as evidence of the contract terms, and if the recipient doesn't object to it within a reasonable time, it can be enforceable.\n\nBut in this case, there's a discrepancy between what was ordered and what was confirmed.\n\nOption C suggests that the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the statute as against the supplier, and that the man failed to object within 10 days.\n\nOption D suggests that the memo operated as an acceptance with additional terms, and that the man failed to object to those additional terms within a reasonable time.\n\nI need to consider whether the confirmation letter is sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.\n\nUnder UCC Section 2-201, a contract for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.\n\nIn this case, the confirmation letter is signed by the supplier and indicates the terms of the contract.\n\nHowever, there's a discrepancy in the quantity ordered.\n\nIf the man claims he ordered three dozen, but the confirmation says 36 dozen, and he didn't correct it, does that make the confirmation enforceable for 36 dozen?\n\nI think the key here is whether the confirmation is a sufficient writing to evidence the contract.\n\nBut there's a mistake in the quantity, which was the essential term of the contract.\n\nIf the man believed he ordered three dozen and the confirmation says 36 dozen, and he didn't correct it, it might be argued that his failure to correct the error could be construed as acceptance of the terms in the confirmation.\n\nHowever, this seems unfair because he clearly intended to order three dozen, not 36 dozen.\n\nMoreover, the supplier might argue that the confirmation was sent in good faith and that the man had an opportunity to review it and object, which he didn't do within a reasonable time.\n\nBut, the man can argue that the confirmation contained a material error and that he had no intention to agree to purchase 36 dozen socks.\n\nAdditionally, the UCC provides that when a written confirmation is sent in good faith but contains terms that differ from the oral agreement, and the recipient doesn't object within a reasonable time, those terms become part of the contract.\n\nHowever, this generally applies to additional terms, not to the basic terms like quantity.\n\nQuantity is a fundamental term of the contract, and a mistake in quantity might not be covered by this rule.\n\nMoreover, if the confirmation contains a clerical error or a mistake, and the party relying on it acts in good faith, there might be some protection.\n\nBut in this case, the supplier acted based on the confirmation and attempted to deliver 36 dozen socks.\n\nThe man rejected the delivery, claiming he only ordered three dozen.\n\nNow, the supplier is suing for the $1,000 difference after reselling the socks for $8,000 instead of $9,000.\n\nIf the man pleads the statute of frauds as a defense, arguing that there's no enforceable written contract because of the discrepancy in quantity, would that be successful?\n\nOption A suggests that the defense would be successful because the statute wasn't satisfied by the supplier's tender of goods, which were rejected, and the supplier didn't rely on the oral agreement other than by attempting delivery.\n\nOption B also suggests that the defense would be successful because the agreed price for three dozen was over $500, and the supplier's written memo incorrectly stated the quantity.\n\nOption C says no, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the statute, and the man failed to object within 10 days.\n\nOption D says no, because the memo operated as an acceptance with additional terms, and the man failed to object to those terms within a reasonable time.\n\nI think Option C is the most accurate.\n\nUnder UCC Section 2-207, if a written confirmation is sent in good faith and the recipient doesn't object to its terms within a reasonable time, those terms become part of the contract.\n\nIn this case, the supplier sent the confirmation in good faith, and the man failed to object to it within a reasonable time.\n\nTherefore, the confirmation becomes part of the contract, and the man is bound by its terms, including the quantity of 36 dozen socks.\n\nHowever, there's a twist here: the man claims he ordered three dozen, not 36 dozen.\n\nIf this is a genuine mistake, and he didn't notice the error in the confirmation, does that affect the enforceability?\n\nUnder the UCC, if a party has reason to know of the contents of a confirmation and fails to object within a reasonable time, the confirmation becomes part of the contract.\n\nIn this case, the man glanced at the confirmation but didn't notice the error in quantity.\n\nHe had an opportunity to review it and should have noticed the discrepancy.\n\nTherefore, his failure to object could be seen as acceptance of the terms in the confirmation.\n\nThus, the statute of frauds would not be a successful defense because the confirmation serves as sufficient written evidence of the contract terms.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems correct.\n\nOption D seems similar but refers to \"proposals for additional terms,\" which might not directly apply here since the quantity is a basic term, not an additional one.\n\nSo, I think Option C is the best answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the confirmation is a written memorandum signed by the supplier, stating the essential terms of the contract, including quantity and price, and the man fails to object to it within a reasonable time, then under the UCC, this confirmation can be enforceable against him.\n\nTherefore, the statute of frauds defense would not be successful.\n\nHence, the answer is C."
