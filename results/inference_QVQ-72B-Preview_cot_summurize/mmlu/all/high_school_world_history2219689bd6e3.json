                    "text": "Alright, I've got this quote from Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanian leader from 1961. He's talking about the importance of African unity and how it can contribute to world peace. He says that by creating a political union, Africa can set an example for a divided world and project its personality more effectively. He also mentions that without unity, Africa won't get the respect it deserves, especially from the great powers.\n\nSo, the question is asking why Nkrumah feels Africa must avoid the dangers inherent in disunity. The options are:\n\nA. African nations will not achieve independence without unity.\n\nB. Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.\n\nC. The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.\n\nD. The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.\n\nLet me read the quote again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\n\"Nkrumah says: 'The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African independence by the Great Powers.'\"\n\nOkay, so he's emphasizing that unity is crucial for Africa to have a stronger voice in the world and to be taken seriously by other powerful nations.\n\nLet's look at option A: African nations will not achieve independence without unity.\n\nHmm, Nkrumah was writing in 1961, which was a time when many African countries were gaining their independence from colonial powers. However, the quote seems to be more about strengthening the position of already independent African nations rather than achieving independence in the first place. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nOption B: Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.\n\nWell, the quote does mention the Congo tottering into anarchy, which suggests that disunity can lead to internal problems and instability. But the main focus seems to be on the external aspect\u2014how Africa is perceived and treated by other powers.\n\nOption C: The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.\n\nWhile it's true that civil wars can be a result of disunity, the quote doesn't specifically mention civil wars. It talks about opposition to French atomic tests and the situation in the Congo, which seems more related to international relations and the treatment of African nations by global powers.\n\nOption D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.\n\nThis seems relevant. Nkrumah mentions that the world respects only size and influence, and that a union of African states would command more respect. So, by uniting, Africa would have greater size and influence, thereby gaining more respect in the international community.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Is this the main reason why Nkrumah thinks Africa must avoid disunity?\n\nHe also says that a united Africa can set an example for a divided world, which suggests that he believes in the moral and ideological importance of unity beyond just gaining respect from other powers.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking about why he feels Africa must avoid the dangers inherent in disunity, and the options are given to choose from.\n\nLooking back at the quote, he says that a union of African states will project the African personality more effectively and command respect from a world that values size and influence.\n\nHe also gives examples of how African opposition was ignored, like the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the UN's handling of the Congo crisis, which he sees as evidence of the great powers' disregard for African independence.\n\nSo, it seems that he's arguing that without unity, Africa will continue to be disregarded and its interests will be overlooked by more powerful nations.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate because it directly relates to the idea that the world respects nations based on their size and influence, which aligns with Nkrumah's point about the need for a political union to project a stronger image and command more respect.\n\nOption A is about achieving independence, but the context suggests more about strengthening independence and international standing rather than achieving it.\n\nOption B touches on the internal disarray caused by disunity, but the quote seems to emphasize more the external perceptions and treatments by other powers.\n\nOption C is about civil wars, which isn't directly mentioned in the quote.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.\n\nThis explains why Nkrumah feels that Africa must avoid disunity\u2014to gain the respect and recognition it deserves in the international community by presenting a united front with greater collective size and influence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
