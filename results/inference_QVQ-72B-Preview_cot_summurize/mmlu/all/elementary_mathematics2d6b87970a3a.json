                    "text": "So the post office delivered eighteen thousand ninety-six pieces of mail in a week, and I need to write this number in expanded form. The options are given, but I want to make sure I understand what expanded form is and how it applies to this number.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I have the correct number. Eighteen thousand ninety-six\u2014that sounds like 18,096. So, in numerical form, that's 18,096.\n\nNow, expanded form is a way to write a number by adding the value of its digits at each place value. So, for the number 18,096, I need to break it down into its place values: ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\nLet's identify the place value of each digit:\n\n- The first digit is 1, which is in the ten thousands place. So, that's 1 \u00d7 10,000 = 10,000.\n\n- The second digit is 8, which is in the thousands place. So, that's 8 \u00d7 1,000 = 8,000.\n\n- The third digit is 0, which is in the hundreds place. So, that's 0 \u00d7 100 = 0.\n\n- The fourth digit is 9, which is in the tens place. So, that's 9 \u00d7 10 = 90.\n\n- The fifth digit is 6, which is in the ones place. So, that's 6 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nNow, to write the number in expanded form, I need to add up these values:\n\n10,000 + 8,000 + 0 + 90 + 6.\n\nBut since zero doesn't add any value, I can omit it for simplicity:\n\n10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 18 + 1,000 + 90 + 6\n\nThis adds up to 1,104, which is not equal to 18,096. So, this is incorrect.\n\nB. 18 + 1,000 + 900 + 60\n\nThis adds up to 2,078, which is not equal to 18,096. So, this is incorrect.\n\nC. 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6\n\nThis adds up to 18,096, which matches the given number.\n\nD. 10,000 + 8,000 + 900 + 60\n\nThis would add up to 18,960, which is not equal to 18,096. So, this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6.\n\nJust to double-check, let's verify the sum:\n\n10,000 + 8,000 = 18,000\n\n18,000 + 90 = 18,090\n\n18,090 + 6 = 18,096.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the expanded form of eighteen thousand ninety-six is 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
