And I need to figure out which subfield of psychology he is most likely affiliated with. The options are counseling, educational, industrial/organizational, and developmental psychology.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these subfields focuses on.\n\nStarting with counseling psychology: I think it deals with helping people deal with personal issues, like mental health problems, relationship issues, or career choices. It's more about one-on-one therapy or counseling to improve an individual's well-being.\n\nEducational psychology sounds like it's about how people learn, including developmental stages, teaching methods, and learning disorders. It's focused on the educational setting, like schools, and how to optimize the learning process for students.\n\nIndustrial/organizational (I/O) psychology seems relevant here. It's about applying psychological principles to the workplace. That could include things like improving job satisfaction, productivity, leadership, and workplace design. So, it deals with how people behave in organizational settings.\n\nDevelopmental psychology is about the psychological changes that occur as people age, from childhood through adulthood. It looks at things like cognitive development, social development, and identity formation over the lifespan.\n\nGiven that Dr. Bonneau helped redesign offices to raise morale and productivity, which are directly related to the workplace environment and employee performance, it seems like this falls under the umbrella of industrial/organizational psychology.\n\nLet me double-check. Counseling psychology is more about individual therapy, which isn't directly mentioned here. Educational psychology is about learning and education, which isn't the primary focus in this scenario. Developmental psychology is about development across the lifespan, which again doesn't directly relate to office redesign and employee morale.\n\nOn the other hand, industrial/organizational psychology focuses on improving the work environment, which can include physical space design, to enhance employee well-being and productivity. So, it aligns perfectly with what Dr. Bonneau did\u2014redesigning offices to raise morale and productivity.\n\nI think the correct answer is C. industrial/organizational.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
