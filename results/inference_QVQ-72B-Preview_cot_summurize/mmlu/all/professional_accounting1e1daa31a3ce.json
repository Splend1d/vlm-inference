                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, we have two companies, X and Y. The market price of Company X is $45 per share, and Company Y is $30 per share. X is offering three-fourths of a share of its stock for each share of Y. We need to find the ratio of exchange of market prices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"ratio of exchange of market prices\" means. I think it's asking for the ratio between the market prices of X and Y based on the exchange offer.\n\nSo, the exchange offer is three-fourths of a share of X for each share of Y. That means for every one share of Y, you get 0.75 shares of X.\n\nNow, the market price of X is $45, and Y is $30. So, the value received for each Y share is 0.75 times $45, which is 0.75 * 45 = $33.75.\n\nBut the market price of Y is $30, so the ratio of exchange based on market prices would be the value received in X shares divided by the Y share price.\n\nSo, that's $33.75 / $30 = 1.125.\n\nWait, but the options are given in terms of ratios, like 0.667, 1, 1.125, and 1.5. So, 1.125 is one of them.\n\nBut let me double-check if I'm understanding this correctly. The question says \"the ratio of exchange of market prices would be,\" and I interpreted it as the exchange value in terms of X shares compared to Y shares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the ratio of the market prices directly, like price of X to price of Y.\n\nPrice of X is $45, price of Y is $30, so 45/30 = 1.5.\n\nBut that's option D.\n\nWait, but the exchange offer is three-fourths of X for each Y. So, if the market prices were directly proportional to the exchange ratio, maybe 0.75 corresponds to the price ratio.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to find the ratio of the exchange offer in terms of shares.\n\nThe exchange offer is 0.75 shares of X for each share of Y.\n\nSo, the exchange ratio is 0.75 X shares per Y share.\n\nNow, the market price exchange ratio would be the price of X shares given for one Y share.\n\nSo, it's 0.75 * $45 = $33.75 for each Y share.\n\nBut the market price of Y is $30, so the ratio is $33.75 / $30 = 1.125.\n\nThat seems consistent with option C.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is the exchange rate based on the prices.\n\nSo, if X is offering 0.75 shares of X for each share of Y, then the exchange ratio in terms of shares is 0.75 X per Y.\n\nBut in terms of market prices, it's $45 per X share and $30 per Y share.\n\nSo, the value exchanged is 0.75 * $45 = $33.75 for each Y share.\n\nAgain, comparing to Y's market price of $30, the ratio is $33.75 / $30 = 1.125.\n\nThis seems to point towards option C.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for the ratio of the exchange in terms of the prices directly.\n\nSo, perhaps it's asking for the ratio of the price of X to the price of Y, which is $45 / $30 = 1.5, option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the exchange offer in terms of shares to the price ratio.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me consider the exchange offer: 0.75 shares of X for each share of Y.\n\nSo, the exchange ratio in shares is 0.75 X per Y.\n\nThe market price ratio is $45 / $30 = 1.5.\n\nSo, for every Y share, you get 0.75 X shares, which is worth 0.75 * $45 = $33.75.\n\nSo, $33.75 is being offered for each Y share, which is worth $30.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the exchange value to the Y share price is $33.75 / $30 = 1.125.\n\nAlternatively, if I look at the exchange in terms of the price of X and Y, it's $45 for X and $30 for Y, so the ratio is 1.5.\n\nBut the exchange offer is giving 0.75 X shares for each Y share, which aligns with the 1.5 ratio because 1 / 0.75 = 1.333, which is not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the exchange rate.\n\nIf the exchange offer is 0.75 X per Y, and the market price of X is $45, then the value received for each Y is $33.75, as calculated before.\n\nComparing this to the Y's market price of $30, the ratio is $33.75 / $30 = 1.125.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the exchange in terms of the price of X and Y, it's $45 / $30 = 1.5.\n\nBut that seems like the ratio of their prices, not directly related to the exchange offer.\n\nI think the key is to consider the value being exchanged.\n\nSo, for each Y share, you get 0.75 X shares, which are worth 0.75 * $45 = $33.75.\n\nComparing this to the Y share price of $30, the ratio is $33.75 / $30 = 1.125.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 1.125.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's another way to interpret the question.\n\nMaybe the ratio is calculated based on the exchange offer in terms of shares.\n\nSo, 0.75 X shares per Y share.\n\nIf I think of it as the exchange ratio being 0.75, which is the same as 3/4, then the inverse would be 4/3, but that doesn't seem to match any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is the price of X divided by the price of Y times the exchange ratio.\n\nSo, ($45 / $30) * 0.75 = 1.5 * 0.75 = 1.125, which again brings me back to 1.125.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the price of X times the exchange ratio divided by the price of Y.\n\nSo, $45 * 0.75 / $30 = $33.75 / $30 = 1.125.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the price of Y divided by the price of X times the exchange ratio.\n\nSo, $30 / $45 * 0.75 = 0.666..., which is option A, but that doesn't seem to make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the price of X divided by the price of Y, which is 1.5, but that doesn't involve the exchange ratio.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is the value received in X shares for each Y share compared to the Y share price.\n\nSo, value received is 0.75 * $45 = $33.75 for each Y share.\n\nComparing to Y's market price of $30, the ratio is $33.75 / $30 = 1.125.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1.125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
