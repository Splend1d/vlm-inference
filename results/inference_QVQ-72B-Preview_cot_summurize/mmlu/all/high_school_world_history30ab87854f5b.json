They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nThe most likely source of Islam in Mali came from\n\nA. wandering Berber mystics.\nB. conquering Mughal armies.\nC. contact with Muslim trade caravans.\nD. pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the spread of Islam in Mali during the 1300s, based on an account by Ibn Battuta. The options are:\n\nA. wandering Berber mystics.\n\nB. conquering Mughal armies.\n\nC. contact with Muslim trade caravans.\n\nD. pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some context about Mali in the 1300s. Mali was part of the Mali Empire, which was located in West Africa and was known for its wealth from gold and salt trade. It was a significant center of trade and culture during that period.\n\nIbn Battuta was a Moroccan traveler and scholar who is famous for his extensive travels across the Islamic world and beyond. His accounts provide valuable insights into the societies he visited, including their customs, religions, and ways of life.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the most likely source of Islam in Mali during this time. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: wandering Berber mystics.\n\nBerbers are an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa. They have a rich history and have been in the region for thousands of years. Mystics could refer to Sufis, who were Islamic mystics known for their role in spreading Islam through peaceful means, often through trade routes. It's possible that Berber Sufis played a role in spreading Islam in Mali, but I need to see if there's more direct evidence or if this is the most likely source.\n\nOption B: conquering Mughal armies.\n\nThe Mughal Empire was primarily based in the Indian subcontinent, founded by Babur in the early 16th century. However, the 1300s were the 14th century, so chronologically, the Mughal Empire wasn't even established yet. This seems unlikely, as the Mughals didn't exist in the 1300s, and their influence was mainly in South Asia, not West Africa.\n\nOption C: contact with Muslim trade caravans.\n\nThis seems plausible. Mali was situated along major trade routes, especially the trans-Saharan trade routes that connected West Africa with North Africa and the Mediterranean world. Muslim merchants and traders would have traveled these routes, bringing goods and ideas, including Islam, to Mali. Trade was a common vector for the spread of religions and cultures.\n\nOption D: pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia has a long history with Christianity, having adopted it in the 4th century. While there are Muslim communities in Ethiopia, especially in the northeastern regions, it's not primarily known for Islamic shrines in the same way that Mecca or Medina are. Moreover, Mali and Ethiopia are geographically distant, and direct cultural exchanges between them during the 1300s seem less likely compared to the influence of trade routes.\n\nGiven this background, option C\u2014contact with Muslim trade caravans\u2014seems the most plausible source of Islam in Mali during the 1300s. The trans-Saharan trade routes were well-established by this time, and Muslim merchants played a significant role in these trade networks, often bringing their faith with them.\n\nBut let's double-check with Ibn Battuta's account. Although the excerpt provided doesn't directly mention the source of Islam in Mali, it does describe the Malians as Muslims who pray, study Islamic jurisprudence, and memorize the Quran. This suggests that Islam was well-integrated into Malian society by the time Ibn Battuta visited.\n\nAdditionally, the practices described, such as the matrilineal inheritance system and the role of maternal uncles, indicate a blend of Islamic and traditional Malian customs. This kind of syncretism is typical when a new religion is adopted through peaceful means, such as through trade and cultural exchange, rather than through conquest.\n\nTherefore, based on both the historical context and the information from Ibn Battuta's account, the most likely source of Islam in Mali during the 1300s was through contact with Muslim trade caravans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
