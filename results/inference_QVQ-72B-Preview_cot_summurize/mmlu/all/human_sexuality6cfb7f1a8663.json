                    "text": "So I have this question about the placenta, and it's asking which of the following the placenta does not do. The options are:\n\nA. Supplies oxygen to the fetus\n\nB. Supplies nutrients to the fetus\n\nC. Supplies blood to the fetus\n\nD. Secretes hormones\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step. I remember that the placenta is a crucial organ in pregnancy that connects the mother and the fetus. It's like a life support system for the baby before birth.\n\nFirst, I know that the placenta facilitates the exchange of gases between the mother and the fetus. So, it allows oxygen from the mother's blood to pass through to the fetus, and carbon dioxide from the fetus to pass to the mother's blood to be expelled. So, option A, supplying oxygen to the fetus, is definitely something the placenta does.\n\nNext, option B is supplying nutrients to the fetus. Again, the placenta is responsible for transferring nutrients like sugars, proteins, and fats from the mother's blood to the fetus's blood. This is essential for the baby's growth and development. So, that's another function of the placenta.\n\nNow, option C is supplying blood to the fetus. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. The placenta does facilitate the circulation of blood between the mother and the fetus, but does it actually supply the blood itself? I think the fetus has its own blood supply, which is connected to the placenta via the umbilical cord. The placenta allows for the exchange of substances between the mother's and fetus's bloodstreams, but the blood itself is not mixed directly. So, maybe the placenta doesn't supply the blood per se; it's more about facilitating the exchange.\n\nLastly, option D is secretes hormones. I recall that the placenta does produce several hormones during pregnancy. These hormones help maintain the pregnancy and prepare the mother's body for childbirth. For example, it produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is often measured in pregnancy tests, and estrogen and progesterone, which are important for sustaining the pregnancy.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the placenta doesn't actually supply blood to the fetus, but rather facilitates the exchange of substances between the mother's and fetus's bloodstreams. Therefore, option C is likely the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. Supplies oxygen to the fetus \u2013 Yes, that's a function of the placenta.\n\nB. Supplies nutrients to the fetus \u2013 Yes, that's another function.\n\nC. Supplies blood to the fetus \u2013 No, the placenta facilitates the exchange but doesn't supply the blood itself.\n\nD. Secretes hormones \u2013 Yes, the placenta produces important hormones.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Supplies blood to the fetus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
