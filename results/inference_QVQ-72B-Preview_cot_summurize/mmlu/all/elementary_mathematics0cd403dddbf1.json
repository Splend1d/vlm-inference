                    "text": "So Kate has this coin collection, and she keeps 7 coins in a box. That box contains 5% of her entire collection. I need to find out the total number of coins she has. Hmm, percentages can be tricky, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that 7 coins represent 5% of her whole collection. Maybe if I can find out what 1% is, then I can figure out the total. Because if 7 coins are 5%, then 1% would be 7 divided by 5, right? Let me calculate that.\n\n7 divided by 5 is 1.4. So, 1% is 1.4 coins. Then, to find 100%, I'd multiply by 100. So, 1.4 times 100 would be 140 coins. Wow, that seems like a lot. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, the options are 12, 14, 120, and 140. So, 140 is one of the choices. But is it reasonable? Let me think about it differently. If 7 coins are 5%, then what is 100%?\n\nAnother way is to set up a proportion. Let's say, 5% is 7 coins, so 100% would be x coins. Percentages are parts per hundred, so 5% is 5 per 100. So, 5 is to 100 as 7 is to x. That makes sense.\n\nSo, 5/100 = 7/x. Cross-multiplying, 5x = 700. Then, x = 700 / 5, which is 140. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using decimals instead of fractions. 5% is 0.05, right? So, 0.05 times the total number of coins equals 7.\n\nSo, 0.05 * x = 7. Then, x = 7 / 0.05. Let's calculate that. 7 divided by 0.05 is again 140. Same answer.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider whether the collection can have a fraction of a coin or not. In real life, coins are whole items, so the collection should have whole numbers of coins. But in this problem, it seems like it's allowing for fractions, because 1.4 coins as 1% would suggest that.\n\nBut looking back at the options, they are all whole numbers: 12, 14, 120, 140. So, perhaps the collection is considered to have whole coins, but the percentage calculation is allowing for fractions in the intermediate steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the collection has a certain number of coins, and 5% of that is 7, leading to 140 coins in total.\n\nWait, but 140 seems quite a lot. Maybe there's a mistake here. Let's consider if the box contains 7 coins, which is 5% of the total collection. So, 5% is 7, then 10% would be 14, and 100% would be 140. That seems consistent.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way to think about this. Maybe using the formula for finding the whole when you have a part and the percentage.\n\nThe formula is: part = percentage / 100 * whole. So, 7 = (5/100) * x. Solving for x, x = 7 * (100/5) = 140. Yep, same answer again.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other information or if maybe I'm missing something. The problem says \"she keeps 7 of the coins in a box, which is only 5% of her entire collection.\" It doesn't say anything about overlapping or multiple boxes, so I think it's safe to assume that the box contains 7 coins, which is 5% of the total.\n\nI should also consider if the collection can have a fraction of a coin or not. In reality, you can't have a fraction of a coin, but in mathematical terms, it's acceptable to consider fractions in calculations, especially when dealing with percentages.\n\nGiven that, and that the options are all whole numbers, I think the total collection is 140 coins.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's see what 5% of 140 is. 5% of 140 is 0.05 * 140 = 7 coins. Perfect, matches the information given.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose 120, which is another option, 5% of 120 is 6 coins, which is not 7. So, that doesn't match.\n\n140 is the only option that makes 5% equal to 7 coins.\n\nTherefore, the total number of coins in Kate's collection is 140.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
