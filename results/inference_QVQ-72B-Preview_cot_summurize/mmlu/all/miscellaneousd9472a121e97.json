                    "text": "So I've got this trivia question here: \"Whom did Billie Jean King defeat in the famous 'Battle of the Sexes' tennis match?\" And the options are A. Jimmy Connors, B. Pete Sampras, C. John McEnroe, and D. Bobby Riggs. Okay, I need to figure out which one of these tennis players Billie Jean King played against in that historic match.\n\nFirst off, I know that Billie Jean King was a legendary tennis player, and she's famous for winning that \"Battle of the Sexes.\" But honestly, I don't remember who she played against. Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that the \"Battle of the Sexes\" was a tennis match between a top male player and a top female player, and it was meant to be this big showdown to see who was better. But was it Bobby Riggs? I think I've heard that name associated with that match.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Jimmy Connors: He was a famous male tennis player, but I don't think he was involved in the \"Battle of the Sexes.\"\n\nB. Pete Sampras: Another great male player, but again, I don't recall him being part of that particular match.\n\nC. John McEnroe: He's known for his intense rivalries, especially with Bjorn Borg, but I don't think he was in the \"Battle of the Sexes.\"\n\nD. Bobby Riggs: Now, this name rings a bell. I think he was the one who challenged Billie Jean King to the match.\n\nWait a minute, I think Bobby Riggs was an older player by the time of the \"Battle of the Sexes.\" Let me try to recall: Bobby Riggs was born in 1918, and the match took place in 1973. So he would have been in his mid-50s at that time, while Billie Jean King was in her late 20s or early 30s. That makes sense, as it was sort of a generational and gender-based challenge.\n\nAlso, I remember that Bobby Riggs had made some comments about women not being as good as men in tennis, which led to the match. So that must have been the backdrop to the \"Battle of the Sexes.\"\n\nLet me double-check this. If Bobby Riggs was known for his provocative statements about women's tennis and challenged Billie Jean King to a match, and she accepted, then that would make sense. And indeed, that's what happened.\n\nI think the other players\u2014Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and John McEnroe\u2014were all active around different times or weren't directly involved in that event.\n\nSo, based on what I can recall, the correct answer should be D. Bobby Riggs.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly check if there was more than one \"Battle of the Sexes.\" I think there was only one famous one involving Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, which took place at the Houston Astrodome in 1973. That was a major event in tennis history, and Billie Jean King won it, which was a big deal for women's sports.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. Bobby Riggs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
