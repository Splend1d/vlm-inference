The parties agreed that the employment would be on an at-will basis. At the end of her first week of work, the employee was given a booklet entitled \"Employment Manual,\" with instructions to read the book in its entirety by the end of the following week. That evening, the employee began reading the manual. The first few pages described the history of the company and provided a personal biography of its president. On page 20, the manual stated that the company treats its employees \"as family\" and that employees will be discharged \"only with good cause. \" The employee finished reading the manual as requested. The employee interpreted the statement on page 20 as insuring continued employment unless good cause existed for termination. Over the next two months, the employee continually complained to her supervisor that the lighting in the accounting department was insufficient. Finally the supervisor, fed up with the complaints, fired the employee. The employee then sued the company, seeking to recover on grounds of promissory estoppel. Which of the following facts, if true and provable, would be most helpful for the employee's cause of action?\n\nA. At the time when the company hired the employee, the company subjectively intended that the employee be given job security.\nB. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\nC.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about an employee who was hired on an \"at-will\" basis but then received an employment manual that said employees would be treated \"as family\" and could only be discharged \"with good cause.\" Then, the employee got fired for complaining about lighting and is now suing the company using promissory estoppel. I need to figure out which fact would be most helpful for the employee's case.\n\nFirst, I should understand what promissory estoppel is. It's a legal doctrine that says if someone makes a promise that the other person relies on to their detriment, the promisor can be held to that promise even if there wasn't a formal contract. So, in this case, the employee is arguing that the company promised job security in the manual, and she relied on that promise by continuing to work there.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. At the time when the company hired the employee, the company subjectively intended that the employee be given job security.\n\nThis seems relevant because if the company intended to provide job security, it might support the idea that the manual's statement was a real promise, not just empty words. However, it's about the company's internal intention, which might be hard to prove.\n\nB. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\n\nThis is important because it shows that the employee relied on the manual's statement. If she believed she could only be fired for good cause, and acted on that belief, that's a key part of promissory estoppel.\n\nC. Just prior to receiving the manual, the employee seriously considered quitting, but continued to work for the company in reliance on the provisions contained on page 20 of the manual.\n\nThis is a strong point because it directly shows that the employee changed her behavior based on the manual's promise. She was thinking of quitting but stayed because of the job security promise. That's direct evidence of reliance.\n\nD. The employee's complaints regarding the insufficient lighting were factually true and justifiable.\n\nWhile this might be relevant to whether the termination was with \"good cause,\" it's more about the merits of the termination itself rather than the promissory estoppel claim. The core of promissory estoppel is whether the employee relied on the company's promise to her detriment.\n\nSo, comparing these options, C seems the most directly relevant to promissory estoppel because it shows specific reliance by the employee, changing her decision to stay or leave based on the manual's promise.\n\nBut let's think deeper. If the company intended to provide job security (option A), that might support the idea that the manual's statement was a real promise. However, the company's intention is less important than the employee's reliance on the promise.\n\nOption B shows that the employee interpreted the manual to mean job security, which is important, but option C goes further by showing that she actually relied on that interpretation to make a decision\u2014specifically, not quitting.\n\nOption D is more about the fairness of the termination, which is related but not directly tied to the promissory estoppel claim.\n\nTherefore, the fact that would be most helpful is option C: just prior to receiving the manual, the employee seriously considered quitting, but continued to work for the company in reliance on the provisions contained on page 20 of the manual.\n\nThis directly ties the employee's reliance on the promise to a specific action (staying employed), which is a key element of promissory estoppel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nC"
