The options are process improvement, the techno-structural change model, the job characteristics model, and socio-technical systems. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these perspectives focuses on. Starting with process improvement, I think that's more about making efficiencies in how work is done, like reducing waste or improving workflows. It might indirectly affect job satisfaction, but I don't think it's primarily aimed at enhancing job satisfaction and productivity in the way the question is suggesting.\n\nNext is the techno-structural change model. From what I recall, this approach involves using technology and changing the structure of work to improve performance. It sounds like it could relate to productivity, but I'm not sure if it directly targets job satisfaction in the same way.\n\nThen there's the job characteristics model. I remember learning about this one in class. It's all about designing jobs that are more enriching and motivating for employees. It identifies core job dimensions like skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. When these are present, it's supposed to lead to higher job satisfaction and, consequently, increased productivity. That sounds pretty spot on for what the question is asking.\n\nLastly, socio-technical systems. This seems to be about balancing the social and technical aspects of work. It's about designing work systems that consider both the human elements and the technology they use. While this might contribute to job satisfaction and productivity, it seems a bit broader than the job characteristics model.\n\nComparing all these, the job characteristics model seems to be the one that specifically focuses on enhancing job satisfaction and, as a result, productivity. So, I think the answer is C. Job characteristics model.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Process improvement is more about efficiency and cutting costs, techno-structural change is about using tech to change work structures, which might indirectly affect satisfaction, but it's not the primary goal. Socio-technical systems are about balancing social and technical aspects, which could influence job satisfaction, but again, not as directly as the job characteristics model.\n\nYeah, I think I'm confident with my choice. The job characteristics model is the one that directly aims to enhance job satisfaction and productivity through enriching job design.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
