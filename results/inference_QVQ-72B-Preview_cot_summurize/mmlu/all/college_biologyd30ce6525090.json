                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Approximately what fraction of the human genome encodes proteins?\" And the options are A. 2%, B. 25%, C. 50%, and D. 90%. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that the human genome is the complete set of DNA contained in our cells. It's like the blueprint for building and running our bodies. Now, parts of this genome code for proteins, which are essential for almost every function in our bodies. But not all of the genome is used to make proteins, right? There's a lot of other DNA that doesn't code for proteins, and some of that might have other functions, like regulating when and where genes are turned on or off.\n\nI remember hearing about something called junk DNA, which was thought to be parts of the genome that didn't do anything, but now scientists think that a lot of it might have important functions after all. So, with that in mind, I need to recall what percentage of the human genome is actually coding for proteins.\n\nLet me think back to my biology classes. I think that in humans, only a small portion of the genome is made up of protein-coding genes. The human genome is pretty big, with about 3 billion base pairs, and it contains around 20,000 protein-coding genes. But how does that translate into percentage?\n\nWait a minute, if there are 3 billion base pairs and 20,000 genes, each gene on average would be how many base pairs? Let's see, if each gene is, say, 1,000 base pairs on average, then 20,000 genes would be 20 million base pairs. That's only about 0.67% of the genome. But I've heard that the actual coding sequences, meaning the exons that get translated into proteins, are even less.\n\nIn fact, human genes have a lot of non-coding regions called introns that are spliced out before the RNA is translated into protein. So, the exons are just a small part of the gene. Maybe around 1-2% of the genome is coding sequence.\n\nLet me check that. If the human genome is 3 billion base pairs and coding sequences make up about 1-2%, that would be 30-60 million base pairs. That seems plausible for the total amount of DNA that directly codes for proteins.\n\nBut wait, I think I've heard something about the ENCODE project, which suggested that a larger portion of the genome is transcribed into RNA, even if it doesn't code for proteins. Does that change things?\n\nThe ENCODE project found that a significant portion of the genome is transcribed into non-coding RNAs, which have various functions in the cell, like regulating gene expression or being involved in cell structure. But even if it's transcribed, if it doesn't code for proteins, it doesn't count towards the protein-coding fraction.\n\nSo, to reiterate, only the parts of the genome that actually code for amino acids in proteins should be considered in this question. Based on that, I think the correct answer is A. 2%.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. For example, some genes might have multiple coding regions or something like that, but no, that wouldn't significantly increase the coding percentage.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total length of all coding sequences in the genome. If the average gene has a certain number of base pairs in its exons, and there are so many genes, I can calculate the total coding DNA.\n\nLet's assume an average human gene has about 5,000 base pairs, but only 1% of that is coding sequence. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Actually, I think the exons make up a larger portion than that in some genes.\n\nI found a quick calculation online once that said the total length of all exons in the human genome is around 50 million base pairs. Given that the total genome is 3 billion base pairs, that would be roughly 1.67% of the genome coding for proteins.\n\nHmm, that's closer to option A. 2%, but a bit less. Maybe the exact number is around 1-2%, and 2% is the best estimate among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering both protein-coding and non-protein-coding RNA genes. But no, the question specifically asks for the fraction that encodes proteins.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward answer is that approximately 2% of the human genome encodes proteins. So, the answer should be A. 2%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 2\\%} \\]"
