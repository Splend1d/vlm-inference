                    "text": "Let's see. I have this logical formula: ~C \u2228 D, and I need to translate it into an English sentence using the given key. The key assigns letters to specific actions:\n\n- A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.\n\n- B: Izzy plays Minecraft.\n\n- C: Emily stops working.\n\n- D: Russell makes dinner.\n\n- E: Ashleigh stops by.\n\nSo, the formula is ~C \u2228 D. I remember that in logic, ~ means \"not,\" \u2228 means \"or.\" So, it's \"not C or D,\" which translates to \"Emily doesn't stop working or Russell makes dinner.\"\n\nNow, I need to match this with one of the options provided:\n\nA. If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner.\n\nB. Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner.\n\nC. Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.\n\nD. Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\n\nHmm, let's analyze each option.\n\nOption A: If Emily doesn't stop working, then Russell makes dinner.\n\nIn logical terms, this is ~C \u2192 D.\n\nI know that ~C \u2192 D is logically equivalent to D \u2228 ~C, which is the same as ~C \u2228 D.\n\nWait, is that right? Actually, no. The logical equivalence is that ~C \u2192 D is the same as ~D \u2192 C, but I might be getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. The original formula is ~C \u2228 D.\n\nOption A says ~C \u2192 D.\n\nBut ~C \u2228 D is not the same as ~C \u2192 D.\n\nWait, in logic, P \u2192 Q is equivalent to ~P \u2228 Q.\n\nSo, ~C \u2192 D is equivalent to ~(~C) \u2228 D, which simplifies to C \u2228 D.\n\nThat's different from ~C \u2228 D.\n\nSo, option A is not matching the original formula.\n\nOption B: Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner.\n\nI think \"unless\" translates to \"if not,\" so this would be C \u2228 D.\n\nBecause \"Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner\" means \"If Russell does not make dinner, then Emily stops working.\"\n\nIn logical terms, that's D \u2192 C, which is equivalent to ~D \u2228 C.\n\nAgain, this is different from ~C \u2228 D.\n\nOption C: Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.\n\nThis would translate to C \u2228 ~D.\n\nBecause \"unless\" means \"if not,\" so \"Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner\" means \"If Russell does make dinner, then Emily stops working.\"\n\nWhich is D \u2192 C, but wait, that seems similar to option B.\n\nWait, no. \"Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner\" should be \"If Russell makes dinner, then Emily stops working.\"\n\nWhich is D \u2192 C, which is the same as ~D \u2228 C.\n\nAgain, that's different from ~C \u2228 D.\n\nOption D: Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\n\nThis is ~C \u2228 D.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\n\"Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\"\n\n\"Unless\" means \"if not,\" so this means \"If Russell does not make dinner, then Emily doesn't stop working.\"\n\nWhich is ~D \u2192 ~C.\n\nIn logic, ~D \u2192 ~C is equivalent to C \u2228 D, which is not the same as ~C \u2228 D.\n\nWait, no. Actually, ~D \u2192 ~C is equivalent to D \u2228 ~C, which is the same as ~C \u2228 D.\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nI know that P \u2192 Q is equivalent to ~P \u2228 Q.\n\nSo, ~D \u2192 ~C would be ~~D \u2228 ~C, which is D \u2228 ~C.\n\nWait, no. P \u2192 Q is equivalent to ~P \u2228 Q.\n\nSo, ~D \u2192 ~C is equivalent to ~(~D) \u2228 ~C, which is D \u2228 ~C.\n\nBut I need ~C \u2228 D.\n\nAre D \u2228 ~C and ~C \u2228 D the same?\n\nIn logic, the disjunction is commutative, so yes, D \u2228 ~C is the same as ~C \u2228 D.\n\nTherefore, option D matches the original formula.\n\nSo, the correct translation of ~C \u2228 D is \"Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\"\n\nLet me just confirm.\n\nOption D: Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\n\nWhich translates to ~D \u2192 ~C, which is D \u2228 ~C, which is ~C \u2228 D.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
