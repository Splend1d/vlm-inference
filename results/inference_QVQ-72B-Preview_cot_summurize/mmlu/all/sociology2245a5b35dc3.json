                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about privatization and how it changed the relationship between companies and managers, based on something Mulholland said in 1998. I'm not super familiar with this specific source, but I do know a bit about privatization in general. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, privatization is when something that was owned or operated by the government is transferred to private ownership. So, companies that were once state-owned become privately owned, usually through selling shares to the public or to specific investors. This can happen for various reasons, like the government wanting to reduce its involvement in business, improve efficiency, or raise money.\n\nNow, the question is about how this process changes the relationship between companies and managers. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that flexibility was reduced by the introduction of detailed daily worksheets. Hmm, that sounds a bit specific. Daily worksheets sound like they might be part of some management system, maybe for tracking tasks or productivity. But I'm not sure how this directly relates to the relationship between companies and managers after privatization. Maybe it's about increased bureaucracy or reporting requirements, but I need to think more about this.\n\nOption B says that the state had greater control than managers over production processes. Wait, but privatization is supposed to reduce state control, right? If a company is privatized, the state should have less say in how it's run, not more. So, this option seems counterintuitive. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nOption C says that ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers. Well, in privatization, ownership is typically transferred from the state to private shareholders. Sometimes, this can involve selling shares to the general public, which would include small shareholders. But there have been cases where privatization led to concentration of ownership in the hands of a few large shareholders or managers. This could happen through management buyouts, for example. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says that employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment. This suggests a shift in employment practices, maybe towards more performance-based hiring and firing. Before privatization, in state-owned enterprises, job security might have been higher, and hiring might have been based on connections or other non-performance factors. After privatization, companies might adopt more market-oriented practices, where performance is key. This also seems plausible.\n\nSo, now I have to decide between options C and D, as option A seems a bit too specific and option B seems contradictory to what I know about privatization.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Mulholland wrote in 1998, which was a time when many countries were undergoing privatization reforms, especially in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union. So, perhaps his argument was specific to that context.\n\nIn some privatization processes, especially in transition economies, there were cases where senior managers of former state-owned enterprises ended up acquiring significant ownership stakes, sometimes at the expense of small shareholders. This is sometimes referred to as \"insider privatization\" or \"management buyouts.\" This could fit with option C.\n\nOn the other hand, option D suggests a change in employment practices, moving from a system based on trust and commitment to one based on performance. This could also be a consequence of privatization, as private companies might adopt more results-oriented management styles.\n\nBut maybe Mulholland was focusing on the change in ownership structure and the potential for managers to gain disproportionate control after privatization. That seems like a significant shift in the relationship between companies and managers.\n\nLet me consider some examples. In Russia during the 1990s, for instance, many state-owned companies were privatized through voucher privatization, which sometimes resulted in managers and insiders gaining control of the companies at the expense of the intended broad-based ownership. This led to a concentration of ownership and wealth in the hands of a few oligarchs.\n\nSimilarly, in other countries, privatization processes have sometimes favored managers or insiders, who had better knowledge and access to the companies being privatized.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to align with what happened in some privatization processes.\n\nBut let's not dismiss option D entirely. It's possible that after privatization, employment practices changed, becoming more performance-driven. This could be seen as a positive change, as it might lead to more efficient operations and higher productivity. However, it could also mean that job security decreased, and employees felt more pressure to perform.\n\nGiven that Mulholland was likely referring to a specific aspect of the relationship between companies and managers, perhaps focusing on the ownership structure, I'm leaning towards option C.\n\nLet me see if I can find any references or quotes from Mulholland's 1998 work. Unfortunately, I don't have direct access to it right now, but maybe I can recall some general principles.\n\nIn general, privatization involves transferring ownership from the public sector to the private sector. This can lead to changes in management practices, corporate governance, and employment conditions.\n\nIf I recall correctly, in some privatization cases, senior managers did acquire significant ownership stakes, sometimes through favorable terms or by outbidding other potential buyers. This could lead to a situation where managers have both control over the company's operations and a substantial financial interest in its performance.\n\nThis alignment of interests\u2014where managers are both managers and owners\u2014could be seen as a change in the relationship between companies and managers. Previously, in state-owned enterprises, managers might have been more accountable to government officials or political interests rather than to shareholders.\n\nSo, from this perspective, option C seems to capture this shift accurately.\n\nOption D, while possibly a consequence of privatization, might not be as directly related to the relationship between companies and managers in the way that ownership structure is.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option C: ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other angle I might be missing.\n\nFor example, perhaps Mulholland was focusing on the agency problem in privatized companies. In state-owned enterprises, there might be agency issues between the government and managers, but after privatization, there's a shift to agency issues between shareholders and managers.\n\nHowever, if ownership is concentrated in the hands of senior managers, that could mitigate some agency problems, as managers have a direct stake in the company's success.\n\nAlternatively, if managers have too much control, it could lead to entrenchment and self-dealing, which is another form of agency problem.\n\nStill, the key point here is the transfer of ownership from small shareholders to senior managers, which aligns with option C.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Option A: flexibility reduced by daily worksheets \u2013 seems too specific and not directly related to the relationship between companies and managers.\n\n- Option B: state has greater control than managers \u2013 contradicts the general aim of privatization, which is to reduce state control.\n\n- Option C: ownership transferred from small shareholders to senior managers \u2013 aligns with some privatization processes, especially insider privatizations or management buyouts.\n\n- Option D: employment depends on performance rather than trust and commitment \u2013 while possible, this is more about employment practices and may not directly address the relationship between companies and managers in terms of ownership and control.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
