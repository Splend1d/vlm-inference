                    "text": "So I have this problem here: Find the order of the factor group (Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085)/(<1,1>). The options are A.1, B.2, C.5, D.11. Hmm, I need to understand what this is asking.\n\nFirst off, Z\u2081\u2081 and Z\u2081\u2085 are groups of integers modulo 11 and 15, respectively. So, Z\u2081\u2081 has 11 elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, and Z\u2081\u2085 has 15 elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}.\n\nThe group Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085 is the direct product of these two groups. That means its elements are ordered pairs where the first component is from Z\u2081\u2081 and the second is from Z\u2081\u2085. So, the total number of elements in Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085 is 11 * 15 = 165.\n\nNow, the notation <1,1> refers to the subgroup generated by the element (1,1) in Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085. So, <1,1> consists of all multiples of (1,1), which are just repeated additions of (1,1) to itself.\n\nIn group theory, the order of an element in a direct product is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its components. The order of 1 in Z\u2081\u2081 is 11 because 11 is the smallest positive integer n such that 1*n is congruent to 0 mod 11. Similarly, the order of 1 in Z\u2081\u2085 is 15.\n\nSo, the order of (1,1) in Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085 is LCM(11,15). Since 11 and 15 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the LCM is 11 * 15 = 165. That means the subgroup <1,1> has 165 elements.\n\nBut wait, that seems off because in Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085, the element (1,1) being the generator of a subgroup of order 165 would imply that <1,1> is equal to the whole group Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085. Is that the case?\n\nLet me think about it. If I add (1,1) to itself 11 times, I get (11,11), which is (0,11) in Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085, which is (0,11 mod 15) = (0,11). So, after 11 additions, we don't get back to the identity (0,0). Maybe after 15 additions, (15,15) is (4,0) in Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085, since 15 mod 11 is 4 and 15 mod 15 is 0. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, to find the order of (1,1), I need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n*(1,1) = (0,0) in Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085. So, n*1 \u2261 0 mod 11 and n*1 \u2261 0 mod 15. As I thought earlier, the smallest such n is the LCM of 11 and 15, which is indeed 165. Therefore, <1,1> has 165 elements, which is the same as the order of Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085. That suggests that <1,1> is equal to Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the order of the factor group (Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085)/<1,1>. If <1,1> is equal to Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085, then the factor group is the trivial group with only one element, so its order should be 1. That would correspond to option A.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit suspicious because maybe <1,1> isn't the whole group Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that.\n\nLet me double-check. In Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085, the element (1,1) has order LCM(11,15) = 165, and since Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085 has 11 * 15 = 165 elements, <1,1> should indeed be the whole group. Therefore, the factor group (Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085)/<1,1> is the trivial group with one element.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085 is an abelian group, and <1,1> is a subgroup of order 165, then the factor group is trivial.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to look at it. The order of the factor group is equal to the index of the subgroup <1,1> in Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085. Since |Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085| = 165 and |<1,1>| = 165, the index is 165 / 165 = 1, so again, the factor group has order 1.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe <1,1> isn't the whole group, but I don't see how that could be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085 as a group under addition, and <1,1> is the subgroup generated by (1,1). Then, the factor group is indeed the trivial group with one element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using the first isomorphism theorem or considering the structure of the group.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the orders of the components. Z\u2081\u2081 is cyclic of order 11, and Z\u2081\u2085 is cyclic of order 15. So, Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085 is cyclic of order 11*15 = 165, generated by (1,1). Therefore, <1,1> is the whole group, and the factor group is trivial.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A.1.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the factor group modulo the subgroup generated by (1,0) and (0,1), but that's not what's written. The subgroup is explicitly <1,1>, which is the subgroup generated by (1,1).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the notation. Perhaps <1,1> is not the subgroup generated by (1,1), but something else. But no, <1,1> standardly means the subgroup generated by (1,1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the order of the factor group (Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085)/N, where N is the subgroup generated by (1,1), and we need to find |(Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085)/N|.\n\nAs established, |Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085| = 165 and |N| = 165, so the index is 1, meaning the factor group has order 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to compute this, like using the structure of Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085.\n\nWait, Z\u2081\u2081 is isomorphic to Z/11Z and Z\u2081\u2085 to Z/15Z, so Z\u2081\u2081 x Z\u2081\u2085 is isomorphic to Z/11Z \u00d7 Z/15Z.\n\nThe subgroup <1,1> corresponds to the element (1 mod 11, 1 mod 15), and its order is LCM(11,15)=165, as previously determined.\n\nTherefore, the factor group is indeed trivial, with order 1.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A.1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A.1} \\]"
