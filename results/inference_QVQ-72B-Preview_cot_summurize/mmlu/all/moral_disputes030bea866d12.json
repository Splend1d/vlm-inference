                    "text": " I'm trying to answer this question about Altman's characterization of racial epithets and terms of abuse. The question is asking what these terms are used to express, according to Altman, and the options are moral blame, moral praise, moral contempt, or none of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Altman is saying about these terms. Racial epithets are offensive words used to refer to people based on their race, and terms of abuse are insulting or derogatory expressions. Altman seems to be discussing how these terms function in communication, particularly in expressing extreme forms of moral judgments.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Moral blame: This would involve attributing fault or responsibility for something negative. Using a racial epithet might be seen as a way to assign blame based on race, which is clearly inappropriate and unethical.\n\nB. Moral praise: This is the opposite of blame; it involves commending someone for positive attributes or actions. It's hard to see how racial epithets, which are inherently negative, would be used for moral praise. Maybe in some ironic or sarcastic context, but generally, these terms are used to denigrate, not to praise.\n\nC. Moral contempt: Contempt is a strong feeling of disapproval and superiority over someone else, often due to their perceived moral failings or inferiority. Racial epithets could be seen as expressions of contempt based on race, suggesting a deep-seated disregard for the inherent worth or dignity of the person being addressed.\n\nD. None of the above: This option suggests that Altman doesn't characterize racial epithets as expressing any of these moral concepts, which seems unlikely. If this were the case, perhaps he views them as purely expressive of emotion without conveying a specific moral judgment.\n\nGiven that racial epithets are primarily used to insult and degrade individuals based on their race, it's reasonable to consider that they express moral blame or contempt. They are not typically used to praise someone, so option B seems less plausible.\n\nBetween moral blame and moral contempt, there's a difference in focus. Moral blame emphasizes assigning responsibility for wrongdoings, while moral contempt involves a judgment of worthlessness or inferiority. Racial epithets are often used to express a sense of inherent inferiority or worthlessness based on race, which aligns more closely with contempt rather than blame.\n\nMoreover, blame often presupposes that the person being blamed has agency and could have acted differently. Contempt, on the other hand, may deny the person's agency or worth, seeing them as inherently bad or inferior.\n\nTherefore, using racial epithets seems more aligned with expressing moral contempt than with assigning moral blame.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether Altman is discussing the illocutionary force of these terms. In speech act theory, illocutionary acts are the intentions behind utterances. Perhaps Altman is arguing that racial epithets are used to express extreme forms of condemnation or to perform acts of moral denigration.\n\nIf that's the case, then expressing moral contempt would fit into that framework, as contempt is a particularly strong and negative moral judgment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Altman views these terms as expressing a combination of blame and contempt, making it difficult to categorize under just one of the provided options.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the best answer according to Altman's characterization, and the options are discrete, I need to choose the one that most accurately reflects his view.\n\nLet me think about some examples. Suppose someone uses a racial epithet to refer to another person. What is being expressed in that act?\n\nIs it blame for a specific action? Perhaps, but often these terms are used without reference to any particular action, suggesting that the contempt is for the person's perceived racial identity itself, not for something they have done.\n\nThis further supports the idea that racial epithets are primarily expressions of moral contempt.\n\nAnother angle: in moral philosophy, contempt is sometimes discussed as a vice, a negative emotional response that can be morally inappropriate. Using racial epithets would be an extreme expression of such a vice, reinforcing the idea that it's an expression of moral contempt.\n\nAdditionally, considering the social and historical contexts in which racial epithets are used, they are often employed to assert dominance and inferiority, which aligns with expressions of contempt.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would conclude that, in Altman's characterization, racial epithets and similar terms of abuse are communicative tools for expressing an extreme form of moral contempt.\n\nSo, the answer is C. moral contempt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
