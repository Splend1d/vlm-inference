                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out why white-collar crime is low in visibility. The options are:\n\nA. It involves only small amounts of money.\n\nB. The proletariat can outsmart the bourgeoisie.\n\nC. The police turn a blind eye to corporate crime.\n\nD. It goes undetected in the context of everyday business transactions.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what is white-collar crime? I remember from my criminology class that white-collar crime refers to financially motivated offenses committed by individuals in their professional capacities, usually involving deceit. These crimes are often committed by people who hold respected social positions, like businessmen, doctors, or lawyers.\n\nNow, why might these crimes be low in visibility?\n\nOption A says it involves only small amounts of money. That doesn't sound right. White-collar crimes can involve huge sums of money\u2014think of embezzlement scandals where millions or even billions are stolen. So, it's not just small amounts. Maybe this option is a\u8bef\u533a.\n\nOption B mentions the proletariat outsmarting the bourgeoisie. Hmm, proletariat refers to the working class, and bourgeoisie to the ruling class. In the context of white-collar crime, which is typically committed by people in higher social positions, this seems a bit off. White-collar criminals are usually part of the bourgeoisie, not the proletariat. So, maybe this isn't the reason for low visibility.\n\nOption C suggests that the police turn a blind eye to corporate crime. While there might be cases where law enforcement doesn't prioritize certain types of crimes, I don't think this is the primary reason for the low visibility of white-collar crimes. Police are supposed to enforce the law regardless of the perpetrator's social status. Plus, there have been high-profile cases where white-collar criminals have been prosecuted.\n\nOption D says that it goes undetected in the context of everyday business transactions. This seems plausible. White-collar crimes often involve complex financial maneuvers that can be hidden within legitimate business activities. For example, accounting fraud or insider trading can be difficult to detect because they're embedded in the day-to-day operations of companies.\n\nLet me consider this further. White-collar crimes are often sophisticated and require knowledge of financial systems and regulations. Perpetrators can use their expertise to mask their activities, making it hard for outsiders to spot anything amiss. Additionally, these crimes may not leave obvious physical traces, unlike street crimes, which can make them less visible to the general public.\n\nAlso, white-collar crimes can be time-consuming to investigate. They often require extensive analysis of financial records and data, which can take months or even years to uncover. This complexity and the resources needed to detect and prove these crimes might contribute to their low visibility.\n\nMoreover, in some cases, companies may try to handle white-collar crimes internally to avoid bad publicity. If a company discovers that one of its employees has been engaging in fraudulent activities, they might choose to terminate the employee quietly rather than reporting the crime to authorities. This can also contribute to the underreporting and low visibility of white-collar crimes.\n\nAnother factor could be that white-collar crimes are sometimes viewed as victimless or less serious than other types of crimes. However, this isn't accurate, as these crimes can have severe impacts on individuals, organizations, and even entire economies.\n\nBut among the given options, D seems to be the most accurate reason for the low visibility of white-collar crime. It directly addresses how these crimes are integrated into everyday business transactions and can go undetected as a result.\n\nLet me just double-check. Is there any evidence to suggest that white-collar crimes involve only small amounts of money? No, quite the contrary. Some of the largest financial scandals in history involve white-collar criminals defrauding investors or manipulating markets for massive profits.\n\nAs for option B, it seems like a misdirection. Proletariat outsmarting bourgeoisie isn't typically how white-collar crime works. These crimes are usually committed by those in positions of power and trust within corporations or organizations.\n\nOption C might play a role in some instances, but it's not a general rule. Law enforcement agencies do investigate and prosecute white-collar crimes, as evidenced by various high-profile cases.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D: it goes undetected in the context of everyday business transactions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
