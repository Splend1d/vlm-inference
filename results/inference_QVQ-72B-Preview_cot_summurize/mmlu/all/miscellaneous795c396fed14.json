                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is: how much more electrical energy will the United States need to generate if everyone drives electric cars? And the options are given in joules, from 2*10^19 J up to 2*10^25 J.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much energy is currently used by gasoline-powered cars in the U.S. and then see how much electrical energy would be required to replace that usage with electric vehicles (EVs). The difference between the energy from electricity and the current gasoline consumption will tell us how much additional electrical energy is needed.\n\nLet me start by estimating the total energy used by gasoline-powered vehicles in the U.S. annually.\n\nI know that the average car in the U.S. drives about 13,500 miles per year. Let's use that as a starting point.\n\nNext, I need to know the average fuel efficiency of cars in the U.S. According to recent data, the average fuel economy is around 25 miles per gallon (mpg).\n\nSo, if a car drives 13,500 miles a year and gets 25 mpg, it would consume 13,500 / 25 = 540 gallons of gasoline per year.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much energy is contained in one gallon of gasoline. I recall that one gallon of gasoline contains approximately 125,000 British thermal units (BTUs). To convert that to joules, I remember that 1 BTU is about 1055.06 joules. So, 125,000 BTUs per gallon is 125,000 * 1055.06 J \u2248 131,882,500 J per gallon.\n\nTherefore, each car consumes about 540 gallons * 131,882,500 J/gallon \u2248 7.12 * 10^10 J per year.\n\nNow, I need to know how many cars there are in the U.S. According to statistics, there are roughly 280 million vehicles in the U.S., but not all are cars; some are trucks, SUVs, etc. For simplicity, let's assume that about 250 million vehicles are passenger cars.\n\nSo, if each car uses 7.12 * 10^10 J per year, then the total energy used by all cars would be 250,000,000 * 7.12 * 10^10 J \u2248 1.78 * 10^19 J per year.\n\nNow, if these cars were electric, we need to know how much electrical energy would be required to drive the same distance.\n\nFirst, let's find the average energy consumption for electric vehicles. I know that the Tesla Model 3 has an energy consumption of about 250 watt-hours per mile, but let's use a more general figure. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that electric vehicles use about 300 watt-hours per mile on average.\n\nSo, for a car driving 13,500 miles per year, the energy consumed would be 13,500 * 300 watt-hours = 4,050,000 watt-hours or 4,050 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year.\n\nTherefore, for 250 million cars, the total electrical energy required would be 250,000,000 * 4,050 kWh \u2248 1.0125 * 10^12 MWh or 1.0125 * 10^19 kWh.\n\nWait a minute, but energy units need to be consistent. Since the options are in joules, I should convert this to joules. One kWh is equal to 3.6 * 10^6 joules.\n\nSo, 1.0125 * 10^19 kWh * 3.6 * 10^6 J/kWh = 3.645 * 10^25 J.\n\nNow, earlier I calculated that the total energy used by gasoline-powered cars is approximately 1.78 * 10^19 J. So, the additional electrical energy required would be 3.645 * 10^25 J - 1.78 * 10^19 J.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the total energy used by gasoline cars is much less than the energy required by electric cars. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the efficiency of electricity use in electric vehicles versus gasoline cars.\n\nI know that electric vehicles are more efficient than gasoline-powered cars. The efficiency of gasoline engines is typically around 25% to 30%, whereas electric vehicles can be up to 90% efficient.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust my calculations to account for the difference in efficiency.\n\nLet me recast my approach.\n\nFirst, find the total energy required to move the vehicles, regardless of the source, and then see how much energy is needed from electricity considering the efficiency of electric vehicles.\n\nFirst, find the total mechanical energy required to move all the cars.\n\nAssuming that electric vehicles are, say, 80% efficient, then the total mechanical energy required would be the same as what is currently provided by gasoline, but electric vehicles would need only 80% of the energy content to achieve the same work.\n\nWait, no. Actually, because electric vehicles are more efficient, they need less energy input to do the same work.\n\nSo, if electric vehicles are, say, 80% efficient and gasoline cars are 25% efficient, then the energy required for electric vehicles would be less.\n\nBut perhaps I should calculate it differently.\n\nLet me think about the work done to move the vehicles.\n\nThe work done is force times distance, but assuming efficiency is accounted for in the energy consumption figures I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the energy content of the gasoline and relate it to the efficiency of the vehicles.\n\nLet me try this way:\n\nFirst, find the total mechanical energy required to move all cars, which is the same regardless of the power source.\n\nThen, find how much energy is currently supplied by gasoline and how much would be required from electricity.\n\nGiven that gasoline has an energy content of about 125,000 BTUs per gallon, which is about 131,882,500 J per gallon, and considering that gasoline engines are about 25% efficient, the mechanical energy output per gallon is approximately 25% of 131,882,500 J, which is about 32,970,625 J per gallon.\n\nSo, if a car consumes 540 gallons per year, the mechanical energy provided is 540 * 32,970,625 J \u2248 1.78 * 10^11 J per year.\n\nFor 250 million cars, the total mechanical energy required is 250,000,000 * 1.78 * 10^11 J \u2248 4.45 * 10^19 J per year.\n\nNow, if we switch to electric vehicles that are, say, 80% efficient, then the electrical energy required to provide the same mechanical energy would be 4.45 * 10^19 J / 0.8 = 5.56 * 10^19 J per year.\n\nBut wait, earlier I used 25% efficiency for gasoline cars, which might not be accurate. Maybe I should look up more precise figures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total primary energy consumption for transportation in the U.S. and see how much additional electricity would be needed if all cars were electric.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI recall that in the U.S., transportation accounts for a significant portion of energy consumption, mostly from petroleum. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), annual gasoline consumption in the U.S. is roughly 140 billion gallons.\n\nIf each gallon of gasoline contains about 125,000 BTUs, then total energy from gasoline is 140 * 10^9 * 125,000 BTUs \u2248 1.75 * 10^14 BTUs or about 1.82 * 10^17 joules.\n\nBut this is the total energy content of the gasoline, not the useful work done.\n\nGiven that gasoline engines are about 25% efficient, the useful mechanical work is 25% of that, which is about 4.55 * 10^16 joules.\n\nIf we switch to electric vehicles that are, say, 80% efficient, then the electrical energy required to provide the same mechanical work would be 4.55 * 10^16 J / 0.8 = 5.69 * 10^16 J.\n\nBut this seems too small, considering that the earlier calculation based on per-car consumption suggested much higher numbers.\n\nThere must be a mistake here. Perhaps I'm mixing up units or miscalculating the total gasoline consumption.\n\nLet me check the gasoline consumption figure. According to the EIA, the annual gasoline consumption in the U.S. is approximately 140 billion gallons per year.\n\nIf each gallon contains 125,000 BTUs, then total energy is 140 * 10^9 * 125,000 BTUs = 1.75 * 10^14 BTUs.\n\nConverting BTUs to joules: 1 BTU = 1055.06 J, so 1.75 * 10^14 BTUs * 1055.06 J/BTU \u2248 1.84 * 10^17 joules.\n\nNow, if gasoline engines are 25% efficient, the useful work is 25% of 1.84 * 10^17 J, which is about 4.6 * 10^16 J.\n\nIf electric vehicles are 80% efficient, then the electrical energy required is 4.6 * 10^16 J / 0.8 = 5.75 * 10^16 J.\n\nBut this seems way too low compared to earlier calculations. There must be a mistake in assuming that all gasoline is used for passenger cars.\n\nActually, gasoline is used for various purposes, not just passenger cars. There are also light trucks, SUVs, and other vehicles. So, perhaps the total gasoline consumption includes fuels for vehicles other than passenger cars.\n\nEarlier, I assumed there are about 250 million passenger cars in the U.S., but total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the U.S. are around 3.4 trillion miles per year, with an average fuel economy of about 25 mpg, leading to about 136 billion gallons of gasoline consumed annually.\n\nWait, that contradicts the EIA's figure of 140 billion gallons. Maybe I need to reconcile these numbers.\n\nAccording to the Federal Highway Administration, total VMT in 2020 were about 2.9 trillion miles, and the average fuel economy was around 24.8 mpg, which would imply gasoline consumption of about 117 billion gallons.\n\nBut the EIA reports higher consumption figures. Perhaps some gasoline is used for other purposes besides road transportation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not all VMT are gasoline-powered; some could be electric or diesel.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that gasoline consumption is primarily for passenger cars and light-duty vehicles.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that there are about 250 million passenger cars, if each car drives 13,500 miles per year at 25 mpg, they would consume 540 gallons each, totaling 135 billion gallons, which is less than the EIA's figure.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that my initial assumption about the number of passenger cars or their average mileage may be off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total gasoline consumption includes both cars and light trucks, which together make up the majority of vehicles.\n\nAccording to some sources, light-duty vehicles (cars and light trucks) account for about 55% of total gasoline consumption.\n\nSo, perhaps gasoline consumption for passenger cars is around 55% of 140 billion gallons, which is about 77 billion gallons.\n\nIf each car consumes 540 gallons per year, then the number of cars would be 77 * 10^9 / 540 \u2248 142.6 million cars.\n\nBut earlier, I thought there were about 250 million passenger cars. There's a mismatch here.\n\nI need to find more accurate data.\n\nUpon checking, the U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that there were about 284 million registered vehicles in the U.S. in 2020, but not all are passenger cars. The breakdown varies, but approximately 60% are passenger cars, and 40% are light trucks and SUVs.\n\nSo, about 170 million passenger cars.\n\nIf the average passenger car drives 13,500 miles per year at 25 mpg, it consumes 540 gallons per year, so total consumption would be 170 * 10^6 * 540 = 9.18 * 10^10 gallons.\n\nBut according to the EIA, total gasoline consumption is about 140 billion gallons. So, either my assumption about the number of passenger cars is incorrect, or gasoline is being used for other purposes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average fuel consumption per car is different.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nAccording to the EIA, total gasoline consumption is about 140 billion gallons per year.\n\nIf we assume that 60% of vehicles are passenger cars and 40% are light trucks/SUVs, and that light trucks have a different average fuel economy, perhaps around 20 mpg, while cars are at 25 mpg.\n\nThen, total gasoline consumption would be:\n\nPassenger cars: 170 million cars * 13,500 miles / 25 mpg = 170 * 10^6 * 13,500 / 25 = 9.18 * 10^10 gallons.\n\nLight trucks/SUVs: 114 million vehicles * 13,500 miles / 20 mpg = 114 * 10^6 * 13,500 / 20 = 7.695 * 10^10 gallons.\n\nTotal gasoline consumption: 9.18 * 10^10 + 7.695 * 10^10 = 1.6875 * 10^11 gallons.\n\nBut this is much less than the EIA's figure of 140 billion gallons. There must be something wrong with my assumptions.\n\nPerhaps the average miles driven per vehicle is higher, or maybe there are more vehicles than I estimated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fuel economy figures are lower on average.\n\nLet me adjust the average fuel economy to 22 mpg for cars and 18 mpg for light trucks.\n\nThen:\n\nPassenger cars: 170 million * 13,500 miles / 22 mpg = 170 * 10^6 * 13,500 / 22 \u2248 1.05 * 10^11 gallons.\n\nLight trucks/SUVs: 114 million * 13,500 miles / 18 mpg = 114 * 10^6 * 13,500 / 18 \u2248 8.55 * 10^10 gallons.\n\nTotal: 1.05 * 10^11 + 8.55 * 10^10 = 1.905 * 10^11 gallons.\n\nStill less than 140 billion gallons.\n\nPerhaps the average miles driven per vehicle are higher. Let's assume 15,000 miles per year.\n\nThen:\n\nPassenger cars: 170 * 15,000 / 22 \u2248 1.15 * 10^11 gallons.\n\nLight trucks/SUVs: 114 * 15,000 / 18 \u2248 9.5 * 10^10 gallons.\n\nTotal: 1.15 * 10^11 + 9.5 * 10^10 = 2.1 * 10^11 gallons.\n\nStill only 210 billion gallons, compared to the EIA's 140 billion gallons.\n\nThis suggests that my assumptions are off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of vehicles is lower or fuel economy is higher.\n\nLet me check more recent data.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation, as of 2020, there were approximately 284 million registered vehicles in the U.S.\n\nThe fuel economy standards have been increasing over the years, with the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards targeting higher mpg.\n\nAssuming an average fuel economy of 25 mpg for cars and 20 mpg for light trucks, and an average of 23 mpg for all light-duty vehicles.\n\nIf total gasoline consumption is 140 billion gallons, and total VMT are about 3.4 trillion miles, then the average fuel economy would be 3.4 trillion / 140 billion = 24.29 mpg, which aligns with the CAFE standards.\n\nSo, if total VMT are 3.4 trillion miles and average fuel economy is 24.29 mpg, then total gasoline consumption is 3.4 trillion / 24.29 \u2248 140 billion gallons.\n\nNow, if there are 284 million vehicles, and total VMT are 3.4 trillion, then average miles per vehicle are 3.4 trillion / 284 million \u2248 12,000 miles per year.\n\nEarlier, I used 13,500 miles per year, which might be higher than the actual average.\n\nAssuming 12,000 miles per vehicle, and an average fuel economy of 24 mpg, each vehicle consumes 12,000 / 24 = 500 gallons per year.\n\nThen, total vehicles are 284 million, so total gasoline consumption is 284 million * 500 gallons \u2248 1.42 * 10^11 gallons, which matches the EIA's 140 billion gallons.\n\nGood, that checks out.\n\nNow, if we consider that 60% of these are passenger"
