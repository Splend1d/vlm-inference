                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, is clearly morally wrong. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let's see.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I rolled the ball that me and my friends were playing with.\" Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward. Me and my friends were playing with a ball, and I rolled it. That doesn't sound like anything bad or morally wrong. It's just part of the game, right? Unless there's some context I'm missing, like maybe I rolled it in a way that cheated or something, but the scenario doesn't say that. So, I think this is not wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I ate her delicious finger sandwiches.\" Okay, so someone made these finger sandwiches, and I ate them. Now, the question is, is there anything morally wrong with eating someone's food? Well, it depends. If the sandwiches were offered to me, like at a party or something, and it's okay to eat them, then there's nothing wrong with that. But if I took them without permission, maybe stole them, then that would be wrong. The scenario doesn't specify, so that's a bit unclear. But assuming it's in an ordinary social setting, probably it's fine to eat food that's been provided.\n\nGiven that, I think both scenarios are not clearly morally wrong. So, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" I need to make sure I'm considering that time and place. In 2020 in the US, generally, eating food that's been provided in a social setting isn't wrong, unless it's explicitly not for you. And rolling a ball in a game with friends also seems fine.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
