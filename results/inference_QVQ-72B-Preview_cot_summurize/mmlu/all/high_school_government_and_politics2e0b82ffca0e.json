It's a bit confusing, but I think I have a handle on it.\n\nOption A says that the president signs the version he prefers. But that doesn't sound right. I thought the president doesn't get to choose which version to sign. Instead, Congress has to send him one agreed-upon version.\n\nOption B says the bill goes back to each house's committee and restarts the legislative process. Hmm, that seems possible, but I recall there's a more formal way to resolve differences between the two versions.\n\nOption C says all amendments are invalidated, and the original version of the bill is sent to the president to sign. That can't be correct. If that were the case, then why bother with the whole process of amending and passing different versions? There must be a better way to resolve differences.\n\nOption D says the two legislative bodies form a conference committee. Now, that rings a bell. I think I've heard of a conference committee before. It's like a special committee made up of members from both the House and the Senate who work together to iron out the differences in the bill's versions.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. When both chambers pass different versions of a bill, they need to reconcile their differences to come up with a single version that both can agree on. This seems like the role of a conference committee.\n\nI remember that in Congress, after both the House and the Senate pass their own versions of a bill, they appoint conferees to serve on this committee. These conferees negotiate and try to reach a compromise on the differing provisions of the bill.\n\nOnce the conference committee agrees on a unified text, they produce a conference report, which is then sent back to both the House and the Senate for final approval. If both chambers approve the conference report, it then goes to the president for signature.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct answer. Forming a conference committee is the standard procedure when there are differences between the House and Senate versions of a bill.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any chance that instead of a conference committee, they might just send it back to the committees in each house and start over? Well, technically, they could do that, but that would be inefficient and time-consuming. The conference committee is a more streamlined approach to resolving discrepancies.\n\nAlso, sometimes, if the differences are minor, perhaps they could work out the changes through informal agreements or by one chamber agreeing to accept the other's version. But in cases where there are significant differences, a conference committee is usually the way to go.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that generally, when the Senate and House pass different versions of the same bill, they form a conference committee to reconcile the differences.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
