                    "text": "So I have this question here about social support. It says that when my sister Patricia was feeling depressed, I comforted her and reminisced about happier times. And it asks what type of social support I provided. The options are A. Emotional, B. Instrumental, C. Informational, and D. Friendly.\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to understand what each type of social support means to figure out which one fits my action.\n\nStarting with Emotional support, that sounds like providing comfort and understanding during tough times. So, if Patricia was depressed, comforting her and talking about happier times seems like I'm offering emotional comfort. That might be a possible answer.\n\nNext, Instrumental support. I think this has to do with providing practical help, like assistance with tasks or resources. In this scenario, I didn't do anything practical like helping with chores or giving her money or anything like that. I just offered my presence and we talked. So, probably not Instrumental support.\n\nThen, Informational support. This seems like giving advice or information to help someone make decisions or understand a situation better. While I did reminisce about happier times, I don't think I was giving her information or advice per se. I was more so trying to lift her spirits by recalling positive memories. So, maybe not Informational support.\n\nLastly, Friendly support. This option isn't directly listed in the standard types of social support I've learned about. Usually, social support is categorized into Emotional, Instrumental, Informational, and perhaps Appraisal support. So, perhaps there's a mistake here, or maybe \"Friendly\" is meant to be something else.\n\nWait a minute, maybe \"Friendly\" is a mistranslation or a typo. In some contexts, social support can include things like companionship or belonging, which could be considered forms of emotional support. But since it's not a standard category, I should stick with the options given.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is A. Emotional support. Because comforting someone and reminiscing about happier times is a way to provide emotional comfort and reassurance during a difficult period.\n\nLet me double-check. Emotional support typically involves offering empathy, love, and psychological comfort to help someone cope with stress or hardship. By sharing happy memories, I'm helping Patricia feel connected and supported, which aligns with emotional support.\n\nInstrumental support, on the other hand, is more about providing tangible assistance, like financial help, running errands, or offering services. That's not what happened here.\n\nInformational support involves giving advice, guidance, or information to help someone make decisions or solve problems. Again, not the primary focus of my actions in this scenario.\n\nAnd \"Friendly\" isn't a recognized type of social support, so I should disregard that option.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. Emotional support.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Emotional}} \\]"
