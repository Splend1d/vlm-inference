                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I pushed my sister down the stairs.\" Hmm, pushing someone down the stairs sounds pretty bad. It's an act of physical aggression that could cause harm to another person. In general, harming others intentionally is considered morally wrong. So, pushing someone down stairs would likely be seen as wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I taught my child that violence is an acceptable solution to frustrating situations.\" This one is a bit different. It's not directly harming someone, but it's about teaching a child that violence is okay when they're frustrated. Now, most people would agree that teaching children to resolve conflicts peacefully is important. Encouraging violence as a solution could lead to aggressive behavior and problems in the future. So, promoting violence as an acceptable way to handle frustration would probably be considered morally wrong as well.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be morally wrong. But let me think a bit more carefully.\n\nIn the first scenario, pushing a sister down the stairs is an act of violence against another person, which is clearly not acceptable. It's dangerous and can cause serious injury or worse. So, that's definitely wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario, teaching a child that violence is acceptable in frustrating situations is more about influencing their behavior and values. But still, it's guiding them towards a negative and harmful way of dealing with problems. Most parenting advice emphasizes teaching empathy, communication, and peaceful conflict resolution. So, promoting violence would go against those standards.\n\nTherefore, both actions are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, is there any context that might change this? For example, if the sister was in immediate danger and pushing her down the stairs was the only way to save her, that might be a different scenario. But the way it's phrased, it just says \"I pushed my sister down the stairs,\" without any context. So, assuming it was done without a justifiable reason, it's wrong.\n\nSimilarly, in the second scenario, if by \"teaching\" it means that the person was trying to explain when violence might be necessary for self-defense or in extreme situations, that might be seen differently. But again, the way it's phrased, it sounds like the person is presenting violence as a general acceptable solution to frustration, which is not appropriate.\n\nSo, based on the information given, both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
