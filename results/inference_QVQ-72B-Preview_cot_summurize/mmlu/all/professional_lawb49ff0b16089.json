                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about Bill, who was a single man with some property, and then he got married and died shortly after. There are a few things to consider here, like his will, a prenuptial agreement, and some property transfers. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Bill owned pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant, and a condominium in Miami that he held for investment. In his will, he left the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets were to be split equally between Tommy and Julie.\n\nThen, Bill married Kathy, and they signed a valid prenuptial agreement where Kathy gave up any rights she might have had by marrying Bill. So,\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0cthis means that Kathy shouldn't inherit anything from Bill's estate because she waived her rights through the prenup.\n\nBut, during their honeymoon in Miami, they drove by the condominium, and Kathy said she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy that he signed and delivered a deed to Kathy, making them both owners of the condominium as \"an estate by the entirety.\" He also planned to move in once the tenant left.\n\nUnfortunately, Bill died the next day. Now, we need to figure out how his assets are distributed.\n\nLet's look at the condominium first. Bill had deeded it to himself and Kathy as an \"estate by the entirety.\" In Florida, an estate by the entirety is a type of joint ownership between spouses where each owns the entire property, and upon one spouse's death, it passes automatically to the surviving spouse, bypassing the will.\n\nHowever, there was a prenuptial agreement in place where Kathy waived her rights to Bill's estate. Does this mean that the deed transfer is invalid, or does the prenup override the deed?\n\nI think the prenup was executed before the marriage, and it likely specified the terms of their estate distribution. If the prenup was valid and Kathy waived her rights to inherit from Bill, then despite the deed, perhaps the condominium should still pass according to the will to Julie.\n\nBut, deeds are generally considered binding and can transfer property ownership immediately. So, if Bill deeded the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety, and then died, the condominium would pass to Kathy automatically.\n\nHowever, the prenup might have provisions about not changing the estate plan without mutual consent or something like that. But assuming that wasn't the case, and the prenup only waived Kathy's rights to inherit through the estate, perhaps the deed transfer is still valid.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider that the prenup specifically waived Kathy's rights to inherit from Bill, so even though he deeded the condominium to her, her rights are still limited by the prenup.\n\nLet me think differently. If Bill deeded the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety, and then died, typically, the condominium would pass to Kathy automatically. But since there was a prenup where Kathy waived her rights, maybe this deed transfer is invalid or can be set aside.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the prenup only affects what Kathy inherits through the will, and since the deed transfer is a separate legal act, it stands on its own.\n\nI need to consider Florida law on prenuptial agreements and how they interact with property deeds.\n\nIn Florida, prenuptial agreements are enforceable as long as they are in writing and signed by both parties. They can waive or modify spousal rights to property, including inheritance rights.\n\nSo, if Kathy waived her rights to inherit from Bill through the prenup, does that mean that the deed transfer to her as a tenant by the entirety is invalid?\n\nI think not necessarily. The deed transfer is a separate action from the prenup. Bill could have chosen to deed the property to Kathy despite the prenup.\n\nBut, perhaps the prenup specified that neither party could transfer property without the other's consent, or something like that. But assuming that's not the case, and the prenup only waived inheritance rights, then the deed transfer might still be valid.\n\nNow, considering that, if the condominium is now owned by Kathy as a result of the deed, then it wouldn't be part of Bill's estate to be distributed according to the will.\n\nSo, the condominium would pass to Kathy, and according to the will, the pasture land goes to Tommy, and all other assets are split equally between Tommy and Julie.\n\nBut wait, option A says Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\n\nOption B says, due to the prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium, and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\n\nOption C says Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally intended to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.\n\nOption D says, regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.\n\nOkay, let's look at the concept of a pretermitted spouse. In Florida, a pretermitted spouse is one who was not provided for in the will because they were not married to the testator at the time the will was made. If a person marries after making a will and does not amend it to include the new spouse, the law may provide that the spouse is entitled to a share of the estate.\n\nHowever, in this case, Bill and Kathy were married after the will was made, and there was a prenuptial agreement where Kathy waived her rights to inherit from Bill.\n\nSo, generally, a prenuptial agreement can override the statutory provisions for a pretermitted spouse, provided it's properly executed and the waiver is explicit.\n\nTherefore, if Kathy waived her rights through the prenup, she wouldn't be entitled to anything from Bill's estate, except perhaps what was specifically provided for in the prenup.\n\nBut, as we established earlier, Bill deeded the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety, which likely means that Kathy now owns the condominium upon Bill's death.\n\nSo, the condominium goes to Kathy, the pasture land goes to Tommy per the will, and the remaining assets are split equally between Tommy and Julie.\n\nThis seems to align with option C: Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.\n\nHowever, option A also mentions that Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\n\nBut option A seems to suggest that Kathy gets the condominium despite the prenup, but doesn't mention anything about her being a pretermitted spouse or getting a specific portion of the estate.\n\nOption B suggests that due to the prenup, Tommy gets the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium, and Tommy and Julie split the rest. But this seems contradictory because the condominium was deeded to Kathy, not Julie.\n\nOption D claims that regardless of the prenup, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse and gets 50% of the estate, while Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue.\n\nBut if the prenup is valid and Kathy waived her rights, she shouldn't be considered a pretermitted spouse entitled to a share of the estate.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the closest correct answer: Kathy gets the condominium, and Tommy and Julie split the remaining estate.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm whether the prenup would affect the deed transfer.\n\nIf the prenup only waived Kathy's rights to inherit from Bill, it probably doesn't affect the validity of the deed transfer during Bill's lifetime.\n\nSo, Bill could deed the condominium to Kathy, and upon his death, it passes to her automatically as tenants by the entirety.\n\nTherefore, the condominium is not part of the estate, and the will's provisions for the condominium to go to Julie are superseded by the deed.\n\nHence, the pasture land goes to Tommy, the condominium to Kathy, and the remaining assets are split equally between Tommy and Julie.\n\nThis seems to match option C.\n\nBut option A also mentions Kathy getting the condominium, Tommy getting the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie splitting the rest, which is similar.\n\nHowever, option C specifically mentions that because Bill intended to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie split the remaining estate.\n\nBut in reality, the will left the condominium to Julie, but since it was deeded to Kathy, it's no longer part of the estate. So, the remaining assets are just the other assets not specifically devised, which are to be split equally between Tommy and Julie.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the best answer.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it assumes Kathy is a pretermitted spouse entitled to a share of the estate, which is not the case due to the prenup.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests Julie gets the condominium, but it was deeded to Kathy.\n\nOption A is similar to C but doesn't mention the prenup's role, whereas C does.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
