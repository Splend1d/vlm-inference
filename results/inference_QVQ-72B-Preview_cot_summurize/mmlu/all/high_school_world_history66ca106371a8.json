                    "text": "So I'm reading this poem about Sharpeville, which is about an incident in South Africa in 1960 where police fired into a crowd of black South Africans who were protesting against having to carry identity papers. Seventy people died, and it sounds really tragic. The poet, Dennis Brutus, wrote this in 1973, and he's reflecting on that event and what it represents.\n\nThe question is asking about the line \"what the world whispers apartheid declares with snarling guns the blood the rich lust after South Africa spills dust.\" I need to figure out what the poet means by \"what the world whispers.\" There are four options:\n\nA. The world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid.\n\nB. The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.\n\nC. The world condemns South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n\nD. The world economy promotes South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the poem. It's about Sharpeville, which was a significant event in the anti-apartheid movement. Apartheid was the system of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa. The protest in Sharpeville was against the pass laws, which required black South Africans to carry identity documents at all times, which was a tool to control their movement and limit their freedom.\n\nThe incident at Sharpeville, where police opened fire on unarmed protesters, became a symbol of the brutality of the apartheid regime. The poet refers to it as \"bullet-in-the-back day\" and emphasizes the defenselessness of the protesters.\n\nNow, looking at the line in question: \"what the world whispers apartheid declares with snarling guns the blood the rich lust after South Africa spills dust.\" It seems like the poet is drawing a connection between what the world is saying quietly or secretly about apartheid and how apartheid is expressed openly through violence and bloodshed.\n\nThe phrase \"what the world whispers\" suggests that there are things being said or thought about apartheid that aren't being expressed openly, perhaps out of fear or because they're uncomfortable truths.\n\nOption A suggests that the world is afraid of South Africa and doesn't oppose apartheid. But does the poem suggest fear? It seems more like indifference or complicity rather than fear.\n\nOption B says that the world engages in subtler forms of discrimination. This could make sense because apartheid was an extreme form of discrimination, and the poet might be suggesting that while the world condemns apartheid, it still practices discrimination in less obvious ways.\n\nOption C is that the world condemns South Africa's discrimination. That seems straightforward, but the poem seems to suggest something deeper than just condemnation.\n\nOption D says that the world economy promotes South Africa's discrimination. This could be referring to how international trade and economic relations might have supported the apartheid regime.\n\nLooking back at the poem, it emphasizes that Sharpeville epitomizes oppression and reveals the nature of society more clearly than anything else. It also says that nowhere is racial dominance more clearly defined, and nowhere is the will to oppress more clearly demonstrated. So, the poet is highlighting that Sharpeville is not just an isolated incident but a reflection of deeper societal issues.\n\nThe line \"what the world whispers apartheid declares with snarling guns the blood the rich lust after South Africa spills dust\" seems to suggest that the world might be aware of or complicit in the oppression, but doesn't openly acknowledge it. The \"whispers\" could be the unspoken acknowledgment of similar issues in other places or the acceptance of apartheid for economic gains.\n\nGiven that, option B might be the closest, suggesting that the world engages in subtler forms of discrimination. However, option D also seems relevant because the world economy could be seen as supporting apartheid through trade and investment.\n\nBut considering the poetic language, \"whispers\" might imply secrecy or quiet acknowledgment rather than active promotion. So, perhaps the poet is suggesting that the world knows about these issues but doesn't speak up openly, instead only whispering about them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"what the world whispers\" refers to the condemnation or criticism that the world privately holds about apartheid, which apartheid regime ignores or responds to with violence, as symbolized by \"snarling guns.\"\n\nThat would align more with option C, that the world condemns South Africa's discrimination, and apartheid responds with violence.\n\nHowever, the poem seems to criticize the world's response, suggesting that mere whispers are not enough, and that apartheid is declared through violent means. So, perhaps the poet is criticizing the world for not doing more than just whispering.\n\nBut the direct meaning seems to be that apartheid is declared with violence, contrasting with the world's whispers.\n\nI think the key is understanding what \"what the world whispers\" refers to. It's likely that it's something that the world is saying quietly about apartheid, and apartheid is responding to those whispers with violence.\n\nGiven that, option C, that the world condemns South Africa's discrimination, seems plausible. The whispers would be the condemnations, and apartheid declares its stance with guns.\n\nBut I'm still considering option B, that the world engages in subtler forms of discrimination. However, that might not directly connect to the idea of whispers about apartheid.\n\nOption A, that the world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid, doesn't seem to align well with the notion of whispers; fear might lead to silence, but whispers suggest some acknowledgement.\n\nOption D, that the world economy promotes South Africa's discrimination, could be seen as a form of complicity, but again, it's not directly about whispers.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C, that the world condemns South Africa's discrimination, and the whispers represent that condemnation, which apartheid ignores or responds to with violence.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
