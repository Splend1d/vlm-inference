                    "text": "So I have this question here about what makes relationships last, according to someone named Sternberg. I'm not super familiar with Sternberg's theories, but I think he's a psychologist who studied love and relationships. The options given are intimacy, commitment, decision, and passion. I need to pick which one of these is the most important for making a relationship last.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means in the context of relationships.\n\nStarting with intimacy: I think intimacy refers to the emotional closeness and connection between two people. It's about sharing feelings, supporting each other, and having a deep understanding of one another. In relationships, intimacy can make you feel safe and secure with your partner.\n\nNext, commitment seems straightforward. It's about being dedicated to the relationship and to your partner. Commitment involves making a promise to stay together through thick and thin, and actively working to maintain the relationship.\n\nThen there's decision. I'm not sure how this fits into relationships. Maybe it's about making choices that benefit the relationship rather than just yourself. Like prioritizing the relationship in decisions you make.\n\nLastly, there's passion. Passion is often associated with the romantic and physical aspects of a relationship. It's the spark, the excitement, the desire that people feel for their partners.\n\nNow, the question is asking, according to Sternberg, what makes a relationship last. I recall that Sternberg proposed the Triangular Theory of Love, which includes three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. Wait, so in his theory, love is made up of these three things, and different types of love have different combinations of them.\n\nLet me think about this. If love consists of intimacy, passion, and commitment, then perhaps all three are necessary for a relationship to last. But the question is asking specifically what makes it last, so maybe one of these is more crucial than the others.\n\nLooking back at the options, intimacy, commitment, and passion are all part of Sternberg's triangle. Decision seems a bit different; it might be related to commitment, as commitment involves deciding to stay in the relationship.\n\nWait, maybe decision is about the choice to continue the relationship, which is a part of commitment. So perhaps commitment encompasses the decision to stay.\n\nI think I need to clarify what each term means in Sternberg's theory.\n\nIntimacy: this is about the emotional connection, feeling close to your partner, and being able to share your thoughts and feelings openly.\n\nPassion: this is about the romantic and physical attraction, the excitement and desire in the relationship.\n\nCommitment: this is about the decision to maintain the relationship, the dedication to work through problems, and the perseverance over time.\n\nDecision: this might be related to the choice aspect of commitment, where you actively decide to stay in the relationship despite challenges.\n\nGiven this, it seems that commitment involves decision-making. So decision might be a part of commitment, rather than a separate component.\n\nMaybe the options are not all on the same level; perhaps some are subcomponents of others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say that commitment is the key factor, and decision is a part of commitment.\n\nIf that's the case, then the answer would be commitment, since it encompasses the decision to stay in the relationship.\n\nBut let's consider if any of the other options could be the primary factor.\n\nIntimacy is important for emotional satisfaction in a relationship, but without commitment, the relationship might not endure long-term challenges.\n\nPassion is great for the initial stages of a relationship, but it's often not enough to sustain a long-term partnership, especially when difficulties arise.\n\nDecision seems too narrow on its own, as it's more about the act of choosing rather than the ongoing dynamic of the relationship.\n\nTherefore, commitment seems to be the most comprehensive factor that ensures a relationship lasts over time.\n\nMoreover, in Sternberg's theory, commitment is seen as the component that helps relationships endure over the long haul, even when passion may wane or intimacy is tested.\n\nSo, according to Sternberg, commitment is what makes relationships last.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. commitment}} \\]"
