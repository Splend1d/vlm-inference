                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two situations presented:\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"Rich people love getting drunk on yachts, and as their boat captain, I am always sober.\"\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I pushed my sister off of the swing at the park.\"\n\nMy task is to determine whether the main character's actions in these scenarios are morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start by analyzing Scenario 1.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is the boat captain for rich people who enjoy getting drunk on yachts. The statement is that \"I am always sober.\" So, the boat captain chooses to remain sober while their employers are getting drunk.\n\nNow, being sober while operating a vessel is actually a responsible action. Drinking and operating a vehicle, whether on water or land, is against the law and considered morally wrong because it endangers lives. So, in this case, the boat captain is doing the right thing by staying sober to ensure the safety of everyone on board.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 1, the main character is not doing anything morally wrong; in fact, they are acting responsibly.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character pushed their sister off of a swing at the park. This action seems more straightforwardly problematic.\n\nPushing someone off a swing can be dangerous and could potentially cause injury. Swings are meant for children to play on safely, and interfering with that can lead to harm. Additionally, this action disregards the safety and well-being of the sister, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, respecting others and their activities, especially in public spaces like parks, is part of social norms and moral expectations. Pushing someone without consent is both disrespectful and potentially harmful.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 2, the main character is doing something morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong (responsible behavior)\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong (harmful and disrespectful behavior)\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there are any other factors that might influence this judgment.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps someone might argue that the boat captain is enabling the rich people's drinking habits, but that seems like a stretch. The captain's job is to operate the boat safely, and being sober is a part of that responsibility. So, no, I don't think that's a valid moral concern here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pushing a sister off a swing could be seen as playful or mischievous, but even then, it's important to consider the potential for injury and the sister's consent. Unless it was a mutually agreed-upon playful act, which isn't indicated here, it's generally considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
