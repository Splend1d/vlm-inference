The options are cognitive rationality, conscious rationality, bounded rationality, and restricted rationality. I need to pick the one that best describes decisions that are limited by our ability to process information.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each term means. Starting with cognitive rationality, I think this refers to the way people make decisions based on their cognitive abilities and the information they have. It might involve using mental shortcuts or heuristics to make choices, but I'm not sure if that's the same as being limited by information processing capacity.\n\nConscious rationality sounds like decisions made with full awareness and rational thought. But again, I don't think this directly relates to limitations in information processing capacity. Maybe it's more about making decisions based on logical thinking rather than being constrained by the amount of information one can handle.\n\nBounded rationality rings a bell. I think I've heard of this term before. It was proposed by Herbert Simon, a economist and political scientist, who argued that people's rationality is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make decisions. So, this seems pretty close to the description in the question.\n\nRestricted rationality sounds similar to bounded rationality but might not be a standard term in decision-making theory. It could be another way of saying that rationality is limited, but I'm not sure if it's the correct terminology.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards bounded rationality as the answer. It seems to fit the description of decisions being limited by human capacity to absorb and analyze information.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider an example. Suppose I'm trying to choose the best smartphone to buy. There are dozens of models with different features, prices, and user reviews. My ability to compare all of them might be limited by how much information I can process at once. According to bounded rationality, I might simplify my decision by setting certain criteria, like budget or camera quality, and then choosing the best option within those constraints rather than considering every possible detail.\n\nThis makes sense because in reality, we can't possibly weigh every single factor for every decision we make; it's just not feasible. So, bounded rationality acknowledges that and suggests that we make satisfactory decisions rather than optimal ones due to these limitations.\n\nOn the other hand, cognitive rationality might refer more to the thought processes and mental strategies we use to make decisions, but it doesn't necessarily emphasize the limitations imposed by information processing capacity in the same way.\n\nConscious rationality seems more about being aware and deliberate in decision-making, but again, it doesn't directly address the constraints of information processing.\n\nRestricted rationality could be a way of saying that rationality is limited, but it's not a commonly used term in decision-making theory, at least not to my knowledge.\n\nTherefore, I think the most accurate answer is bounded rationality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Bounded rationality}} \\]"
