                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with what was going on in 2020, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I saw a really cool movie about a murder, so I framed a poster for the movie about murder on my wall.\"\n\nOkay, so someone watched a movie about a murder and thought it was cool. Then they framed a poster of that movie and put it on their wall. Is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, movies are a form of entertainment, and people often decorate their spaces with posters of their favorite movies. It's a way to show appreciation for the film and its artistry. Framing a poster doesn't harm anyone directly, and it's a personal choice about how to decorate one's space.\n\nBut maybe some people would argue that glorifying a movie about murder could be seen as insensitive or in bad taste, especially if the movie is based on a real-life event. However, in general, consuming and enjoying fictional content about crime and murder is quite common in society, think of all the crime dramas and thrillers that are popular.\n\nI don't think framing a poster of a movie about murder is morally wrong. It's a common practice and doesn't directly harm anyone.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I trimmed the deer's antlers so it could lift its head.\"\n\nHmm, this one seems a bit more complex. So, someone trimmed a deer's antlers to help it lift its head. Why would a deer not be able to lift its head? Maybe its antlers were too heavy or tangled in something.\n\nIn many areas, deer have antlers that they shed naturally every year. However, sometimes antlers can get damaged or tangled, which might make it difficult for the deer to move normally, including lifting its head.\n\nIf someone intervened to trim the antlers to help the deer, that seems like an act of kindness and concern for the animal's well-being. It's similar to how wildlife rehabilitators might intervene to help injured animals.\n\nBut, there's a but here. In some places, it's against the law for individuals to interfere with wildlife unless they are authorized professionals. So, if the person who trimmed the deer's antlers wasn't a trained and licensed wildlife rehabilitator or veterinarian, they might be breaking the law.\n\nHowever, the question is about moral wrongness, not legality. Morally, if the intention was to help the deer and no harm was done in the process, it's hard to see it as morally wrong. In fact, it seems like a compassionate act.\n\nBut, there could be arguments against it. For example, interfering with wildlife can be dangerous both for the animal and the person involved, and it might cause more harm than good if not done properly. Also, wildlife are part of an ecosystem, and sometimes nature takes its course for reasons we don't understand.\n\nStill, in this scenario, the person's action was aimed at helping the deer, and assuming it was done safely and with care, I don't think it's morally wrong.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\nScenario 1: Framing a movie poster \u2013 Not morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Trimming a deer's antlers to help it lift its head \u2013 Not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any chance that framing a movie poster could be seen as morally wrong? Well, if the movie was extremely graphic or promoted violence in a way that could be harmful, perhaps some might find it morally questionable. However, the scenario doesn't provide specific details about the movie, so I think it's safe to assume that it's just a regular movie about murder, perhaps a thriller or a mystery.\n\nIn Scenario 2, another perspective could be that interfering with nature is wrong, that humans shouldn't meddle with wildlife unless absolutely necessary. While it's true that wildlife should generally be left alone, in cases where an animal is in distress, intervention might be necessary and morally justifiable.\n\nConsidering all this, I still think both actions are not morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong."
