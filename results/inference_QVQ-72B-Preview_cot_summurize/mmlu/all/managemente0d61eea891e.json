In the same industry\n\nC. In the same country\n\nD. Remotely\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to think about what defines a virtual team based on their location.\n\nFirst off, I know that a virtual team is a group of people who work together but are not necessarily in the same physical place. They might be spread out over different locations, right? So, they probably don't work in the same building. That makes option A less likely.\n\nOption B says \"in the same industry.\" Well, that might be true for some teams, but I don't think that's necessarily a characteristic based on location. Industries can span multiple locations, countries, and even continents. So, this seems more related to the type of work rather than where the team members are located.\n\nOption C is \"in the same country.\" Again, for a virtual team, members can be from anywhere, including different countries. So, being in the same country might not always be the case. Maybe sometimes, but not necessarily always.\n\nOption D says \"remotely.\" Now, this seems intriguing. Remote work is when individuals work from different places, often from home or from various locations, and collaborate using technology. That sounds a lot like what a virtual team would do.\n\nLet me double-check this. If a team is virtual, it means they're not co-located, right? They're dispersed geographically. So, they could be in different buildings, different cities, or different countries. Therefore, working remotely seems to be a key characteristic of a virtual team.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a difference between virtual teams and remote teams. But I think they're often used interchangeably. Let me see if I can find some clarity here.\n\nI recall that a virtual team is a group of people who work together using technology to communicate across distances, time zones, and organizational boundaries. So, their location can vary widely.\n\nRemote work, on the other hand, typically refers to working from a distance, often from home, and not necessarily in an office setting.\n\nGiven that, it seems like virtual teams can include remote workers, but also people working from different offices or different countries. So, remote work is a part of virtual teamwork, but virtual teamwork might encompass more than just remote work.\n\nBut in terms of location, the defining feature seems to be that team members are not collocated\u2014they're working from different places.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says \"remotely.\" While remote work is a aspect of virtual teams, maybe it doesn't capture the full picture. For example, if a team is composed of people working from different offices in different countries, they're working remotely, but also internationally.\n\nHowever, among the given options, \"remotely\" seems to be the closest description of where a virtual team is located. They are not in the same building, industry, or necessarily the same country, but they are working from different locations\u2014remotely.\n\nI think the answer is D. Remotely.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
