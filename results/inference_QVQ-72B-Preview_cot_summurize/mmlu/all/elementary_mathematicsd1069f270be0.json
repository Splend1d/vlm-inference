                    "text": "Alright, I've got this problem here: write 60 over 72 in its simplest form. And there are some options to choose from. Let me see, option A is 4 over 6, B is 10 over 12, C is 15 over 17, and D is 5 over 6. Hmm, I need to simplify 60/72 and see which of these it matches.\n\nFirst, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60 and 72. I think the GCD is the largest number that divides both 60 and 72 without leaving a remainder. Let me recall how to find the GCD.\n\nI know that one way to find the GCD is to list the factors of each number and then find the highest common factor. So, let's list the factors of 60 and 72.\n\nFactors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.\n\nFactors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.\n\nLooking at both lists, the common factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. So, the greatest common divisor is 12.\n\nNow, to simplify the fraction 60/72, I can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD, which is 12.\n\nSo, 60 \u00f7 12 = 5, and 72 \u00f7 12 = 6. Therefore, 60/72 simplifies to 5/6.\n\nLet me just double-check if 5/6 is in its simplest form. The GCD of 5 and 6 is 1, since 5 is a prime number and doesn't divide into 6. So, yes, 5/6 is the simplest form.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 4 over 6\n\nB. 10 over 12\n\nC. 15 over 17\n\nD. 5 over 6\n\nIt seems like option D is 5 over 6, which matches what I just found.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another way to simplify it or if maybe one of the other options could also work.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can reduce the fraction in steps. For example, I could divide both numerator and denominator by a smaller common factor, like 4 or 6, and see if I get the same result.\n\nLet's try dividing by 4:\n\n60 \u00f7 4 = 15, and 72 \u00f7 4 = 18. So, 60/72 simplifies to 15/18.\n\nBut 15/18 can be simplified further because 15 and 18 have a common factor of 3.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 3: 15 \u00f7 3 = 5, and 18 \u00f7 3 = 6. So, again, we end up with 5/6.\n\nThis confirms that 5/6 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, if I divide by 6:\n\n60 \u00f7 6 = 10, and 72 \u00f7 6 = 12. So, 60/72 simplifies to 10/12.\n\nBut 10/12 can also be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 10 \u00f7 2 = 5, and 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, again getting 5/6.\n\nSo, no matter which way I simplify it, I end up with 5/6.\n\nLet me also check if 5/6 is equal to any of the other options.\n\nOption A is 4/6. Is 5/6 equal to 4/6? Well, 4/6 is 2/3 when simplified, and that's not equal to 5/6.\n\nOption B is 10/12. Let's see, 10/12 is 5/6 when simplified, so that's actually the same as 5/6.\n\nWait a second, so option B is also 5/6?\n\nLet me check:\n\n10 \u00f7 2 = 5, and 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, so 10/12 simplifies to 5/6.\n\nSimilarly, option D is directly 5/6.\n\nSo, both options B and D are 5/6.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, 60/72 simplifies to 5/6, so both B and D seem to be correct.\n\nHowever, in the original problem, it's asking to write 60 over 72 in simplest form, and among the options, both B and D are 5/6.\n\nBut wait, the problem might be expecting a single answer, so perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not all options are simplified forms of 60/72, and only one of them is correct.\n\nLet me check the other options to see if any of them equal 5/6.\n\nOption C is 15 over 17. Is 15/17 equal to 5/6?\n\nTo check, I can cross-multiply: 5 * 17 = 85, and 6 * 15 = 90. Since 85 \u2260 90, 15/17 \u2260 5/6.\n\nSimilarly, option A is 4/6, which is 2/3, and that's not equal to 5/6.\n\nSo, only options B and D are 5/6.\n\nBut in the context of simplifying 60/72, only one of them should be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed to have multiple choices that lead to the same answer to test understanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying 60/72.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can reduce the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by the GCD, which is 12, to get 5/6 directly.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might simplify in steps, like first dividing by 4 to get 15/18, and then dividing by 3 to get 5/6, which is also correct.\n\nBut in any case, the simplest form is 5/6.\n\nLooking back at the options, both B and D are 5/6, but perhaps the problem expects only one correct answer, so maybe there's a typo or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether we can recognize that 5/6 is the simplest form and not get distracted by other options that look similar but are actually different.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is D. 5 over 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
