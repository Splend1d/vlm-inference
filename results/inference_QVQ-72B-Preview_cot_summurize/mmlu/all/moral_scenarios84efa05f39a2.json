                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character denied being aware of the person who has been babysitting their children for years. So, someone is saying they didn't know about the babysitter, but it's someone who has been taking care of their kids for a long time. That seems odd. Why would someone deny knowing their babysitter?\n\nWell, maybe there are different reasons for denying it. Perhaps they wanted to avoid paying the babysitter, or maybe they were trying to hide something from their spouse or others. But regardless of the reason, denying knowledge of someone who has been a significant part of your family's life for years seems unethical.\n\nBabysitters are entrusted with the care and safety of children, and acknowledging their role is important for the well-being of the family. Denying awareness could imply that the babysitter's contributions are being deliberately ignored or minimized, which doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of honesty and integrity. Honesty is a key moral value, and denying something that's true goes against that principle. So, if the main character knows the babysitter but says they don't, that's a lie, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nMoreover, depending on the context, this denial could have negative consequences. For example, if the babysitter is seeking reference or needs confirmation of their employment, denying awareness could harm their professional reputation or financial stability. That would be morally wrong as well, because it shows a lack of responsibility and consideration for someone who has been taking care of your children.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, it seems pretty clear that denying awareness of the babysitter is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: the main character tossed a ball at the catcher's mitt. Okay, this seems like a harmless action, probably related to playing baseball or softball. Tossing a ball to a catcher's mitt is a common practice in these sports.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider if there's any context that might make this action morally wrong. For example, was the ball tossed in an aggressive manner, intending to harm someone? Or was it just a normal part of the game?\n\nAssuming it's a standard practice within a game, tossing the ball to the catcher's mitt is perfectly acceptable and not morally wrong. It's part of the sport, and there's no inherent moral issue with it.\n\nHowever, if the ball was tossed with the intent to harm someone, that would be a different story. But since the scenario doesn't provide any additional context, I'll assume it's just a regular action during a game.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 2, tossing a ball at the catcher's mitt is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, putting this together, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is morally wrong because denying awareness of a long-term babysitter is dishonest and could have negative consequences, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong because tossing a ball at the catcher's mitt is a normal part of playing a sport.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong...\" and then lists the options as A, B, C, D. But option B seems to be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which matches my conclusion.\n\nHowever, I should double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. Maybe there's something I'm not considering in either scenario.\n\nLet me think again about Scenario 1. Is there any way that denying awareness of the babysitter could be morally acceptable? Well, perhaps if there were safety concerns or if the babysitter had behaved inappropriately, but the scenario doesn't provide any such context. It just says the babysitter has been taking care of the children for years, and the main character denied being aware of them.\n\nIn most circumstances, denying knowledge of someone who has been a significant part of your family's life seems unethical. It suggests a lack of honesty and could potentially cause harm to the babysitter's professional reputation or financial situation.\n\nMoving back to Scenario 2, unless there's some unusual context, tossing a ball at the catcher's mitt during a game is a standard action and doesn't carry any moral implications.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
