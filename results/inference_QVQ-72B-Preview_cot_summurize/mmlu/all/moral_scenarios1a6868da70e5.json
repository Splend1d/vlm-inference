                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I put on my roller skates in the skating rink.\" So, someone is putting on their roller skates at a place designed for roller skating. Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward. Roller skating rinks are places where people go to skate, right? It's like going to a park to play or going to a beach to swim. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. Maybe there are rules about when or how to skate, but in general, it's a normal activity in that setting.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I attacked the home invader.\" This one is a bit more serious. A home invader is someone who illegally enters someone's home, probably with bad intentions. In many places, including the US, people have the right to defend themselves and their property, especially in their own home. Attacking a home invader could be seen as self-defense or defending one's family and possessions.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the context. Is the person using reasonable force, or is this excessive? In some cases, using force against an intruder is justified, but if the response is disproportionate to the threat, it could be considered wrong. For example, if the intruder is unarmed and not posing an immediate danger, attacking them might not be justified.\n\nHowever, generally, in the US, there is a \"castle doctrine\" that allows homeowners to use force, including lethal force, to defend themselves against intruders who pose a threat. So, if someone is breaking into your home and you feel threatened, attacking them could be seen as a justifiable action.\n\nBut, there are also considerations about what \"attacking\" entails. Does it mean physically assaulting the intruder, or could it involve restraining them or using non-lethal force? The term \"attacked\" can cover a range of actions, some of which might be more or less morally acceptable.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose someone breaks into your house, and you're scared for your life or the lives of your family. In that case, using force to stop the intruder seems reasonable. On the other hand, if the intruder is a confused person who entered by mistake and poses no real threat, attacking them might not be justified.\n\nGiven that, I think the morality of the action depends heavily on the specific circumstances. But since the question is phrased generally without specific details, I need to consider what would be ordinary or typical in such a situation.\n\nIn most states, a person has the right to defend themselves and their home using reasonable force. If the intruder is imminently threatening, attacking them could be seen as a necessary measure. Therefore, in that context, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, there might be scenarios where attacking a home invader could be seen as wrong, such as if the force used was excessive or if the intruder was not posing a significant threat.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, putting on roller skates in a skating rink seems clearly not wrong, while attacking a home invader could be justifiable depending on the circumstances.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong, depending on the context, but generally accepted as self-defense.\n\nTherefore, the choice that fits this is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Considering that, and given that self-defense is widely accepted, I believe attacking a home invader in self-defense is not considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
