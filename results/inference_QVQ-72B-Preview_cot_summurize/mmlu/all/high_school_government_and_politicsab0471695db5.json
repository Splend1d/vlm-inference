Resigns to take a position as a consultant to lobbying groups\n\nB. Cedes control of his or her department to lifelong bureaucrats within the department\n\nC. Places his or her department's priorities above the president's\n\nD. Accepts bribes or expensive favors from businesses regulated by his or her department\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"gone native\" means in this scenario. Generally, the phrase \"gone native\" suggests that someone has adopted the customs or perspectives of a group they were not originally part of, often to the point of identifying more with that group than their original one.\n\nIn the context of a cabinet member, this would likely mean that the individual has started to prioritize the interests of their specific department or the groups they interact with in that role over the broader agenda of the president who appointed them.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Resigns to take a position as a consultant to lobbying groups\n\nThis seems more like a departure from the cabinet position for personal or professional reasons, perhaps to leverage their experience in the private sector. It doesn't necessarily imply that they've adopted the perspective of their department over the president's priorities.\n\nB. Cedes control of his or her department to lifelong bureaucrats within the department\n\nThis suggests that the cabinet member is not actively managing or leading the department, allowing career officials to make decisions. While this could be seen as a failure to impose the president's agenda, it's more about a lack of leadership rather than adopting the department's priorities.\n\nC. Places his or her department's priorities above the president's\n\nThis option directly suggests that the cabinet member is putting the interests or goals of their department ahead of the president's overall plan. This aligns closely with the idea of \"going native,\" as they're prioritizing the department's perspective over the president's agenda.\n\nD. Accepts bribes or expensive favors from businesses regulated by his or her department\n\nThis is clearly unethical and illegal behavior, involving personal gain through corrupt practices. While it involves misuse of power, it doesn't directly relate to adopting the department's perspective over the president's.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to be the most fitting definition of \"gone native\" in this context. It indicates that the cabinet member has shifted their loyalty or focus towards the department's interests at the expense of the president's priorities, which resonates with the idea of adopting the viewpoints of one's new environment.\n\nI think the answer is C. Places his or her department's priorities above the president's.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
