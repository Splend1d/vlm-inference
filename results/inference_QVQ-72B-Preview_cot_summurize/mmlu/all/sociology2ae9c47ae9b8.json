                    "text": "So I have this question about the term \"nuclear family.\" It's asking what it means, and there are four options to choose from. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says it's \"a group of people sharing living accommodation and meals.\" Hmm, that sounds more like a household or a roommates situation. Not sure if that's the same as a nuclear family.\n\nOption B is \"a network of relatives extended within or between generations.\" That seems more like an extended family, where you have aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, and so on. But I think a nuclear family is smaller than that.\n\nOption C says \"the new family created when an adult leaves home and gets married.\" That might be related to starting a new family, but I'm not sure if that's the exact definition of a nuclear family.\n\nOption D is \"a two generation unit of parents and their children.\" This seems familiar. I think a nuclear family typically consists of parents and their children, without including other relatives like grandparents or aunts and uncles.\n\nLet me think about this. In sociology, a nuclear family is usually defined as a family unit composed of two parents and their children. This is in contrast to an extended family, which includes other relatives beyond just the parents and children, like grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins living together or in close proximity.\n\nSo, based on that, option D seems to align with this definition. It's specifically mentioning a two-generation unit: parents and their children.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption A: A group of people sharing living accommodation and meals. This could include roommates or any group of people living together and eating together, which isn't necessarily a family unit based on parental relationships.\n\nOption B: A network of relatives extended within or between generations. This sounds more like an extended family, which includes multiple generations and branches of the family tree, not just the immediate parents and children.\n\nOption C: The new family created when an adult leaves home and gets married. This might refer to the concept of starting a new family unit, but it's not a precise definition of a nuclear family. It's more about the process of forming a new family rather than describing what a nuclear family is.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe that option D is the correct answer. A nuclear family is a two-generation unit consisting of parents and their children.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that in many social science texts, the nuclear family is often contrasted with the extended family. The nuclear family is seen as a basic unit, while the extended family includes a larger group of related individuals.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option D accurately defines the nuclear family.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
