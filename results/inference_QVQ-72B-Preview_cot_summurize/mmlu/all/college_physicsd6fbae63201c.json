                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a Michelson interferometer with a gas cell. So, there's a gas cell that's 10 cm long, and it's placed in one arm of the interferometer. The light source is a laser with a wavelength of 632.2 nm, and when the gas cell is evacuated, 100 fringes are counted. I need to find the index of refraction of the original gas. The options are A. 1.00063, B. 1.00032, C. 1.00016, and D. 0.99968.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how interferometers work, especially the Michelson interferometer. When you have a gas cell in one arm, and you evacuate it, the index of refraction changes from the original value to 1 (since air has an index very close to 1, and vacuum is exactly 1). This change in index affects the optical path length of that arm, which in turn causes the interference pattern to shift, resulting in fringes moving.\n\nSo, the number of fringes that move when the gas cell is evacuated can be related to the change in the optical path length. The formula for the optical path length is:\n\nOptical path length = n * L\n\nWhere n is the index of refraction and L is the physical path length.\n\nWhen the gas cell is filled with gas, the optical path length is n * L. When it's evacuated, it becomes 1 * L (since the index of refraction of vacuum is 1). The difference in optical path length is then (n - 1) * L.\n\nEach fringe corresponds to a change in optical path length of one wavelength, right? Because the interference pattern is sensitive to path differences in whole wavelengths.\n\nSo, if 100 fringes are counted, that means the optical path length changed by 100 wavelengths.\n\nTherefore, the change in optical path length is equal to 100 times the wavelength of the light.\n\nMathematically:\n\n(n - 1) * L = 100 * \u03bb\n\nWhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the light in vacuum.\n\nGiven that, I can solve for n:\n\nn = (100 * \u03bb) / L + 1\n\nI have L = 10 cm = 0.1 m (since it's easier to work in meters)\n\nAnd \u03bb = 632.2 nm = 632.2 * 10^-9 m\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nn = (100 * 632.2 * 10^-9) / 0.1 + 1\n\nFirst, calculate 100 * 632.2 * 10^-9:\n\n100 * 632.2 = 63220\n\n63220 * 10^-9 = 63.22 * 10^-6 m\n\nThen, divide by 0.1 m:\n\n(63.22 * 10^-6) / 0.1 = 63.22 * 10^-5\n\nSo, n = 63.22 * 10^-5 + 1\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. 63.22 * 10^-5 is 0.006322.\n\nSo, n = 0.006322 + 1 = 1.006322, which rounds to 1.0063.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 1.00063, which is similar but has an extra decimal place.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nGiven:\n\nL = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\n\u03bb = 632.2 nm = 632.2 * 10^-9 m\n\nChange in optical path length = (n - 1) * L = 100 * \u03bb\n\nSo,\n\n(n - 1) * 0.1 = 100 * 632.2 * 10^-9\n\nn - 1 = (100 * 632.2 * 10^-9) / 0.1\n\nCalculate 100 * 632.2 = 63220\n\n63220 * 10^-9 = 63.22 * 10^-6 m\n\nDivide by 0.1:\n\n63.22 * 10^-6 / 0.1 = 63.22 * 10^-5\n\nWait, no:\n\n63.22 * 10^-6 / 0.1 = 63.22 * 10^-6 / (1 * 10^-1) = 63.22 * 10^-5\n\nWhich is 0.006322\n\nSo, n - 1 = 0.006322\n\nTherefore, n = 1.006322\n\nBut this isn't matching any of the options directly. Maybe I need to consider that the fringe count corresponds to half the wavelength change, or perhaps there's a factor of 2 missing somewhere.\n\nLet me think again. In a Michelson interferometer, when you have a change in one arm, the fringe shift is given by the change in optical path length divided by the wavelength. But I need to consider whether the interferometer is set up in reflection or transmission.\n\nAssuming it's in transmission (though Michelson interferometers are often used in reflection), but for simplicity, let's proceed with the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fringe shift corresponds to the change in optical path length being equal to the number of fringes times half the wavelength, since each fringe corresponds to a phase change of \u03c0.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the relationship between fringe shift and optical path length change.\n\nUpon checking, in a Michelson interferometer, each fringe shift corresponds to a change in optical path difference of one wavelength. So my initial approach seems correct.\n\nBut my calculation gives n = 1.0063, which isn't matching any of the options directly. Maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion.\n\nLet's check the units again:\n\nL = 10 cm = 0.1 m\n\n\u03bb = 632.2 nm = 632.2 * 10^-9 m\n\n(n - 1) * 0.1 m = 100 * 632.2 * 10^-9 m\n\nSo,\n\nn - 1 = (100 * 632.2 * 10^-9) / 0.1\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n100 * 632.2 = 63220\n\n63220 * 10^-9 = 63.22 * 10^-6 m\n\nDivide by 0.1:\n\n63.22 * 10^-6 / 0.1 = 63.22 * 10^-5 = 0.006322\n\nSo, n = 1 + 0.006322 = 1.006322\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. 1.00063\n\nB. 1.00032\n\nC. 1.00016\n\nD. 0.99968\n\nNone of these are 1.0063. Maybe I need to consider that the fringe count is for one arm, but the interferometer has two arms, and the reference arm might also be changing.\n\nWait, in a Michelson interferometer, when you have a gas cell in one arm, and you evacuate it, the optical path length in that arm changes by (n - 1) * L. The interference occurs between the light from that arm and the reference arm. So, the total optical path difference is the difference between the two arms.\n\nIf only one arm changes, the optical path difference changes by (n - 1) * L, assuming the reference arm remains constant.\n\nSo, the fringe shift should correspond to this change in optical path difference, which is (n - 1) * L.\n\nEach fringe corresponds to a change in optical path difference of one wavelength, so:\n\n(n - 1) * L = 100 * \u03bb\n\nTherefore:\n\nn - 1 = 100 * \u03bb / L\n\nPlugging in \u03bb = 632.2 nm and L = 10 cm:\n\nn - 1 = (100 * 632.2 * 10^-9 m) / 0.1 m = 63.22 * 10^-6 m\n\nn = 1 + 63.22 * 10^-6 = 1.00006322\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n100 * 632.2 nm = 100 * 632.2 * 10^-9 m = 63220 * 10^-9 m = 63.22 * 10^-6 m\n\nDivide by L = 0.1 m:\n\n63.22 * 10^-6 / 0.1 = 63.22 * 10^-5 = 0.006322\n\nWait, that's what I had before, but now I realize that 100 fringes correspond to 100 wavelengths, not 100 times the wavelength.\n\nWait, perhaps the fringe shift is equal to the change in optical path difference divided by the wavelength.\n\nSo, if the optical path difference changes by (n - 1) * L, and each fringe corresponds to a change of one wavelength, then:\n\n(n - 1) * L = 100 * \u03bb\n\nTherefore:\n\nn - 1 = 100 * \u03bb / L\n\nPlugging in \u03bb = 632.2 nm = 632.2 * 10^-9 m and L = 10 cm = 0.1 m:\n\nn - 1 = (100 * 632.2 * 10^-9) / 0.1 = (63220 * 10^-9) / 0.1 = 63220 * 10^-9 / 0.1 = 63220 * 10^-10 / 0.1 = 63220 * 10^-11 / 0.1 = wait, that seems off.\n\nWait, 632.2 nm = 632.2 * 10^-9 m\n\n100 * 632.2 * 10^-9 = 63220 * 10^-9 = 63.22 * 10^-6 m\n\nDivide by 0.1 m:\n\n63.22 * 10^-6 / 0.1 = 63.22 * 10^-5 = 0.0006322\n\nSo, n - 1 = 0.0006322\n\nTherefore, n = 1.0006322\n\nWhich matches option A: 1.00063\n\nI must have miscalculated earlier. I think I confused the units or did the division incorrectly.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A: 1.00063\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
