                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this genetics problem about guinea pigs with black and white coats. It says that black is dominant over white, and both parents have black coats. When they're crossed, three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter have white coats. I need to figure out what the genotypes of the parents are most likely to be. The options are:\n\nA. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nB. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nC. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nD. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the genetics behind this. Black is dominant over white, so let's assume that the capital letter B represents the black allele and b represents the white allele. Since black is dominant, any guinea pig with at least one B will have a black coat, and only those with bb will have a white coat.\n\nNow, both parents have black coats. That means each parent has at least one B allele. They could be either BB (homozygous dominant) or Bb (heterozygous).\n\nThe problem is to determine which combination of genotypes for the parents would result in the observed offspring ratio of three-quarters black to one-quarter white.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: bb \u00d7 bb\n\nWait a minute, both parents are bb. But the problem states that both parents have black coats, and bb should have white coats. So this can't be right because bb has white coat, not black. So, option A is out.\n\nOption B: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nBoth parents are heterozygous, having one B and one b allele.\n\nLet's recall the Punnett square for Bb \u00d7 Bb:\n\nParent 1: Bb\n\nParent 2: Bb\n\nPossible gametes from parent 1: B and b\n\nPossible gametes from parent 2: B and b\n\nCombining them:\n\n- B from parent 1 with B from parent 2: BB (black)\n\n- B from parent 1 with b from parent 2: Bb (black)\n\n- b from parent 1 with B from parent 2: Bb (black)\n\n- b from parent 1 with b from parent 2: bb (white)\n\nSo, the offspring genotypes are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. That's three black to one white, which is exactly three-quarters black and one-quarter white, matching the observed ratio.\n\nSo, option B seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption C: Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nOne parent is heterozygous black (Bb), and the other is homozygous white (bb).\n\nLet's do the Punnett square:\n\nParent 1: Bb\n\nParent 2: bb\n\nPossible gametes from parent 1: B and b\n\nPossible gametes from parent 2: b and b\n\nCombining them:\n\n- B from parent 1 with b from parent 2: Bb (black)\n\n- b from parent 1 with b from parent 2: bb (white)\n\nSo, the offspring are either Bb (black) or bb (white), in equal proportions: 50% black and 50% white.\n\nBut the problem states that three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter have white coats. This doesn't match the 50-50 ratio from this cross. So, option C is not matching the observed ratio.\n\nOption D: BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nOne parent is homozygous dominant (BB), and the other is heterozygous (Bb).\n\nPunnett square:\n\nParent 1: BB\n\nParent 2: Bb\n\nPossible gametes from parent 1: all B\n\nPossible gametes from parent 2: B and b\n\nCombining them:\n\n- B from parent 1 with B from parent 2: BB (black)\n\n- B from parent 1 with b from parent 2: Bb (black)\n\nSo, all offspring are BB or Bb, both of which are black. There are no white offspring in this cross. This doesn't match the observed ratio of three-quarters black and one-quarter white.\n\nSo, based on this, option D is also not matching the observed ratio.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits the observed ratio is option B: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIn option B, Bb \u00d7 Bb, the expected offspring ratios are:\n\n- BB (black): 25%\n\n- Bb (black): 50%\n\n- bb (white): 25%\n\nSo, total black (BB + Bb) is 75%, and white is 25%, which matches the observed ratio.\n\nIn option C, Bb \u00d7 bb, it's 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match.\n\nIn option D, BB \u00d7 Bb, it's 100% black, which also doesn't match.\n\nOption A was already eliminated because bb has a white coat, contrary to the problem's statement that both parents have black coats.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any exceptions or if I'm missing something about incomplete dominance or something like that.\n\nThe problem states that black is dominant over white, so it's a clear case of complete dominance. There's no mention of incomplete dominance or any other factors that might affect the phenotype.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
