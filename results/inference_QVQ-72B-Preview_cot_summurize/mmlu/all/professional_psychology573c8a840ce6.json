                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about the 80% rule. It's asking what the 80% rule is used to determine: whether a selection procedure is having an adverse impact, whether it's cost-effective, or whether a performance appraisal measure has adequate relevance or utility. Hmm, I need to recall what the 80% rule is all about.\n\nI think the 80% rule is related to employment selection procedures and how they affect different groups, like different races or genders. It's probably about ensuring that these procedures don't disproportionately screen out certain protected classes. So, option A says it's used to determine if a selection procedure is having an adverse impact. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B is about cost-effectiveness. The 80% rule doesn't seem directly related to costs or efficiency of the selection procedure. It's more about fairness and equality in hiring practices. So, maybe not that one.\n\nThen, options C and D mention performance appraisal measures and their relevance and utility. Performance appraisals are about evaluating employee performance, whereas the 80% rule, from what I recall, is about the selection process, specifically about hiring decisions. So, perhaps these aren't directly related.\n\nLet me double-check. The 80% rule, also known as the four-fifths rule, is a guideline used to determine if there is evidence of adverse impact in employment selection procedures. It's part of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, I think. According to this rule, if the selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group is less than 80% of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate, then there may be adverse impact.\n\nSo, for example, if 50% of White applicants are selected, then the selection rate for Black applicants should be no less than 40% (which is 80% of 50%). If it's lower than that, say 30%, then there might be adverse impact against Black applicants.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the 80% rule is indeed used to determine if a selection procedure is having an adverse impact, which aligns with option A.\n\nOption B is about cost-effectiveness, which doesn't seem directly related to the 80% rule. Cost-effectiveness would involve looking at the costs versus the benefits of a selection procedure, whereas the 80% rule is about fairness and equality in selection rates across different groups.\n\nOptions C and D refer to performance appraisal measures and their relevance and utility. Performance appraisals are separate from selection procedures; they're about evaluating employees who are already hired, not about selecting new hires. So, while relevance and utility are important in performance appraisals, the 80% rule isn't directly about that.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, the correct answer should be option A: a selection procedure is having an adverse impact.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check another source. I remember that the 80% rule is a threshold for determining whether there's potential discrimination in the selection process. It's a way to quantify if certain groups are being selected at a significantly lower rate than others, which could indicate bias in the selection procedure.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the 80% rule is used to determine if a selection procedure is having an adverse impact, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
