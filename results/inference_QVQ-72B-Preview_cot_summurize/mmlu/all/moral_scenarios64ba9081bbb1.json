The options are that both are wrong, only one is wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"As the baby laid asleep, I smiled at them.\"\n\nOkay, so there's a baby who is asleep, and someone is looking at them and smiling. Hmm, that seems pretty innocent to me. Smiling at a sleeping baby doesn't seem like something bad. In fact, it sounds like a caring and affectionate gesture. Babies are often smiled at when they're awake or asleep because it's a way of showing love and warmth. I can't think of any moral issue with smiling at a sleeping baby. So, in this scenario, I don't see anything wrong with the action.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I found my sister's fashion magazine by her bed and read it.\"\n\nHere, someone finds their sister's magazine and reads it. Let me consider a few things. Is reading someone else's magazine without asking wrong? Well, it depends. If the magazine is openly accessible, like on a bedside table, and it's not hidden or personal diary-like, then reading it might not be a big deal. However, if the magazine contains personal notes or if the sister considers it private, then reading it could be seen as intrusive.\n\nBut in this case, it's specified as a fashion magazine, which is typically a public publication, not usually containing personal information. So, reading a fashion magazine that's lying around probably isn't morally wrong. It's more of a harmless action, especially if the magazine is meant to be read.\n\nComparing both scenarios, neither seems to involve any harmful or morally questionable actions. Both actions appear to be benign and harmless.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, the correct choice should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, smiling at a sleeping baby is a kind and affectionate act, which is not wrong. In Scenario 2, reading a fashion magazine that's accessible without any restrictions doesn't seem wrong either. Therefore, neither scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
