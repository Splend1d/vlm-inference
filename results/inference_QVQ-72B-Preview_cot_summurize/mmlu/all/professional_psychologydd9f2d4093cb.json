                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question about decreasing hostility between groups of junior high school students. There are four options, and I need to pick the best advice. Let me think through each one.\n\nOption A says to increase opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions. That sounds like getting the kids from different groups to spend time together in a positive environment. Maybe organizing events where they can interact and get to know each other better. I've heard that familiarity can help reduce prejudices and misunderstandings. So, that seems like a good approach.\n\nOption B suggests having a respected member of the community speak to the students about the benefits of cooperation. This seems like it could be effective because if someone the students look up to is telling them that working together is important, they might be more open to the idea. It's like authority figures can influence behavior. But, I wonder if just hearing about cooperation is enough to change their attitudes towards each other.\n\nOption C is about having each group select a representative to discuss ways to reduce hostility. This seems like a diplomatic approach. By having representatives, maybe the groups feel more ownership over the solutions. It could be effective because it involves the students directly in finding solutions, which might make them more committed to implementing them. But, I'm not sure if this would necessarily lead to reduced hostility between the groups as a whole.\n\nOption D mentions assigning the students goals that can only be achieved through intergroup cooperation. This sounds a lot like the idea of working towards a common goal. If the groups have to work together to achieve something, maybe they'll start seeing each other as teammates rather than rivals. This could be really effective because it creates a situation where they have to rely on each other.\n\nHmm, all of these options seem like they could help reduce hostility, but I need to choose the best advice. Let me try to compare them.\n\nFirst, between A and D: increasing contact under pleasant conditions versus assigning goals that require intergroup cooperation. Contact theory suggests that positive contact can reduce prejudice, but maybe assigning common goals is more active and forces collaboration. Maybe both are effective, but in different ways.\n\nOption B, having a respected speaker talk about cooperation, might raise awareness, but I'm not sure if it would directly reduce hostility. It might inspire some students, but perhaps not change deep-seated attitudes.\n\nOption C, having group representatives discuss ways to reduce hostility, could be effective if the representatives can communicate well and bring back ideas to their groups. But again, it might not directly address the hostility between the groups.\n\nComparing A and D again: contact under pleasant conditions versus common goals. I think assigning common goals that require cooperation might be more effective because it not only brings them together but also gives them a reason to work together towards a shared objective. Maybe it's more structured and ensures that they have to interact in a collaborative way.\n\nBut, on the other hand, just increasing positive contact might also lead to better relationships over time as they get to know each other better.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully. Maybe consider some examples.\n\nSuppose I have two groups in school that don't get along, like the drama kids and the sports kids. If I organize a school play where both groups have to work together, that might be a common goal that requires intergroup cooperation. They'd have to rehearse together, build sets, maybe even perform together. That seems like a practical way to get them to work as a team.\n\nAlternatively, if I just organize a picnic where both groups can hang out, that might be pleasant, but would it necessarily lead to reduced hostility? Maybe, but perhaps not as directly as working towards a shared goal.\n\nHaving a respected speaker talk about cooperation might make them think about getting along, but again, it's more about awareness than action.\n\nAnd having representatives discuss ways to reduce hostility could be a good start, but it might not translate into changed behavior across the whole groups.\n\nSo, between A and D, I'm leaning towards D: assigning goals that require intergroup cooperation. It seems more active and structured, forcing the groups to collaborate in a meaningful way.\n\nBut, I should consider if there's any research or theory that supports this.\n\nI recall something about the \"contact hypothesis,\" which suggests that under certain conditions, intergroup contact can reduce prejudice. Those conditions include equal status contact, common goals, and cooperation. So, maybe combining contact with common goals is even more effective.\n\nWait, option D already includes common goals and cooperation, so that aligns with the contact hypothesis.\n\nPlus, maybe having common goals adds an extra layer of necessity for cooperation, which could be crucial in changing attitudes.\n\nAlso, if the groups are working together towards something they all value, it might help shift their perspective from seeing each other as rivals to seeing each other as partners.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose I don't assign common goals but just increase opportunities for social interaction. Could that be as effective?\n\nWell, social interactions can help build friendships and understanding, but without a shared purpose or goal, it might not address some of the underlying causes of hostility, like competition for resources or recognition.\n\nIn contrast, assigning common goals that require cooperation might not only build relationships but also demonstrate that working together is more beneficial than competing against each other.\n\nMaybe it's a combination of both: increasing positive contact and assigning common goals.\n\nBut since I have to choose the best advice among the options, and option D specifically mentions intergroup cooperation towards common goals, I think that's the most comprehensive approach.\n\nI should also consider practicality. Is it feasible to assign goals that require intergroup cooperation in a junior high school setting?\n\nYes, absolutely. Schools often have projects or events that can involve students from different groups working together, like science fairs, sports teams, or community service projects.\n\nWhereas, increasing opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions might be more about social events, which are also feasible, but perhaps less directly tied to academic or school activities.\n\nWait, maybe both A and D can be combined in such activities. For example, a school project that brings students from different groups together in a pleasant environment to work towards a common goal.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps option D is still covering that ground.\n\nAlright, after considering all this, I think the best advice is option D: assign the students goals that can be achieved only through intergroup cooperation.\n\nIt seems to be the most effective way to reduce hostility by fostering collaboration and mutual dependence, which can lead to better understanding and relationships between the groups.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
