                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which horror film has the most sequels. The options are \"Scream,\" \"Jaws,\" \"Halloween,\" and \"Friday the 13th.\" Hmm, I'm pretty into movies, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers for each of these franchises.\n\nFirst, let's think about \"Scream.\" I know that the first \"Scream\" came out in 1996, and there have been a few sequels since then. I think there's \"Scream 2,\" \"Scream 3,\" and \"Scream 4.\" Wait, actually, \"Scream 5\" just came out recently, I believe. So that would make it five movies in total for the \"Scream\" series.\n\nNext is \"Jaws.\" I remember that \"Jaws\" was a huge hit when it came out in 1975. It spawned a couple of sequels. There's \"Jaws 2,\" \"Jaws 3,\" and \"Jaws: The Revenge.\" So that's four movies in total for the \"Jaws\" franchise.\n\nNow, \"Halloween.\" This one is a classic. The first \"Halloween\" was directed by John Carpenter and came out in 1978. It introduced Michael Myers, right? There have been numerous sequels and reboots in this franchise. Let me try to count them.\n\nThere's \"Halloween II\" in 1981, then \"Halloween III: Season of the Witch\" in 1982, which I think was a bit different from the others. Then they went back to Michael Myers with \"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers\" in 1988, followed by \"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\" in 1989, \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" in 1995, \"Halloween: H20\" in 1998, \"Halloween: Resurrection\" in 2002, and then there was a remake in 2007 by Rob Zombie, which had its own sequel in 2009. More recently, there was another \"Halloween\" reboot in 2018, followed by \"Halloween Kills\" in 2021, and \"Halloween Ends\" is supposed to come out soon. Wow, that's a lot. Let me count them:\n\nOriginal series: Halloween (1978), Halloween II (1981), Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), Halloween 4 (1988), Halloween 5 (1989), Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995), Halloween: H20 (1998), Halloween: Resurrection (2002) \u2013 that's 8 movies.\n\nThen the Rob Zombie remakes: Halloween (2007), Halloween II (2009) \u2013 that's 2 more.\n\nAnd the recent reboots: Halloween (2018), Halloween Kills (2021), Halloween Ends (2022) \u2013 that's 3 more.\n\nSo in total for \"Halloween,\" that's 8 + 2 + 3 = 13 movies. That's quite a few!\n\nLastly, \"Friday the 13th.\" This franchise started in 1980 with the first \"Friday the 13th\" movie, introducing Jason Voorhees. I know there are many sequels, including one set in space, I think. Let me see if I can recall how many there are.\n\nThere's \"Friday the 13th, Part 2\" in 1981, \"Friday the 13th, Part 3\" in 1982, \"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter\" in 1984, \"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\" in 1985, \"Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives\" in 1986, \"Friday the 13th, Part VII: The New Blood\" in 1988, \"Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\" in 1989, \"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\" in 1993, \"Jason X\" in 2001, and then a remake in 2009. So, counting them:\n\n1. Friday the 13th (1980)\n\n2. Part 2 (1981)\n\n3. Part 3 (1982)\n\n4. The Final Chapter (1984)\n\n5. A New Beginning (1985)\n\n6. Jason Lives (1986)\n\n7. The New Blood (1988)\n\n8. Jason Takes Manhattan (1989)\n\n9. Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993)\n\n10. Jason X (2001)\n\n11. Friday the 13th (remake, 2009)\n\nThat's 11 movies in total for \"Friday the 13th.\"\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scream: 5\n\n- Jaws: 4\n\n- Halloween: 13\n\n- Friday the 13th: 11\n\nFrom these numbers, \"Halloween\" has the most sequels with 13 films in total. That's impressive!\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss any movies.\n\nStarting with \"Scream\":\n\n1. Scream (1996)\n\n2. Scream 2 (1997)\n\n3. Scream 3 (2000)\n\n4. Scream 4 (2011)\n\n5. Scream (2022)\n\nThat's five movies. Seems correct.\n\n\"Jaws\":\n\n1. Jaws (1975)\n\n2. Jaws 2 (1978)\n\n3. Jaws 3 (1983)\n\n4. Jaws: The Revenge (1987)\n\nFour movies. Correct.\n\n\"Halloween\":\n\nI listed 13 movies, but let's verify:\n\nOriginal series:\n\n1. Halloween (1978)\n\n2. Halloween II (1981)\n\n3. Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)\n\n4. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988)\n\n5. Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989)\n\n6. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995)\n\n7. Halloween: H20 (1998)\n\n8. Halloween: Resurrection (2002)\n\nRob Zombie remakes:\n\n9. Halloween (2007)\n\n10. Halloween II (2009)\n\nRecent reboots:\n\n11. Halloween (2018)\n\n12. Halloween Kills (2021)\n\n13. Halloween Ends (2022)\n\nThat's indeed 13 movies.\n\n\"Friday the 13th\":\n\n1. Friday the 13th (1980)\n\n2. Part 2 (1981)\n\n3. Part 3 (1982)\n\n4. The Final Chapter (1984)\n\n5. A New Beginning (1985)\n\n6. Jason Lives (1986)\n\n7. The New Blood (1988)\n\n8. Jason Takes Manhattan (1989)\n\n9. Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993)\n\n10. Jason X (2001)\n\n11. Friday the 13th (remake, 2009)\n\nThat's eleven movies.\n\nSo, based on this, \"Halloween\" has the most sequels with 13 films.\n\nBut wait, I recall that there might be more to the \"Halloween\" franchise. Let me check if there are any other movies that I might have missed.\n\nAfter \"Halloween: Resurrection\" in 2002, there was a reboot in 2007 by Rob Zombie, followed by a sequel in 2009. Then another reboot in 2018, with \"Halloween Kills\" in 2021 and \"Halloween Ends\" in 2022. I think that's all of them.\n\nFor \"Friday the 13th,\" I believe there was also a crossover movie with Freddy Krueger, but that was \"Freddy vs. Jason,\" which was a crossover and not a direct sequel to \"Friday the 13th.\" So, I don't count that as part of the franchise.\n\nSimilarly, for \"Halloween,\" there might have been some direct-to-video releases or spin-offs, but I don't think so. The ones I listed should be the main entries.\n\nTherefore, \"Halloween\" has the most sequels among these options, with 13 films in total.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
