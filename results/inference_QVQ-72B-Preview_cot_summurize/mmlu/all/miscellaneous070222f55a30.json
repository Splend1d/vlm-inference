Luther Vandross, and D. Lex Luthor. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Lutheran Church is a Christian denomination. I think it's part of the Protestant Reformation or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure about the details. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nOption A is Martin Luther King Jr. I know who he is\u2014he was a prominent civil rights activist in the United States, famous for his role in the civil rights movement and delivering the \"I Have a Dream\" speech. But I don't think he's related to the Lutheran Church directly. Maybe indirectly, since he was a Baptist minister, but that's a different denomination. So, probably not him.\n\nOption B is Martin Luther. Now, I've heard of Martin Luther in the context of the Protestant Reformation. He was a German monk and theologian who initiated the Reformation by posting his 95 Theses in 1517, challenging some practices of the Catholic Church. I believe that the Lutheran Church is named after him because he was its founder or at least the key figure who started it all. So, this seems like a likely answer.\n\nOption C is Luther Vandross. I'm pretty sure he's a musician. I recall that he was a famous R&B and soul singer-songwriter. He had a lot of hits in the 80s and 90s. But I don't see how he's connected to the Lutheran Church. He's a musician, not a religious figure, as far as I know. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption D is Lex Luthor. Well, Lex Luthor is a fictional character, primarily known as Superman's archenemy in comic books. He's a supervillain, not a real person, and certainly not someone who would be associated with a church denomination. So, this is definitely not the answer.\n\nAfter considering all the options, it seems clear that the correct answer is B. Martin Luther. He was the key figure in the Protestant Reformation, and the Lutheran Church is named after him. It makes sense because the Lutheran Church is one of the major branches of Protestantism that emerged during the Reformation.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll double-check my knowledge. The Lutheran Church was founded in the early 16th century by Martin Luther. His ideas about justification by faith alone and challenging the authority of the Pope led to the split from the Roman Catholic Church. This movement spread throughout Europe and beyond, forming various Lutheran churches and denominations.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that Martin Luther is the person from whom the Lutheran Church gets its name. The other options are either not related to the church's history or are fictional characters, so they can be eliminated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Martin Luther}} \\]"
