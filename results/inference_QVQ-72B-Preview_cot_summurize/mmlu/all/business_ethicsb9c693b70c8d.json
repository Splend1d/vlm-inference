                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about ethical theories, and I need to match up these terms correctly. Let's see, the question is saying that two things are examples of another thing based on some universal principles of right and wrong. So, it's about ethics and morality, specifically different types of ethical theories.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option is referring to:\n\nA. Ethics of duty, Ethics of rights and justice, Principle\n\nB. Utilitarianism, Egoism, Principle\n\nC. Ethics of duty, Utilitarianism, Consequentialist\n\nD. Egoism, Ethics of rights and justice, Consequentialist\n\nHmm, I think I should recall what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with \"Ethics of duty\" \u2013 that sounds like deontological ethics, which is based on duties and obligations. So, it's about doing what's right because it's the right thing to do, regardless of the consequences.\n\n\"Ethics of rights and justice\" \u2013 this seems related to theories that emphasize individual rights and fairness, like libertarianism or some forms of liberalism.\n\n\"Utilitarianism\" \u2013 that's a consequentialist theory that focuses on maximizing utility, usually defined as happiness or well-being, for the greatest number of people.\n\n\"Egoism\" \u2013 this is a theory that suggests individuals should act in their own self-interest.\n\n\"Principle\"-based theories \u2013 this seems a bit vague, but it probably refers to theories that are based on fundamental moral principles or rules.\n\n\"Consequentialist\"-based theories \u2013 these are theories that judge the morality of an action based on its outcomes or consequences.\n\nAlright, so I need to find which pair of the first two options are examples of the third option.\n\nLet's look at option A: Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice are both examples of Principle-based theories.\n\nDeontological ethics (duty-based) is indeed principle-based, as it relies on rules like \"thou shalt not kill\" or \"keep your promises.\" Similarly, theories of rights and justice often rely on principles like \"everyone has a right to liberty\" or \"justice requires equal treatment under the law.\" So, both of these seem to be based on principles or rules rather than consequences. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B: Utilitarianism and Egoism are both examples of Principle-based theories.\n\nUtilitarianism is consequentialist; it's based on the principle of maximizing happiness, but it's more about the consequences rather than adhering to specific rules. Egoism is also consequentialist in nature, focusing on individual self-interest. So, while both have principles, they are more about the outcomes than adhering to specific duties or rights. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption C: Ethics of duty and Utilitarianism are both examples of Consequentialist theories.\n\nEthics of duty is deontological, which is non-consequentialist, while Utilitarianism is consequentialist. So, these are different in that one looks at duties and the other at consequences. Therefore, this can't be right.\n\nOption D: Egoism and Ethics of rights and justice are both examples of Consequentialist theories.\n\nEgoism is consequentialist, as it focuses on individual outcomes (self-interest). However, ethics of rights and justice are more principle-based, emphasizing rules and principles over consequences. So, again, mixing different types here.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A seems to be the most accurate: Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice are both examples of Principle-based theories.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is Ethics of rights and justice indeed principle-based? Yes, theories of justice often rely on principles of fairness, equality, and individual rights. So, that checks out.\n\nAnd Ethics of duty is definitely principle-based, as it's founded on the idea of following moral duties and obligations, which are rule-based.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
