                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about acrosome and cortical reactions in fertilization. It says these reactions ensure something immediately after fertilization. Let me see what options we have.\n\nOption A says they ensure the sperm will fertilize the ovum. Hmm, but if fertilization has already occurred, why would they still need to ensure that? Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nOption B says the zygote will begin to divide normally. That sounds possible, but I think these reactions are more about preventing multiple sperm from fertilizing the egg rather than starting the division process.\n\nOption C says one and only one sperm will fertilize the egg. That sounds familiar. I think the acrosome reaction is involved in helping the sperm penetrate the egg's outer layers, and the cortical reaction might be about blocking other sperm from entering after the first one has fused with the egg.\n\nOption D says the zygote will not divide into two embryos, producing twins. I don't think that's directly related to the acrosome and cortical reactions. Twins can happen naturally or due to other factors, not sure about this one.\n\nLet me think again. The acrosome reaction is when the sperm releases enzymes to break down the outer layers of the egg, right? So, that helps the sperm get through to the egg's membrane. Then, the cortical reaction happens after the sperm enters, and I think it involves changes in the egg's membrane to prevent other sperm from entering.\n\nSo, combining these, it seems like these reactions are primarily about ensuring that only one sperm fertilizes the egg. That points towards option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the acrosome reaction helps the sperm penetrate the egg, and the cortical reaction prevents other sperm from entering, then yes, that ensures that only one sperm fertilizes the egg. So, option C seems correct.\n\nOption A might be confusing because fertilization has already occurred when these reactions take place, so it's not about ensuring the sperm will fertilize the ovum, but more about the processes happening after fertilization.\n\nOption B, starting the zygote's division, might be a subsequent event, but I don't think these reactions directly cause the zygote to divide. Maybe indirectly, but not directly ensuring it.\n\nOption D seems unrelated to the acrosome and cortical reactions. Whether the zygote splits into two embryos to form twins is a different process, not directly connected to these reactions.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, I think the answer is option C: one and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
