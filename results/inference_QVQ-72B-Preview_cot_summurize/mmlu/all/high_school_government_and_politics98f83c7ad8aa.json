I know that the First Amendment is really important because it protects some basic rights like free speech and religion, but the question is asking about something else it protects. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says \"due process of the law in any criminal case.\" Hmm, I think due process is more related to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, not the First. So maybe that's not it.\n\nOption B is \"retain personal property unless justly compensated by the government.\" That sounds like it's about eminent domain or something, where the government can take private property for public use but has to pay for it. I think that's the Fifth Amendment too, not the First. So probably not B.\n\nOption C says \"not be subjected to excessive fines or unusual punishment.\" Again, that sounds like it's related to criminal penalties, which I think is covered by the Eighth Amendment. So again, probably not part of the First Amendment.\n\nThat leaves Option D: \"petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" Now, I remember that the First Amendment talks about the right to assemble peaceably and to petition the government. Let me think back to what it exactly says.\n\nI think the First Amendment starts with something like, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, among the rights protected by the First Amendment are freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petitioning the government.\n\nSo, if I'm correct, Option D is indeed protected by the First Amendment.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check the other options once more.\n\nOption A: Due process in criminal cases. That's actually the Fifth Amendment, I believe. It says something about no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n\nOption B: Retaining personal property unless justly compensated. That's the Takings Clause, which is also part of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nOption C: No excessive fines or cruel and unusual punishment. That's the Eighth Amendment.\n\nOption D: Petitioning the government for a redress of grievances. That's definitely the First Amendment.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait a minute, the question says, \"While best known for protecting freedom of speech and religion, the First Amendment also protects Americans' right to...\" and then lists these options. Since A, B, and C are not part of the First Amendment, D must be the correct choice.\n\nI think I've got it right. If I had to choose one, I'd go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
