                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Rainbow Corporation and their shareholders' meeting. They have 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock. The preferred stock has some liquidation preference and dividend details, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant to the question. The main issue seems to be about whether a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights, which comes ahead of the old preferred stock, is validly approved based on the votes.\n\nSo, at the shareholders' meeting, 700 common shares and 400 preferred shares voted in favor of the proposal. The question is asking which statement is correct regarding the validity of this approval.\n\nOption A says the proposal is validly approved because a majority of the outstanding shares did approve. So, total outstanding shares are 1,000 common + 1,000 preferred = 2,000 shares. The votes in favor are 700 common + 400 preferred = 1,100 shares. That's more than half of 2,000, so that seems to satisfy the majority requirement.\n\nOption B says the proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve. The preferred shareholders are 1,000 shares, and 400 voted in favor, which is less than half. So, indeed, a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nOption C says the vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock. But wait, the question mentions that the preferred stock is nonvoting, but in this case, they did vote. Maybe there's some exception or special circumstance where nonvoting stock can vote on certain matters.\n\nOption D says the proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required. I don't have information about whether a two-thirds majority is needed, so I can't assume that.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully. First, the preferred stock is nonvoting, but they voted on this proposal. Maybe there are rules that allow nonvoting stock to vote on matters that affect them directly, like changes to their class.\n\nI recall that in corporate law, certain amendments to the corporate charter or bylaws may require approval from affected classes of stock, even if they are normally nonvoting. So, in this case, since the proposal affects the preferred stock by creating a new class that comes ahead of the old preferred, perhaps the preferred stockholders have the right to vote on this matter.\n\nGiven that, the fact that only 400 out of 1,000 preferred shares voted in favor suggests that less than a majority approved. So, if the preferred class needed to approve it, and they didn't, then the proposal might be invalidly approved.\n\nBut option A suggests that since the overall majority of shares approved it, that's sufficient. However, in many jurisdictions, including the United States, amendments to the corporate charter that affect a particular class of stock may require the approval of that class, in addition to the overall majority of shares.\n\nSo, even if the common shareholders approved it, if the preferred shareholders, who are directly affected, did not approve it by the required majority, then the proposal might not be validly approved.\n\nWait, but in this case, the preferred stock is nonvoting. Does that mean they can't vote, or are there exceptions?\n\nLet me check. In some corporate laws, nonvoting stock may have the right to vote on limited matters that affect their interests, such as changes to their rights or preferences.\n\nAssuming that's the case here, then the preferred stockholders have the right to vote on this proposal because it affects their class by creating a new class that comes ahead of them.\n\nGiven that, and since only 400 out of 1,000 preferred shares voted in favor, which is less than a majority, it seems that the preferred class did not approve the proposal.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: the proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nBut let's double-check. Option A is saying that the overall majority approves, so it's valid. However, corporate law often requires that amendments affecting a particular class get approval from that class, in addition to the overall majority.\n\nSo, even if the total votes are a majority, if a required class approval is not met, the approval is invalid.\n\nOption C says that the preferred votes don't matter because they're nonvoting. But in this scenario, they did vote, and it seems they have the right to vote on this matter, so this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D mentions a two-thirds vote of each class is required. I don't have information to support that a two-thirds majority is needed, so I can't assume that.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, option B seems to be the correct answer: the proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
