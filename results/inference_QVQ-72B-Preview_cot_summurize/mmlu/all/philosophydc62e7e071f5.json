                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Bentham's views on utilitarian calculations. The question is about what he thought regarding these calculations: should they be done before every action, or maybe just kept in mind without necessarily doing them each time? Or perhaps they're just a theoretical tool with no practical use, or even fundamentally flawed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Bentham is and what utilitarianism is. Jeremy Bentham was an English philosopher and jurist who is widely regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes utility, which is often defined as happiness or pleasure minus pain or suffering. So, in utilitarian terms, an action is right if it leads to the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nNow, regarding utilitarian calculations, I remember that Bentham believed in quantitative assessment of pleasure and pain. He proposed a \"felicific calculus\" as a method for measuring the amount of happiness or utility that an action would produce. This involved considering several factors like the intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, fecundity, and purity of the pleasure or pain resulting from an action.\n\nGiven that, option A says that utilitarian calculations should be performed prior to each action. That seems quite rigorous and time-consuming. Imagine having to calculate the utility of every single action you take throughout the day\u2014it would be practically impossible due to time constraints and the complexity of predicting outcomes.\n\nOption B suggests that calculations need not be performed before each action, but should always be kept in mind. This seems more feasible. It implies that while you don't have to do a full-blown calculation every time, the principle of utility should guide your decision-making process. You should consider the consequences of your actions and aim for the greatest good, even if you don't quantify them mathematically.\n\nOption C states that utilitarian calculations are merely a formal device and do not have practical application. This seems contradictory to Bentham's purpose. If utilitarian calculations were just a theoretical tool without practical use, then what's the point of developing them? Bentham intended his felicific calculus to be a practical guide for making ethical decisions, not just an abstract concept.\n\nOption D claims that utilitarian calculations are fundamentally flawed. While there are criticisms of utilitarianism, such as the difficulty in measuring and comparing utilities across different people, or the potential for justifying immoral acts if they lead to greater overall happiness, I don't recall Bentham himself acknowledging fundamental flaws in his theory.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think option B is the most accurate reflection of Bentham's views. He likely didn't expect people to perform utilitarian calculations before every single action, given the impracticality of such a approach. Instead, he probably intended for the principle of utility to be a guiding ethos that informs decision-making in a more general sense.\n\nTo double-check, I might recall some of Bentham's famous quotes or key points from his works, like \"the greatest happiness principle.\" In his book \"An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,\" Bentham outlines the idea that the moral worth of an action is determined by its contribution to overall happiness. He also discusses the felicific calculus as a method for assessing this, but acknowledges that it's more of a guiding principle than a precise mathematical tool.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe the correct answer is B: utilitarian calculations need not be performed before each action, but should always be kept in mind. This aligns with Bentham's practical approach to ethics and recognizes the limitations of performing detailed calculations in everyday life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
