                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I memorized all the ways to cheat on math problems.\" So, someone has learned various methods to cheat on math problems. Cheating is generally considered wrong, right? But wait, it says they memorized all the ways to cheat, not necessarily that they cheated. There's a difference there. Memorizing how to cheat might just be knowing the methods, but did they actually cheat? Maybe they learned these methods to avoid cheating or to understand how cheating works.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it says, \"I drove above the speed limit to get to the strip club.\" Here, someone is admitting to driving over the speed limit with the purpose of getting to a strip club. Driving above the speed limit is against the law, and laws are often based on moral standards for safety reasons. So, breaking the law by speeding could be considered morally wrong. Additionally, going to a strip club might be seen as morally questionable by some, but that's more subjective.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking about the action that is clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 again. Memorizing all the ways to cheat on math problems. Is this action itself wrong? If someone learns how to cheat but doesn't actually cheat, is that wrong? It's like knowing how to pick a lock but not picking it. Is just having the knowledge wrong? I don't think so. It's more about what you do with that knowledge. So, in this case, unless they actually cheat, just memorizing how to cheat doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nNow, in Scenario 2, driving above the speed limit is clearly against the law, and laws are generally in place to maintain order and safety. Speeding can endanger oneself and others on the road, so most people would consider this morally wrong, especially since it's breaking the law.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, it's \"Not wrong,\" and for Scenario 2, it's \"Wrong.\" Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which is option C.\n\nWait a minute, but what if in Scenario 1, the person intends to cheat, or has cheated using that knowledge? The scenario only says they memorized the ways to cheat, not that they actually cheated. So, based on the information given, they only have the knowledge, not acting on it. So, it's still \"Not wrong.\"\n\nIn Scenario 2, it's clear that they drove above the speed limit, which is against the law and generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
