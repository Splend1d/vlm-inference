                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the central prayer in Jainism. The options are Namokar Mantra, The Liberation Mantra, Ahimsa, and Archaryas. I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means in the context of Jainism.\n\nStarting with the Namokar Mantra: I recall that in Jainism, the Namokar Mantra is a widely used prayer or invocation. It's often chanted at the beginning of scriptures and during daily prayers. The name \"Namokar\" comes from the Sanskrit words \"Nama\" meaning bow or reverence and \"Kar\" meaning making. So, it's essentially an expression of reverence or respect towards the Tirthankaras, who are the spiritual teachers in Jainism. This seems like a prominent prayer in Jainism.\n\nNext, The Liberation Mantra: I'm not as familiar with this term in Jainism. Jainism does emphasize the concept of liberation or moksha, which is the ultimate goal of the religion\u2014to free oneself from the cycle of rebirth. There might be prayers or mantras related to this concept, but I'm not sure if there's a specific prayer called \"The Liberation Mantra.\" Maybe it's another name for one of the Jain prayers, or perhaps it's more of a general term.\n\nAhimsa: This is a principle that's central to Jainism, as well as to other Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism. Ahimsa means non-violence, and it's a fundamental teaching in Jainism, guiding their ethical conduct and practices. However, Ahimsa is more of a philosophical and ethical principle rather than a specific prayer or mantra. So, while it's crucial in Jainism, it's probably not the central prayer.\n\nArcharyas: I'm not sure about this one. In Jainism, Acharyas are revered teachers or leaders who guide the Jain community. They play a significant role in interpreting scriptures and providing spiritual guidance. However, again, this seems more like a title or a position within the community rather than a specific prayer or mantra.\n\nComparing all the options, the Namokar Mantra seems to be the most fitting answer. It's a well-known prayer in Jainism, used regularly in their worship and practices. The other options either refer to concepts, principles, or roles within the community but aren't specifically identified as central prayers.\n\nJust to make sure, I should check if there's any other prayer in Jainism that might be considered the central one. For instance, there's the Micchami Dukkadam, which is a forgiveness mantra, but that's more specifically related to the festival of forgiveness, not necessarily the central prayer.\n\nAnother one is the Navkar Mantra, which is similar to the Namokar Mantra and is also widely used in Jainism. In fact, I think the Namokar Mantra and the Navkar Mantra are different names for the same prayer. The Navkar Mantra is:\n\n\"Namo Aatmane, Namo Aatmane,\n\nNamo Aatmane, Namo Aatmane,\n\nNamo Aatmane, Namo Aatmane,\n\nNamo Aatmane, Namo Aatmane,\n\nNamo Aatmane, Namo Aatmane,\n\nNamo Aatmane, Namo
