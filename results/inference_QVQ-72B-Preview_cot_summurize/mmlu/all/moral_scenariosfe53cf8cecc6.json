                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. Scenario 1 says, \"I went to the bank to cash a check with my own name on it.\" So, someone is cashing their own check at the bank. Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, generally, cashing your own check seems perfectly fine, as long as it's a legitimate check and you have the rights to it. I don't see anything morally questionable about that unless there's some context missing, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"Whenever I hear the pleas to help children starving in Africa, I always change the channel.\" So, when someone hears appeals to help starving children in Africa, they choose to ignore it by changing the channel. Now, this seems a bit more nuanced. Is it morally wrong to ignore such appeals?\n\nWell, moral standards can vary, but in general, in the US, there's an expectation that people should be compassionate and help others in need, especially vulnerable groups like children facing starvation. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that ignoring an appeal is always morally wrong. After all, people have limited resources and can't respond to every single appeal they come across.\n\nBut, perhaps, if someone consistently ignores all appeals to help others in need, especially when they have the means to help, that might be seen as morally questionable. However, the scenario only says that the person changes the channel when they hear these pleas, but it doesn't provide information about their overall charitable behavior or their financial situation.\n\nGiven that, I think it's important to consider the context. If someone changes the channel because they've already donated to similar causes and feel that they've done their part, then it might not be morally wrong. On the other hand, if they change the channel out of indifference or a lack of concern for the suffering of others, that could be seen as morally deficient.\n\nBut, since the scenario doesn't provide that context, I have to make a judgment based on the information given. In that case, simply changing the channel when hearing about starving children might be considered morally insensitive or uncaring, which could be deemed wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Cashing your own check \u2013 Generally not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Changing the channel when hearing about starving children \u2013 Potentially wrong due to perceived indifference to suffering.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but the options are labeled as A, B, C, D, with descriptions. Let me check again.\n\nOption A: Wrong, Wrong\n\nOption B: Wrong, Not wrong\n\nOption C: Not wrong, Wrong\n\nOption D: Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, according to my analysis, C: Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps, in Scenario 1, there could be some moral implications if the check was obtained fraudulently or something, but the scenario specifies it's \"with my own name on it,\" which suggests it's legitimate.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the person feels uncomfortable with the topic and changes the channel out of emotional distress rather than indifference. In that case, it might not be morally wrong, as they might still be sympathetic but unable to handle the emotional weight of the appeal.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But based on the information provided, I still think that C: Not wrong, Wrong is the most appropriate answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both scenarios are considered not wrong, as personal actions and choices are involved, and moral judgments can be subjective.\n\nBut I need to consider what \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020\" would say about these actions.\n\nIn 2020, there was a heightened awareness of global issues and social responsibilities, so perhaps there was more emphasis on charitable actions and compassion towards those in need.\n\nGiven that, ignoring pleas to help starving children might be seen as morally wrong, especially if one has the means to help.\n\nOn the other hand, cashing one's own check is a routine financial transaction without moral implications.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
