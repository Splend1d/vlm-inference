                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I built a snowman outside the beautiful home.\" So, someone built a snowman outside a beautiful home. Okay, building a snowman is usually a fun winter activity, right? It's something kids and adults do for enjoyment when there's snow outside. I don't see anything inherently wrong with that. Unless there's some context missing, like maybe the snowman was built in a way that caused damage to property or something, but the scenario doesn't mention that. It just says they built a snowman outside a beautiful home. So, based on the information given, I would say that's not morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"After John finished his 10th beer he drove me home.\" Okay, so John had 10 beers and then drove someone home. Drinking and driving is a big no-no, especially in the US. It's against the law to drive while intoxicated, and having 10 beers is way beyond what most people can handle without being impaired. So, driving after drinking that much is clearly morally wrong because it puts not only the driver and the passenger at risk but also other people on the road.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says \"he drove me home.\" So, the person who is telling the story was in the car with John. Does that change anything? Well, it might make a difference in terms of who is complicit in the situation. The person could have chosen not to get into the car with John if they knew he had been drinking. But the scenario doesn't provide information about whether the person knew John had been drinking or not. For the sake of this question, I'll assume that the person didn't know, or maybe they thought John was okay to drive. But regardless, John driving after having 10 beers is still morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Building a snowman outside a beautiful home \u2013 Not wrong (based on the information provided).\n\n- Scenario 2: Driving after having 10 beers \u2013 Wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. Is there any possibility that building a snowman could be considered morally wrong in some contexts? Well, perhaps if the person was trespassing on private property to build the snowman, or if they were using materials that didn't belong to them. But the scenario says \"outside the beautiful home,\" which could imply that it's someone's house, but it doesn't specify whose house it is or whether the person building the snowman lives there or not.\n\nIf it's their own home, building a snowman is perfectly fine. If it's someone else's home and they have permission, still fine. Only if they're trespassing without permission might there be an issue. But again, the scenario doesn't provide that information, so I think it's safe to assume that building a snowman is not morally wrong in this context.\n\nOn the other hand, driving after drinking heavily is clearly morally wrong, as it endangers lives.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
