                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Gary and his farm animals. It says that Gary has 72 cows, and that he has 6 times as many cows as he has horses. And there's a number sentence given: 72 \u00f7 h = 6. I need to find out how many horses, h, Gary has. The options are 12, 66, 78, or 432 horses.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. Gary has 72 cows, and the number of cows is 6 times the number of horses. So, if I let h represent the number of horses, then the relationship is cows = 6 \u00d7 horses. In other words, 72 = 6h.\n\nLooking at the number sentence provided, it's 72 \u00f7 h = 6. That seems like another way of expressing the same relationship. Basically, when you divide the number of cows by the number of horses, you get 6, which aligns with the earlier statement that cows are 6 times horses.\n\nSo, to solve for h, I need to rearrange the equation to isolate h. Starting with 72 \u00f7 h = 6, I can multiply both sides by h to get 72 = 6h. Then, to solve for h, I can divide both sides by 6. So, h = 72 \u00f7 6.\n\nLet me calculate that: 72 divided by 6 equals 12. So, h = 12.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure I'm not missing anything here. The question is asking for the number of horses, and the options are A. 12 horses, B. 66 horses, C. 78 horses, D. 432 horses. Since 72 \u00f7 6 = 12, the answer should be 12 horses.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Perhaps using the number of cows and horses directly. If Gary has 72 cows and 6 times as many cows as horses, then yes, dividing 72 by 6 should give me the number of horses.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of proportions, the ratio of cows to horses is 6:1. So, for every 6 cows, there's 1 horse. Therefore, with 72 cows, the number of horses would be 72 \u00f7 6 = 12.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use algebra. If I let h = number of horses, then cows = 6h. Given that cows = 72, so 6h = 72. To find h, I divide both sides by 6: h = 72 \u00f7 6 = 12.\n\nI think this is consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the correct answer is 12 horses.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any trick or alternative interpretation of the problem. For example, maybe there are other animals on the farm that could affect the count, but the problem specifies only cows and horses. So, probably not.\n\nAlso, perhaps checking if the other options could be plausible in any way. Like, could there be a miscalculation leading to one of the other numbers?\n\nLet's see: if I mistakenly multiplied instead of dividing, say h = 6 \u00d7 72, that would be 432, which is option D. But that doesn't make sense because if cows are 6 times horses, then horses can't be larger than cows.\n\nSimilarly, if I added incorrectly, like 72 + 6 = 78, which is option C, but that doesn't follow from the given equation.\n\nAnd option B is 66 horses. Let's see, if h = 66, then cows = 6 \u00d7 66 = 396, which is not 72, so that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is A. 12 horses.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider units. Since both cows and horses are being counted in the same unit (animals), there's no issue with units canceling out or anything like that.\n\nAlso, considering the number sentence provided, 72 \u00f7 h = 6, and solving for h gives h = 72 \u00f7 6 = 12, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, after all these checks, I'm certain that the correct answer is 12 horses, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 12 \\text{ horses}} \\]"
