                    "text": "So I've got this question about the walls of the central complex of Great Zimbabwe. It says all of the following statements are true EXCEPT one, and I need to figure out which one is not true. The options are:\n\nA. They were built of over 1 million granite bricks.\n\nB. They exhibit sophisticated masonry.\n\nC. They stood 40 feet tall in places.\n\nD. The mortar that holds them together was made from ground up ocean shells.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what I know about Great Zimbabwe. I know that Great Zimbabwe was an ancient African civilization, and it's famous for its large stone structures. The central complex is probably one of the main parts of the site.\n\nLet me think about the walls. I remember that they were constructed without using any cement or steel, which is pretty impressive for their time. They used stone blocks fitted together perfectly, which is called ashlar masonry. So, option B says they exhibit sophisticated masonry, which seems to align with that. But I should double-check.\n\nOption A says they were built of over 1 million granite bricks. Hmm, I know that the structures at Great Zimbabwe are made of stone, and granite is a type of stone, so that could be possible. But I'm not sure about the exact number of bricks. Maybe it's an exaggeration or a rough estimate.\n\nOption C says they stood 40 feet tall in places. I recall that some of the walls at Great Zimbabwe are quite tall, but I'm not sure if they reach 40 feet. Maybe some parts do, but I need to verify that.\n\nOption D is about the mortar being made from ground up ocean shells. This one seems a bit odd. I know that traditional mortars were often made from materials like lime, sand, and water, or sometimes mud. But using ocean shells seems unusual, especially since Great Zimbabwe is inland in Zimbabwe, which is landlocked now. Maybe in ancient times, there was access to the sea, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait a minute, Zimbabwe is landlocked, meaning it's surrounded by other countries and doesn't have a coastline. So, getting ocean shells would be difficult unless they were traded from coastal regions. But that seems unlikely for construction material.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If they did use mortar made from ocean shells, that would mean they had to import the shells from somewhere with a coastline, like Mozambique or South Africa. But that seems like a lot of effort for mortar. Maybe they used local materials instead.\n\nI recall that in many ancient civilizations, mortar was made from locally available materials like limestone or other minerals that could be found nearby. Since Great Zimbabwe is located in a region with abundant stone, including granite and soapstone, it's possible they used locally sourced materials for mortar rather than importing ocean shells.\n\nMaybe the mortar was made from crushed stone or burned limestone, which were common practices in ancient times. Using ocean shells seems out of place here.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I'm starting to think that option D might be the incorrect statement.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. Over 1 million granite bricks \u2013 while the structures are made of stone, possibly granite, the number might be an estimate, but it's plausible.\n\nB. Sophisticated masonry \u2013 this seems accurate, as the walls are known for their intricate and precise construction.\n\nC. 40 feet tall in places \u2013 I'm less sure about this, but it's possible that some walls reached that height.\n\nD. Mortar made from ground up ocean shells \u2013 This seems the least likely, given the location and the practicality of obtaining ocean shells for construction purposes.\n\nI think the answer is D. The mortar that holds them together was made from ground up ocean shells.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
