                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out who owns the home after the woman died. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.\n\nFirst, the woman executed a will where she devised her farm to her nephew and bequeathed the residue of her estate to her niece. So, basically, the farm goes to the nephew, and whatever is left after that goes to the niece.\n\nThen, she lived on the farm for 12 years after making the will. After that, she sold the farm and used the money to buy a home in the city, where she lived until she died. She never changed her will during all this time.\n\nNow, after she died, her will was admitted to probate, and both the nephew and the niece are claiming ownership of the home. I need to determine who has the right to the home based on the will and the subsequent events.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\n\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\n\nC. The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.\n\nD. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to understand what each of these doctrines means and see which one applies to this situation.\n\nFirst, the doctrine of ademption. From what I recall, ademption is when a specific gift in a will no longer exists at the time of the testator's death. So, if someone leaves a specific item, like a piece of jewelry, and then sells it before they die, that specific bequest fails, and the beneficiary doesn't get anything in place of it. It's like the gift is adeemed, or canceled.\n\nIn this case, the woman devised her farm to her nephew. But then she sold the farm before she died. So, the farm doesn't exist anymore. Does that mean the devise to the nephew fails?\n\nWait a minute, she used the proceeds from the sale to buy a home. So, the value of the farm was transferred into the home. Does that mean the nephew has a claim to the home?\n\nOption A says the nephew owns the home because of the doctrine of ademption. But ademption usually means the gift fails, not that the beneficiary gets something else in its place. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nMaybe I need to look into ademption by extinction or ademption by sale. I think ademption by extinction is when the property is destroyed or no longer exists. Ademption by sale is similar, where the property is sold before death.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if the testator sells the property, and doesn't substitute anything else, the devise fails. But in this case, she did substitute the farm with another asset, the home.\n\nIs there something called ademption by substitution? Maybe if the testator buys something new with the proceeds, the new asset takes the place of the old one.\n\nI need to check that.\n\nLet me see. Suppose someone devises a specific piece of real estate to someone, then sells it and buys another piece of real estate with that money. Does the new real estate become the devise?\n\nI think it depends on the intent of the testator. If she intended to substitute the home for the farm in her will, then maybe the nephew has a claim to the home.\n\nBut she didn't change her will to reflect that. She left it as is, devising the farm to the nephew and bequeathing the residue to the niece.\n\nSo, if she sold the farm and bought the home, and didn't change her will, does the devise to the nephew fail, or does he get something else?\n\nMaybe the nephew gets nothing because the farm no longer exists. But option A says he gets the home because of ademption.\n\nThat seems contradictory. If ademption means the gift fails, why would he get the home?\n\nPerhaps there's a principle where, if the testator substitutes one asset for another, the beneficiary gets the substitute asset.\n\nIs that a thing?\n\nI need to check that.\n\nLet me see. Suppose I have a will that says, \"I devise my car to John,\" and then I sell the car and buy a boat with that money. Does John get the boat instead of the car?\n\nI think, generally, no. John would get nothing because the specific gift of the car no longer exists. That's ademption by extinction.\n\nBut maybe there are exceptions if the testator intended to substitute one asset for another.\n\nIn this case, the woman sold the farm and bought the home with the proceeds. Did she intend for the home to take the place of the farm in her will?\n\nI don't know. She didn't change her will to say so.\n\nMaybe the court would look at her actions and infer that she intended the home to be the substitute for the farm.\n\nBut that's speculative. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sale of the farm and purchase of the home are considered a conversion of assets, and the nephew still gets the value of the farm, which is now in the home.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nWait, maybe the doctrine of ademption doesn't apply here in the way option A suggests.\n\nLet me consider option B: the nephew owns the home because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\n\nEquitable estoppel is a legal principle that prevents someone from going back on their word if it would harm another person who relied on that word.\n\nHow does that apply here?\n\nDid the nephew do anything in reliance on the woman's will, or did she make any representations to him about getting the farm or the home?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any communications between them regarding the will or the farm.\n\nSo, it's hard to see how equitable estoppel applies here.\n\nMaybe the nephew relied on getting the farm and made plans based on that, but without knowing, it's unclear.\n\nOption C says the niece owns the home because of the doctrine of lapse.\n\nThe doctrine of lapse applies when a beneficiary predeceases the testator. In that case, the gift intended for that beneficiary passes to the residuary legatee.\n\nBut in this scenario, neither the nephew nor the niece predeceased the woman. They are both alive when she died.\n\nSo, the doctrine of lapse doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nOption D says the niece owns the home because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nThe residuary legatee is the person who gets the residue, or what's left after all the specific devises and bequests are satisfied.\n\nIn this case, the farm was devised to the nephew, and the residue to the niece.\n\nBut the farm was sold, and the proceeds were used to buy the home.\n\nSo, does the home become part of the residue?\n\nOr does the nephew still get something?\n\nWait, the farm was a specific devise, and it was sold before death, so the specific devise fails, and perhaps the proceeds from the sale become part of the residue.\n\nIn that case, the niece would get the home, since it was purchased with the proceeds of the farm's sale.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nBut option A suggests that the nephew gets the home because of ademption.\n\nI need to reconcile these ideas.\n\nLet me see if there's a principle that says when a specific devise is sold and replaced with another asset, the beneficiary of the specific devise gets the new asset.\n\nI don't think that's generally the case.\n\nUsually, if a specific devise is sold, and not replaced in the will, the devise fails, and the proceeds become part of the residue.\n\nBut maybe there are exceptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court would look at it as the nephew getting the value of the farm, which is now embodied in the home.\n\nBut that seems like an equitable adjustment, not a strict application of ademption.\n\nI need to think differently.\n\nMaybe the nephew has a claim to the home because it was purchased with the proceeds of the farm's sale, and thus the home is traceable to the farm.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the nephew can trace his interest in the farm to the home.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sale of the farm and purchase of the home are considered a conversion of assets, and the nephew still gets the farm's value, which is now in the home.\n\nBut again, that seems like an extension beyond strict ademption.\n\nI think the most straightforward application is that the devise to the nephew fails because the farm no longer exists, and the proceeds become part of the residue, which goes to the niece.\n\nTherefore, the niece owns the home.\n\nBut that contradicts option A, which says the nephew owns the home because of ademption.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check a legal source on ademption.\n\nUpon checking, ademption generally means that a specific devise fails if the property is not owned by the testator at death.\n\nIf the testator sells the property, the devise fails, and the beneficiary gets nothing unless there's a contrary intention expressed in the will.\n\nIn this case, there's no contrary intention; the will wasn't changed after the farm was sold.\n\nSo, the nephew doesn't get the farm because it doesn't exist anymore.\n\nTherefore, the home should be part of the residue, which goes to the niece.\n\nBut option A says the nephew gets the home because of ademption.\n\nThat doesn't make sense to me based on what I know about ademption.\n\nMaybe there's a different doctrine at play here.\n\nLet me consider whether the nephew has any equitable claim to the home.\n\nHe was supposed to get the farm, but the farm was sold and replaced with the home.\n\nPerhaps the nephew can argue that the home is the successor to the farm, and thus he should get the home.\n\nBut that seems like an argument based on equitable principles rather than strict ademption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a doctrine of ademption by benefit, where the beneficiary gets the benefit of the devise in some form.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nGiven the information I have, I think the most accurate answer is that the niece owns the home because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nThe sale of the farm and purchase of the home with the proceeds means that the home is part of the residue, which goes to the niece.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nBut since option A claims the nephew owns the home because of ademption, I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nPerhaps in some jurisdictions, ademption by substitution allows the beneficiary to get the substitute asset.\n\nBut I think that's the minority view.\n\nIn most places, if the specific devise is sold, and not replaced in the will, the devise fails.\n\nSo, unless there's a specific provision in the will addressing this situation, which there isn't, the nephew doesn't get the home.\n\nTherefore, the niece owns the home.\n\nSo, my final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
