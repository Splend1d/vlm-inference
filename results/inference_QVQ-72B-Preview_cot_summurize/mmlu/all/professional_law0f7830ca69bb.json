                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Calvin Poultry Co. offering to sell Chickenshop 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound, with specified delivery terms. Chickenshop accepted the offer but added a condition: \"We accept your offer for 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound per city scale weight certificate.\" I need to figure out which of the given options is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Calvin Poultry Co. made an offer to sell chicken at a certain price and with specific delivery terms. Chickenshop accepted the offer but specified that the weight should be determined by a city scale weight certificate. Now, I need to determine if this acceptance is valid and if a contract has been formed, and if so, on whose terms.\n\nI recall that in contract law, an acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer exactly. If the acceptance includes additional terms or changes to the original offer, it's considered a counteroffer, not an acceptance. This means that the original offer is rejected, and a new offer is made by the acceptor.\n\nIn this case, Chickenshop accepted the offer but added a condition regarding the weight certification. This seems like an additional term to the original offer. So, according to the mirror image rule, this would not be a valid acceptance; instead, it would be a counteroffer.\n\nBut wait, there might be exceptions or nuances here. For example, sometimes additional terms are considered mere proposals and don't necessarily turn the acceptance into a counteroffer. Also, there might be implied terms or industry standards that come into play.\n\nLet me think about the significance of the city scale weight certificate. It probably ensures that the weight is accurately measured by a neutral third party, which might be important for both sides to avoid disputes over the actual amount of chicken being sold.\n\nIs this condition something that would materially alter the terms of the original offer? If it's a standard practice in the industry, perhaps it's something that can be implied in the contract without explicitly agreeing to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a condition that's acceptable to Calvin Poultry Co., and they might not object to it.\n\nBut strictly speaking, by adding this condition, Chickenshop is modifying the original offer, which typically constitutes a counteroffer.\n\nSo, option C says that Chickenshop's reply constitutes a counteroffer and no contract was formed. That seems to align with my understanding.\n\nOption A says that a contract was formed on Calvin's terms. But if Chickenshop's acceptance is considered a counteroffer, then no contract has been formed yet.\n\nOption B says that Chickenshop's reply is a conditional acceptance but not a counteroffer. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. In contract law, a conditional acceptance is when the acceptor agrees to the offer but only if certain conditions are met. This is often treated as a rejection and a counteroffer.\n\nOption D says that a contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms. But that would require that Calvin Poultry Co. explicitly agreed to the additional condition, which isn't stated in the problem.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option C seems to be the correct answer: Chickenshop's reply constitutes a counteroffer and no contract was formed.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something about the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that applies here, especially since this involves the sale of goods.\n\nUnder the UCC, when businesses are involved (both parties are merchants), additional terms in an acceptance might become part of the contract unless they materially alter the original terms or the offeror objects to them.\n\nIn this case, the additional term is about the weight certification. Is this a material alteration? It might not be, if it's a standard practice in the industry and doesn't affect the price or quantity significantly.\n\nIf that's the case, under the UCC, this additional term might become part of the contract unless Calvin Poultry Co. objects to it.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify that both parties are merchants or that the UCC applies. It just says \"Calvin Poultry Co.\" and \"Chickenshop,\" without indicating their statuses.\n\nAssuming that both are merchants, under the UCC, the additional term might become part of the contract, and thus a contract might have been formed on terms that include the city scale weight certificate.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the UCC applying or the parties being merchants, I think it's safer to stick with the common law approach, where adding any new term constitutes a counteroffer, and no contract is formed until the original offeror accepts the new terms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Chickenshop's reply constitutes a counteroffer and no contract was formed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
