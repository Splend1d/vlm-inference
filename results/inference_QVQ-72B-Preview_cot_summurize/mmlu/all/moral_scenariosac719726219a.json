                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I lost my legs while serving in Iraq so I parked in the handicap parking spot.\" Okay, so this person has a disability\u2014specifically, they lost their legs. Handicap parking spots are designated for people with disabilities, right? So, parking in a handicap spot when you have a disability seems perfectly acceptable. But maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are rules about who can park in those spots or something. I should think about that.\n\nIn the US, handicap parking spots are typically reserved for individuals with disabilities that make it difficult for them to walk long distances or maneuver easily. Losing both legs would certainly qualify as a disability that affects mobility. So, from that perspective, parking in a handicap spot seems appropriate. Maybe the person is worried that others might think it's wrong because they don't have visible disabilities, but in reality, they do have a legitimate reason to use the spot. So, in this case, it seems like the person is not doing anything morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"The hospital signs told us to turn off all electrical devices, but I kept my phone on.\" Here, there's a clear instruction from the hospital to turn off all electrical devices, and the person chose to disregard that instruction by keeping their phone on. Hospitals have rules about electrical devices for good reasons, often related to patient safety. For example, some medical equipment can be interfered with by electronic devices, especially in the past with older equipment.\n\nBut it's 2020, and I wonder if hospitals still have strict rules about turning off electronic devices. Maybe with advancements in technology, modern hospitals have updated their policies. However, assuming that the signs are still there for a reason, and the person was instructed to turn off all electrical devices, keeping the phone on would be against those instructions.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, following rules in a hospital setting is crucial because it can directly impact patient safety. Disobeying such rules could potentially put others at risk, whether it's due to interference with medical equipment or other reasons. Therefore, keeping the phone on when told to turn off all electrical devices could be considered morally wrong, especially if it poses a risk to patients or hospital operations.\n\nPutting it all together, in Scenario 1, the person with a disability parks in a handicap spot, which is actually appropriate given their condition. In Scenario 2, the person disregards hospital rules about turning off electrical devices, which could potentially be risky and morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\" Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to this. In Scenario 1, is there any chance that parking in a handicap spot could be considered wrong? Well, some people might think that just because someone has a disability, they don't automatically get to use handicap spots, but that doesn't seem right. Actually, in many places, you need a disability placard or license plate to park in handicap spots, and presumably, someone who lost their legs would qualify for one. So, unless there's something I'm missing, it seems fine.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perhaps the person kept their phone on because they were expecting an important call or needed it for some urgent matter. However, even then, hospitals usually have provisions for such situations, like allowing patients or visitors to use their phones in designated areas or with certain precautions. But without that context, it still appears that the person knowingly disobeyed the hospital's rules, which could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
