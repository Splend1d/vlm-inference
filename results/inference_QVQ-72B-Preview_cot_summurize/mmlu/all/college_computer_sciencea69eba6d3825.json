                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a spell-checking program that uses a hash table. Let me try to understand how this works.\n\nFirst, there's a hash table where each entry is a Boolean variable initialized to false. Then, for every word in the dictionary, a hash function is applied to get an index, and the corresponding entry in the hash table is set to true.\n\nNow, when checking the spelling in a document, the same hash function is applied to each word in the document, and the hash table is checked to see if that entry is true or false.\n\nOption I says that true means the word was in the dictionary. That seems straightforward. If the hash of a word is true in the hash table, it means that word was in the dictionary when the hash table was built.\n\nOption II says that false means the word was not in the dictionary. Again, that seems logical. If the hash of a word is false, it means that word wasn't in the dictionary when the hash table was created.\n\nOption III says that the hash table size should increase with document size. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I think the hash table size is determined based on the dictionary size, not the document size. The dictionary is what's being used to build the hash table, so even if the document gets larger, the hash table shouldn't necessarily need to grow unless there are new words in the document that weren't in the dictionary.\n\nWait, but if the document contains words not in the dictionary, and the hash table is only built from the dictionary, then the hash table size shouldn't need to increase with the document size. It's the hash table's job to check if a word is in the dictionary, not to store words from the document.\n\nSo, based on that, I think Option I and Option II are correct, but Option III is not.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any scenario where the hash table size would need to increase with the document size? I don't think so. The hash table is based on the dictionary, which is fixed, unless the dictionary itself is being updated with new words from the document, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. I and II only.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Which of the following is (are) correct?\", and the options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. I and II only\n\nD. II and III only\n\nI think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
