This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a state that's the only one taxing the extraction of pitchblende, which is this mineral that's really important for uranium and stuff. Congress has passed a law saying no state can tax the extraction of pitchblende, and since only this one state does it, it's basically targeting that state. Now, I need to figure out whether this state's tax is valid or invalid based on the Constitution and this federal law.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Pitchblende is a mineral that contains uranium and radium, and it's crucial for atomic energy because it's a source of uranium 235, which can be used in nuclear reactors and weapons. So, it's a strategic material, not just any old mineral.\n\nThe state is taxing its extraction, which makes sense because states often tax the extraction of natural resources within their borders as a way to generate revenue. But now, Congress has stepped in and said no state can tax pitchblende extraction. Since only this one state does it, this law is effectively singling out that state.\n\nSo, the question is, is this federal law valid, and if so, does it override the state's tax?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing. If Congress is enacting a law forbidding the tax, and the Supremacy Clause says that federal law overrides state law, then shouldn't the state tax be invalid? But the option says invalid, but the reasoning seems mixed up. Let me think again.\n\nActually, if Congress is exercising its power over interstate commerce, which pitchblende likely is part of, then any state law that conflicts with the federal law should be invalid under the Supremacy Clause. So, if Congress says no tax on pitchblende extraction, and the state has a tax, that would be inconsistent with federal law, meaning the state tax should be invalid. So, option A seems to suggest it's invalid, which aligns with this reasoning.\n\nBut wait, option A says \"invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\" That seems correct, but the way it's phrased might be a bit confusing. Plenary power means full or complete power, so if Congress is using its full power over commerce, state laws that conflict would be void. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nOption B: Invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n\nHmm, the General Welfare Clause is part of the Preamble to the Constitution and is also referred to in Article I, Section 8, which gives Congress the power to lay taxes to provide for the general welfare. But does this give Congress the power to prohibit state legislation? Probably not directly. The General Welfare Clause is more about Congress's power to tax and spend for the nation's benefit, not about regulating state actions. So, this seems like a stretch. Maybe this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n\nWell, generally, states have the power to tax, but Congress can regulate interstate commerce, which might include taxation of items involved in interstate commerce. So, there might be cases where Congress can limit state taxation, especially if it affects interstate commerce unduly. So, this option seems too absolute. Probably not correct.\n\nOption D: Valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n\nThis is interesting. There's something called the \"equal footing doctrine,\" which generally holds that states should be treated equally by the federal government. However, in practice, Congress can often pass laws that affect only certain states or regions, especially if there's a valid constitutional basis. For example, if a state is unique in some way, Congress might pass laws that only apply to that state. So, in this case, since only one state taxes pitchblende, and pitchblende is only found in that state, it's not necessarily unequal treatment if Congress decides to regulate that specific activity. So, this option also seems unlikely.\n\nGiven this analysis, option A seems the most plausible. If Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and pitchblende is part of that commerce, then a state tax on its extraction could be seen as interfering with that commerce. Therefore, Congress could prohibit such a tax, and under the Supremacy Clause, any conflicting state law would be invalid.\n\nLet me double-check this. The Supremacy Clause states that the Constitution, treaties made under the authority of the United States, and federal laws passed pursuant to the Constitution are the supreme law of the land, and any state law that conflicts with them is invalid. So, if Congress passes a law saying no tax on pitchblende extraction, and the state has such a tax, the state tax would be invalid because it conflicts with federal law.\n\nMoreover, Congress has broad powers to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause, and that includes regulating the extraction and taxation of minerals that are part of interstate commerce. Pitchblende, being a strategic material, is likely involved in interstate commerce, possibly being sold to other states or exported.\n\nTherefore, the federal law prohibiting the state tax on pitchblende extraction is likely valid, and the state tax would be invalid due to the Supremacy Clause.\n\nWait a minute, but option A says \"invalid,\" meaning the state tax is invalid, which aligns with this reasoning. So, perhaps option A is the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's an argument that the state tax is valid for some reason.\n\nLet's consider that. If the state has been taxing pitchblende extraction, and Congress now says no, is there any basis for the state to argue that its tax is still valid?\n\nOne possible argument could be that pitchblende extraction is purely an intrastate activity, not affecting interstate commerce, and therefore beyond Congress's regulatory power. But given that pitchblende is a strategic material likely involved in interstate commerce, this argument seems weak.\n\nAnother argument might be that the tax is necessary for the state's revenue and that Congress cannot interfere with a state's ability to tax its own natural resources. However, this runs counter to the idea that Congress can regulate interstate commerce, including taxation that might burden such commerce.\n\nAdditionally, there might be arguments related to the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. But again, if Congress is acting within its Commerce Clause powers, the Tenth Amendment doesn't provide protection.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the state's tax on pitchblende extraction would be invalid due to the Supremacy Clause, as Congress has forbidden such taxation through its plenary power over interstate commerce.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
