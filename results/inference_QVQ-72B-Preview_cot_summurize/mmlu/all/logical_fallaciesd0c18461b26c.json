It says that when someone makes an argument and the only evidence they use to support their claim is the testimony that an authority figure believes the claim, what kind of fallacy is that? The options are:\n\nA. Questionable use of statistics\n\nB. Apple polishing\n\nC. Self-evident truths\n\nD. Argument from authority\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with \"questionable use of statistics\" \u2013 that sounds like when someone uses statistics that might not be reliable or are manipulated to support their point. But in this scenario, the person is using a testimony from an authority figure, not statistics. So, this probably isn't the right choice.\n\nNext, \"apple polishing\" \u2013 I think this refers to flattery or brown-nosing, like trying to impress someone in authority. But again, here we're dealing with using an authority figure's belief as evidence, which doesn't seem directly related to flattery.\n\nThen, \"self-evident truths\" \u2013 this sounds like something that's obviously true without needing proof. But in this case, the argument is relying on someone else's belief, not something that's inherently obvious.\n\nFinally, \"argument from authority\" \u2013 this seems the most fitting. It's when you use the opinion of an expert or authority figure as evidence to support a claim, without providing additional evidence.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. An argument from authority is a type of logical fallacy where the claim is deemed true because an expert or authority figure says it's true, rather than based on facts or evidence. This can be problematic because even experts can be wrong sometimes, and their authority doesn't automatically make a claim true.\n\nIn the scenario described, the only evidence presented is the testimony that an authority figure believes the claim. That fits the definition of an argument from authority.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any overlap with the other options.\n\nQuestionable use of statistics: This involves using statistical data in a misleading way, which isn't relevant here since no statistics are being used.\n\nApple polishing: This is more about flattery or seeking favor, which doesn't relate directly to using an authority figure's testimony as evidence.\n\nSelf-evident truths: These are statements that are true on their own, without needing evidence. But in this case, the claim isn't being presented as self-evidently true; it's being supported by someone else's belief.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Argument from authority.\n\nI should also remember that while an argument from authority can be a fallacy, there are times when appealing to authority is acceptable, especially when the authority is directly related to the subject matter and their expertise is relevant. However, in this specific question, it's presented as the only evidence, which makes it a fallacious argument.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D. Argument from authority is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
