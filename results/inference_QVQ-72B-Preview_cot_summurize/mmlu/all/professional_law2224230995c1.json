                    "text": "So I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding the enforceability of offers for the sale of widgets. The question is asking which of the four scenarios provided would not be enforceable if the seller changes his mind before acceptance. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles of contract law, particularly concerning offer and acceptance, and what makes an offer irrevocable. Generally, an offer can be revoked at any time before it's accepted, unless there's something that makes it irrevocable. So, the key here is to identify which of these options creates an irrevocable offer.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A merchant tells the buyer in writing that she will sell the widget for $35,000 and that the offer will be irrevocable for ten days.\n\nHmm, this seems relevant. There's a written statement saying the offer is irrevocable for ten days. In contract law, particularly in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which deals with sales of goods, there are rules about firm offers. I think there's a section in the UCC that allows a merchant to make a firm offer that is irrevocable without requiring consideration, provided it's in writing and specifies the irrevocability period.\n\nLet me double-check that. Yes, UCC Section 2-205 states that a merchant may make a firm offer that is irrevocable without consideration for a stated period of time, but not exceeding three months, if it's in writing and signed by the merchant. So, in this case, the merchant has stated in writing that the offer is irrevocable for ten days. That should make the offer binding for that period, meaning the seller cannot revoke it during those ten days.\n\nTherefore, if the seller changes his mind before acceptance during that ten-day period, the offer is still enforceable because it's irrevocable.\n\nOption B: A merchant writes to the buyer offering to sell the widget for $35,000.\n\nThis is a straightforward offer without any mention of irrevocability or any other conditions that would prevent revocation. So, in this case, the offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance. Therefore, if the seller changes his mind before the buyer accepts, the offer is not enforceable because it has been revoked.\n\nWait a minute, but in some jurisdictions, there might be implications of good faith or other doctrines that could affect this, but generally speaking, in contract law, an offer can be revoked before acceptance unless there's something that makes it irrevocable.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since there's no indication that the offer is irrevocable or that there's any consideration provided to make it binding, the offer is revocable, and the seller can change his mind before acceptance.\n\nOption C: A merchant telegraphs the buyer offering to sell the widget for $35,000 and promises to hold the offer open for ten days.\n\nHere, the offer is made by telegraph, which is an instantaneous means of communication, and the merchant promises to hold the offer open for ten days.\n\nI need to consider whether this promise to hold the offer open creates an irrevocable offer.\n\nIn contract law, generally, an offeror can make their offer irrevocable by providing consideration in exchange for the promise not to revoke the offer. This is known as option contract, where the offeree pays consideration to keep the offer open.\n\nHowever, in this case, there's no mention of any consideration being provided by the buyer to keep the offer open. The merchant is unilaterally promising to hold the offer open for ten days.\n\nDoes this promise, without consideration, make the offer irrevocable?\n\nGenerally, no. Promises without consideration are not binding in contract law. So, unless there's something else at play here, the seller can revoke the offer before acceptance, despite the promise to hold it open for ten days.\n\nBut, I recall that in the UCC, there's a provision that allows a merchant to make a firm offer that is irrevocable without consideration, provided it's in writing and specifies the irrevocability period.\n\nWait, but in option A, the offer was in writing, and here in option C, it's by telegraph, which is also a form of writing, I believe.\n\nBut, according to UCC Section 2-205, a firm offer must be in writing and signed by the merchant. A telegraph would likely qualify as a writing, and it's signed electronically, perhaps.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of telegraph communications in this context. Maybe I should look that up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the UCC considers telegraphs as writings for the purposes of firm offers.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then this offer would be irrevocable for ten days, similar to option A.\n\nBut, the question is testing which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes his mind before acceptance.\n\nIf option C is irrevocable, then changing his mind wouldn't be possible during the ten days, and the offer would be enforceable.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a difference between writing and telegraphing in terms of the UCC's requirements.\n\nLet me check that. UCC Section 2-205 requires the offer to be in writing and signed by the merchant. A telegraph can be considered a writing, and it's typically signed with the sender's name or initials.\n\nSo, assuming that's the case, option C should also be considered a firm offer, irrevocable for ten days.\n\nTherefore, if the seller changes his mind during that period, the offer is still enforceable.\n\nOption D: A merchant writes to the buyer offering to sell the widget for $35,000 and stating that the offer will be irrevocable for ten days if the buyer will pay $1.00. The buyer pays.\n\nHere, there's a condition attached to the irrevocability of the offer: the buyer must pay $1.00.\n\nThe buyer has paid the $1.00, as stated.\n\nThis seems like an option contract, where the buyer pays consideration to keep the offer open for a certain period.\n\nIn contract law, paying consideration in exchange for keeping an offer open makes the offer irrevocable during that period.\n\nSo, in this case, because the buyer has paid $1.00, the offer is irrevocable for ten days.\n\nTherefore, the seller cannot change his mind during that period, and the offer remains enforceable.\n\nNow, summarizing all the options:\n\n- Option A: Irrevocable offer due to UCC Section 2-205.\n\n- Option B: Revocable offer with no irrevocability clause.\n\n- Option C: Irrevocable offer due to UCC Section 2-205.\n\n- Option D: Irrevocable offer due to consideration provided by the buyer.\n\nTherefore, the only option where the offer is not enforceable if the seller changes his mind before acceptance is Option B, because it's a revocable offer without any irrevocability clause or consideration to make it binding.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn option C, is the telegraph considered a writing for the purposes of UCC Section 2-205?\n\nI think so, as it's a transmitted message that can be recorded and signed.\n\nTherefore, option C should indeed be irrevocable for ten days.\n\nOption D is clearly irrevocable due to the consideration provided.\n\nOption A is also irrevocable due to the writing and the merchant's status.\n\nOption B is just a plain offer without any irrevocability clause, so it's revocable.\n\nHence, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
