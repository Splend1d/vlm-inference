                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal puzzle. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a widower who dies on March 1, 1999, and leaves his property to both his co-worker and his boss \"as their community property.\" The co-worker and the boss are siblings and neither is married. The property includes a single-family house with a yard, garage, and driveway.\n\nNow, community property is typically something that's owned jointly by married couples in certain states, where each spouse owns half of the property acquired during the marriage. But here, the co-worker and the boss are not married to each other or to anyone else. So, it's a bit confusing how the term \"community property\" applies in this context.\n\nMaybe the widower intended for the siblings to hold the property as joint tenants or tenants in common. But he specifically devise it \"as their community property.\" Perhaps he wanted them to own it equally, with rights of survivorship, similar to community property in some jurisdictions.\n\nBut let's proceed. The boss dies intestate on May 1, 2001, and her daughter is her sole heir. During the boss's occupancy, she paid $3,500 annually in insurance and property taxes, and the property had a fair market rental value of $1,500 per year.\n\nAfter the boss's death, her daughter moves into the house on May 2, 2001, and as the administratrix of the boss's estate, she tries to collect from the co-worker half of the insurance and property taxes that the boss paid. The co-worker, however, claims no liability for those expenses and is advised by his attorney that the daughter doesn't own any interest in the property and that since the boss's death, the co-worker owns the entire property. The attorney also suggests that the daughter owes rent for her occupancy and would be liable for insurance and property taxes if she continues to live there.\n\nNow, in an action to determine the title of the property, the question is: what interest, if any, does the daughter have in the property?\n\nLet's consider the initial devise. The widower left the property to both his co-worker and his boss \"as their community property.\" Assuming that the siblings are not married to each other, this likely means they are to hold the property jointly with rights of survivorship, similar to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety in some jurisdictions.\n\nIn joint tenancy, when one joint tenant dies, their interest passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) by right of survivorship, avoiding probate. So, if the siblings held the property as joint tenants, upon the boss's death, the co-worker would automatically become the sole owner of the property.\n\nHowever, the daughter is the heir of the boss, who died intestate. If the siblings held the property as tenants in common, then the boss's share would pass to her heir, the daughter.\n\nBut the widower specified \"as their community property,\" which might imply joint ownership with rights of survivorship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the property was intended to be held in tenancy by the entirety, but since the siblings are not married to each other, that might not apply.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the property was held as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. In that case, upon the boss's death, the co-worker would inherit the entire property, and the daughter would have no interest.\n\nBut option B suggests that the daughter has an undivided one-half interest because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs. If the siblings were tenants in common, then yes, the boss's share would pass to her daughter.\n\nOption C mentions an undivided one-half interest because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition. But again, tenancy by the entirety typically applies to married couples, and these siblings are not married to each other.\n\nOption D says the daughter has an undivided whole interest because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part of the unit group that owns the whole. But that seems confusing. In a joint tenancy, each tenant owns the whole property, but upon death, the surviving tenant owns it entirely.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is A: none, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.\n\nBut let's double-check. If the siblings held the property as joint tenants, and the boss died, the co-worker would automatically inherit the entire property. Therefore, the daughter would have no interest.\n\nHowever, if the siblings were tenants in common, then the boss's share would pass to her heir, the daughter.\n\nThe key here is how the property was devised: \"as their community property.\" If that means they hold it jointly with rights of survivorship, then it's like joint tenancy, and the co-worker gets the whole property upon the boss's death.\n\nAlternatively, if \"community property\" was intended to mean they hold it as tenants in common, then the boss's share passes to her heir.\n\nGiven that they are not married, and community property typically applies to married couples, perhaps the widower intended for them to hold it as joint tenants.\n\nTherefore, the daughter has no interest in the property, and the co-worker owns the entire property by right of survivorship.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
