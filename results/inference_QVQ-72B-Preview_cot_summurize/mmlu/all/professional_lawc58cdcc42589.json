On the day of the robbery, the three participants drove to the store in a stolen van. In accordance with their plan, the defendant was to wait in the getaway van while the two men conducted their heist. While the two men were inside the store, the defendant decided to renounce his involvement and participation in the scheme and hurriedly drove away in the van. In his haste, the defendant failed to see a pedesthan jaywalking across the street, and struck and killed the pedestrian.\nB. A defendant, accompanied by his girlfriend, was attending his law school graduation party. Both the defendant and his girlfriend became highly intoxicated during the party celebration. As the defendant and his girlfriend were leaving the party, the defendant handed his girlfriend the keys to his automobile and directed her to drive home. While driving, the girlfriend suddenly swerved the car across the median strip into the path of an oncoming car, killing the driver of the other vehicle.\nC. A defendant, whose driver's license had been revoked one week previously, was driving on an infrequently traveled country road one night. Knowing that his car brakes were defective, the defendant was traveling at 35 m. p. h. in a zone in which the speed limit was 25 m. p. h. when a victim suddenly darted in front of his car. In an effort to avoid striking the victim, the defendant applied his brakes to no avail. The car struck and killed the victim.\nD. One afternoon a defendant was delivering pornographic materials to various adult bookstores in the community. In this jurisdiction, the delivery of pornographic materials constituted a misdemeanor. As the defendant was on his way to a book store for his final delivery of the day, he inadvertently struck a blind man who was crossing an intersection. Six months later, the blind man died as a result of injuries suffered in the accident.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about which scenario is most likely to result in a murder conviction for the defendant. There are four options, and I need to pick the one where the defendant is most likely guilty of murder. I should probably start by recalling what constitutes murder. Generally, murder is the unlawful killing of another person with malice aforethought, right? So, it's not just about causing someone's death, but doing so with intent or recklessness that shows a disregard for human life.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: This is about a robbery conspiracy where the defendant was supposed to be the getaway driver but decided to leave before the robbery took place and ended up hitting and killing a pedestrian while fleeing. Hmm, interesting. So, initially, there was a plan to rob a store, and the defendant was part of that plan, even if he wasn't directly involved in the robbery itself. But he changed his mind and left early, and in doing so, caused an accident that resulted in someone's death.\n\nI wonder if the initial intent to rob has any bearing on the murder charge here. Maybe there's something about felony murder rules, where if someone dies during the commission of a felony, like robbery, the participants can be charged with murder. But in this case, the defendant left before the robbery actually took place. So, maybe that changes things.\n\nHowever, he was still fleeing the scene of a crime, or at least a planned crime, and his reckless driving led to the pedestrian's death. Maybe that could be considered murder due to the recklessness and the connection to the initial criminal plan.\n\nOption B: Here, the defendant is at a law school graduation party with his girlfriend, and both are drunk. When they leave, he gives her the keys to drive, and she crashes the car, killing someone. So, in this scenario, it was his girlfriend who was driving and caused the accident.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Is the defendant being charged with murder for allowing his girlfriend to drive drunk, knowing that she was intoxicated? That seems a bit of a stretch. Maybe there's some negligence or accomplice liability here, but I'm not sure if it rises to the level of murder.\n\nPerhaps in some jurisdictions, if you hand over the keys to an intoxicated person who then causes a fatal accident, you could be charged with some form of vehicular homicide or involuntary manslaughter, but I doubt it would be murder.\n\nOption C: In this case, the defendant's driver's license was revoked, and he knew his car brakes were defective. He was driving over the speed limit when he hit and killed someone who darted in front of his car.\n\nSo, multiple issues here: driving with a revoked license, driving with known defective brakes, and speeding. All of these are illegal acts that could be seen as showing a reckless disregard for human life.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, this could be considered manslaughter or perhaps even second-degree murder, especially if the combination of these reckless acts is seen as manifesting a depraved indifference to human life.\n\nBut is it murder? I think it's possible, especially if the prosecution can argue that the defendant's actions showed a conscious disregard for the safety of others.\n\nOption D: Here, the defendant is delivering pornographic materials, which is a misdemeanor in this jurisdiction. While on his way to make a delivery, he inadvertently hits a blind man crossing the street, who later dies from injuries.\n\nSo, the defendant was engaged in an illegal activity at the time of the accident, but it was a misdemeanor, not a felony. And the accident was inadvertent; he didn't mean to hit the blind man.\n\nIn some legal systems, there's a concept called \"Watson doctrine\" or \"vehicle code violation resulting in death,\" which can lead to vehicular manslaughter charges if the driver was violating a vehicle code and caused a death as a result.\n\nBut for murder, I think there needs to be a higher level of intent or recklessness. Here, it seems like an accidental collision, even if the defendant was engaged in an illegal act at the time.\n\nSo, comparing all four options:\n\n- Option A: Defendant was part of a robbery conspiracy, left before the robbery but fled recklessly and killed a pedestrian.\n\n- Option B: Defendant allowed his girlfriend to drive drunk, and she caused a fatal accident.\n\n- Option C: Defendant drove with a revoked license, defective brakes, and over the speed limit, resulting in a fatal accident.\n\n- Option D: Defendant was delivering pornographic materials (misdemeanor) and accidentally hit and killed a blind man while driving.\n\nI need to pick the one where the defendant is most likely to be found guilty of murder.\n\nOption A involves a connection to a felony plan, even if the robbery hadn't yet occurred when the defendant left. Maybe the initial intent to rob could influence the charge, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption C involves multiple reckless actions: driving with a revoked license, defective brakes, and speeding. This seems like a strong case for murder, especially if the jurisdiction considers such reckless behavior as showing a depraved indifference to human life.\n\nOption B seems less likely to result in a murder conviction because the defendant wasn't the one driving, and allowing someone else to drive drunk might not rise to the level of murder.\n\nOption D is an accidental collision during a misdemeanor activity, which again seems more suited for manslaughter than murder.\n\nSo, between options A and C, I think option C is stronger for a murder charge because of the combination of reckless actions: driving with a revoked license, defective brakes, and speeding, all leading to a fatal accident.\n\nIn option A, the defendant was fleeing a crime scene but had decided to renounce his involvement in the robbery plan. Maybe that renunciation lessens his liability somewhat, though I'm not sure.\n\nBut in option C, the defendant's multiple reckless choices directly led to the fatal accident.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
