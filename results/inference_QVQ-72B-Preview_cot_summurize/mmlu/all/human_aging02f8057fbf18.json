Rorschach ink blot test\n\nD. McAdams test of levels\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an objective test of personality is. Generally, personality tests can be divided into two types: objective tests and projective tests. Objective tests are standardized measures that typically use multiple-choice questions or rating scales to assess personality traits or characteristics. They are usually quantitative in nature and can be scored and interpreted using established norms.\n\nOn the other hand, projective tests present ambiguous stimuli, like inkblots or pictures, and ask the person to interpret them. The idea is that the person will project their own thoughts, feelings, or desires onto the ambiguous images, revealing aspects of their personality.\n\nGiven that, I need to look at each option and determine which one is an objective test.\n\nOption A: TAT\n\nTAT stands for Thematic Apperception Test. I recall that this involves showing people ambiguous pictures or stories and asking them to tell a story about what's happening. It's often used to uncover underlying motives, feelings, and conflicts. This sounds more like a projective test because it relies on the person's interpretation of ambiguous stimuli.\n\nOption B: MMPI\n\nMMPI stands for Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. I've heard of this one; it's a widely used personality test. It consists of a large number of yes-or-no questions that are designed to assess a range of psychological traits and disorders. It seems very structured and standardized, which aligns with the definition of an objective test.\n\nOption C: Rorschach ink blot test\n\nThis is another well-known test where people look at inkblots and describe what they see. It's similar to the TAT in that it uses ambiguous images to elicit projections of the person's inner thoughts and feelings. Again, this seems more projective than objective.\n\nOption D: McAdams test of levels\n\nI'm not as familiar with this one. A quick search tells me that Dan McAdams is a personality psychologist who has proposed a theory of personality consisting of three levels: the personal narrative, the personality trait, and the life story. However, I couldn't find any specific reference to a \"McAdams test of levels.\" It might be a theoretical framework rather than a specific standardized test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the MMPI (Option B) seems to be the clear choice for an objective test of personality. It's standardized, uses a structured format, and is quantitatively scored, which are all characteristics of an objective test.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look up each option again to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nThematic Apperception Test (TAT): Projective test.\n\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI): Objective test.\n\nRorschach ink blot test: Projective test.\n\nMcAdams test of levels: Couldn't find evidence of this being a specific test; it might be more of a theoretical concept.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. MMPI.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
