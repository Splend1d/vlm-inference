Fomalhaut A*, and D. Sagittarius A*. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole at its center. I think it's called Sagittarius A*, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that the center of the Milky Way is in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, which makes sense because that's where the galaxy's core is from our perspective on Earth. So, maybe that's why it's called Sagittarius A*.\n\nLet me consider the other options. Altair is a star in the constellation Aquila, which is not near the galactic center. Fomalhaut is in the constellation Piscis Austrinus, which is also not near the center. And Alsephina A*\u2014well, I'm not familiar with that name at all. Maybe it's a made-up option?\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check. I remember learning about Sagittarius A* in astronomy class. It's a massive black hole at the heart of our galaxy, and astronomers have observed stars orbiting around it, which helps confirm its existence and mass.\n\nAltair A* might be confusing because Altair is a bright star, but it's not associated with a black hole that I know of. Similarly, Fomalhaut is another bright star, known for having a debris disk around it, but again, not related to the galactic center.\n\nAlsephina A* sounds like it might be a typo or a misremembered name. Maybe it's supposed to be something else?\n\nGiven all that, I think the correct answer is D. Sagittarius A*. That's the widely recognized name for the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any possibility that one of the other options could be correct. But no, I don't think so. Altair, Alsephina, and Fomalhaut are all individual stars, not black holes, and certainly not the central black hole of the Milky Way.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. Sagittarius A*.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Sagittarius A*}} \\]"
