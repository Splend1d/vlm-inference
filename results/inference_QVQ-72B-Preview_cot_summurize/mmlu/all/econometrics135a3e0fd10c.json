                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in the context of GARCH models are true. I'm not super confident with GARCH models yet, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nStarting with statement i): \"Maximum likelihood estimation selects the parameter values that maximize the probability that we would have actually observed the values of the series y that we actually did.\" That sounds familiar. ML is about finding the parameters that make the observed data most likely, right? So, yeah, that seems correct. I think this is a basic principle of ML estimation.\n\nMoving on to statement ii): \"GARCH models can only be estimated by ML and not by OLS.\" Hmm, I know that OLS is commonly used for linear regression models, but GARCH models are for volatility modeling in time series, especially in financial data. I recall that GARCH models are typically estimated using ML because they involve nonlinear relationships and conditional heteroskedasticity, which OLS isn't designed to handle directly. So, I think this statement is also correct.\n\nStatement iii): \"For estimation of a standard linear model (with no GARCH), the OLS and ML estimates for the slope and intercept parameters will be identical but the estimator for the variance of the disturbances is slightly different.\" Okay, so in the context of a standard linear regression model, under certain assumptions (like normality of errors), OLS and ML estimates for the coefficients are indeed the same. However, for the variance of the disturbances, I believe OLS uses a biased estimator unless adjusted, while ML typically provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance. So, they might differ slightly in practice, especially with small sample sizes. Therefore, this statement seems accurate.\n\nLastly, statement iv): \"Most computer packages use numerical procedures to estimate GARCH models rather than a set of analytical formulae.\" Yeah, that makes sense. GARCH models involve complex likelihood functions that don't have closed-form solutions, at least not in a straightforward manner. So, estimating GARCH parameters usually requires numerical optimization techniques, like quasi-Newton methods or gradient descent, which are implemented in various statistical software packages.\n\nSo, from what I can tell, all four statements seem to be true. But I'm a bit unsure about statement iii), especially regarding the variance estimator. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nLet me think about statement iii) again. In a standard linear regression model, if the errors are normally distributed, then the OLS estimators of the coefficients are indeed identical to the ML estimators. However, for the variance of the error term, OLS typically uses the residual sum of squares divided by (n - k - 1), which is an unbiased estimator, whereas the ML estimator divides by n, which is biased but can be more efficient. So, in practice, they differ slightly, which aligns with the statement.\n\nTherefore, I think all four statements are correct. So, the answer should be D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly summarize why each is correct:\n\ni) ML estimation maximizes the likelihood of observing the data, which is a fundamental concept in statistics.\n\nii) GARCH models require ML estimation due to their complexity and the nature of conditional heteroskedasticity.\n\niii) In linear regression, OLS and ML coefficient estimates are the same under normality, but variance estimates differ slightly.\n\niv) Numerical procedures are necessary for estimating GARCH models because analytical solutions are not feasible.\n\nYeah, I feel confident with this choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
