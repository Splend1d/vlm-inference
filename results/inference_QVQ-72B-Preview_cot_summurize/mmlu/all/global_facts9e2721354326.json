                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"As of 2015, what percentage of the global population over 15 years old was literate?\" And there are four options to choose from: A. 81%, B. 86%, C. 91%, D. 96%. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that literacy rates have been increasing over the years, especially with more access to education. But I'm not sure about the exact percentage for the year 2015. Maybe I can recall some data I've come across before.\n\nI think I remember that in the early 21st century, literacy rates were around 80-90%, but I'm not certain. Another thing I recall is that literacy rates vary significantly between countries, with some having very high rates and others much lower. But since the question is about the global population, I guess it's an average across all countries.\n\nLet me consider some factors that could influence the global literacy rate. For instance, advancements in education systems, compulsory education laws in many countries, and initiatives by international organizations to promote literacy might have driven the rates up. On the other hand, there are still many regions where access to education is limited, which might keep the global average lower than some might expect.\n\nMaybe I can look up some statistics to get a better idea. I know that the United Nations and other international bodies often track literacy rates. If I could find data from around 2015, that would be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the literacy rates of specific regions and try to estimate a global average based on population weights. For example, I know that in developed countries, literacy rates are very high, often above 95%. In some developing countries, literacy rates might be around 70-80%, and in least developed countries, they might be lower, perhaps around 50-60%.\n\nIf I consider the distribution of the global population, a large portion lives in developing countries, so that might pull the average down a bit. But with the significant progress made in education worldwide, the global literacy rate is probably higher than it was in previous decades.\n\nWait a minute, I think I recall that the global literacy rate for people aged 15 and above was around 86% in 2015. Let me see if that rings a bell. I think I might have seen that in a report or maybe in a class I took.\n\nTo double-check, I can try to recall if there are any landmark figures or recent statistics that mention this. I remember that in 2015, there was a lot of focus on education goals, like the Sustainable Development Goals, which aimed to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\n\nGiven that context, it's likely that literacy rates were quite high by then. So, option B. 86% seems plausible.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any data that suggests a higher or lower percentage. For example, if I consider that even in some parts of the world with lower literacy rates, there have been substantial improvements, maybe the global average is higher than 86%.\n\nHowever, I think that 86% is a reasonable estimate for the global literacy rate in 2015. So, I'll go with option B. 86%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 86\\%} \\]"
