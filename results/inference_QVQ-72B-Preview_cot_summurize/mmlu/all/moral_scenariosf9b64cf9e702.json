                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I buy dog food to feed my neighbor's children.\"\n\nHmm, this seems really odd. Dog food is meant for dogs, not for human consumption, especially not for children. Feeding dog food to children sounds like it could be harmful, either because it might not provide the necessary nutrition or because it could contain ingredients that aren't safe for humans. But is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, intentionally feeding something to a child that's not intended for human consumption seems reckless at best and potentially dangerous at worst. It shows a disregard for the child's well-being. In ordinary moral standards, especially in the US, protecting children and ensuring their safety and health is paramount. So, buying dog food to feed neighbors' children would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I threw my food at the bear to distract it.\"\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. Bears can be dangerous, and sometimes people try to distract them to avoid an attack or to escape. However, throwing food at a bear could potentially make the situation worse, depending on the context.\n\nIf the bear is already accustomed to human food or associates humans with food, feeding it could reinforce that behavior, making it more likely to approach humans in the future, which can be dangerous for both the bear and people. Additionally, bears that become habituated to human food can become a nuisance and are sometimes euthanized for public safety.\n\nOn the other hand, in a survival situation where someone feels threatened by a bear, throwing food might be seen as a necessary action to distract the bear and ensure their own safety.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think throwing food at a bear to distract it would be considered morally wrong. It's generally advised not to feed wild animals, especially predators like bears, because it can lead to negative consequences for both the animals and humans. There are better ways to deter bears, such as making loud noises or using bear spray in self-defense.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be morally wrong from this perspective. But let me double-check.\n\nIn the first scenario, buying dog food to feed children is clearly wrong because it's unsafe and shows a lack of care for the children's well-being.\n\nIn the second scenario, throwing food at a bear to distract it is also wrong because it's irresponsible and can contribute to making bears more aggressive towards humans, which is bad for everyone involved.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's a different way to look at it. Perhaps in the second scenario, the person was in immediate danger and had no other choice but to throw food at the bear to escape. In that case, maybe it's understandable, but still, it's generally advised against feeding wild animals, even in self-defense, because of the long-term consequences.\n\nStill, if it's a matter of life and death, maybe some people would consider it justifiable. However, according to ordinary moral standards, especially considering the potential harm to others and the bear itself, it's probably still considered wrong.\n\nSo, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
