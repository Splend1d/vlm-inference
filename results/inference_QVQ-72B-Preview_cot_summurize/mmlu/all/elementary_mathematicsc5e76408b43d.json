                    "text": "Let's see. The vice president took a client out to lunch, and the lunch cost $44. She gave a 20% tip. I need to find out how much money she spent in total on lunch. So, total cost is the cost of the meal plus the tip, right?\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the tip amount. The tip is 20% of the lunch cost. So, 20% of $44. To find 20% of a number, I can multiply the number by 0.20. So, $44 times 0.20.\n\nLet me calculate that: 44 multiplied by 0.20. Well, 40 times 0.20 is 8, and 4 times 0.20 is 0.8, so total tip is $8.80.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the lunch and the tip. So, $44 plus $8.80. Let's add those together: 44 plus 8 is 52, and 0.80 is already included in that, so the total is $52.80.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $8.80\n\nB. $35.20\n\nC. $52.80\n\nD. $53.80\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the correct answer should be C. $52.80.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the lunch cost: $44. Tip is 20% of that, which is $8.80. Adding them up: 44 plus 8.80 is indeed 52.80. Seems correct.\n\nMaybe another way to look at it: I could calculate the total cost as the lunch plus the tip. So, total = lunch + (lunch * 20%). That's lunch * (1 + 0.20) = lunch * 1.20. So, $44 times 1.20.\n\nLet me try that method: 44 times 1.20. First, 44 times 1 is 44, and 44 times 0.20 is 8.80, so again, total is $52.80.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be extra sure, I could consider the tip amount and add it manually. Tip is 20% of $44. 20% is the same as one-fifth. So, one-fifth of $44 is $8.80. Adding that to the lunch cost: $44 + $8.80 = $52.80.\n\nI think I've confirmed it in multiple ways, and I'm pretty confident now that the correct answer is C. $52.80.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other way to interpret the question. It says, \"how much money did she spend on lunch?\" That should be the cost of the lunch plus the tip she gave. So, $44 plus $8.80 is indeed $52.80.\n\nNo, there doesn't seem to be any trick or alternative interpretation here. It's a straightforward calculation.\n\nAlright, I'm satisfied with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ \\$52.80} \\]"
