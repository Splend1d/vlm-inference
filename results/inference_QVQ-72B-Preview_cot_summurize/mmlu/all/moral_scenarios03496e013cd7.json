                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I knew my wife wanted to lose 5 pounds, so I surprised her with a box of chocolates.\n\nHmm, okay. So, my wife wants to lose weight, and I give her chocolates. Chocolates are usually high in calories and sugar, which might not help her weight loss goal. Maybe I was trying to be nice by surprising her, but it seems like it could be counterproductive to her desire to lose weight. But is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, intentions matter in morality, right? I was probably trying to do something nice by giving her something I thought she'd like or to show appreciation. However, knowing that she wants to lose weight, maybe I should have considered that chocolates could tempt her or make it harder for her to stick to her diet. Maybe it's not the best gift in that situation.\n\nBut is it wrong? It seems more like a lack of consideration for her goals rather than something malicious. Maybe it's a thoughtless act, but not necessarily morally wrong. Unless, of course, I knew she was struggling with her diet and deliberately tried to sabotage her efforts, but the scenario doesn't suggest that. It just says I surprised her with chocolates without considering her weight loss goal.\n\nSo, for scenario one, I'm leaning towards \"not wrong,\" but I need to think more about it.\n\nSecond scenario: I got a permit to bring a gun into the classroom in case I needed to discipline the students.\n\nOkay, this is heavier. Bringing a gun into a classroom for discipline purposes. That sounds pretty extreme. Guns are dangerous, and classrooms are places for learning, not for weapons. Using a gun for discipline seems totally inappropriate.\n\nBut wait, the person got a permit, which means they followed the law to carry the gun. Legally, they have the right to bring it, but morally, is it acceptable?\n\nIn many places in the US, there are discussions about arming teachers for safety reasons, like protecting against potential active shooters. But that's a different context from using it for discipline.\n\nDiscipline in a classroom usually involves managing student behavior, like following rules, respecting others, etc. It's hard to see how a gun would be necessary or appropriate for that.\n\nUsing a gun as a threat for discipline sounds coercive and potentially traumatic for students. It could create a fearful environment, which isn't conducive to learning.\n\nMoreover, having a gun in a classroom could pose risks of accidental discharge, or it might fall into the wrong hands.\n\nSo, even if the person has a permit, bringing a gun into a classroom for discipline seems morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause and the inappropriate use of weapons for educational purposes.\n\nNow, going back to scenario one, giving chocolates to someone who wants to lose weight might be inconsiderate, but it's not on the same level of moral wrongness as bringing a gun into a classroom for discipline.\n\nComparing the two, scenario one is more of a minor lapse in judgment, while scenario two involves a serious moral issue related to safety and appropriate use of force.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario one is \"not wrong,\" and scenario two is \"wrong.\"\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
