                    "text": "Let's see what this question is about. It mentions Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect, which I remember has to do with how light can eject electrons from a metal surface under certain conditions. So, light of variable frequency shines on a metal surface, and we're supposed to predict what Einstein's theory says about this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the photoelectric effect is. It's when light shines on a metal and knocks electrons out of it, but only if the frequency of the light is above a certain threshold, which is specific to each metal. This threshold frequency corresponds to the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal, called the work function.\n\nEinstein's explanation involved the idea that light comes in packets of energy called photons, and each photon can transfer its energy to an electron. The energy of a photon is given by the equation E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the light.\n\nSo, if the energy of the photon, hf, is greater than or equal to the work function, \u03c6, of the metal, then the electron can be ejected. The kinetic energy of the ejected electron is then KE = hf - \u03c6.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. The work function is a property of the metal and doesn't depend on the frequency of the light. Different metals have different work functions, but for a given metal, the work function is constant, regardless of the light frequency.\n\nB. Work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength.\n\nAgain, the work function is a characteristic of the metal, not the light. Wavelength is related to frequency by c = \u03bbf, where c is the speed of light. Since the work function is constant for a given metal, it shouldn't be proportional to the wavelength.\n\nC. Current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength.\n\nHmm, current in the photoelectric tube is related to the number of electrons ejected, which depends on the intensity of the light and the properties of the metal. Wavelength is related to frequency, and frequency affects whether electrons are ejected or not. But I don't think current is linearly proportional to wavelength. In fact, current should increase with intensity, not necessarily with wavelength.\n\nD. Potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nThis sounds promising. The stopping potential, which is the potential difference needed to prevent the most energetic electrons from reaching the collector, is related to the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.\n\nFrom Einstein's equation, KE = hf - \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the work function.\n\nThe stopping potential, V\u2080, is related to the kinetic energy by KE = eV\u2080, where e is the elementary charge.\n\nSo, eV\u2080 = hf - \u03c6.\n\nRearranged, V\u2080 = (hf - \u03c6)/e.\n\nThis looks like a linear relationship between V\u2080 and f, with slope h/e and y-intercept -\u03c6/e.\n\nSo, V\u2080 = (h/e)f - \u03c6/e.\n\nThis suggests that stopping potential is linearly proportional to the frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nWait, but the threshold frequency is the minimum frequency that can eject electrons, corresponding to f = \u03c6/h.\n\nSo, for f > f\u2080, where f\u2080 is the threshold frequency, the stopping potential should be linearly related to f.\n\nDoes this mean that option D is correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nOption D says: the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nYes, that matches what I just derived. Stopping potential V\u2080 is linear in frequency f, above the threshold frequency f\u2080.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Option A: No, work function is constant for a given metal.\n\n- Option B: No, work function is not related to wavelength.\n\n- Option C: No, current is related to intensity, not linearly to wavelength.\n\n- Option D: Yes, stopping potential is linearly related to frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
