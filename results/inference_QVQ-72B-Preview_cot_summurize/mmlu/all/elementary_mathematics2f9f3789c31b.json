                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says that two whole numbers have a least common multiple (LCM) of 60, and each number is less than or equal to 12. Also, the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers is 2. I need to find out what those two numbers are, and there are options provided: A. 6 and 10, B. 5 and 12, C. 10 and 12, D. 12 and 15.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what LCM and GCF mean. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that both of them divide evenly into. The GCF is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nSo, according to the problem, the LCM is 60, and the GCF is 2. Also, both numbers are less than or equal to 12.\n\nI should probably check each option to see which pair satisfies these conditions.\n\nLet's start with option A: 6 and 10.\n\nFirst, check if their LCM is 60. To find the LCM of 6 and 10, I can list the multiples of each:\n\nMultiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, ...\n\nMultiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, ...\n\nThe smallest common multiple is 30, not 60. So, their LCM is 30, which doesn't match the required 60. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nNext, option B: 5 and 12.\n\nFirst, check if their LCM is 60.\n\nMultiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, ...\n\nMultiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ...\n\nThe smallest common multiple is 60. So, their LCM is 60, which matches the required condition.\n\nNow, check if their GCF is 2.\n\nTo find the GCF of 5 and 12, I can list the factors of each:\n\nFactors of 5: 1, 5\n\nFactors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nThe common factors are just 1. So, the GCF is 1, which does not match the required GCF of 2.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect, even though their LCM is 60, because the GCF is not 2.\n\nMoving on to option C: 10 and 12.\n\nFirst, check the LCM.\n\nMultiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, ...\n\nMultiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ...\n\nThe smallest common multiple is 60.\n\nSo, their LCM is 60.\n\nNow, check the GCF.\n\nFactors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10\n\nFactors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nThe common factors are 1 and 2. The largest common factor is 2.\n\nSo, the GCF is 2, which matches the required condition.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to satisfy both conditions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check option D: 12 and 15.\n\nFirst, check the LCM.\n\nMultiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ...\n\nMultiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, ...\n\nThe smallest common multiple is 60.\n\nSo, their LCM is 60.\n\nNow, check the GCF.\n\nFactors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nFactors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15\n\nThe common factors are 1 and 3. The largest common factor is 3.\n\nSo, the GCF is 3, which does not match the required GCF of 2.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option C: 10 and 12.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"each number is less than or equal to 12.\" Both 10 and 12 are less than or equal to 12, so that checks out.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another pair of numbers less than or equal to 12 that have an LCM of 60 and a GCF of 2.\n\nLet me think about another possible pair.\n\nSuppose one number is 8 and the other is 15.\n\nWait, but 15 is greater than 12, so that doesn't work.\n\nWhat about 6 and 20?\n\n20 is greater than 12.\n\nHow about 4 and 15?\n\n15 is greater than 12.\n\nIs there any other pair where both numbers are less than or equal to 12, with LCM 60 and GCF 2?\n\nLet me try 12 and 12.\n\nLCM of 12 and 12 is 12, which is not 60.\n\n12 and 10, which we already checked.\n\n12 and 8: LCM is 24, GCF is 4.\n\n12 and 6: LCM is 12, GCF is 6.\n\n12 and 4: LCM is 12, GCF is 4.\n\n12 and 2: LCM is 12, GCF is 2.\n\nWait, 12 and 2: LCM is 12, which is not 60, and GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n12 and 1: LCM is 12, GCF is 1.\n\nNot matching.\n\n10 and 8: LCM is 40, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n10 and 6: LCM is 30, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n10 and 4: LCM is 20, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n10 and 2: LCM is 10, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n10 and 1: LCM is 10, GCF is 1.\n\nNot matching.\n\n8 and 6: LCM is 24, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n8 and 4: LCM is 8, GCF is 4.\n\nNot matching.\n\n8 and 2: LCM is 8, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n8 and 1: LCM is 8, GCF is 1.\n\nNot matching.\n\n6 and 4: LCM is 12, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n6 and 2: LCM is 6, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n6 and 1: LCM is 6, GCF is 1.\n\nNot matching.\n\n4 and 2: LCM is 4, GCF is 2.\n\nNot matching.\n\n4 and 1: LCM is 4, GCF is 1.\n\nNot matching.\n\n2 and 1: LCM is 2, GCF is 1.\n\nNot matching.\n\nSo, from this exhaustive list, the only pair of numbers less than or equal to 12 that have an LCM of 60 and a GCF of 2 is 10 and 12.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 10 and 12.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that both numbers are less than or equal to 12, but in option D, one number is 15, which is greater than 12, so that's invalid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other pairs where one number is greater than 12, but the problem specifies that both numbers are less than or equal to 12.\n\nSo, no need to consider those.\n\nHence, the answer is C. 10 and 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
