                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: the curve defined by x^3 + xy - y^2 = 10 has a vertical tangent line when x equals what? And there are some options provided: A. 0 or \u20131/3, B. 1.037, C. 2.074, D. 2.096.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means for a curve to have a vertical tangent line. A vertical tangent line means that the slope of the tangent is undefined, which typically happens when the derivative dy/dx is infinite. In terms of the derivative, this corresponds to the case where the denominator of dy/dx is zero.\n\nSo, I should find dy/dx for the curve x^3 + xy - y^2 = 10 and determine when the denominator is zero.\n\nOkay, to find dy/dx, I'll use implicit differentiation. Let's differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x.\n\nStarting with x^3: the derivative is 3x^2.\n\nNext, xy: this is a product of x and y, so I need to use the product rule. That gives y + x dy/dx.\n\nThen, -y^2: again, y is a function of x, so the derivative is -2y dy/dx.\n\nAnd the right side is a constant, 10, which differentiates to zero.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n3x^2 + y + x dy/dx - 2y dy/dx = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve for dy/dx. Let's collect terms involving dy/dx on one side.\n\nSo, x dy/dx - 2y dy/dx = -3x^2 - y\n\nFactor dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx (x - 2y) = -3x^2 - y\n\nTherefore, dy/dx = (-3x^2 - y) / (x - 2y)\n\nNow, a vertical tangent occurs when dy/dx approaches infinity, which happens when the denominator is zero (provided the numerator isn't zero at the same time, but in this case, since we're dealing with a curve, it's possible that both could be zero at certain points, but we'll check that later).\n\nSo, set the denominator equal to zero:\n\nx - 2y = 0 \u2192 x = 2y\n\nNow, I need to substitute x = 2y back into the original curve equation to find the corresponding y-values.\n\nSo, plug x = 2y into x^3 + xy - y^2 = 10:\n\n(2y)^3 + (2y)(y) - y^2 = 10\n\nCalculate (2y)^3: that's 8y^3\n\nThen, 2y * y = 2y^2\n\nAnd -y^2\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n8y^3 + 2y^2 - y^2 = 10\n\nSimplify the y^2 terms: 2y^2 - y^2 = y^2\n\nSo, 8y^3 + y^2 = 10\n\nLet's move all terms to one side:\n\n8y^3 + y^2 - 10 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this cubic equation for y. This looks tricky because it's not immediately factorable. Maybe I can try to find rational roots using the rational root theorem.\n\nAccording to the rational root theorem, any possible rational root, p/q, is such that p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient.\n\nSo, possible p values are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110\n\nPossible q values are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b18\n\nSo, possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b11/2, \u00b11/4, \u00b11/8, \u00b12/1, \u00b15/1, \u00b110/1, etc.\n\nLet's test y = 1:\n\n8(1)^3 + (1)^2 - 10 = 8 + 1 - 10 = -1 \u2260 0\n\ny = -1:\n\n8(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 - 10 = -8 + 1 - 10 = -17 \u2260 0\n\ny = 2:\n\n8(8) + 4 - 10 = 64 + 4 - 10 = 58 \u2260 0\n\ny = -2:\n\n8(-8) + 4 - 10 = -64 + 4 - 10 = -70 \u2260 0\n\ny = 1/2:\n\n8*(1/8) + (1/4) - 10 = 1 + 0.25 - 10 = -8.75 \u2260 0\n\ny = -1/2:\n\n8*(-1/8) + (1/4) - 10 = -1 + 0.25 - 10 = -10.75 \u2260 0\n\ny = 5:\n\n8(125) + 25 - 10 = 1000 + 25 - 10 = 1015 \u2260 0\n\ny = -5:\n\n8(-125) + 25 - 10 = -1000 + 25 - 10 = -1005 \u2260 0\n\ny = 10:\n\n8(1000) + 100 - 10 = 8000 + 100 - 10 = 8100 \u2260 0\n\ny = -10:\n\n8(-1000) + 100 - 10 = -8000 + 100 - 10 = -8010 \u2260 0\n\nHmm, none of these rational roots work. Maybe there are no rational roots, or perhaps I missed some.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use numerical methods to approximate the real roots.\n\nLet me consider the function f(y) = 8y^3 + y^2 - 10\n\nI can try to find where f(y) = 0.\n\nLet's try y = 1.2:\n\nf(1.2) = 8*(1.728) + 1.44 - 10 = 13.824 + 1.44 - 10 = 5.264 \u2260 0\n\ny = 1.1:\n\n8*(1.331) + 1.21 - 10 = 10.648 + 1.21 - 10 = 1.858 \u2260 0\n\ny = 1.05:\n\n8*(1.157625) + 1.1025 - 10 = 9.261 + 1.1025 - 10 = 0.3635 \u2260 0\n\ny = 1.04:\n\n8*(1.124864) + 1.0816 - 10 = 8.998912 + 1.0816 - 10 = 0.080512 \u2260 0\n\ny = 1.037:\n\n8*(1.10550169) + 1.075069 - 10 \u2248 8.84401352 + 1.075069 - 10 \u2248 -0.0809 \u2248 0\n\nWait, that's close to zero. So y \u2248 1.037 might be a root.\n\nSimilarly, option B is 1.037, which matches this approximation.\n\nLet me check y = 1.037:\n\n8*(1.037)^3 + (1.037)^2 - 10 \u2248 8*(1.112) + 1.075 - 10 \u2248 8.896 + 1.075 - 10 \u2248 -0.029 \u2248 0\n\nClose, but not exactly zero. Maybe y = 1.037 is a good approximation.\n\nNow, since x = 2y, then x \u2248 2*1.037 \u2248 2.074, which is option C.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the x-value when there's a vertical tangent. So, if y \u2248 1.037, then x \u2248 2.074.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is 2.074, and option B is 1.037.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"when x =\", and gives options in terms of x, but from our work, we found y \u2248 1.037 and x \u2248 2.074.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is x \u2248 2.074, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple points where the tangent is vertical.\n\nLet me check if there are other real roots for y.\n\nFrom f(y) = 8y^3 + y^2 - 10, it's a cubic function, which can have up to three real roots. But from the rational root theorem and our numerical approximations, it seems there's only one real root around y \u2248 1.037.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other real roots that are not easily found numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that x = 2y, and substitute back into the original equation to solve for y.\n\nWait, I already did that, and found y \u2248 1.037.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the discriminant or other properties of the cubic equation, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that x = 2y, and substitute back into the original equation to solve for y.\n\nWait, I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the derivative expression again.\n\nWait, dy/dx = (-3x^2 - y)/(x - 2y)\n\nAnd we set the denominator to zero: x - 2y = 0 \u2192 x = 2y\n\nThen, substitute x = 2y into the original equation: x^3 + xy - y^2 = 10\n\nSo, (2y)^3 + (2y)(y) - y^2 = 10 \u2192 8y^3 + 2y^2 - y^2 = 10 \u2192 8y^3 + y^2 - 10 = 0\n\nNow, perhaps I can use numerical methods like Newton's method to find a more accurate value of y.\n\nNewton's method formula is y_{n+1} = y_n - f(y_n)/f'(y_n)\n\nGiven f(y) = 8y^3 + y^2 - 10, then f'(y) = 24y^2 + 2y\n\nLet's take an initial guess y_0 = 1.037\n\nThen, y_1 = y_0 - [8*(1.037)^3 + (1.037)^2 - 10] / [24*(1.037)^2 + 2*1.037]\n\nCalculate (1.037)^3 \u2248 1.10550169\n\nSo, 8*1.10550169 \u2248 8.84401352\n\n(1.037)^2 \u2248 1.075069\n\nSo, f(y_0) \u2248 8.84401352 + 1.075069 - 10 \u2248 -0.0809\n\nf'(y_0) \u2248 24*(1.037)^2 + 2*1.037 \u2248 24*1.075069 + 2.074 \u2248 25.801656 + 2.074 \u2248 27.875656\n\nTherefore, y_1 \u2248 1.037 - (-0.0809)/27.875656 \u2248 1.037 + 0.0029 \u2248 1.04\n\nNow, let's check y = 1.04:\n\nf(1.04) = 8*(1.04)^3 + (1.04)^2 - 10 \u2248 8*1.124864 + 1.0816 - 10 \u2248 8.998912 + 1.0816 - 10 \u2248 0.080512 \u2260 0\n\nStill not zero, but closer.\n\nRepeat Newton's method:\n\ny_2 = y_1 - f(y_1)/f'(y_1)\n\nf(y_1) \u2248 0.080512\n\nf'(y_1) \u2248 24*(1.04)^2 + 2*1.04 \u2248 24*1.0816 + 2.08 \u2248 25.9584 + 2.08 \u2248 28.0384\n\nSo, y_2 \u2248 1.04 - 0.080512/28.0384 \u2248 1.04 - 0.0029 \u2248 1.037\n\nSo, it's oscillating around y \u2248 1.037\n\nTherefore, y \u2248 1.037, and x \u2248 2*1.037 \u2248 2.074, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, the options include A. 0 or \u20131/3, which seems unrelated to this value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other points where the denominator is zero, but in this case, it seems only y \u2248 1.037 satisfies the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider complex roots, but since we're dealing with real variables, only real roots are relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that x = 2y is the only solution.\n\nWait, x - 2y = 0 implies x = 2y, but perhaps there are other ways the denominator can be zero.\n\nWait, the denominator is x - 2y, and we set it to zero, leading to x = 2y.\n\nBut maybe there are other points where the numerator is also zero, which would make dy/dx undefined.\n\nWait, in the expression dy/dx = (-3x^2 - y)/(x - 2y), if both numerator and denominator are zero, then dy/dx is indeterminate, not necessarily infinite.\n\nBut in the context of implicit curves, a vertical tangent typically occurs when the denominator is zero and the numerator isn't zero at that point.\n\nSo, in this case, since x = 2y, and plugging back into the numerator:\n\n-3x^2 - y = -3*(2y)^2 - y = -3*4y^2 - y = -12y^2 - y\n\nAt y \u2248 1.037, -12*(1.037)^2 - 1.037 \u2248 -12*1.075069 - 1.037 \u2248 -12.900828 - 1.037 \u2248 -13.937828 \u2260 0\n\nSo, the numerator isn't zero when the denominator is zero, which confirms that dy/dx approaches infinity at this point, indicating a vertical tangent.\n\nTherefore, the only real solution is y \u2248 1.037, and thus x \u2248 2.074, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let's check if there are any other real solutions.\n\nLooking back at the cubic equation 8y^3 + y^2 - 10 = 0, it's clear that it has one real root and two complex conjugate roots.\n\nSo, only one real value of y, and thus one real value of x where the tangent is vertical.\n\nTherefore, the answer is x \u2248 2.074, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
