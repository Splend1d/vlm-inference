Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.\nB. The plaintiff will prevail unless denial of membership to women can be justified by some \"compelling interest,\" since such discrimination is \"suspect\" and requires the strictest equal protection test.\nC. The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.\nD. The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which statement is the most accurate regarding the outcome of this case. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a county with a big, scenic lake that's great for fishing and boating. The county leased part of the lake and the park around it to a company owned by the most prominent family in the area. This company built a yacht club with a bar, restaurant, and private marina, and according to the lease, it's supposed to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent.\n\nNow, the yacht club is only for members, and there are bylaws that allow the membership committee to set strict \"standards\" and decide on membership fees and dues. The problem is, the committee has a policy of only approving men's applications and denying all women's applications. So, basically, no women can join this club.\n\nA woman from the county applied for membership but was denied because she's a woman. She's now suing the company, claiming that this policy violates her equal protection rights.\n\nOkay, so equal protection is about ensuring that similar individuals are treated similarly under the law. In the United States, the Equal Protection Clause is part of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and it prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nBut wait, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state actions, including actions by local governments like counties. So, even though this is a private club, the fact that the county is involved through the lease might make a difference here.\n\nLet me think about that. The county leased land to this company to operate the yacht club, and the lease was negotiated with bylaws that were reviewed and approved by the county. Also, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages. So, there's definitely some government involvement here.\n\nNow, the issue is that the club is discriminating based on sex, specifically excluding women from membership. The woman is arguing that this denial of membership solely based on her sex violates her equal protection rights.\n\nSo, which of the options is correct?\n\nOption A says that the plaintiff will lose because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Actually, the Supreme Court has recognized sex as a suspect classification, meaning that laws or policies that classify people based on their sex are subject to heightened scrutiny under the equal protection clause.\n\nBut, in this case, it's a private club, not a law passed by the government. However, because there's government involvement through the lease and the alcohol license, maybe the club's actions are subject to equal protection analysis.\n\nOption B says that the plaintiff will prevail unless the denial of membership to women can be justified by some \"compelling interest,\" since such discrimination is \"suspect\" and requires the strictest equal protection test.\n\nHmm, strict scrutiny is indeed applied to classifications based on race, national origin, and sometimes sex. But I think intermediate scrutiny is generally applied to sex-based classifications, not strict scrutiny.\n\nLet me double-check that. In the case of Craig v. Boren (1976), the Supreme Court applied intermediate scrutiny to a sex-based classification, requiring that the classification serve important governmental objectives and that the means chosen are substantially related to achieving those objectives.\n\nSo, maybe intermediate scrutiny applies here, not strict scrutiny.\n\nOption C says that the plaintiff will lose because other similar facilities are available to women.\n\nWell, just because there are other facilities available doesn't necessarily mean that this particular discrimination is lawful. If the club is receiving some form of government benefit or is subject to government regulation, it might still be required to comply with equal protection principles.\n\nMoreover, even if there are other facilities, denying access to this particular facility based on sex could still be discriminatory.\n\nOption D says that the plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n\nThis seems closer to the intermediate scrutiny standard. Under intermediate scrutiny, the government (or in this case, the club with government involvement) must show that the sex-based classification serves an important governmental objective and that the means used are substantially related to achieving that objective.\n\nSo, if the club can't provide a sufficient justification for excluding women, the plaintiff would prevail.\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most accurate.\n\nBut let me think again. Is the club a public accommodation or is it a private entity?\n\nIn general, private clubs are not subject to the same anti-discrimination laws as public accommodations. However, if the club is operating on government-leased land and receiving government benefits, that might change things.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's open to the public for boating and fishing suggests some level of public access.\n\nWait, the scenario says that the yacht club is open to members only, with a restaurant and bar that require membership to access. So, it's not open to the general public; it's a members-only facility.\n\nBut, because it's on government-leased land and possibly receiving other government benefits, maybe it's considered a quasi-public entity, subject to equal protection requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the sale of alcoholic beverages requires a state license, which might impose additional regulations regarding discrimination.\n\nNow, considering all that, it seems that the club's membership policies could be subject to equal protection scrutiny.\n\nGiven that, and considering that sex is a classification that triggers intermediate scrutiny, option D seems correct: the plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for excluding women.\n\nIn other words, the burden is on the club to justify its discriminatory policy.\n\nOption B suggests strict scrutiny applies, which isn't accurate for sex-based classifications; intermediate scrutiny is more appropriate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because sex-based classifications are indeed subject to equal protection analysis, though with intermediate scrutiny.\n\nOption C is problematic because even if there are other facilities available to women, denying membership based on sex in a club that operates on government-leased land and sells alcohol with a state license seems like it could violate equal protection principles.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is option D: the plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
