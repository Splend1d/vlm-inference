                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I showed up to a beach party with board shorts on.\" Hmm, board shorts are pretty standard attire for a beach party, right? I mean, it's a beach party; people usually wear swim trunks or board shorts there. I don't see anything inherently wrong with that. Maybe if the party had a different dress code or something, but generally, board shorts are appropriate for a beach setting.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I set up a feast for the homeless in front of the rich.\" This one seems a bit more complex. So, setting up a feast for homeless people sounds like a charitable act, which is generally considered good and moral. However, doing it \"in front of the rich\" might imply that there's some intention to show off or to make the rich feel guilty or something. But, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, helping the homeless is seen as a positive thing. Providing food for those in need is admirable. But, the location being \"in front of the rich\" might raise some eyebrows. Is this about helping the homeless or is it about making a statement to the rich? If the intention is purely to help the homeless, then it's a good deed. But if the intention is to shame the rich, that might be seen as problematic.\n\nHowever, I think the primary motive here is to help the homeless, and maybe incidentally, it brings attention to the issue of homelessness and wealth disparity. In that case, it's still a positive action. Setting up a feast for the homeless, regardless of the location, is a kind act.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, showing up to a beach party with board shorts is not morally wrong. For Scenario 2, setting up a feast for the homeless in front of the rich, again, doesn't seem morally wrong. It's a charitable act, even if the location might be seen as provocative.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
