                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about real GDP per capita and standard of living. It says that if real GDP per capita was $20,000 in 1980 and $21,000 in 1990, then we can conclude that the standard of living has increased by a certain percentage. I need to figure out which one of these options is correct: 0.5 percent, 5.0 percent, 50 percent, or 3.3 percent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what real GDP per capita means. I know that GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year, and real GDP adjusts that for inflation to show the actual growth. So, real GDP per capita is real GDP divided by the population, which gives an idea of the average output per person.\n\nHere, real GDP per capita increased from $20,000 in 1980 to $21,000 in 1990. So, that's an increase of $1,000 over 10 years.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, I think I should use the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = (increase / original amount) * 100%\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage increase = ($1,000 / $20,000) * 100% = 0.05 * 100% = 5%\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nMaybe I should consider the compound annual growth rate, but the question seems to be asking for the total percentage increase over the 10-year period, not the annual rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the rule of 70 to estimate the doubling time or something, but that might not be necessary here.\n\nLet me see, if real GDP per capita increased from $20,000 to $21,000, that's indeed a $1,000 increase. To find the percentage increase, I divide the increase by the original amount and then multiply by 100% to get the percentage.\n\nSo, $1,000 / $20,000 = 0.05, which is 5%. That seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if this is a real increase adjusted for inflation. But since we're using real GDP, which is already adjusted for inflation, I don't think I need to adjust further for inflation.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the population grew during those years, but since we're looking at per capita figures, the population growth is already factored in.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could affect this calculation. If real GDP per capita increased from $20,000 to $21,000, that's a 5% increase, as calculated.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if this is the correct way to calculate it. Sometimes, economic growth can be measured in different ways, like compound annual growth rate or something like that.\n\nLet me calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for real GDP per capita over 10 years.\n\nThe formula for CAGR is:\n\nCAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n) - 1\n\nWhere n is the number of years.\n\nSo, CAGR = ($21,000 / $20,000)^(1/10) - 1 = (1.05)^(0.1) - 1 \u2248 1.0048 - 1 = 0.0048 or 0.48% per year.\n\nBut the question isn't asking for the annual growth rate; it's asking for the total percentage increase over the 10-year period.\n\nSo, the total increase would still be $1,000 on $20,000, which is 5%.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is trying to trick me by implying that since it's per capita, I need to consider population growth, but no, because per capita already accounts for population.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the standard of living doesn't always move in lockstep with real GDP per capita, but in this case, the question assumes that real GDP per capita is a direct measure of standard of living.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the standard of living increased by 5% from 1980 to 1990.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.5 percent.\n\nB. 5.0 percent.\n\nC. 50 percent.\n\nD. 3.3 percent.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want me to calculate the percentage increase using the formula:\n\nNew Value - Original Value / Original Value * 100%\n\nWhich is exactly what I did: ($21,000 - $20,000) / $20,000 * 100% = 5%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think there's any other calculation needed here. It's a straightforward percentage increase question.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is 5.0 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
