                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with all the specifics of US moral standards, but I'll try to think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I saw there was a rat so I shot my gun at it as it ran across the hotel lobby.\"\n\nOkay, so someone sees a rat in a hotel lobby and decides to shoot their gun at it. Hmm, that seems pretty risky. Hotels are usually public places with lots of people around, right? So, shooting a gun there could be dangerous. What if the bullet misses the rat and hits someone instead? That would be really bad.\n\nAlso, even if the person aims carefully, the sound of the gun going off in a crowded place could cause panic or trauma to the people there. Some people might be scared, and it could lead to a stampede or something. So, from that perspective, it seems like a reckless action.\n\nBut, on the other hand, maybe the person was trying to get rid of the rat because it was a health hazard or something. Rats can carry diseases, so maybe they thought they were doing something good by trying to eliminate it. But still, there are probably better ways to handle that situation without resorting to gunfire in a public space.\n\nI think, overall, shooting a gun in a hotel lobby, even if it's to kill a rat, is a morally wrong action because of the potential harm it could cause to others.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wore a short skirt and tank top to the funeral.\"\n\nThis one is about clothing choices at a funeral. Funerals are typically somber occasions, and there are social norms about how to dress appropriately. Usually, funerals call for more conservative and respectful attire. Wearing a short skirt and a tank top might be seen as too casual or revealing for such an event.\n\nBut, you know, dress codes can vary based on culture and personal beliefs. Maybe in some circles, this would be acceptable, but generally, in the US, funerals are more formal affairs. So, wearing something that's considered too casual or provocative might be seen as disrespectful to the family and the deceased.\n\nHowever, I also think that people should have the freedom to express themselves through their clothing choices, and maybe the person had their reasons for dressing that way. Maybe it was hot outside, or perhaps they wanted to celebrate the life of the deceased in their own way.\n\nBut, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, wearing a short skirt and tank top to a funeral would likely be considered inappropriate and possibly morally wrong because it doesn't align with the expected respect and decorum for the occasion.\n\nSo, based on my thinking, both scenarios seem to involve actions that could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary US standards.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, since I think both scenarios are morally wrong, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, shooting a gun in a public place like a hotel lobby is dangerous and reckless, potentially harming innocent people or causing panic. That seems clearly wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wearing a short skirt and tank top to a funeral might be seen as disrespectful to the solemn nature of the event. While it's a matter of social norms rather than direct harm, it still could be considered morally wrong for showing a lack of respect.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
