                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It's asking for the area of a square, and it gives me some information about a circle first. Let me read it carefully.\n\nIt says, \"What is the area, in square units, of a square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units?\"\n\nOkay, so the key things here are:\n\n1. There's a circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units.\n\n2. The radius of this circle is the same as the side length of a square.\n\n3. I need to find the area of that square.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its radius.\n\nI know that the formula for the circumference of a circle is:\n\n\\[c = 2\\pi r\\]\n\nWhere \\(c\\) is the circumference and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nGiven that the circumference is \\(12\\pi\\), I can plug that into the formula:\n\n\\[12\\pi = 2\\pi r\\]\n\nHmm, I can solve for \\(r\\) by dividing both sides by \\(2\\pi\\):\n\n\\[r = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} = 6\\]\n\nSo, the radius of the circle is 6 units.\n\nNow, the problem states that the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of this circle. So, the side length of the square is also 6 units.\n\nTo find the area of the square, I just need to square the length of its sides. The formula for the area of a square is:\n\n\\[a = s^2\\]\n\nWhere \\(a\\) is the area and \\(s\\) is the side length.\n\nPlugging in the value I have:\n\n\\[a = 6^2 = 36\\]\n\nSo, the area of the square is 36 square units.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 10\n\nB. 11\n\nC. 12\n\nD. 36\n\nIt seems like the correct answer is D. 36.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, I confirmed the circumference formula: yes, \\(c = 2\\pi r\\).\n\nThen, I solved for \\(r\\) correctly: \\(r = \\frac{c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} = 6\\).\n\nNext, the side of the square is equal to the radius, which is 6 units.\n\nFinally, the area is \\(s^2 = 6^2 = 36\\).\n\nEverything checks out. I don't see any errors in my calculations.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether the units are in terms of the same measurement, but the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, perhaps there's a trick here, but I can't see any immediate tricks. The problem states clearly that the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of the circle, and we're given the circumference.\n\nUnless there's some misdirection, but based on the information provided, 36 seems correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
