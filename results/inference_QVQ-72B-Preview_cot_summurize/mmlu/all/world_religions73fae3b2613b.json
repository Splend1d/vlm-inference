Hmm, I need to figure this out. I think I know the answer, but I want to make sure I'm correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that Islam is a religion that originated in the Arabian Peninsula and is based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. The word 'Islam' is an Arabic word, and I recall that it has a specific meaning in that language.\n\nLet me think about the roots of the word. In Arabic, words often derive from roots consisting of three consonants. For example, the root '\u0643\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0628' (k-t-b) gives us words like '\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628' (kit\u0101b - book) and '\u064a\u0643\u062a\u0628' (yaktub - he writes). Similarly, ' Islam' starts with '\u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652' (is-) and ends with '\u0644\u064e\u0645' (lam), but that doesn't directly help me remember its meaning.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the verbal roots. I think 'Islam' is derived from the verb '\u0627\u0633\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e' (aslama), which means something like 'to surrender' or 'to submit.' That rings a bell. So, if that's the case, then 'Islam' would mean 'submission' in Arabic.\n\nBut let me consider each option carefully:\n\nA. Worship: While worship is an important aspect of Islam, I don't think 'Islam' directly translates to 'worship.' Worship involves prayer, rituals, and devotion, but the core meaning of 'Islam' seems to be more about adherence to God's will.\n\nB. Submission: This seems plausible. As I mentioned earlier, 'Islam' is often translated as 'submission to the will of God.' This aligns with the idea of living one's life in accordance with God's commands and teachings.\n\nC. Obedience: Obedience is also a key concept in Islam, but it feels a bit too narrow. Obedience typically implies following orders or rules, whereas 'Islam' encompasses a broader sense of surrendering one's will to God's will.\n\nD. Faith: Faith is another crucial element of Islam, but again, it doesn't capture the full meaning of 'Islam.' Faith involves belief and trust in God, but 'Islam' is more about the practice and way of life.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe that 'submission' is the most accurate translation of the word 'Islam' in Arabic. It's about submitting oneself to the will of God, which encompasses worship, obedience, and faith.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that the declaration of faith in Islam, the Shahada, states, \"There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.\" This affirms the oneness of God and the submission to His will, which further reinforces the idea that 'Islam' means 'submission.'\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The word 'Islam' means 'submission' in Arabic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Submission}} \\]"
