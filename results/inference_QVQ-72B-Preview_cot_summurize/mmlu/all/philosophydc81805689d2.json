                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what John Stuart Mill would say about how to decide how to act. The options are:\n\nA. We should always calculate the expected consequences of our action.\n\nB. We should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility.\n\nC. We should consult tradition.\n\nD. We should consult scripture.\n\nI know that Mill was a philosopher who supported utilitarianism, which is basically about maximizing happiness or pleasure and minimizing pain for the greatest number of people. So, the principle of utility is about actions being right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce the opposite.\n\nOption A suggests always calculating the expected consequences. That sounds a bit like act utilitarianism, where you consider the consequences of each specific act to see which one will produce the most good. But I recall that Mill actually favored rule utilitarianism over act utilitarianism. In rule utilitarianism, you follow general rules that are derived from the principle of utility because following those rules generally leads to the best outcomes.\n\nSo, if Mill favored rule utilitarianism, maybe option B is more accurate. It says we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility. That seems to align with rule utilitarianism.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"in deciding how to act,\" and it's asking what Mill claims we should do. Maybe he thought that in practical terms, we can't always calculate the consequences, so we need rules of thumb.\n\nOption C is about consulting tradition. Well, tradition can be a guide, but utilitarianism isn't necessarily about following tradition blindly. Sometimes tradition might conflict with what would bring the greatest happiness.\n\nOption D is about consulting scripture. Mill was a secular philosopher, so I don't think he would advocate for basing our decisions on scripture.\n\nSo, between options A and B, B seems more in line with Mill's thinking. He believed that having general rules based on the principle of utility was more practical and reliable than trying to calculate the consequences every time we make a decision.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I were to act according to Mill's utilitarianism, would I be calculating the consequences each time, or would I be following general rules that are likely to lead to good outcomes?\n\nI think it's the latter. Mill emphasized the importance of general rules because they provide a stable and predictable framework for behavior. Calculating consequences every time could be time-consuming and impractical, especially in situations where quick decisions are needed.\n\nMoreover, Mill discussed the idea that some actions are right as means and others as ends. He believed that certain actions are right in themselves because they contribute to overall happiness, and others are right because they help achieve that end.\n\nSo, perhaps he would say that we should have rules that guide us towards actions that promote happiness, without needing to calculate the exact consequences each time.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most appropriate choice. It captures the essence of rule utilitarianism, which Mill supported, whereas option A sounds more like act utilitarianism, which he was critical of.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I'm faced with a situation where I could lie to protect someone's feelings or tell the truth, which might hurt them but be honest. According to act utilitarianism, I would need to calculate which action would produce more happiness in this specific instance.\n\nBut according to rule utilitarianism, I would consider general rules, like \"honesty is the best policy\" because, in the long run, honesty promotes trust and overall happiness.\n\nMill would likely advocate for following the general rule, as it aligns with the principle of utility over the long term, even if in some specific cases, lying might seem to produce better immediate results.\n\nSo, in this scenario, option B seems to fit better with Mill's philosophy.\n\nAdditionally, Mill discussed the idea that some rules are so important that they should almost never be broken, even if breaking them might seem to produce better results in a particular case. This further supports the idea that he valued general rules over case-by-case calculations.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is B: we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
