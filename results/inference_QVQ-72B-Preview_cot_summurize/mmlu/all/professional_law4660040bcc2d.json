                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this legal scenario here involving a dog named Rover and an elderly lady named Ginny Grandmother. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nSo, Doug Dogman has a golden retriever named Rover. Golden retrievers are usually really friendly and good-natured dogs, right? They're not typically aggressive or anything. Rover is described as a friendly dog who loves to run and chase cars but has never hurt anyone. That's important, I think.\n\nOne evening, it's dark before the street lights come on, which might make visibility poor. Rover is out chasing cars in the street. Ginny, who is 85 years old, is driving and sees Rover chasing cars. To avoid hitting the dog, she swerves and ends up hitting a parked car, resulting in a head injury.\n\nNow, Ginny is suing Doug under a strict liability theory. Strict liability, from what I remember, is a legal concept where someone can be held responsible for damages or injuries caused by their actions or possessions without needing to prove negligence or intent. So, in this case, because Rover is Doug's dog, and Rover's actions led to Ginny getting injured, Ginny is trying to hold Doug liable regardless of whether Doug was negligent or not.\n\nThe question is asking who the court will likely find for: Ginny or Doug. And there are several options provided.\n\nOption A says Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries. Cause in fact, I believe, refers to the actual cause of the injury. So, if it weren't for Rover chasing cars, Ginny wouldn't have swerved and hit the parked car. That seems plausible.\n\nOption B says Doug, because a retriever is a domesticated animal. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Domesticated animals are common pets, but I don't think that fact alone exempts the owner from liability if the animal causes harm.\n\nOption C says Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets. This is interesting. If there's a law that requires dogs to be leashed in public areas, and Rover was unleashed, maybe that changes things. But I'm not sure how that directly affects strict liability.\n\nOption D says Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities. So, since Rover is friendly and hasn't hurt anyone, maybe strict liability doesn't apply.\n\nAlright, let's think this through.\n\nFirst, strict liability for animals typically applies when the animal has shown dangerous or vicious tendencies, and the owner knows or should know about them. But I think some jurisdictions have different rules for different types of animals.\n\nIn many places, for dog bites, there's a \"one-bite rule,\" meaning that the owner is liable only if they knew or should have known that the dog was dangerous. But in this case, Rover didn't bite anyone; Ginny was injured when she swerved to avoid hitting the dog.\n\nSo, is strict liability applicable here? And if so, does it matter that Rover is a friendly dog with no history of aggression?\n\nI need to consider the principle of strict liability in the context of animal ownership. Generally, strict liability imposes liability without fault on the owner for injuries caused by their animal, especially if the animal has shown dangerous tendencies.\n\nBut in this scenario, Rover is a friendly dog that likes to chase cars but has never hurt anyone. Chasing cars might be seen as a nuisance behavior, but not necessarily vicious or dangerous in the traditional sense.\n\nHowever, Rover's behavior led to Ginny swerving and getting injured. So, even if Rover isn't vicious, his actions caused the injury.\n\nMaybe strict liability applies here because Rover's behavior was unforeseeable or inherently dangerous, even if he's generally friendly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a local ordinance or statute that requires dogs to be leashed in public areas. If that's the case, and Rover was unleashed, Doug might be in violation of that law, which could affect the liability.\n\nBut the question specifies that it's a strict liability theory, not negligence or violation of a statute.\n\nWait, option C mentions that unless there's a statute or ordinance banning unleashed dogs on public streets, the court will likely find for Doug. But the question is about strict liability, not negligence based on a statute.\n\nI need to focus on strict liability.\n\nLet me look up what strict liability entails in animal cases.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that strict liability in animal cases generally applies when:\n\n1. The animal has dangerous propensities that are known to the owner.\n\n2. The injury was caused by those dangerous propensities.\n\nIn this case, Rover is described as friendly with no history of hurting anyone. So, he doesn't seem to have dangerous propensities.\n\nHowever, his behavior of chasing cars could be considered a dangerous propensity, as it could lead to accidents.\n\nBut the question specifies that he's never hurt anyone, so maybe the owner didn't know or shouldn't have known about this propensity.\n\nWait, but the injury was caused by Rover's chasing behavior, which could be seen as a known behavior of dogs, especially retrievers, who are known to chase things.\n\nSo, perhaps Doug should have known that Rover might chase cars and could cause accidents.\n\nBut in strict liability, it's about the animal's dangerous propensity and the owner's knowledge of it.\n\nIf Rover has never hurt anyone, and chasing cars isn't necessarily a dangerous propensity in itself, maybe Doug isn't strictly liable.\n\nBut option A suggests that Ginny would win because Rover was a cause in fact of her injuries.\n\nCause in fact is a concept in tort law that refers to the actual cause of the harm. So, if it weren't for Rover chasing cars, Ginny wouldn't have swerved and gotten injured. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut in strict liability cases, just because the animal caused the injury doesn't automatically mean the owner is liable if the animal doesn't have dangerous propensities.\n\nOption D says that strict liability for dogs doesn't include those without vicious propensities, which seems to align with what I found earlier.\n\nSo, if Rover doesn't have vicious propensities, maybe Doug isn't strictly liable.\n\nBut Ginny was injured because of Rover's behavior, which was chasing cars.\n\nIs chasing cars a vicious propensity? Probably not, but it could be considered a dangerous one.\n\nMaybe the court would consider chasing cars as a dangerous propensity, even if Rover is otherwise friendly.\n\nBut the question specifies that Rover is friendly and has never hurt anyone, so perhaps chasing cars isn't seen as a dangerous propensity.\n\nOption C mentions that unless there's a statute or ordinance banning unleashed dogs on public streets, the court will likely find for Doug.\n\nSo, if there's no such law, maybe strict liability doesn't apply.\n\nBut again, the question is about strict liability, not negligence based on violating a statute.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to rephrase.\n\nStrict liability for animals typically requires that the animal has dangerous or vicious propensities that are known to the owner, and that the injury was caused by those propensities.\n\nIn this case, Rover is friendly, has never hurt anyone, and his propensity to chase cars may or may not be considered dangerous.\n\nIf chasing cars is not considered a dangerous propensity, then Doug may not be strictly liable.\n\nBut Ginny was injured because of Rover's chasing behavior, so perhaps the court would consider that a dangerous propensity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would rule that since Rover is a domesticated animal and doesn't have vicious propensities, Doug isn't strictly liable.\n\nOption B suggests that because Rover is a domesticated animal, Doug wins. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nDomesticated animals are common pets, but that doesn't necessarily exempt their owners from liability if they cause harm.\n\nOption D seems similar, saying that strict liability for dogs doesn't include those without vicious propensities.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is D: Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n\nBut I'm still unsure.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, owners are strictly liable for injuries caused by their animals if the animals are abnormally dangerous.\n\nBut in this case, Rover is a golden retriever, which is not considered abnormally dangerous.\n\nSo, maybe strict liability doesn't apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a doctrine that holds owners liable for their pets' actions regardless of the pet's nature.\n\nI need to think about whether strict liability applies to non-vicious animals.\n\nMaybe I should look up some case law on this.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that in some places, owners are strictly liable for injuries caused by their pets, even if the pets are not vicious, as long as the pets are kept in a way that creates an unreasonable risk.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps negligence applies here.\n\nWait, but the question specifies a strict liability theory, not negligence.\n\nSo, sticking to strict liability.\n\nIf strict liability requires that the animal has dangerous or vicious propensities, and Rover doesn't, then maybe Doug isn't liable under strict liability.\n\nBut that seems unfair to Ginny, who was injured because of Rover's actions.\n\nPerhaps the court would find some way to hold Doug liable, but based on the options provided, it seems like Doug would win under a strict liability theory because Rover doesn't have vicious propensities.\n\nSo, option D seems the most fitting.\n\nOption C mentions a statute or ordinance, which isn't directly related to strict liability.\n\nOption B mentions that Rover is a domesticated animal, but that might not be relevant to strict liability.\n\nOption A says Ginny wins because Rover was a cause in fact of her injuries, but that seems more related to negligence or some other theory, not strict liability.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is D: Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure.\n\nLet me see if I can find more information.\n\nUpon further research, I find that in some jurisdictions, owners are strictly liable for injuries caused by their pets, regardless of the pet's nature, as long as the pet is kept in a way that creates an unreasonable risk.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's universally applied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different standard for non-vicious animals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the court would find that since Rover is a friendly dog with no history of aggression, Doug isn't strictly liable for Ginny's injuries.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely find for Doug, based on the strict liability rule not applying to dogs without vicious propensities.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
