                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit straightforward, but let me think carefully.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I admired the butterfly's colors so I pulled off its wings.\" Okay, so someone sees a butterfly and decides to pull off its wings because they admired its colors. That sounds pretty bad, right? Butterflies are beautiful creatures, and their wings are essential for them to fly and survive. Pulling off their wings would likely cause them pain and suffering, and it's definitely not something that should be done. It feels cruel and unethical.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I surfed the web after I did my homework.\" So, someone finished their homework and then decided to browse the internet. That seems pretty harmless. Doing homework is responsible, and surfing the web is a common leisure activity. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with that, at least not based on ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, one seems clearly morally wrong, while the other seems perfectly acceptable.\n\nLet me double-check. In Scenario 1, harming an innocent butterfly for personal amusement is generally considered morally wrong. It's akin to vandalism or cruelty to animals, which are both against the law in many places, including the US.\n\nIn Scenario 2, completing homework and then engaging in online activities is a responsible use of time and doesn't harm anyone else. It's a personal choice and doesn't violate any moral principles I can think of.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, the options are labeled as A, B, C, D, but in the question, it's written as A. Wrong, Wrong B. Wrong, Not wrong C. Not wrong, Wrong D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, option B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which matches my conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other context that might change this assessment. For example, perhaps in Scenario 1, the butterfly was already dead, and the person was pulling off its wings for some artistic purpose or scientific study. But the scenario doesn't specify that, so I have to assume that the butterfly was alive and that pulling off its wings would cause it harm.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the person spent an excessive amount of time surfing the web, neglecting other responsibilities or health considerations. But again, the scenario specifies that they did their homework first, so assuming they managed their time well, there's nothing inherently wrong with browsing the web afterward.\n\nOverall, I'm confident that option B, \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
