Let me look at the options: A. 9, B. 11, C. 26, D. 32. Okay, I have to be careful here because order of operations is really important in math. If I mess up the sequence, I'll get the wrong answer.\n\nFirst thing I remember is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, I need to solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n\nLooking inside the brackets: (2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) + (8 \u00f7 4). I should solve the operations inside these parentheses first.\n\nStarting with (2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5):\n\n2 \u00d7 6 is 12.\n\nThen 12 \u2013 5 is 7.\n\nNext, (8 \u00f7 4) is 2.\n\nSo now, the expression inside the brackets is 7 + 2, which equals 9.\n\nNow, the expression becomes 3 \u00d7 9 \u2013 1.\n\nNext, I need to do the multiplication before subtraction according to PEMDAS.\n\n3 \u00d7 9 is 27.\n\nThen, 27 \u2013 1 is 26.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 26.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n3 \u00d7 [(2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) + (8 \u00f7 4)] \u2013 1\n\nSolve inside the parentheses first:\n\n(2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5) is (12 \u2013 5) which is 7.\n\n(8 \u00f7 4) is 2.\n\nThen, 7 + 2 is 9.\n\nNow, 3 \u00d7 9 is 27.\n\nFinally, 27 \u2013 1 is 26.\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other interpretations. Is there any chance that the division should be done before addition? Let me see.\n\nActually, inside the brackets, I have addition and division. According to PEMDAS, multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction, but they are evaluated from left to right.\n\nSo, first, I have subtraction inside the first set of parentheses: 2 \u00d7 6 \u2013 5. That's 12 \u2013 5, which is 7. Then, addition outside that: 7 + (8 \u00f7 4). Yes, 8 \u00f7 4 is 2, and then 7 + 2 is 9. Then, 3 \u00d7 9 is 27, and finally, 27 \u2013 1 is 26.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone would try to do the multiplication outside before solving inside the parentheses, but that would be incorrect according to PEMDAS. Because parentheses come first.\n\nYeah, I'm sure. So, the answer should be 26, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]"
