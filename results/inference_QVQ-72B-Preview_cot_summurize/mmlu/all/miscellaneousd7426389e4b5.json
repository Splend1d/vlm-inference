National Geographic, and D. Smithsonian. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to think about what each of these magazines is known for. Starting with Tiger Beat, I recall that it's a magazine that covers celebrity news, especially focusing on young stars and pop culture. So, it's more about entertainment and celebrities rather than natural science. That seems like a strong candidate for not focusing on natural science.\n\nNext, Outside. I've heard of Outside magazine; I think it covers outdoor activities, travel, and adventure sports. So, it might touch on some aspects of nature and the environment, but its primary focus is more on activities and experiences in the outdoors rather than scientific studies or research about the natural world.\n\nThen there's National Geographic. I'm pretty familiar with this one; it's renowned for its coverage of geography, history, and science. It often features articles about wildlife, conservation, and scientific discoveries. So, this definitely seems to focus on natural science.\n\nLastly, Smithsonian magazine. The Smithsonian Institution is a major research center and museum complex in Washington, D.C., covering a wide range of topics, including natural history, art, and history. Their magazine likely covers similar ground, including aspects of natural science.\n\nSo, comparing all four:\n\n- Tiger Beat: Entertainment and celebrities \u2013 not science-focused.\n\n- Outside: Outdoor activities and travel \u2013 some connection to nature but not primarily scientific.\n\n- National Geographic: Clearly science-focused, especially on natural science.\n\n- Smithsonian: Broad coverage, including natural science.\n\nGiven that, it seems like Tiger Beat is the one that doesn't focus on natural science. But just to be sure, let me double-check.\n\nIs Outside magazine ever involved with scientific research or discoveries? While it does cover some environmental issues, its main emphasis is on adventure and outdoor lifestyles, not on scientific studies or research. So, it's less focused on natural science compared to National Geographic and Smithsonian.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is A. Tiger Beat, as it primarily covers entertainment and celebrity news, which does not focus on natural science.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Tiger Beat}} \\]"
