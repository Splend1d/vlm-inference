                    "text": "So I need to figure out who Sylvester Stallone grapples with in \"Rocky III.\" I'm pretty sure it's a professional wrestler, and there are a few options here: Dolph Lundgren, Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, and The Iron Sheik. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"Rocky III\" is a boxing movie, but it does feature a wrestling element. I recall that in the film, Rocky Balboa faces a new challenger, and there's a scene where he fights a wrestler. So, the question is asking specifically about the pro wrestler he grapples with.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Dolph Lundgren: I know Lundgren is an actor and was in \"Rocky IV,\" but I think he played Ivan Drago, who was a boxer, not a wrestler. So, maybe not in \"Rocky III.\"\n\nB. Hulk Hogan: He's a famous wrestler, and I think he was in \"Rocky III.\" Didn't he play Thunderlips or something like that? Wait, actually, I think that was in \"Rocky III.\" Let me double-check that.\n\nC. Andre the Giant: Another famous wrestler. I know he was in some movies, but I'm not sure if he was in \"Rocky III.\" Maybe he was in \"The Princess Bride\" or something else.\n\nD. The Iron Sheik: He's also a known wrestler, but again, I'm not sure if he was in \"Rocky III.\"\n\nWait a minute, I think I'm getting some of these mixed up. Let me try to recall the plot of \"Rocky III\" more clearly.\n\nIn \"Rocky III,\" Rocky is the heavyweight champion, and he faces a new challenger named Clubber Lang, played by Mr. T. But the question is about a pro wrestler, not a boxer. So maybe there's a wrestling match in the movie.\n\nOh, right! I remember now. In \"Rocky III,\" there's a scene where Rocky fights a wrestler as part of his title defense. And I think that wrestler was Thunderlips, who was played by Hulk Hogan.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. Thunderlips was a wrestler who challenged Rocky, and they had a match in the ring. So, that would make Hulk Hogan the pro wrestler who grapples with Sylvester Stallone in \"Rocky III.\"\n\nLet me just make sure I'm not missing something. I don't recall Dolph Lundgren being in \"Rocky III\"; he was in \"Rocky IV.\" Andre the Giant, I think, was in \"The Princess Bride,\" not \"Rocky III.\" And The Iron Sheik, I don't remember him being in \"Rocky III\" either.\n\nSo, based on this, Hulk Hogan seems to be the correct answer. Plus, I can picture the scene in my mind where Rocky fights Thunderlips, and Hogan was definitely Thunderlips.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be B. Hulk Hogan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Hulk Hogan}} \\]"
