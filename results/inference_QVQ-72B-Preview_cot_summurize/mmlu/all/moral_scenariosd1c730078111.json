                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" or \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Since the politician literally voted against increasing apple orchard subsidies, I decided to throw an apple pie toward the politician, and told him to vote differently next time.\n\nScenario 2: I make sure my high-watt security light is aimed in my neighbor's bedroom window.\n\nAlright, so in Scenario 1, someone is upset about a politician's vote against increasing subsidies for apple orchards, so they throw an apple pie at the politician and tell them to vote differently next time. In Scenario 2, someone aims a high-watt security light into their neighbor's bedroom window.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether these actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1. Throwing an apple pie at a politician because you disagree with their vote. Is that wrong?\n\nWell, first off, expressing dissatisfaction with a politician's vote is perfectly acceptable and even encouraged in a democracy. However, doing so through physical action, like throwing something at them, that's a different matter.\n\nThrowing an object at someone can be considered assault, even if it's just a pie. It's an aggressive act that could cause harm, embarrassment, or both. In most societies, including the US, assaulting someone is considered morally wrong, and it's also against the law.\n\nMoreover, targeting a public figure with such actions might be seen as a form of protest, but it still crosses a line into violence or at least aggression, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, throwing an apple pie at a politician seems like a morally wrong action.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Aiming a high-watt security light into a neighbor's bedroom window.\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. On one hand, it's your property, and you have the right to secure it with lights. However, aiming the light directly into someone else's bedroom window is invasive and could be seen as a nuisance or even a form of harassment.\n\nImagine if someone did that to you\u2014having a bright light shining into your bedroom, possibly disrupting your sleep or privacy. It would likely make you feel uncomfortable and violated.\n\nIn terms of moral standards, this action seems disrespectful of your neighbor's right to privacy and peace. It could also be seen as\u6545\u610f\u7684\u5e72\u6270, which is not acceptable behavior.\n\nAdditionally, in many places, there are laws against such actions, particularly regarding light pollution or nuisance lighting that affects neighboring properties.\n\nSo, in Scenario 2, aiming a high-watt security light into a neighbor's bedroom window also seems like a morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there's a perspective where one of these actions could be considered not wrong.\n\nStarting again with Scenario 1. Is throwing a pie at a politician ever considered acceptable?\n\nIn some extreme cases, people might argue that it's a form of protest and therefore justifiable. However, even in protest, there are lines that shouldn't be crossed, and physical assault is generally one of them.\n\nMoreover, there are peaceful and non-violent ways to express dissent, such as writing letters, participating in debates, or organizing peaceful protests, which are more in line with moral and legal standards.\n\nTherefore, throwing a pie at a politician is still considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, for Scenario 2. Is there any scenario where aiming a high-watt security light into a neighbor's bedroom window could be justified?\n\nPerhaps if there was a genuine security threat that required such measures, but even then, it would be necessary to balance your security needs with your neighbor's right to privacy and peaceful enjoyment of their property.\n\nIn most cases, though, it's considered inconsiderate and morally wrong to impose such an intrusion on your neighbor.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I conclude that both actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
