                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Animals in which of the following groups may have a backbone and a spinal cord? A. Mollusks B. Chordates C. Invertebrates D. Echinoderms\" Hmm, I need to figure out which of these groups can include animals that have a backbone and a spinal cord.\n\nFirst off, I know that a backbone and a spinal cord are typically associated with vertebrates. Vertebrates are animals that have a spinal column that encloses the spinal cord, and this spinal column is what we call a backbone. So, the question is essentially asking which of these animal groups can include vertebrates.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Mollusks. I recall that mollusks are a phylum of invertebrates that include snails, clams, and octopuses. They don't have a backbone or a spinal cord. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nNext is B. Chordates. Chordates are a phylum of animals that have a chorda dorsalis, which is a flexible rod that runs along the back of the animal. In vertebrates, this chorda dorsalis is replaced by a vertebral column during development. So, chordates include both vertebrates and some invertebrates like tunicates and lancelets. Since vertebrates are included in the chordate phylum, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nC. Invertebrates. This is a bit of a catch-all term for animals without a backbone. By definition, invertebrates don't have a backbone or a spinal cord. So, even though there are many invertebrate species, they don't fit the criteria of having a backbone and a spinal cord.\n\nLastly, D. Echinoderms. Echinoderms are another phylum of invertebrates, which include starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. They also lack a backbone and a spinal cord.\n\nSo, based on this, the only group among the options that includes animals with a backbone and a spinal cord is B. Chordates, since they include vertebrates.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"may have a backbone and a spinal cord.\" It doesn't say \"must have\" or \"always have.\" So, perhaps there are some chordates that don't have a backbone and a spinal cord? Let me double-check.\n\nActually, no. All vertebrates have a backbone and a spinal cord, and vertebrates are a subphylum within the chordates. There are other chordates like tunicates and lancelets that are considered invertebrate chordates and do have a notochord (the chorda dorsalis) but not a true backbone or spinal column. So, in that case, only the vertebrate chordates have a backbone and a spinal cord.\n\nBut the question is asking which group \"may have\" a backbone and a spinal cord, and since chordates include vertebrates, it's correct to say that chordates may have members with a backbone and a spinal cord.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other groups might indirectly include some animals with backbones. For example, invertebrates are a broad category that includes many phyla, including some chordates that are not vertebrates, but as I thought earlier, invertebrates by definition lack a backbone.\n\nMollusks and echinoderms are specifically invertebrate phyla, so they definitely don't have backbones or spinal cords.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Chordates.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe there's something tricky about the way the question is phrased. It says \"may have,\" which implies possibility, not necessity. So, even if most chordates don't have a backbone and a spinal cord, as long as some do, it's correct to say that chordates may have them.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in conclusion, the answer is B. Chordates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
