                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of these is a government agency established to protect investors?\" And the options are AAA, NBA, SEC, and MADD. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out which one of these is a government agency that's set up to protect investors.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall what each of these acronyms stands for. Starting with AAA \u2013 I think that's the American Automobile Association. You know, they offer road assistance and travel services for drivers. But is that a government agency? No, I don't think so. It sounds more like a membership-based organization rather than a government entity. So, maybe AAA isn't the right choice here.\n\nNext up is NBA. Oh, that's easy \u2013 that's the National Basketball Association. That's the professional basketball league in the United States. Definitely not a government agency; it's a sports organization. So, that can't be the answer.\n\nNow, SEC. Hmm, SEC stands for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wait, that rings a bell. I think it's a U.S. government agency that oversees the securities industry and protects investors from fraud. Yeah, that sounds right. It was established to regulate the securities markets and ensure that companies provide accurate information to investors. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nLastly, MADD. I know MADD as Mothers Against Drunk Driving. It's a non-profit organization that advocates for stricter drunk driving laws and raises awareness about the dangers of impaired driving. Again, not a government agency, but rather an advocacy group. So, while their work is important, it's not related to protecting investors.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the options, it seems clear that the SEC is the government agency established to protect investors. The other options are either private organizations or related to different fields entirely.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should double-check my understanding of the SEC. Let me think about its main functions. The SEC is responsible for enforcing federal securities laws, regulating the securities industry, and overseeing electronic filing of corporate disclosures. They also provide educational resources for investors and monitor trading activities to prevent fraud and manipulation.\n\nYeah, that aligns perfectly with the question's description of a government agency established to protect investors. So, I'm confident that SEC is the correct answer here.\n\nIn summary, among the given options \u2013 AAA, NBA, SEC, and MADD \u2013 the SEC is the only government agency established to protect investors. Its role in regulating securities markets and safeguarding investors makes it the appropriate choice for this question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. SEC}} \\]"
