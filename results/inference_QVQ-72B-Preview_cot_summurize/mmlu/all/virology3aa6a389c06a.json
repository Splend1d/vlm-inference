                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a new drug being tested on patients with HIV. There are 200 patients in total, and out of these, 100 are selected by lottery to receive the drug. The rest get plain orange juice, but nobody knows who got the drug or who didn't. At the end of the study period, they measure the number of CD4+ T cells in all the patients. Now, I need to figure out what type of study this is from the options given: case-control, case report, cohort study, or cross-sectional study.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each type of study involves.\n\nStarting with a case-control study: I think this is when researchers look at people who have a particular disease (cases) and compare them to people who don't have the disease (controls). They look back to see what factors might be associated with the disease. But in this scenario, all the patients already have HIV, confirmed by Western blot, so it's not comparing HIV-positive and HIV-negative people. It's comparing those who received the drug and those who didn't, and then measuring CD4+ T cells. So, this doesn't seem like a case-control study.\n\nNext, a case report. I believe this is when a detailed account of a single patient or a very small number of patients is presented, often to highlight some unusual aspects of the disease or its treatment. But here, we're dealing with 200 patients, which is too many for a case report. So, this can't be a case report.\n\nNow, a cohort study. This sounds more promising. In a cohort study, a group of people is followed over time to see how certain factors affect their health outcomes. It can be prospective or retrospective. In this scenario, patients are being divided into two groups: those who receive the drug and those who don't, and then their CD4+ T cell counts are measured at the end of the study period. This seems like following two groups over time to see the effect of the drug on their CD4+ T cell counts.\n\nBut wait, in a typical cohort study, the exposure (in this case, the drug) is not assigned randomly; it's based on real-world decisions. However, in this scenario, the drug is being assigned by lottery, which is randomization. This makes it different from a standard cohort study because here, the exposure is being randomly assigned, which is more characteristic of a randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nHmm, but an RCT isn't one of the options. So, maybe it's still considered a cohort study even if it's randomized.\n\nLet me think about cross-sectional studies next. A cross-sectional study looks at a population at a single point in time to measure the prevalence of a particular characteristic. For example, measuring the CD4+ T cell counts of a group of HIV-positive patients at one specific time. But in this scenario, the measurements are taken at the end of a study period after some intervention (giving the drug), which suggests that time is a factor here. So, this doesn't seem like a cross-sectional study.\n\nSo, between the options given, a cohort study seems to be the closest fit. It's a longitudinal study where a group is followed over time to see the effect of an intervention or exposure.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance it could be considered a case-control study?\n\nWell, case-control studies are analytic studies that look back in time to identify factors that might be associated with a disease. In this scenario, all participants already have the disease (HIV), and the intervention is being tested to see if it affects their CD4+ T cell counts. So, it's not comparing cases and controls in terms of disease presence, but rather comparing two groups in terms of treatment received.\n\nTherefore, it's more of a cohort study where two subgroups (drug vs. no drug) are being compared within the larger group of HIV-positive patients.\n\nI should also consider the blinding aspect. The fact that neither the patients nor the healthcare providers know who received the drug suggests that this is a double-blind study, which is a type of RCT. However, since RCT isn't an option, and cohort studies can include randomized trials, it's likely that this is considered a cohort study.\n\nSo, my answer is C. Cohort study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
