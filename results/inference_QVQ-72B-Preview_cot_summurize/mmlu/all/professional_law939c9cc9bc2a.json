                    "text": "Let me see here. I have this question about arrests without a warrant, and it's asking which of the following is not a circumstance where an arrest can be made without a warrant. The options are:\n\nA. A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it.\n\nB. An officer must have probable cause that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it.\n\nC. An officer may arrest for a felony committed in his presence.\n\nD. An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in the arresting party's presence.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which one of these is not a valid circumstance for a warrantless arrest.\n\nFirst, I know that generally, police need a warrant to make an arrest, but there are exceptions where they can arrest without one. These exceptions are usually based on certain circumstances or when certain crimes are committed in their presence.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that for a misdemeanor, an officer must believe that the person committed it. So, if a misdemeanor has occurred, and the officer believes the person did it, they can arrest without a warrant. That sounds plausible, but I think there might be some conditions attached to this.\n\nOption B says that an officer must have probable cause that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it. Probable cause is a standard in law that allows officers to make arrests or conduct searches without a warrant if they have reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been committed. So, this seems like a standard exception for warrantless arrests.\n\nOption C says that an officer may arrest for a felony committed in his presence. This also makes sense because if the officer witnesses a felony being committed, they don't need a warrant to arrest the person on the spot.\n\nOption D says that an officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in the arresting party's presence. Breach of peace usually refers to disruptive or disorderly behavior that disturbs the public order. So, if an officer witnesses such a misdemeanor, they can arrest without a warrant.\n\nNow, I need to determine which one of these is not a circumstance for a warrantless arrest. Let me consider if there are any limitations or exceptions to these general rules.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, officers can arrest without a warrant for both felonies and misdemeanors under certain conditions. For felonies, probable cause is generally sufficient, and for misdemeanors, it often has to be committed in the officer's presence or involve a breach of peace.\n\nWait a minute, maybe not all misdemeanors can be arrested without a warrant. Perhaps only certain types of misdemeanors or under specific circumstances.\n\nLet me look this up to be sure. Oh, but since this is a hypothetical question, I need to reason it out based on general legal principles.\n\nSo, generally, for felonies, officers can arrest without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that the person committed the felony. This is a widely accepted exception.\n\nFor misdemeanors, the rules vary. In many places, officers can arrest without a warrant if the misdemeanor was committed in their presence, especially if it involves a breach of peace or some other urgent situation.\n\nSo, options B, C, and D seem to align with these general principles: probable cause for felonies, and certain misdemeanors committed in the officer's presence, particularly those involving breach of peace.\n\nOption A says that for a misdemeanor, the officer must believe that the person committed it. But the key here is the standard of belief. In law, \"belief\" can be vague. The standard is usually probable cause, not just any belief.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is not entirely accurate because it uses \"belief\" instead of \"probable cause.\" In most jurisdictions, for a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor, the officer must have probable cause to believe that the person committed the misdemeanor, not just any belief.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer might be option A because it incorrectly states that an officer only needs to believe that the person committed the misdemeanor, rather than requiring probable cause.\n\nTo confirm, in most legal systems, even for misdemeanors, officers need probable cause to make a warrantless arrest, not just a general belief.\n\nSo, option A is likely the incorrect circumstance for a warrantless arrest because it doesn't specify the required standard of probable cause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
