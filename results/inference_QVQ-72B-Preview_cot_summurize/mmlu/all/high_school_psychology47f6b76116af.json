                    "text": "So I have this question here about statistical procedures, and it's asking which one involves systematically combining data from multiple studies that focus on the same question and use similar variables. The options are analysis of variance, analysis of difference scores, multiple regression, and meta-analysis.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what each of these terms means and see which one fits the description.\n\nFirst, analysis of variance, or ANOVA. I remember that ANOVA is a statistical method used to test differences between two or more means. It's primarily used to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups. So, it's more about comparing means across different groups rather than combining data from multiple studies.\n\nNext, analysis of difference scores. I'm not as familiar with this term, but I think it refers to analyzing the differences between paired measurements, like before and after treatments. So, it's about looking at how much things change within subjects or conditions, not really about combining data from different studies.\n\nThen there's multiple regression. This is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. It's about understanding how the typical value of the response variable changes when any one of the predictors is varied, while the others are held fixed. Again, this seems more focused on relationships within a single dataset rather than combining data from multiple studies.\n\nLastly, there's meta-analysis. I've heard of meta-analysis before, but I'm not entirely sure what it entails. From the name, it sounds like it's an analysis of analyses, maybe? Let me think about this. Meta-analysis is a method in statistics that involves combining the results of multiple scientific studies addressing the same research question. It's like taking data from different studies and synthesizing them to get a better estimate of the effect size or to see if the results are consistent across studies.\n\nGiven that definition, it seems like meta-analysis is the procedure that matches the description in the question: systematically combining data from multiple studies focusing on the same question and using similar variables.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly consider if any of the other options could possibly fit the description.\n\nANOVA is for comparing means among groups, not for combining studies.\n\nAnalysis of difference scores is about paired comparisons within a single study, not across multiple studies.\n\nMultiple regression is about predicting a variable based on multiple predictors within a single dataset.\n\nTherefore, none of these other options involve combining data from multiple studies in the way that meta-analysis does.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. Meta-analysis.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"consists of systematically combining data from multiple studies focusing on the same question and using similar variables.\" That sounds almost like a definition of meta-analysis.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check the definitions.\n\n- Analysis of variance (ANOVA): Tests for differences among group means.\n\n- Analysis of difference scores: Examines changes within subjects or conditions.\n\n- Multiple regression: Predicts a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables.\n\n- Meta-analysis: Combines results from multiple studies to draw a conclusion about a particular research question.\n\nYes, meta-analysis is indeed the procedure that fits the description provided in the question.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is D. Meta-analysis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
