Making a determination of probable cause, the magistrate issued a warrant for the x-brand stereo at the homeowner's address. The police arrived at the homeowner's dwelling, showed him the warrant, and came inside. In the living room, they noticed a y-brand stereo, which had the serial number removed.

                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this scenario about a police search and seizure, and now there's a motion to suppress some evidence. I need to figure out which stereo or stereos should not be admitted into evidence based on the search. The options are:\n\nA. The y-brand stereo.\n\nB. The z-brand stereo.\n\nC. Both the y-brand and z-brand stereos.\n\nD. None of the stereos.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the search warrant process and the concept of probable cause. The police had reliable information that the homeowner had a stolen x-brand stereo. They submitted an affidavit to a neutral magistrate, who determined there was probable cause and issued a warrant to search for the x-brand stereo at the homeowner's address.\n\nSo, the warrant is specific: it's for the x-brand stereo at a particular address. That's important because searches need to be reasonable, and warrants are supposed to be specific to prevent general searches.\n\nWhen the police arrived, they showed the warrant to the homeowner and entered the house. In the living room, they saw a y-brand stereo with the serial number removed. They checked and found out it was stolen from a local electronics store during a recent burglary.\n\nHere's where things get a bit tricky. The warrant was for an x-brand stereo, but they found a y-brand stereo that turned out to be stolen. So, is this a valid seizure?\n\nI recall something about the plain view doctrine. If an officer is lawfully present somewhere and sees something in plain view that appears to be evidence of a crime, they can seize it without a warrant. In this case, the officers were lawfully in the living room executing the search warrant for the x-brand stereo. While there, they saw the y-brand stereo, which had its serial number removed, and upon further inspection, they determined it was stolen.\n\nSo, it seems like the y-brand stereo was seized lawfully under the plain view doctrine. It was in plain view, the officers were lawfully present, and the items seized were evidence of a crime.\n\nBut wait, the homeowner is moving to prevent its introduction into evidence. Maybe there's something wrong with the seizure.\n\nLet me think about the scope of the search. The warrant was for the x-brand stereo, but they found something else that was stolen. Does that invalidate the seizure of the y-brand stereo?\n\nI think not, because even though the warrant was for the x-brand stereo, if they come across other evidence of a crime during the lawful execution of the warrant, they can seize that evidence.\n\nMaybe I should look up the concept of \"plain view\" in this context. I found that the plain view doctrine allows officers to seize evidence without a warrant if:\n\n1. They are lawfully present at the place where the evidence can be plainly viewed.\n\n2. The evidence is in plain view.\n\n3. It is immediately apparent to the officer that the items viewed are evidence of a crime.\n\nIn this scenario, all three conditions seem to be met:\n\n1. The officers were lawfully in the living room executing the search warrant.\n\n2. The y-brand stereo was in plain view.\n\n3. The removed serial number and subsequent confirmation that it was stolen make it immediately apparent that it's evidence of a crime.\n\nSo, it seems like the seizure of the y-brand stereo is valid.\n\nBut let's see what happened next. After finding the y-brand stereo, the police arrested the homeowner and told him to stay seated while they searched the rest of the house.\n\nOne officer went to the basement and found the x-brand stereo, which was the original target of the warrant. Then, she went upstairs and found another stolen stereo, the z-brand, in the homeowner's bedroom.\n\nNow, the question is whether the search of the basement and the upstairs was lawful.\n\nThe officers were initially there to search for the x-brand stereo based on the warrant. When they found the y-brand stereo in the living room, which wasn't the target of the warrant, they arrested the homeowner and decided to search the rest of the house.\n\nWas this search lawful?\n\nWell, when someone is arrested, the police can conduct a search incident to arrest. This usually includes the area within the immediate control of the arrestee to ensure officer safety and prevent destruction of evidence.\n\nHowever, searching the entire house might be beyond what's permitted under a search incident to arrest, especially if the arrest is made inside a home.\n\nI think there might be an issue here. The search warrant was specifically for the x-brand stereo, and they found it in the basement. But then they searched the upstairs and found another stolen stereo.\n\nWait, but they went upstairs after arresting the homeowner and telling him to stay seated in the living room. Is that permissible?\n\nI recall that the Supreme Court has ruled that a search incident to arrest is limited to the area within the immediate control of the arrestee. So, if the homeowner was told to stay seated in the living room, searching the basement and upstairs might be beyond that immediate control area.\n\nThere might be a problem with the search of the upstairs where they found the z-brand stereo.\n\nBut what about the basement? The basement is where the x-brand stereo was found, which was the original target of the warrant. So, the warrant allowed them to search the entire house for the x-brand stereo, right?\n\nWait, the warrant specified the address, which is presumably the entire house. So, searching the basement for the x-brand stereo is covered by the warrant.\n\nBut then, did they have the right to search the upstairs after arresting the homeowner?\n\nAgain, searches incident to arrest are generally limited to the area within the arrestee's immediate control. So, unless there was a specific reason to believe that evidence could be destroyed upstairs or that officers were in danger, searching the upstairs might be considered beyond the scope of a search incident to arrest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they had probable cause to believe that there were more stolen items upstairs based on finding the y-brand and x-brand stereos downstairs.\n\nBut I need to think carefully about this.\n\nLet me consider the sequence:\n\n1. Police obtain a warrant to search for the x-brand stereo based on reliable information.\n\n2. They enter the house, see the y-brand stereo in plain view, which appears to be stolen.\n\n3. They arrest the homeowner and decide to search the rest of the house.\n\n4. In the basement, they find the x-brand stereo.\n\n5. Upstairs, they find the z-brand stereo.\n\nNow, the homeowner is moving to suppress the stereos.\n\nFirst, the y-brand stereo was seized under the plain view doctrine, which seems valid.\n\nThe x-brand stereo was found in the basement, which was within the scope of the original search warrant.\n\nThe z-brand stereo was found upstairs, which might be outside the scope of a search incident to arrest.\n\nSo, perhaps the z-brand stereo should be suppressed, but the y-brand and x-brand stereos should not.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. The y-brand stereo.\n\nB. The z-brand stereo.\n\nC. Both the y-brand and z-brand stereos.\n\nD. None of the stereos.\n\nGiven my analysis, it seems that only the z-brand stereo might be suppressed because its seizure might be unlawful.\n\nBut I need to double-check.\n\nIs there any other doctrine that might allow the search of the upstairs?\n\nFor example, if the police had probable cause to believe that there were more stolen items upstairs based on finding two stolen stereos downstairs, they might have had probable cause to search the upstairs without a new warrant.\n\nHowever, in practice, they would probably need to get a new warrant to search the upstairs unless there were exigent circumstances, like the belief that evidence was being destroyed upstairs.\n\nAlternatively, if they arrested the homeowner and believed that the upstairs was within his immediate control, they might argue for a search incident to arrest.\n\nBut, as I recall, the immediate control area is generally limited to the area from which the arrestee could reach to grab weapons or destroy evidence, which might not include the entire house.\n\nSo, perhaps the search of the upstairs was beyond the scope of a search incident to arrest.\n\nTherefore, the z-brand stereo might be suppressed.\n\nBut what about the y-brand stereo? It was in plain view, and the officers were lawfully present executing the warrant. It seems like a valid seizure under the plain view doctrine.\n\nSimilarly, the x-brand stereo was the target of the warrant, so its seizure is clearly valid.\n\nTherefore, only the z-brand stereo should be suppressed.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. The z-brand stereo.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other angle.\n\nMaybe the homeowner argues that finding the y-brand stereo in plain view doesn't give the police the right to arrest him and search the rest of the house without a new warrant.\n\nBut, as I understand it, if they found evidence of a crime in plain view, they could arrest the homeowner for receiving stolen property and then conduct a search incident to that arrest.\n\nHowever, as I thought earlier, the scope of that search might be limited to the area within the homeowner's immediate control.\n\nSo, unless there were exigent circumstances, searching the upstairs might be invalid.\n\nTherefore, the z-brand stereo should be suppressed.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The z-brand stereo.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
