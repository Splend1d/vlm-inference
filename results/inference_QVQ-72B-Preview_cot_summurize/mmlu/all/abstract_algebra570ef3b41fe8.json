                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\"\n\nI know that an equivalence relation on a set must satisfy three properties:\n\n1. Reflexivity: Every element is related to itself.\n\n2. Symmetry: If one element is related to another, then the other is related to the first.\n\n3. Transitivity: If one element is related to a second, and the second is related to a third, then the first is related to the third.\n\nOn the other hand, a partial ordering relation must satisfy:\n\n1. Reflexivity: Same as above.\n\n2. Antisymmetry: If one element is related to another and the other is related back, then they must be the same element.\n\n3. Transitivity: Same as above.\n\nSo, comparing these, an equivalence relation requires symmetry, while a partial ordering requires antisymmetry. These are opposites. Since symmetry and antisymmetry can coexist only in specific cases (like when all elements are related to themselves only), generally, an equivalence relation is not a partial ordering relation. There might be some sets where it could be, but generally, this statement seems false.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2} is 64.\"\n\nI recall that the number of relations from set A to set B is equal to the number of subsets of A \u00d7 B. First, I need to find the Cartesian product A \u00d7 B.\n\nA has 3 elements and B has 2, so A \u00d7 B has 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 elements. The total number of subsets of a set with 6 elements is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the number of relations from A to B is indeed 64. So, this statement is true.\n\nNow, option C: \"Empty relation is reflexive.\"\n\nReflexivity requires that every element in the set is related to itself. The empty relation contains no elements, so there are no elements related to themselves. However, if the set is non-empty, this fails because there exists at least one element that is not related to itself. Therefore, the empty relation is only reflexive on the empty set. If we're considering non-empty sets, this statement is false. But since no set is specified, it's generally false for non-empty sets.\n\nLastly, option D: \"Properties of a relation being symmetric and being unsymmetric are negatives of each other.\"\n\nSymmetry means that if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) must also be in the relation.\n\nUnsymmetry (or asymmetry) means that if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is not in the relation.\n\nSo, symmetry requires (a, b) \u2192 (b, a), and unsymmetry requires (a, b) \u2192 \u00ac(b, a).\n\nThese are indeed negations of each other. If a relation is symmetric, it cannot be unsymmetric, and vice versa. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nA. False\n\nB. True\n\nC. False (assuming the set is non-empty)\n\nD. True\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2} is 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
