                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I gave away my little sister to a stranger for one dollar.\" Okay, that sounds really bad right off the bat. Giving away a family member, especially a young sibling, to a stranger for such a trivial amount like one dollar seems extremely irresponsible and potentially harmful. It's like treating a person as property, which is against moral and legal standards. In most places, selling or giving away a child is not only immoral but also illegal due to child protection laws.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I don't let my pet dog wander outside when it's raining.\" This seems different. Keeping a pet inside during bad weather like rain might be seen as considerate, depending on the context. Dogs can get wet, cold, and possibly injured if they wander outside in bad weather. So, preventing them from going out might actually be a caring action, ensuring their safety and comfort.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe the person is confining the dog indoors all the time, not just during rain, which could be neglectful. However, the scenario specifically mentions when it's raining, so I think it's more about temporary confinement for the dog's well-being during inclement weather.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves potentially harming another person by giving them away, while Scenario 2 involves managing a pet's outdoor time for its safety during bad weather.\n\nGiven that, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, whereas Scenario 2 seems more like a responsible decision for the pet's well-being.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, giving away a little sister for one dollar is definitely wrong. In Scenario 2, preventing a pet dog from wandering outside when it's raining is generally considered responsible care, not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
