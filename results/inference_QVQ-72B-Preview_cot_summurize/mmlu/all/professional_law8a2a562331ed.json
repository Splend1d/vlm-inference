                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a woman who's lived in a state for only two months and is trying to get state-funded surgery, but there's a law that says she has to live there for a year unless it's an emergency. She's suing to say this law is invalid. The question is whether she should prevail in her action.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the different options here. Option A says no, because the law reasonably conserves the state's limited resources. Option B also says no, but for a slightly different reason: it prevents spending state funds on transient nonresidents. Then, option C says yes, because the law burdens her fundamental right to health care, and option D says yes, because it burdens her fundamental right to travel.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about constitutional law here, particularly about fundamental rights and how states can regulate access to their resources.\n\nLet me start by considering the state's interest in conserving its resources. It makes sense that a state would want to make sure its funds are used efficiently and not overburdened by people who might come just to use its services without contributing much in taxes or long-term residency. So, having a residency requirement might be a way to ensure that only people who are committed to living in the state for a certain period get certain benefits.\n\nBut, on the other hand, there are constitutional protections for individuals, including the right to travel and possibly access to health care.\n\nWait, first, I should think about whether there's a fundamental right to health care under the U.S. Constitution. I know that there are debates about this. The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, addressed some aspects of health care access, but that's a federal law, and it's not necessarily about a constitutional right.\n\nI think the Supreme Court has not recognized a fundamental right to health care per se. So, option C might not be on solid ground. But I need to check that.\n\nLet me look up some cases related to state-funded health care and residency requirements.\n\nI recall a case called Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, which was about unemployment compensation and residency requirements, but that might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAnother case that comes to mind is Shapiro v. Thompson, where the Supreme Court struck down a one-year residency requirement for receiving welfare benefits because it burdened the right to travel.\n\nIn Shapiro, the Court held that the residency requirement imposed an unconstitutional burden on the right to travel since it penalized recent migrants by denying them benefits available to longer-term residents.\n\nHmm, that sounds similar to the situation in this question. The woman has been in the state for only two months and is being denied state-funded surgery because of the residency requirement.\n\nBut in this case, it's not welfare benefits; it's medical care. Is there a difference?\n\nI need to see if the Court has made distinctions between different types of benefits regarding residency requirements.\n\nLet me think about another case, Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, which involved a hospital's policy requiring proof of residence as a condition for receiving free emergency care. The Court struck down the policy, saying it burdened the right to travel.\n\nSo, again, it seems that residency requirements for receiving certain benefits can be seen as burdening the right to travel, which is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.\n\nBut in that case, it was emergency care, and here it's non-emergency surgery. Maybe that makes a difference.\n\nThe question says that the surgery is non-emergency, but the law allows for exceptions in emergency situations. So, the state is acknowledging that in emergencies, residency shouldn't be a barrier to care.\n\nBut for non-emergency surgery, they're enforcing the one-year residency requirement.\n\nSo, the woman in this scenario doesn't qualify for the exception because her surgery is non-emergency.\n\nNow, I need to consider whether this distinction is constitutional.\n\nI think the key here is that the state is making a distinction based on the recency of residency, which can affect a person's ability to travel freely to another state without facing penalties in accessing essential services like health care.\n\nThe right to travel includes the right to travel from one state to another without being penalized by the new state for being a recent migrant.\n\nIn this case, the woman has moved to the state seeking permanent employment, which suggests she intends to stay, but she hasn't met the one-year residency requirement yet.\n\nThe state's justification is likely to conserve resources and prevent transient nonresidents from using its services.\n\nBut, based on Shapiro and Memorial Hospital, it seems that such justifications may not be sufficient to overcome the burden on the fundamental right to travel.\n\nWait, but in Shapiro, the Court did allow for some residency requirements, but they have to be narrowly tailored and serve a compelling state interest.\n\nSo, perhaps the state could argue that conserving limited resources is a compelling interest, especially for non-emergency surgeries that can be delayed until the residency requirement is met.\n\nBut, on the other hand, delaying necessary medical care could lead to worse health outcomes, which might not be in the public interest.\n\nAlso, distinguishing between emergency and non-emergency surgeries might be a way to balance the state's interest in conserving resources with the need to provide urgent care to migrants.\n\nBut, in Memorial Hospital, the Court struck down even an emergency care residency requirement.\n\nWait, but in that case, it was about free emergency care, and here it's about state-funded surgery, which might be different.\n\nI need to see if there are more recent cases that address residency requirements specifically for state-funded non-emergency surgeries.\n\nLet me think about another case, Plyler v. Doe, which involved public education and undocumented immigrant children. The Court held that denying public education to undocumented children was unconstitutional because it burdened the right to travel and equal protection.\n\nBut that's about education, not health care, and it involves undocumented immigrants, which is a different context.\n\nStill, it shows that the Court is protective of certain rights even for non-citizens or recent migrants.\n\nIn the context of health care, I recall that Medicaid has residency requirements, but I'm not sure about the constitutional aspects.\n\nWait, Medicaid is a joint federal and state program, and it does have residency requirements as a condition of eligibility.\n\nBut, again, that's a statutory requirement, not necessarily a constitutional one.\n\nBack to the question: should the woman prevail in her action to invalidate the state law?\n\nOption A says no, because the law reasonably conserves the state's limited resources.\n\nBut, based on Shapiro and Memorial Hospital, the Court has been skeptical of residency requirements that burden the right to travel, even if the state claims it's to conserve resources.\n\nOption B says no, because it prevents expenditure on transient nonresidents.\n\nBut the woman is a resident; she's just been there for less than a year.\n\nThe state might argue that she's a transient, but she's seeking permanent employment, which suggests she intends to stay.\n\nOption C says yes, because it burdens her fundamental right to health care.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, there isn't a recognized fundamental right to health care under the Constitution.\n\nOption D says yes, because it burdens her fundamental right to travel.\n\nThis seems the most plausible argument based on Shapiro and Memorial Hospital.\n\nThe right to travel includes the right to travel between states without being penalized by the new state for being a recent migrant.\n\nImposing a residency requirement for state-funded surgery could be seen as a penalty or burden on that right to travel.\n\nTherefore, the law might be unconstitutional because it burdens the fundamental right to travel.\n\nBut, I need to consider if there's a compelling state interest that justifies this burden.\n\nThe state argues that it conserves limited resources and prevents transient nonresidents from using its services.\n\nBut, in Shapiro, the Court held that these justifications weren't sufficient to outweigh the burden on the right to travel.\n\nSimilarly, in Memorial Hospital, the Court struck down a residency requirement for emergency care, again citing the burden on the right to travel.\n\nSo, perhaps the woman should prevail in her action because the law burdens her fundamental right to travel.\n\nBut, I'm a bit unsure because the surgery is non-emergency, and maybe the state can make a stronger case for delaying non-emergency surgeries until the residency requirement is met.\n\nHowever, delaying necessary medical care could exacerbate health issues, which might not be in the public interest.\n\nMoreover, distinguishing between emergency and non-emergency surgeries might not be enough to save the law from being unconstitutional if it still burdens the right to travel.\n\nPerhaps the state could argue that non-emergency surgeries can be postponed until the residency requirement is met, and thus the burden is less severe than in cases involving emergency care.\n\nBut, in Memorial Hospital, the Court was clear that even emergency care residency requirements are unconstitutional.\n\nSo, maybe the same logic applies here, and the woman should prevail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a difference between emergency and non-emergency care that allows for different treatment under the law.\n\nBut, I don't recall any Supreme Court case that makes that distinction in the context of residency requirements and the right to travel.\n\nLet me think about another angle. Suppose the woman had a medical condition that required immediate attention; would the state's exception for emergency situations cover her?\n\nIn this scenario, her surgery is non-emergency, so it doesn't qualify for the exception.\n\nBut, if her condition were to become emergency, would the state provide the funding?\n\nIf so, then perhaps the state is trying to balance its resource constraints with the need to provide urgent care.\n\nBut, again, this might not be enough to save the law from being unconstitutional.\n\nI think the best answer is option D: yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\n\nThis aligns with the Supreme Court's precedent in Shapiro and Memorial Hospital, where residency requirements that burden the right to travel have been struck down.\n\nTherefore, the woman should prevail in her action to invalidate the state law because it unconstitutionally burdens her fundamental right to travel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
