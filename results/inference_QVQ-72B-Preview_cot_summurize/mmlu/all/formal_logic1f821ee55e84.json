So, the statement is \"All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit.\" And we have the predicates:\n\n- Fx: x is a fruit\n\n- Jx: x is a jellybean\n\n- Sxy: x is sweeter than y\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. (\u2200x)[Fx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Jy \u2283 Sxy)]\n\nB. (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[(Fx \u2022 Jy) \u2022 Sxy]\n\nC. (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[Sxy \u2283 (Fy \u2022 Jx)]\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)]\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what the original statement means. It says that every jellybean is sweeter than every fruit. So, for any jellybean and any fruit, the jellybean is sweeter than that fruit.\n\nLet me try to rephrase this. For all jellybeans x, and for all fruits y, x is sweeter than y.\n\nIn logic terms, that would be:\n\n(\u2200x)(Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy))\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D looks similar:\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)]\n\nHmm, that seems promising.\n\nLet's look at option A:\n\nA. (\u2200x)[Fx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Jy \u2283 Sxy)]\n\nThis seems to say that for all x, if x is a fruit, then for all y, if y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. But wait, that's not quite right. It's saying that if x is a fruit, then for all jellybeans y, x is sweeter than y. But that's the opposite of what the original statement says. The original says that jellybeans are sweeter than fruits, not the other way around.\n\nOption B:\n\nB. (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[(Fx \u2022 Jy) \u2022 Sxy]\n\nThis is saying that for all x and all y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. Again, this is the opposite of the original statement.\n\nOption C:\n\nC. (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[Sxy \u2283 (Fy \u2022 Jx)]\n\nThis seems to say that for all x and y, if x is sweeter than y, then y is a fruit and x is a jellybean. That's not quite the same as the original statement.\n\nOption D:\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)]\n\nThis seems to say that for all x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y. That matches exactly with my initial understanding of the statement.\n\nWait a minute, is there a difference between (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[(Fx \u2022 Jy) \u2283 Sxy] and (\u2200x)[Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)]?\n\nLet me think about the scope of the quantifiers.\n\nIn option D, it's saying for all x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y.\n\nIn my initial rephrasing, I had (\u2200x)(Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)), which is similar to option D.\n\nBut looking back, option D is exactly that.\n\nWait, no, option D is (\u2200x)[Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)], which is the same as what I wrote.\n\nSo, it seems that option D is the correct translation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nOption D says: for all x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y.\n\nYes, that matches the original statement: all jellybeans are sweeter than all fruits.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any difference between (\u2200x)(Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)) and (\u2200x)(\u2200y)(Jx \u2022 Fy \u2283 Sxy).\n\nOption D is (\u2200x)[Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)], which is equivalent to (\u2200x)(Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)).\n\nIs that the same as (\u2200x)(\u2200y)(Jx \u2022 Fy \u2283 Sxy)?\n\nWell, no, because in (\u2200x)(\u2200y)(Jx \u2022 Fy \u2283 Sxy), for each x and y, if x is a jellybean and y is a fruit, then x is sweeter than y.\n\nWhereas in (\u2200x)(Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)), it's saying that for each jellybean x, it's sweeter than every fruit y.\n\nThese are logically equivalent because the quantifiers are properly scoped.\n\nSo, yes, option D is the correct translation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
