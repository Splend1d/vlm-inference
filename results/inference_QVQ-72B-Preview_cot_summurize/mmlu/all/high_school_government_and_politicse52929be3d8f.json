Negotiate treaties\n\nB. Collect taxes\n\nC. Establish a federal judiciary\n\nD. Enforce its laws\n\nHmm, I need to recall what the Articles of Confederation were all about. I know that it was the first constitution of the United States, adopted in 1781, right after the Revolutionary War. It was replaced by the current U.S. Constitution in 1789.\n\nThe Articles established a loose confederation of sovereign states, with a weak central government. Most of the power was retained by the individual states, which often led to problems in managing national affairs.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Negotiate treaties\n\nI remember that under the Articles of Confederation, the national government did have the power to conduct foreign affairs and negotiate treaties with other countries. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption B: Collect taxes\n\nWait, I think the national government under the Articles couldn't collect taxes directly from the people. Instead, it had to request funds from the state governments. The states could choose whether or not to provide those funds. So, this suggests that the national government didn't have the power to collect taxes directly.\n\nOption C: Establish a federal judiciary\n\nUnder the Articles, there was no federal judiciary system. Each state had its own court system, and there was no supreme court or system of federal courts. So, the national government couldn't establish a federal judiciary.\n\nOption D: Enforce its laws\n\nI recall that the national government under the Articles relied on the states to enforce its laws. If a state chose not to enforce a particular law, there wasn't much the national government could do about it. So, this means the national government didn't have the power to enforce its laws directly.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that option A\u2014negotiate treaties\u2014is the correct answer. The national government did have the power to negotiate treaties with other nations under the Articles of Confederation.\n\nJust to double-check, let me see if I'm missing anything. The Articles of Confederation created a Congress that could declare war, make peace, enter into treaties and alliances, and regulate relations with Native American tribes. But when it came to domestic affairs, such as taxation and enforcement of laws, the states held most of the power.\n\nSo, yes, negotiating treaties was one of the powers that the national government did possess under the Articles of Confederation. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
