                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a dance student who was working out really hard, doing stuff like leaping and bounding up stairs in her apartment building. One of the janitors warned her that she was bound to get hurt because there were problems with the floor. Unfortunately, she ended up falling due to a loose floorboard and broke her leg. Now, she's suing the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that the janitor told him, \"I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.\"\n\nThe question is whether this statement by the building owner is likely to be held admissible in court. The options are:\n\nA. Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\n\nB. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\n\nC. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.\n\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's going on here. There are a few layers to this situation.\n\nFirst, there's the dance student who was warned by a janitor about the floor being unsafe. Then, she falls and gets injured because of a loose floorboard. Now, she's suing the building owner. The building owner wants to bring in evidence that the janitor had warned the student about the dangers of running too fast.\n\nI need to think about the rules of evidence here, particularly regarding hearsay.\n\nHearsay is generally not admissible in court because it's considered less reliable. Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. There are exceptions to this rule, though.\n\nIn this case, the building owner wants to testify about what the janitor told him. So, the building owner is repeating something that someone else said. That sounds like hearsay.\n\nBut wait, the building owner is likely the defendant in this case, right? So, if the building owner is testifying about what the janitor said, and the janitor is an agent of the building owner, maybe there's some exception that applies.\n\nLet me think about the options again.\n\nOption A says yes, because it's an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\n\nHmm, spontaneous declaration is a hearsay exception, but I'm not sure if it applies here. A spontaneous declaration is typically a statement made under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition, and it must be made immediately after the event.\n\nIn this scenario, the janitor warned the student that she was bound to get hurt if she kept it up because of floor problems. That sounds like a warning based on knowledge of the floor's condition, not necessarily a spontaneous reaction to an event.\n\nMoreover, the building owner is trying to introduce the janitor's statement to the student as evidence. But wait, the building owner wants to testify that the janitor told him, \"I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.\"\n\nSo, it's actually the janitor's statement to the building owner that the building owner wants to introduce.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's break it down.\n\nThe janitor warned the student directly: \"You're bound to get hurt if you keep it up because there are problems with the floor.\"\n\nThen, the janitor told the building owner, \"I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.\"\n\nThe building owner wants to testify about what the janitor told him.\n\nSo, the building owner is testifying about the janitor's statement to him, which is the janitor's account of what he said to the student.\n\nThis seems like multiple layers of hearsay.\n\nFirst layer: the janitor's warning to the student.\n\nSecond layer: the janitor's report to the building owner about what he said to the student.\n\nNow, the building owner wants to testify about the janitor's report to him.\n\nSo, the building owner's testimony is hearsay within hearsay.\n\nGenerally, hearsay within hearsay requires that each layer be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nOption D says no, because it's hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nBut maybe there are exceptions that could apply.\n\nLet me consider if the janitor's statement to the building owner is being offered for a purpose other than proving the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nThe building owner is likely trying to show that he was aware of the floor's condition through the janitor's warning to the student.\n\nBut is that relevant to the building owner's liability?\n\nIn a negligence case like this, the building owner would be liable if he knew or should have known about the dangerous condition and failed to fix it or warn the tenant.\n\nSo, the fact that the janitor warned the student might not directly relate to the building owner's knowledge of the floor's condition.\n\nWait, but the building owner is trying to introduce evidence that the janitor told him about warning the student.\n\nIs this relevant to the building owner's knowledge or lack thereof?\n\nMaybe the building owner is trying to show that he took steps to warn the tenant once he found out about the floor's condition.\n\nBut in reality, the janitor warned the student before the accident, and the building owner found out after the fact, perhaps.\n\nWait, the timing is important here.\n\nIf the janitor warned the student before the accident and then told the building owner about it afterward, that might not help the building owner's case.\n\nBecause if the building owner knew about the floor's condition before the accident and didn't fix it, that could be negligence.\n\nUnless the building owner can show that he didn't know about the condition until after the accident.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe the building owner is trying to show that he had no actual knowledge of the floor's condition until after the accident, and that the janitor's warning to the student was the first indication of a problem.\n\nBut even then, if the janitor warned the student, that might imply that the floor was known to be dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the building owner is trying to argue that the student was warned and chose to ignore the warning, contributing to her own injury.\n\nThat could be a defense of comparative negligence or assumption of risk.\n\nBut even then, the janitor's warning to the student is still hearsay if the janitor isn't testifying.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, it's the building owner testifying about what the janitor told him.\n\nSo, unless the janitor is testifying, introducing the janitor's statement through the building owner would be hearsay.\n\nUnless there's an exception that applies.\n\nOption B says yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\n\nBut that doesn't address whether the statement is admissible hearsay or not.\n\nJust because the building owner can testify about it doesn't mean the statement itself is admissible.\n\nOption C says no, because it's irrelevant and immaterial.\n\nIs it irrelevant?\n\nWell, if the building owner is trying to show that he had no knowledge of the floor's condition until after the accident, and the janitor's warning to the student was prior to the accident, then the building owner's knowledge of that warning (if after the accident) might be relevant.\n\nBut if the building owner is trying to introduce the janitor's statement to the student through his own testimony, that seems problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the building owner is trying to establish that the janitor had warned the student, and therefore the student was aware of the danger.\n\nBut again, that's hearsay unless the janitor testifies.\n\nWait, maybe the building owner is trying to introduce the janitor's statement as an admission by a party-opponent.\n\nIn civil cases, statements by a party's agent or employee can be admissible against the party.\n\nBut in this case, the janitor is the building owner's agent, so his statements could be admissible against the building owner.\n\nBut the building owner is trying to use the janitor's statement to his advantage.\n\nThat might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the janitor's statement to the student is being offered not for its truth, but to show that the student was warned.\n\nBut even then, it's still hearsay if the truth of the statement is relevant.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the purpose for which the statement is being offered.\n\nIf the building owner is trying to show that the janitor warned the student, and that warning is relevant to the student's knowledge of the danger, then the statement might be admissible for that purpose.\n\nBut it's still hearsay, so it needs an exception.\n\nOption A mentions a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\n\nI'm not sure if that fits here.\n\nThe janitor's warning to the student doesn't seem like a spontaneous declaration under stress; it's more of a caution based on knowledge of the floor's condition.\n\nAnd it's not necessarily being offered against an opponent-party in the way that admissions are treated.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the janitor's statement as an admission by a party's agent.\n\nBut again, that would make it admissible against the building owner, not for the building owner.\n\nWait, no, if the janitor is the building owner's agent, then his statements can be admissible against the building owner.\n\nBut the building owner is trying to use the janitor's statement to his advantage.\n\nThat might not fly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the building owner is trying to introduce the janitor's statement as part of his own state of mind.\n\nLike, he's testifying that he didn't know about the floor's condition until after the accident, and the janitor told him about warning the student after the accident.\n\nIn that case, the janitor's statement to the building owner might be relevant to the building owner's state of mind after the accident.\n\nBut that still seems like hearsay.\n\nUnless there's an exception for statements made in furtherance of a common interest or something like that.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently.\n\nSuppose the building owner is trying to establish that he had no actual knowledge of the floor's defect until after the accident.\n\nHe wants to introduce the janitor's statement to show that the janitor warned the student, implying that the janitor knew about the floor's condition, but the building owner didn't.\n\nBut again, the janitor's statement is hearsay unless the janitor testifies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the building owner is trying to introduce the janitor's statement as part of a course of conduct or to show that he took steps to warn the tenant.\n\nBut it still seems like hearsay.\n\nI think the best answer here is Option D: No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nUnless there's a specific exception that I'm missing, it seems like introducing the janitor's statement through the building owner would require multiple layers of exceptions to be admissible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
