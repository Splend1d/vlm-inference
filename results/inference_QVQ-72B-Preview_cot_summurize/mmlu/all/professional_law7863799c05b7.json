After six months, the lawyer was very impressed with the law student's work. He called the law student into his office and told him, \"I know you were only to work for me for six months in exchange for credit in your law school extemship program. However, I'd like you to stay on as a clerk. I'll pay you $25 an hour for any work you do for me between now and the bar exam. In addition, if you put in a minimum of 10 hours per week during that time, I promise to hire you full-time as an associate when you pass the bar exam. \" The attorney then reduced this agreement to writing, which both he and the law student signed. The law student continued to work for the lawyer throughout the rest of his law school career and while he was studying for the bar exam. During that time, the law student always worked a minimum of 10 hours per week. While the law student was awaiting the results of the bar exam, his uncle passed away and left him a large apartment building. The law student decided he did not want to practice law but wanted to spend all of his time managing the apartment building. He told his roommate, a fellow law student who was awaiting his bar results, about his plans and told the roommate he would assign to the roommate the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate, in exchange for $100. The roommate paid the $100 to the law student, who then executed a written assignment of the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate. The roommate passed the bar exam, but the lawyer refused to hire him as an associate. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal effect of this assignment?\n\nA. The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment so that the roommate would be entitled to be hired as an associate.\nB. The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and professional capacity to perform satisfactory work.\nC.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out which statement is the most accurate regarding the legal effect of this assignment. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a law student who clerked for a lawyer for six months as part of an externship program. After six months, the lawyer was impressed and offered the student a continued clerkship at $25 an hour, with the condition that if the student worked a minimum of 10 hours per week until the bar exam, the lawyer promised to hire the student full-time as an associate upon passing the bar.\n\nThey put this agreement in writing, both signed it, and the student kept working, always doing at least 10 hours a week. After law school and while waiting for bar results, the student inherits an apartment building from his uncle and decides not to practice law but to manage the building instead. He tells his roommate, another law student waiting for bar results, about his plans and offers to assign his right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate in exchange for $100. The roommate pays the $100, and the student writes an assignment of this right to the roommate.\n\nThe roommate passes the bar, but the lawyer refuses to hire him as an associate. Now, I need to determine which statement accurately describes the legal effect of this assignment.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment so that the roommate would be entitled to be hired as an associate.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure about this. The original agreement was between the lawyer and the student, and now the student is trying to assign his right to be hired to someone else. I think there are rules about assigning contractual rights and duties.\n\nOption B adds that the lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment but could demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate regarding his willingness and professional capacity to perform satisfactory work.\n\nThis seems similar to option A but with an added condition about assurances of performance. Maybe the lawyer can require some assurance that the roommate can perform the job adequately.\n\nOption C states that the lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment of rights because a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not an assignment.\n\nWait, the student assigned his right to be hired, which is a future right, since it's contingent on passing the bar. Maybe assignments of future rights are not valid unless there's a present assignment of an existing right.\n\nOption D says that the lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment because neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are properly assignable.\n\nThis seems like another possible answer. The agreement between the lawyer and the student was for personal services\u2014clerking and potentially working as an associate. Generally, personal service contracts are not assignable because they rely on the unique skills or attributes of the person performing the service.\n\nLet me think more carefully about this.\n\nFirst, in contract law, assignments of rights are generally permissible unless the contract prohibits it or the nature of the right makes assignment impracticable.\n\nIn this case, the original agreement between the lawyer and the student was to hire the student as an associate upon passing the bar, provided the student met certain work requirements.\n\nThe student then assigned his right to be hired to his roommate in exchange for $100.\n\nNow, the question is whether this assignment is valid and enforceable against the lawyer.\n\nI need to consider a few things:\n\n1. Was the right to be hired assignable?\n\n2. Did the assignment need to be in writing?\n\n3. Is there any prohibition in the original contract against assignment?\n\n4. Are personal service contracts assignable?\n\nLet's tackle these one by one.\n\nFirst, was the right to be hired assignable?\n\nThe original agreement was that if the student worked a minimum of 10 hours per week until the bar exam, the lawyer promised to hire him as an associate upon passing the bar.\n\nSo, the student had a conditional right to be hired, contingent on passing the bar and having met the work requirements.\n\nGenerally, rights to receive benefits under a contract are assignable unless the contract specifically prohibits it or the nature of the right makes assignment impracticable.\n\nIn this case, there's no mention that the original contract prohibited assignment.\n\nSo, unless there's some other reason why the right couldn't be assigned, it seems like it could be assigned.\n\nBut wait, the job is a personal service position. Hiring someone as an associate typically involves personal services, like legal work, which relies on the individual's skills and judgment.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, personal service contracts are not assignable because the person performing the services is essential to the contract.\n\nSo, perhaps the lawyer could argue that since the agreement was specifically with the student, and not with anyone else, assigning the right to be hired to someone else is not valid.\n\nThat would support option D.\n\nBut let's think deeper.\n\nIs the right to be hired the same as the duty to perform services?\n\nAssigning the right to be hired might be different from assigning the duty to perform the job.\n\nIf the student assigned his right to be hired, that means that the lawyer would have to hire the roommate instead of the student.\n\nBut the agreement was with the student, not the roommate.\n\nThe lawyer might have based his decision to hire the student on the student's abilities, work ethic, or other personal qualities.\n\nIf the student assigns his right to be hired to someone else, the lawyer might not agree because he didn't agree to hire that person.\n\nMoreover, personal service contracts are generally not assignable because the promisor's performance is based on their unique skills or attributes.\n\nSo, if the original agreement was for the student to work as an associate, and now someone else is trying to step into that position, the lawyer might have a valid reason to refuse.\n\nTherefore, option D seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider option C as well.\n\nOption C says that the lawyer wouldn't have to recognize the assignment because a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not an assignment.\n\nIn this scenario, the student assigned his right to be hired upon passing the bar.\n\nBut the bar exam hadn't been taken yet, so it was a future right.\n\nGenerally, one can assign a right to receive benefits that are contingent or conditional, as long as the condition is met.\n\nHere, the condition was passing the bar, which the roommate did.\n\nSo, perhaps the assignment is valid because the condition was met.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps the lawyer could argue that since the right was contingent on passing the bar, and the student assigned it before passing the bar, the assignment might not be valid until the condition was satisfied.\n\nHowever, once the condition is satisfied (the roommate passed the bar), the assignment might become effective.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe option C is also a possible answer, but I need to think more about it.\n\nOption B mentions that the lawyer could demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate.\n\nThis seems reasonable because, even if the assignment is valid, the lawyer might want to ensure that the roommate is capable and willing to perform the job adequately.\n\nBut again, personal service contracts are typically not assignable, so the lawyer might not be bound to recognize the assignment in the first place.\n\nSo, if option D is correct, then the lawyer doesn't have to recognize the assignment, and thus, demanding assurances of performance wouldn't be necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, if the assignment is valid, then perhaps the lawyer could require some assurances before proceeding.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me look at option A again.\n\nOption A says that the lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment so that the roommate would be entitled to be hired as an associate.\n\nBut if personal service contracts are not assignable, as option D suggests, then the lawyer wouldn't have to recognize the assignment.\n\nSo, option A seems incorrect based on that.\n\nOption B adds the part about demanding assurances of performance.\n\nIf the assignment is valid, then perhaps the lawyer can require some assurances, but again, if the assignment isn't valid, then this point is moot.\n\nOption C says that the assignment of a future right isn't valid, but in this case, the condition (passing the bar) was met, so perhaps the assignment becomes valid.\n\nBut I'm still leaning towards option D because of the personal service nature of the contract.\n\nI think the key here is that the original agreement was for personal services, and such contracts are generally not assignable.\n\nTherefore, the lawyer wouldn't be required to recognize the assignment, and option D is the most accurate statement.\n\nTo summarize, since the agreement to hire the student as an associate involved personal services, and personal service contracts are not assignable, the lawyer is not bound to recognize the assignment to the roommate.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
