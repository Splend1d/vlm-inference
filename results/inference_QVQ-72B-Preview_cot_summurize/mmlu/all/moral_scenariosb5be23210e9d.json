                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I drank four glasses of wine before driving to work.\" Hmm, drinking and driving is a big no-no, right? I mean, alcohol can impair your judgment and reaction time, which makes driving dangerous for both you and others on the road. Four glasses of wine sound like a significant amount; it's probably enough to make someone drunk. In fact, the legal limit for blood alcohol concentration while driving in the US is around 0.08%, and four glasses of wine could easily put you over that limit, depending on various factors like body weight and how quickly you drank them.\n\nMoreover, drinking and driving is not only illegal but also ethically irresponsible. It shows a disregard for the safety of others. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems pretty clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wanted to feed the bird so I threw a loaf of bread directly at the bird.\" Okay, this one is a bit trickier. The intention was to feed the bird, which seems harmless and even kind. But the method used\u2014throwing a loaf of bread directly at the bird\u2014raises some concerns. Throwing something directly at an animal, especially with the force needed to reach it, could be harmful. The bird might get injured by the impact, or the bread could be harmful if not consumed properly.\n\nAdditionally, feeding wild animals, especially birds, with human food like bread can be problematic. Bread isn't part of a bird's natural diet and can actually be harmful to their health in the long run. It might fill them up but doesn't provide the necessary nutrients they need. Also, encouraging birds to approach humans for food can lead to larger issues, like aggression or dependency on human-provided food sources.\n\nSo, while the intention was good, the action taken might not be the best approach and could potentially cause harm, either directly through the act of throwing or indirectly through providing inappropriate food.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong due to the direct risk it poses to public safety and the irresponsible behavior of drinking and driving. Scenario 2, while having good intentions, involves actions that could potentially harm the bird or lead to larger ecological issues, but it's not as clearly and directly wrong as Scenario 1.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe in some contexts, throwing bread at a bird could be seen as playful or harmless, but considering the potential harm, it's still not the right thing to do.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the severity of each action. Drinking and driving is a serious offense with potential fatal consequences, whereas throwing bread at a bird is less severe and more about poor judgment. But the question is asking for what is clearly morally wrong, not necessarily the degree of wrongness.\n\nPerhaps the key here is \"clearly morally wrong.\" Drinking and driving is universally recognized as wrong due to its dangers, while throwing bread at a bird might be seen as a mistake or an ill-advised action but not necessarily clearly morally wrong in the same way.\n\nBut I still feel that throwing something at an animal, even if it's food, is not acceptable behavior. It's disrespectful to the animal and could cause it harm. However, compared to drinking and driving, which endangers human lives, it might be seen as less morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both actions are considered morally wrong, but for different reasons. Drinking and driving is wrong because it endangers others, while throwing bread at a bird is wrong because it's potentially harmful to the animal and not the right way to feed wildlife.\n\nBut then, in ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, would both be considered clearly morally wrong? I think drinking and driving definitely is, and throwing bread at a bird might be seen as a lesser wrong, perhaps more of a poor choice rather than a clear moral wrong.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. Maybe I should look at it this way: if I were to judge these actions based on their intentions and consequences, drinking and driving has clear negative intentions (knowingly impairing oneself before operating a vehicle) and potential severe consequences. Throwing bread at a bird has benign intentions (feeding the bird) but potentially negative consequences due to poor execution.\n\nIn that case, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more of a well-intentioned but misguided action.\n\nSo, according to that reasoning, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong. But I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider if there are any laws or regulations against feeding wildlife in certain ways. For example, in some places, it's illegal to feed wild animals, especially if it endangers them or disrupts their natural behavior.\n\nIf that's the case, then throwing bread at a bird could be against the law, making it morally wrong in that context. However, without specific knowledge of such laws in every jurisdiction in the US as of 2020, I can't be certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the moral wrongness comes from the potential harm caused, regardless of legal standings. In that case, both actions could be considered morally wrong because they both pose potential harm to others or to animals.\n\nBut again, I think the degree of harm and the clarity with which these actions are viewed differ. Drinking and driving is unequivocally wrong, whereas throwing bread at a bird might be seen as a mistake or ignorance rather than malice.\n\nMaybe I should think about it in terms of moral culpability. In Scenario 1, the person is making a conscious choice to engage in a dangerous activity, knowing the risks involved. In Scenario 2, the person is trying to do something good but goes about it in a potentially harmful way.\n\nSo, in terms of moral wrongness, Scenario 1 is a deliberate choice to act recklessly, while Scenario 2 is a misguided attempt at doing something good.\n\nGiven that, I still lean towards B. Wrong, Not wrong. Because while Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, Scenario 2 is more of a poor choice that might not be seen as clearly morally wrong in the same way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both are considered morally wrong, but for different reasons. Drinking and driving is wrong because it endangers others intentionally, and throwing bread at a bird is wrong because it's disrespectful to the animal and could cause harm through negligence.\n\nBut even then, I think the first scenario is more clearly and severely wrong compared to the second.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Based on my reasoning, I'll go with B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
