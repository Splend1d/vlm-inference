                    "text": "So I have this hypothesis test problem here. It says that P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true) is 0.05, and P(failing to reject H0 when H0 is false) is 0.26. And I need to find the power of the test. The options are 0.26, 0.05, 0.95, or 0.74.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the power of a test is. I think power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. So, it's like 1 minus the probability of a type II error.\n\nLet me list out the probabilities given:\n\n- P(rejecting H0 | H0 is true) = 0.05 \u2192 This is the significance level, \u03b1 (type I error)\n\n- P(failing to reject H0 | H0 is false) = 0.26 \u2192 This is \u03b2, the type II error\n\nAnd I need to find the power of the test, which is 1 - \u03b2, right?\n\nSo, if \u03b2 is 0.26, then power should be 1 - 0.26 = 0.74.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI know that power is the probability of detecting an effect when there is an effect to be detected. So, it's the probability of rejecting H0 when H1 is true.\n\nGiven that P(failing to reject H0 | H1 is true) is 0.26, then P(rejecting H0 | H1 is true) should be 1 - 0.26 = 0.74.\n\nSo, that seems to match up.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about the four possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Correct decision:** H0 is true, and we fail to reject H0.\n\n2. **Type I error:** H0 is true, but we reject H0. This probability is \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\n3. **Type II error:** H0 is false, but we fail to reject H0. This probability is \u03b2 = 0.26.\n\n4. **Correct decision:** H0 is false, and we reject H0. This probability is 1 - \u03b2.\n\nSo, the power of the test is indeed 1 - \u03b2, which is 0.74.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other information I should consider? Maybe the significance level \u03b1 affects the power somehow, but in this case, it seems that \u03b2 is directly given, so I can directly calculate 1 - \u03b2.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. 0.26 \u2192 That's \u03b2, the type II error, not the power.\n\nB. 0.05 \u2192 That's \u03b1, the type I error, not the power.\n\nC. 0.95 \u2192 That might be 1 - \u03b1, which is the confidence level, but not directly related to power.\n\nD. 0.74 \u2192 Which is 1 - \u03b2, the power of the test.\n\nSo, based on this, D. 0.74 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are related in some way that affects the power. In general statistics, power depends on various factors like sample size, effect size, significance level, and so on, but in this specific problem, it seems that \u03b2 is directly given, so calculating 1 - \u03b2 should give the power.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes power is calculated using the standard normal distribution or other distributions, but given the information here, it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me see if there's any trick here. Maybe the problem is trying to mislead by giving both \u03b1 and \u03b2, but actually, to find power, only \u03b2 is necessary since power is 1 - \u03b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some contexts, power could be related to \u03b1 in a different way, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should be 0.74, which is option D.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the definition again: Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the probability of failing to reject H0 when H0 is false is 0.26, then the probability of rejecting H0 when H0 is false is indeed 1 - 0.26 = 0.74.\n\nTherefore, the power of the test is 0.74.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 0.74.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
