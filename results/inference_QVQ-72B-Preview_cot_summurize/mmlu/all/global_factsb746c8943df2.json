                    "text": "So I need to figure out what percentage of India's GDP came from agriculture in 2015. The options are 8%, 16%, 32%, and 64%. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced by a country in a year. It's a measure of economic performance. Agriculture is one sector that contributes to this total, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage for India in 2015.\n\nI recall that India is a large agricultural producer; after all, it's got a big landmass and a lot of farmland. But does that mean it contributes a high percentage to GDP? Let me think about this.\n\nI think agriculture is important in India, but I'm not sure how dominant it is compared to other sectors like manufacturing or services. Maybe I should look at some data to get a better idea.\n\nWait, perhaps I can recall some general trends. I remember that in many developing countries, agriculture tends to make up a larger share of GDP because their economies are more reliant on farming and related activities. India is considered a developing country, so maybe agriculture is a significant part of its economy.\n\nBut then again, India has also seen a lot of growth in the service sector, like IT and business services, which might have reduced agriculture's share of GDP over time.\n\nLet me consider some numbers. If agriculture was 64% of GDP, that seems really high. I don't think it's that much. Similarly, 32% seems a bit on the high side, but maybe possible.\n\n8% seems too low. I think in some advanced economies, agriculture is around 1-2% of GDP, but India is larger than that.\n\nSo between 8%, 16%, 32%, and 64%, I'm leaning towards 16% or 32%. I need to narrow it down.\n\nMaybe I should think about the composition of India's economy. I know that India has a large and diverse economy with sectors like agriculture, industry, and services.\n\nI think the service sector is the largest in India, followed by industry and then agriculture. But I'm not sure about the exact percentages.\n\nIf services are the largest, then agriculture might be a smaller percentage. So if services are, say, 50% of GDP, and industry is 30%, then agriculture would be the remaining 20%. But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, maybe I can recall some specific figures. I think in the early 2000s, agriculture was around 20-25% of India's GDP. But that was more than a decade ago, and things might have changed since then.\n\nGiven that India has been experiencing rapid economic growth, especially in the service sector and manufacturing, it's likely that agriculture's share has decreased over time.\n\nSo, if in the early 2000s it was around 20-25%, and considering the growth in other sectors, maybe by 2015, it was down to around 15-20%.\n\nLooking back at the options, 16% seems to fit into that range. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's still higher, like 32%. That seems a bit high, but perhaps not impossible.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the importance of agriculture in India's economy. Agriculture employs a large portion of the workforce in India, especially in rural areas. I think around 50% of the workforce is employed in agriculture.\n\nBut just because a lot of people work in agriculture doesn't necessarily mean that it contributes a correspondingly large percentage to GDP. Productivity and value added per worker might be lower in agriculture compared to other sectors.\n\nSo, even if half the workforce is in agriculture, the sector might only contribute, say, 15-20% to GDP.\n\nThat again points towards the 16% option.\n\nBut I should consider if there's any data that suggests a higher percentage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the trend over time. If agriculture's share has been decreasing, then perhaps in 2015, it was around 16%.\n\nOn the other hand, if it has been increasing, maybe it's higher.\n\nI don't think it's 64%, that seems too high. And 8% seems too low.\n\nMaybe I should look at some references. I recall that the World Bank provides data on sectoral contributions to GDP.\n\nIf I recall correctly, in 2015, India's GDP was composed of something like:\n\n- Services: around 50%\n\n- Industry: around 30%\n\n- Agriculture: around 15-20%\n\nWhich would put agriculture at around 15-20%, which is closest to 16% among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's higher. Maybe around 20%.\n\nBut since 32% is higher than that, and 16% is lower, I need to decide.\n\nI think 16% is a reasonable estimate based on the trends I've heard about.\n\nSo, my answer is B. 16%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 16\\%} \\]"
