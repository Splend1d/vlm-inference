                    "text": "So I've got this question here about President George H.W. Bush's \"new world order\" speech from 1990. The question is asking which of four options\u2014The Monroe Doctrine, Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick,\" Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, or the Containment policy toward the Soviet Union\u2014most directly resembles Bush's \"new world order.\" I need to figure out which one of these historical concepts or policies is most similar to what Bush was proposing in his speech.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what Bush meant by \"new world order.\" From the excerpt, it seems like he's talking about a shift in global politics where the old East-West confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union is no longer the defining feature. Instead, he envisions a new partnership among nations that can work together to prevent aggression and promote peace, justice, and harmony.\n\nSo, the \"new world order\" is about international cooperation, moving past the Cold War divisions, and creating a more stable and peaceful global community.\n\nNow, I need to look at each of the options and see which one aligns most closely with this idea.\n\nOption A is the Monroe Doctrine. I remember that the Monroe Doctrine was a policy stated by President James Monroe in 1823, which essentially said that European powers should not interfere in the affairs of the newly independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. In return, the US promised to stay out of European conflicts. Over time, it became a foundational principle of US foreign policy toward Latin America.\n\nBut does this resemble the \"new world order\"? The Monroe Doctrine was more about keeping Europe out of the Americas and limiting outside interference in the region. It was largely a unilateral statement by the US, not a multilateral effort involving many countries working together. The \"new world order\" seems to be about greater international cooperation and partnership, not about excluding certain powers from specific regions. So, this doesn't seem like the best fit.\n\nOption B is Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick.\" This refers to Roosevelt's foreign policy approach, which he summarized with the phrase \"speak softly and carry a big stick.\" Essentially, it meant that the US should be prepared with military might but use diplomacy and soft power whenever possible. This was a policy that emphasized strength and the willingness to use force if necessary, but also tried to avoid unnecessary conflicts through diplomacy.\n\nComparing this to the \"new world order,\" Roosevelt's approach was more about the US projecting its power and using it as a deterrent or a tool for achieving its goals. The \"new world order\" seems to be more about collaborative efforts among nations, not just the US using its military might. While both involve concepts of peace and security, the methods and emphasis are quite different. So, this might not be the best match either.\n\nOption C is Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. These were a set of principles outlined by President Wilson in 1918 as a basis for ending World War I and preventing future wars. The points covered things like freedom of the seas, reduction of armaments, self-determination for nations, and the establishment of a league of nations to maintain peace.\n\nThis sounds interesting because it's about creating a more peaceful and cooperative international order, similar to what Bush is describing. The league of nations was an early attempt at a global organization to prevent conflicts, which parallels the idea of the United Nations playing a central role in maintaining peace and security, as Bush mentions.\n\nMoreover, both Wilson's Fourteen Points and Bush's \"new world order\" seem to emphasize multilateralism and international cooperation to achieve common goals. They both look towards a more interconnected and collaborative world where nations work together to solve problems and prevent aggression.\n\nOption D is the Containment policy toward the Soviet Union. This was a strategy adopted by the US during the Cold War to prevent the spread of communism. It involved supporting anti-communist governments and movements around the world, often through economic aid, political pressure, and sometimes military intervention.\n\nThis policy was largely focused on the US-Soviet rivalry and the ideological battle between capitalism and communism. It was a bipolar world order centered on the competition between these two superpowers.\n\nComparing this to the \"new world order,\" which is about moving past the East-West divide and creating a more cooperative and multipolar world, the containment policy seems quite different. The \"new world order\" is about reducing tensions and working together, whereas containment was about containing and countering a specific ideological threat.\n\nSo, after considering all four options, it seems that Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points are the most similar to President Bush's \"new world order.\" Both propose a vision of international cooperation, multilateralism, and the establishment of institutions to maintain peace and prevent aggression. They both reflect an idealistic approach to global governance and the hope for a more peaceful and just world order.\n\nI think the answer is C. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
