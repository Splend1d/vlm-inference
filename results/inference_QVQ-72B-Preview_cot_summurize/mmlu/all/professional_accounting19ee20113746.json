                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about CPA liability. It says that if a CPA recklessly departs from the standards of due care when conducting an audit, the CPA will be liable to third parties who are unknown to the CPA under the law of... and then there are four options: strict liability, breach of contract, negligence, or gross negligence.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what it means for a CPA to recklessly depart from the standards of due care. I think this means that the CPA didn't follow the professional standards or was careless in performing the audit. CPAs are expected to carry out audits with a certain level of care and competence, right? So if they don't, and it causes harm to someone who relies on the audit report, they could be held liable.\n\nNow, the question is about third parties who are unknown to the CPA. That probably means that the CPA didn't have a direct contract or relationship with these parties. So, normally, in contract law, if there's no contract between two parties, then one party can't sue the other for breach of contract. But, there might be other legal theories that allow third parties to sue for other types of liability.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Strict liability: This is a legal doctrine where someone can be held liable for certain actions without having to prove fault or negligence. For example, in some product liability cases, if a product is defective and causes harm, the manufacturer can be held strictly liable, meaning they're responsible even if they weren't negligent. However, in the context of professional services like auditing, strict liability is not commonly applied. Usually, professionals are judged based on their level of care and whether they met the standards of their profession.\n\nB. Breach of contract: As I thought earlier, since there's no direct contract between the CPA and these third parties, it's unlikely that third parties can sue for breach of contract. Breach of contract typically requires that there's a contractual relationship between the parties, and one party failed to fulfill their obligations under that contract. So, if a third party wasn't a party to the contract, they generally can't sue for breach of contract.\n\nC. Negligence: Negligence is a tort law concept where someone fails to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would under similar circumstances, and that failure causes foreseeable harm to another person. In the context of CPAs and audits, if a CPA doesn't follow proper auditing standards and that leads to incorrect financial statements that third parties rely on and suffer harm as a result, the CPA could be liable for negligence. However, there might be limitations based on whether the CPA could have foreseen that unknown third parties would rely on the audit report.\n\nD. Gross negligence: Gross negligence is a more severe form of negligence where the conduct shows a reckless disregard for the rights of others or a complete indifference to the consequences of one's actions. It's beyond ordinary negligence and involves a conscious and voluntary disregard for the need to use reasonable care. In some jurisdictions, gross negligence can lead to higher damages or different types of liability.\n\nGiven that the question specifies that the CPA \"recklessly\" departs from standards of due care, it seems like the conduct is more than just ordinary negligence. Recklessness implies a higher degree of carelessness or indifference to the consequences, which could align with gross negligence.\n\nBut, I need to think about this more carefully. The question is asking under which law the CPA would be liable to unknown third parties. So, it's not about the degree of care or the conduct of the CPA as much as it is about the legal basis for the third parties to sue.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider both the conduct and the legal theory. If a CPA recklessly departs from due care standards, that could be considered gross negligence, and under some laws, third parties can sue for gross negligence even if they're unknown.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some cases, CPAs have been held liable to third parties under negligence theories, even if the third parties weren't directly contracting parties. For example, in the Ultramares case, the court held that auditors could be liable to foreseeable third parties who rely on their audit reports.\n\nBut, in that case, it was ordinary negligence, not gross negligence. So, maybe in cases where the CPA's conduct is particularly reckless, the liability might be based on gross negligence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps strict liability applies in such cases, but as I thought earlier, strict liability isn't typically applied to professional services like auditing.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If the CPA is reckless, that's a pretty serious departure from professional standards. Recklessness is often seen as a higher level of fault compared to ordinary negligence. In many legal systems, higher levels of fault can lead to different types of liability or different remedies.\n\nSo, if a CPA is reckless in performing an audit, and that recklessness causes harm to unknown third parties who rely on the audit report, it's possible that the third parties could sue for gross negligence.\n\nBut, I need to make sure. Maybe I should look up some case law or legal principles related to CPA liability to third parties.\n\nI remember that in some jurisdictions, there's a privity of contract doctrine, which says that only parties to a contract can sue for breach of contract. So, third parties who aren't part of the contract between the CPA firm and the client can't sue for breach of contract.\n\nIn tort law, however, third parties can sometimes sue for negligence if they can show that they were foreseeable users or relyers on the audit report.\n\nMoreover, in cases involving professional malpractice, like accounting, architects, or lawyers, courts sometimes allow third parties to sue for negligence if certain conditions are met, such as the professional knowing that the third parties would rely on their work.\n\nBut, again, in this question, the third parties are unknown to the CPA, so the CPA might not have foreseen that these specific third parties would rely on the audit report.\n\nHowever, if the CPA's conduct was reckless, meaning they showed a conscious disregard for the risks, then perhaps the law imposes liability even to unknown third parties.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the Restatement of Torts or similar legal authorities.\n\nI think there's a principle that professionals owe a duty of care to foreseeable third parties who might rely on their professional opinions or work products.\n\nSo, in the case of an audit, the CPA knows that the audit report will be used by various parties, such as investors, lenders, and other stakeholders, even if they don't know them by name.\n\nTherefore, the CPA has a duty to perform the audit carefully to protect those foreseeable relyers.\n\nIf the CPA recklessly departs from due care standards, they breach that duty, and third parties who rely on the audit report can sue for negligence.\n\nBut, since the conduct is reckless, which is more than ordinary negligence, perhaps it falls under gross negligence.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if gross negligence is a separate legal basis for liability or just a degree of negligence that affects the amount of damages awarded.\n\nIn some legal systems, gross negligence can lead to punitive damages or other enhanced remedies.\n\nBut, the question is asking under which law the CPA would be liable, not about the remedies.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is C. Negligence, because it's the general tort law principle that covers such situations, and gross negligence is just a more severe form of negligence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the law considers gross negligence as a separate basis for liability.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLet me see if I can find any specific legal precedents or rules that address CPA liability to third parties in cases of reckless conduct.\n\nI recall that in the case of Ultramares Corp. v. Touche, 255 N.Y. 170 (1931), the court held that auditors are not liable to an indefinite class of persons who might rely on their audit reports. However, in later cases, like Shin v. Arthur Andersen, LLP, 327 F.3d 382 (5th Cir. 2003), courts have expanded the scope of liability to include third parties who are foreseeable relyers.\n\nBut, again, these cases typically involve ordinary negligence, not gross negligence.\n\nPerhaps in cases of gross negligence, the liability is broader, and unknown third parties can sue under the law of gross negligence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the law imposes strict liability in such cases, but I still think that's unlikely for professional services.\n\nWait, no, strict liability is generally reserved for ultra-hazardous activities or product liability, not for professional malpractice.\n\nSo, probably not A. Strict liability.\n\nB. Breach of contract doesn't apply because there's no contract between the CPA and the third parties.\n\nC. Negligence seems plausible, as it's the general tort law that covers harm caused by careless conduct.\n\nD. Gross negligence might also be applicable, given the reckless conduct, but it might not be a separate legal basis for liability.\n\nPerhaps the answer is C. Negligence, and gross negligence is just a subset of negligence that involves a higher degree of fault.\n\nIn that case, if a CPA is found to have acted with gross negligence, they would still be liable under the law of negligence, and the gross negligence might affect the type or amount of damages awarded.\n\nSo, in conclusion, under the law of negligence, the CPA would be liable to unknown third parties for recklessly departing from due care standards during an audit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
