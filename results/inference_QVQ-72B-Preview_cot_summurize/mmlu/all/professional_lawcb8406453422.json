                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. There's a 12-year-old girl playing catch with a baseball in a park. She throws the ball too far, and it hits a woman's straw hat, knocking it off her head. The woman falls from her chair and breaks her arm. Now, the woman wants to sue the girl to recover damages for her injury. The question is asking what the woman can recover for: assault, battery, both, or nothing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal concepts of assault and battery. Assault is generally defined as the threat or attempt to inflict harm on someone, while battery is the actual infliction of harm through physical contact. So, assault is more about the intention to cause harm, and battery is about the actual harm caused by touching someone without their consent.\n\nIn this scenario, the girl threw the ball, and it hit the woman's hat, which was on her head. The woman didn't see the ball coming, but she was startled by it and fell, breaking her arm. Now, did the girl intend to hit the woman? Probably not, since she was just playing catch. But accidents happen, especially when playing sports.\n\nLet me think about assault first. For assault, there needs to be an intentional act that causes apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. In this case, the woman didn't see the ball coming, so she didn't have time to apprehend or fear any contact. So, it seems like the element of apprehension is missing here. Therefore, it's unlikely that the woman can recover for assault because one of the key elements isn't met.\n\nNow, for battery. Battery requires an intentional touching of another person without their consent that causes harm or offense. The girl threw the ball, which hit the woman's hat, causing the hat to fall off, and as a result, the woman fell and broke her arm. The touching was indirect, through the hat, but it still caused the woman to fall and get injured.\n\nBut here's the thing: was the girl's action intentional in the sense that she meant to hit the woman? No, she was just playing catch. So, her intent was to play, not to hit the woman. In tort law, battery usually requires that the defendant intended to cause contact or was reckless in doing so.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look into the concept of \"transferred intent\" or \"intended consequences.\" But I think in this case, since the girl didn't intend to hit the woman, and the contact was accidental, it might not qualify as battery.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the girl was negligent in throwing the ball carelessly, but negligence isn't the same as battery. Battery is an intentional tort, while negligence is a different category.\n\nSo, maybe the woman can't recover for battery either because there was no intentional act to cause harm.\n\nBut the woman did get injured as a result of the girl's action. Is there any other cause of action she could have? Maybe negligence, but again, that's not one of the options here. The question specifies recovering for assault, battery, both, or not recovering at all.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the woman could recover for both assault and battery. But based on my earlier thinking, it seems unlikely because the elements for both torts aren't met in this scenario.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is that she won't recover, meaning option D. But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different perspective. The girl's action was reckless because she was playing catch in a public park where there are people around. Maybe her recklessness could be considered an intentional act in the context of battery.\n\nBut I think recklessness is different from intention. In some jurisdictions, recklessness might be sufficient for battery, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl's action is seen as a general intent to engage in an activity that could cause harm, and thus she could be held liable for battery.\n\nBut I still feel like the primary issue is that the contact wasn't direct or intended to hit the woman specifically.\n\nAnother thought: the ball hitting the hat could be seen as an extension of the girl's action, and since the hat was part of the woman's person, it's considered a battery.\n\nBut again, the intent seems to be missing.\n\nPerhaps the woman could argue that the girl should have foreseen that her actions could lead to injuring someone, and thus she should be liable.\n\nBut that sounds more like negligence, which isn't one of the options.\n\nI need to focus on the given options: assault, battery, both, or not recovering.\n\nGiven that the elements of assault and battery don't seem to be fully met in this scenario, I'm leaning towards the woman not recovering.\n\nBut maybe there's a legal doctrine that allows recovery in such cases.\n\nLet me think about the principle of proximate cause. If the girl's action was the proximate cause of the woman's injury, could that lead to liability?\n\nPossibly, but again, that's more related to negligence, which isn't an option here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a strict liability principle at play, but that's usually for ultra-hazardous activities, which playing catch isn't.\n\nWait, maybe in some jurisdictions, children are held to a different standard, considering their age and capacity for understanding risk.\n\nBut I don't think that changes the nature of the torts in question.\n\nLet me consider the definitions again. Assault is the apprehension of imminent harmful contact, and battery is the actual harmful contact without consent.\n\nIn this case, there was contact (the ball hitting the hat), but it was accidental and the woman didn't apprehend it.\n\nSo, perhaps it's neither assault nor battery, and thus the woman can't recover based on those torts.\n\nBut maybe there's a different perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the woman could recover for battery because the girl's action caused the harm, even if it was accidental.\n\nBut that seems like stretching the definition of battery.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is that the woman will not recover, meaning option D.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance she could recover for assault or battery.\n\nFor assault: no, because there was no apprehension of harm.\n\nFor battery: the contact was indirect and accidental, so it's unlikely to qualify as battery.\n\nTherefore, the woman cannot recover for either tort, and the answer is D. not recover.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
