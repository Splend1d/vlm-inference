However, based on general knowledge, personality traits can evolve over time, especially during significant life transitions such as adolescence, young adulthood, and middle age.\n\nResearch in psychology suggests that personality traits are relatively stable throughout adulthood but can undergo gradual changes in response to life experiences, social roles, and personal growth. Factors such as marriage, parenthood, career progression, and retirement can influence personality development.\n\nIt's important to note that personality traits are complex and multifaceted, and their evolution can vary widely among individuals. Some people may exhibit stability in their traits, while others may show more pronounced changes.\n\nIn summary, personality traits can change over time, but the extent and nature of these changes can differ based on individual circumstances and life events.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
