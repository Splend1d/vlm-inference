                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here about joint tenancy and liens, and I need to figure out whether the court will enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the surviving second cousin's sale of the property. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst off, joint tenancy with the right of survivorship means that when one joint tenant dies, their interest in the property passes directly to the surviving tenant(s), bypassing the probate process. So, in this case, when the first cousin died, his interest should have passed to the second cousin, right?\n\nBut here's the complication: the first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. Then, a judgment was entered against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. So, there's a lien on the first cousin's interest in the property.\n\nNow, the first cousin died, and the second cousin wants to sell the property. But the mortgagee (the one who lent the money) is trying to stop the sale and enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin is arguing that any lien on the first cousin's interest was extinguished upon the first cousin's death because of the right of survivorship.\n\nI need to decide whether the court will side with the mortgagee or the second cousin.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about this one. Does the second cousin have to assent to the judgment lien? I don't think so. The first cousin put up his interest as security, but that shouldn't automatically bind the second cousin unless there's something in the agreement that says so. And, does a judgment lien destroy the entire joint tenancy? That seems extreme.\n\nB. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\n\nWait, is that true? If one joint tenant takes out a mortgage on their interest, does that destroy the joint tenancy? I thought that in joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest in the whole property, and a lien affects only the interest of the debtor tenant, not the entire property.\n\nC. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. A judgment note is essentially a written promise to pay a debt, secured by a judgment. But can one joint tenant file a judgment note against their own interest without affecting the other's interest? Maybe, but I need to check if that would be considered a valid lien against the entire property or just the debtor's share.\n\nD. No, because when the first cousin died, the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n\nThis seems plausible. If the joint tenancy remains intact despite the lien on one tenant's interest, then upon death, the surviving tenant should automatically inherit the deceased tenant's interest, including any liens attached to it. But does the lien survive the death?\n\nI need to recall some property law here. In joint tenancy, liens generally attach only to the interest of the debtor tenant. So, if the first cousin had a lien on his interest, that lien would typically survive his death and would attach to his interest as it passes to the surviving tenant.\n\nBut does that mean the lien can prevent the surviving tenant from selling the property? Even if the surviving tenant owns the entire property, including the deceased's interest subject to the lien, does the lien give the mortgagee the right to block the sale?\n\nMaybe not directly. Perhaps the surviving tenant can sell the property, but the proceeds would have to account for the lien on the deceased's interest.\n\nWait, but the mortgagee is filing an action to prevent the sale and enforce his interest in the property. So, perhaps the mortgagee is trying to foreclose on the lien or something similar.\n\nI need to think about priority of liens and how they affect joint tenancy.\n\nLet me consider this: in joint tenancy, each tenant has an equal undivided interest in the whole property. So, if the first cousin had a 50% interest and put it up as collateral for a loan, the mortgagee has a claim on that 50% interest.\n\nWhen the first cousin died, his 50% interest passed to the second cousin, but the lien remains attached to that interest. So, the second cousin now owns 100% of the property, but 50% of it is subject to the lien.\n\nDoes that mean that the second cousin can't sell the property without satisfying the lien on the 50% interest?\n\nProbably not, because the second cousin owns the entire property, including the liened portion. However, any buyer would likely require that liens be cleared before purchasing, to get clear title.\n\nBut in this case, the mortgagee is trying to prevent the sale altogether, perhaps because he wants to enforce his lien and possibly foreclose on the liened interest.\n\nBut can a lien on a joint tenant's interest be enforced against the entire property after the tenant's death?\n\nI need to check the law on this. In many jurisdictions, liens against a joint tenant's interest survive the tenant's death and attach to the interest as it passes to the surviving tenant.\n\nSo, the lien remains valid and enforceable against the deceased's interest, which is now held by the surviving tenant.\n\nBut does that give the mortgagee the right to prevent the sale of the entire property?\n\nProbably not directly. The surviving tenant can still sell the property, but would need to deal with the lien on the deceased's interest.\n\nPerhaps the mortgagee is trying to argue that the lien gives him a right to foreclose on the liened interest, which is now part of the entire property, thus effectively preventing the sale.\n\nBut I think the more accurate interpretation is that the lien is against the deceased's interest, and the surviving tenant can sell the property, but would need to use part of the proceeds to satisfy the lien.\n\nSo, in that case, the court might not enforce the lien to prevent the sale, but rather to ensure that the lien is satisfied from the proceeds of the sale.\n\nTherefore, option D seems closest to being correct: no, because upon the first cousin's death, the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, and the lien attaches to the deceased's interest, but doesn't prevent the sale.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me consider option A again: it says yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\n\nI don't think that's accurate. The second cousin didn't assent to the lien; it was the first cousin who put up his interest as security. The joint tenancy shouldn't be destroyed by one tenant's actions unless they explicitly agree to sever the tenancy, which isn't indicated here.\n\nOption B says yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\n\nAgain, I think this is too strong. Generally, liens against one tenant's interest don't destroy the entire joint tenancy unless there's an agreement or action to sever the tenancy.\n\nOption C says no, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\n\nI'm not sure about the constitutionality aspect. It's possible to encumber one's own interest in a joint tenancy property, but it shouldn't affect the other tenant's interest directly. However, in practice, liens on one tenant's interest can complicate matters for the surviving tenant, but that doesn't make it unconstitutional.\n\nSo, overall, I think the best answer is D: no, because when the first cousin died, the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n\nHowever, I should note that the lien on the first cousin's interest still exists and would need to be satisfied from the proceeds of the sale or otherwise addressed.\n\nBut in terms of whether the court will enforce the lien to prevent the sale, I don't think that's the case. The sale can proceed, but the lien must be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D."
