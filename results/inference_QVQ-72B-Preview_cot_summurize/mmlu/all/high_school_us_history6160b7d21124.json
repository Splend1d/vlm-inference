                    "text": "So I've got this poem here by Phillis Wheatley, and it's titled \"On Being Brought from Africa to America.\" It's from her collection \"Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral,\" which was published in 1773. The question is asking how the sentiments in this poem reflect continuities in U.S. history, and I need to choose among options A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the poem. It seems to be about Wheatley's experience being brought from Africa to America, presumably as a slave, given the historical context. She mentions that it was \"mercy\" that brought her from her \"Pagan land\" and taught her soul to understand that there is a God and a Savior. She also says that before this, she neither sought nor knew redemption.\n\nThen there's a stanza where she addresses people who view her race with scorn, saying that their dark skin is a \"diabolic die.\" But she counters that by saying that even people as black as Cain can be refined and join the \"angelic train.\" So, she's making a point about the potential for spiritual growth and equality before God, despite differences in skin color.\n\nNow, considering the historical context, Phillis Wheatley was an African American slave who became a prominent poet in the colonial period. Her work often dealt with themes of faith, freedom, and the humanity of black people in a time when slavery was prevalent and racial prejudices were deeply entrenched.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Debates over religious freedom\n\nB. Debates over social justice\n\nC. Debates over immigration\n\nD. Debates over freedom of expression\n\nI need to see which of these the poem most directly reflects a continuity of debate in U.S. history.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Debates over religious freedom: While the poem does touch on religious themes, such as understanding God and the possibility of redemption, it's not primarily about the freedom to practice religion without government interference. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nB. Debates over social justice: This seems promising. The poem addresses the issue of racial prejudice and makes a case for the equality of all people in the eyes of God. Social justice involves issues of equality, fairness, and the treatment of marginalized groups, which certainly includes the experiences of African Americans in the United States, both in the 18th century and beyond.\n\nC. Debates over immigration: Immigration typically refers to people choosing to come to a new country, often for better opportunities. However, Wheatley was brought to America against her will as a slave. So, while there might be some connections to broader debates about who belongs in American society, this option doesn't seem as directly relevant as social justice.\n\nD. Debates over freedom of expression: This refers to the right to express one's opinions and ideas without censorship. While Phillis Wheatley's ability to publish her poetry is an example of freedom of expression, the poem itself is more about her personal experience and a message about racial equality rather than advocating for the abstract concept of free speech.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B, debates over social justice, is the most direct continuity reflected in Wheatley's poem. The poem confronts racial prejudice and asserts the equal capacity for spiritual growth and redemption among people of African descent, which is a fundamental aspect of social justice debates in U.S. history.\n\nMoreover, Phillis Wheatley's work contributed to the abolitionist movement by humanizing enslaved people and challenging the justifications for slavery based on race. Her poetry helped to shape and influence the way people thought about slavery and racial equality, which has been a ongoing debate in American history.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is B. Debates over social justice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
