                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem where I need to find which list of numbers is ordered from least to greatest. There are four options, each with four numbers. I need to check each one and see if they're in ascending order.\n\nStarting with option A: 167,213, 161,455, 17,400, 11,633.\n\nHmm, let's look at these numbers. First, 167,213 is bigger than 161,455, which is already not in ascending order because it should start with the smallest number first. So, option A is not correct.\n\nNext, option B: 10,354, 10,600, 104,321, 106,213.\n\nLet's see, 10,354 is less than 10,600, which is good. Then 10,600 is less than 104,321, and 104,321 is less than 106,213. So, this seems to be in ascending order. But I should double-check if there are any numbers in between that might be smaller or larger.\n\nWait a minute, 10,354 to 10,600 is fine, and then 104,321 is significantly larger than 10,600, and 106,213 is larger than 104,321. So, option B seems correct so far.\n\nMoving on to option C: 160,233, 171,141, 11,645, 16,703.\n\nHere, 160,233 is larger than 171,141? Wait, no, 171,141 is larger than 160,233. But looking at the sequence, it starts with 160,233, then jumps to 171,141, then drops down to 11,645 and 16,703. That's definitely not in ascending order. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nLastly, option D: 12,209, 12,902, 125,466, 125,464.\n\nStarting with 12,209, then 12,902, which is larger than 12,209, good. Then 125,466, which is larger than 12,902, and finally 125,464, which is smaller than 125,466. So, it starts correctly but ends with a smaller number, which means it's not in ascending order. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on my checks, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that there aren't any typos or misreads in the numbers. Let me verify the numbers again.\n\nOption B: 10,354, 10,600, 104,321, 106,213.\n\nLooking at these again, 10,354 < 10,600 < 104,321 < 106,213. All these inequalities are correct. So, yes, option B is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any other options that are in ascending order.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
