                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a sociologist conducting research at a hospital, and I need to figure out what method of research this is. The options are experimentation, secondary data analysis, participant observation, and survey administration. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these research methods involves.\n\nStarting with experimentation: this is when a researcher manipulates one variable to see its effect on another variable, usually in a controlled setting. Think of lab experiments where you change one condition and observe the outcome. But in this case, the sociologist is on staff at a hospital, recording field notes. That sounds more observational than experimental. So, maybe experimentation isn't the right choice here.\n\nNext, secondary data analysis. This involves using data that was collected for another purpose, like analyzing existing statistics or records. But the scenario says the sociologist is collecting data as field notes while being on staff at the hospital. So, they're gathering new data themselves, not using someone else's data. That makes me think secondary data analysis isn't the appropriate choice here.\n\nNow, participant observation. This sounds familiar. It's a qualitative research method where the researcher observes and sometimes participates in the activities of a group or setting while taking notes. This seems to align pretty closely with the description in the question. The sociologist is on staff at the hospital, which suggests they might be participating in some aspects of hospital life while also observing and recording data in the form of field notes.\n\nLastly, survey administration. This is when a researcher collects data by asking people questions, either in person, over the phone, or online, using questionnaires or interviews. While surveys can be a part of research in hospitals, the scenario here describes the sociologist collecting data through field notes during several weeks on staff, not necessarily through direct questioning of people.\n\nComparing all the options, participant observation seems to be the most fitting method described in the scenario. The sociologist is both participating (being on staff) and observing (recording data as field notes), which is characteristic of participant observation.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Experimentation involves manipulating variables, which isn't mentioned here. Secondary data analysis involves using existing data, but the sociologist is collecting their own data. Survey administration involves asking questions to gather data, but the sociologist is collecting field notes through observation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. participant observation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
