                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. There's a shopper who fell in a mall because the floor was wet and got injured. Now, the shopper is suing the mall owner for negligence. During the trial, the shopper's housekeeper testified that the shopper was bedridden and couldn't work for a month due to a sprained back from the fall at the mall. The housekeeper also said that about a week after the shopper came home from the hospital, the shopper told her that her back was really killing her, the pain was excruciating, and it would be a miracle if she could ever stand up again.\n\nNow, the mall's lawyer wants to strike this testimony. I need to decide whether this motion should be granted or denied based on the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of evidence this testimony is. The housekeeper is recounting what the shopper told her about her condition and feelings after the fall. So, this seems like hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nOption A says the motion should be granted because the housekeeper's testimony is hearsay not within any recognized exception. So, if this is hearsay and there's no exception that applies, then yes, it should be stricken.\n\nBut wait, maybe there is an exception that applies here. Option D suggests that the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nI need to look into this exception. I recall that statements about the declarant's physical condition can be admissible under certain circumstances. Let me see if that fits here.\n\nThe shopper told her housekeeper that her back was really killing her, the pain was excruciating, and it would be a miracle if she could ever stand up again. This sounds like a description of her current physical condition and feelings at that time.\n\nI think statements about pain and physical condition can be admissible as present sense impressions or declarations of physical condition. But I need to confirm that.\n\nLet me think about the rules regarding hearsay exceptions. One exception is for excited utterances, but that's for statements made under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. Here, the fall happened a week earlier, so maybe that doesn't apply.\n\nAnother exception is for statements of then-existing mental or emotional condition, but those are generally not admissible to prove the fact that the condition existed. Wait, maybe I'm confusing things.\n\nLet me check a reliable source on hearsay exceptions. Oh, I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, there is an exception for statements of the declarant's then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition, but they are only admissible to prove the declarant's condition at that time, not for another purpose.\n\nIn this case, the shopper's statement about her back pain and inability to stand up again is being offered to prove that she was in fact in pain and had a severe injury, which seems relevant to the negligence claim.\n\nWait, but is this considered a statement of then-existing physical condition? I think so. The shopper is describing her current state of pain and her belief about her future ability to stand.\n\nBut option D says \"declaration of present bodily condition.\" That seems to fit. So, perhaps the motion should be denied because this falls under that exception.\n\nOption C mentions that the housekeeper's testimony would be admissible as an adoptive admission. I'm not sure about that. An adoptive admission is when a party adopts someone else's statement, but I don't see that happening here. The housekeeper is testifying about what the shopper said, not adopting someone else's statement.\n\nOption B says the motion should be granted because the housekeeper's testimony would be self-serving. I'm not sure what that means in this context. Self-serving statements are typically statements made by a party that are in their own interest, and they can be admissible against them under certain rules.\n\nBut in this case, the shopper is the plaintiff, and the housekeeper is testifying about what the shopper said. So, it's not the shopper making a self-serving statement; it's the housekeeper reporting what the shopper said.\n\nWait, maybe the mall's counsel is arguing that the housekeeper's testimony is self-serving because it helps the shopper's case. But that seems like a stretch. Self-serving declarations are generally not admissible unless they fall under an exception, but again, this is the housekeeper testifying, not the shopper.\n\nI think the key here is whether the shopper's statement to the housekeeper is admissible under the declaration of present bodily condition exception.\n\nLet me look up the specific rule. Under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 803(3), statements of the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition are admissible, but only to prove the declarant's state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition then existing.\n\nSo, in this case, the shopper's statement about her back pain and inability to stand up would be admissible to prove that she was in pain and believed she couldn't stand up at that time.\n\nHowever, the shopper is the one making the statement, and she is the plaintiff. So, is there any issue with her making a statement that benefits her case?\n\nWait, but it's her own statement about her condition, which is a fact in issue in the case. So, it's not like she's making a legal conclusion or something.\n\nMoreover, her statement is being offered through a third party, the housekeeper, who is testifying about what she said.\n\nSo, if the statement qualifies under Rule 803(3), it should be admissible.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this statement is about her then-existing physical condition. Saying \"my back is really killing me\" seems directly related to her physical condition at that time.\n\nSaying \"the pain is excruciating\" is also about her physical sensation at that time.\n\nSaying \"it'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again\" is more of a prediction about the future, which might not fall under the same exception.\n\nBut perhaps the entire statement can be admitted to provide context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only parts of it are admissible.\n\nBut in practice, it's common for such statements to be admitted in their entirety, especially if they are contemporaneous with the event or soon after.\n\nGiven that, I think the motion to strike should be denied because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is an exception that applies.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the testimony isn't self-serving; it's the housekeeper reporting what the shopper said.\n\nOption C is incorrect because this doesn't seem to be an adoptive admission.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. denied, because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
