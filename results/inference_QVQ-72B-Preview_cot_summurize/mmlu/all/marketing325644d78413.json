                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here. It says that once the agency has discussed the brief with the client, the agency provides a detailed outline of how they intend to investigate the problem. And this document is called... let's see the options:\n\nA. Research brief.\n\nB. Research proposal.\n\nC. Research question.\n\nD. Research programme.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these is the correct term for this detailed outline.\n\nFirst, let's think about what a research brief is. I think a research brief is more like the initial document that outlines the problem or the research objectives. It's usually provided by the client to the agency, not the other way around. So, option A seems unlikely.\n\nNext, the research proposal. That sounds familiar. I recall that a research proposal is a document that researchers prepare to outline their planned research project. It typically includes things like the research questions, objectives, methodology, timeline, and budget. Maybe this is what the agency provides to the client after discussing the brief.\n\nOption C is the research question. Well, the research question is more of a specific inquiry that the research aims to answer. It's an essential part of the research proposal, but it's not the entire document. So, probably not the right choice here.\n\nLastly, the research programme. This sounds a bit vague. A research programme could refer to a series of related research projects or a plan for conducting research over a period. It might be too broad for what's being described in the question.\n\nGiven these considerations, the research proposal seems to be the most fitting option. It's a detailed outline of how the agency intends to investigate the problem, including the methods they'll use and the expected outcomes.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider the context. The agency has discussed the brief with the client, and now they're providing a detailed outline of their approach. This sounds exactly like a research proposal. The proposal would outline the agency's understanding of the problem, the methods they propose to use, and how they plan to report their findings.\n\nOn the other hand, a research brief is more about the initial statement of the problem, not the plan to solve it. The research question is just one component of the proposal, and a research programme might be too encompassing for a single project.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Research proposal.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there's a different terminology used in different industries or regions. For example, in some contexts, a research brief might indeed be a detailed plan, but I think that's less common.\n\nI did a quick search in my mind about standard research practices, and it seems that a research proposal is indeed the document that outlines the planned research approach, including the methods and procedures.\n\nSo, I'm confident that B. Research proposal is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
