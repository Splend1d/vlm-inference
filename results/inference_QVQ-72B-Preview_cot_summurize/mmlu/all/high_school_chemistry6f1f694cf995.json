                    "text": "So I have this problem here about nitrous acid, HNO2, which has a pKa of 3.3. The solution has a pH of 4.2, and I need to figure out the relationship between the concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair in solution. The options are:\n\nA. [HNO2] > [NO2-]\n\nB. [NO2-] > [HNO2]\n\nC. [H2NO2+] > [HNO2]\n\nD. [HNO2] > [H2NO2+]\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the conjugate acid-base pair is here. Nitrous acid, HNO2, can ionize in water as follows:\n\nHNO2 + H2O \u21cc NO2- + H3O+\n\nSo, HNO2 is the acid, and NO2- is its conjugate base.\n\nThe acid dissociation constant Ka is related to pKa by the equation:\n\nKa = 10^(-pKa) = 10^(-3.3) \u2248 5.012 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n\nNow, the pH of the solution is given as 4.2. I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to relate pH, pKa, and the concentrations of the acid and conjugate base.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nWhere [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n4.2 = 3.3 + log([NO2-]/[HNO2])\n\nSubtract 3.3 from both sides:\n\n4.2 - 3.3 = log([NO2-]/[HNO2])\n\n0.9 = log([NO2-]/[HNO2])\n\nTo solve for the ratio [NO2-]/[HNO2], I can rewrite this in exponential form:\n\n[NO2-]/[HNO2] = 10^0.9 \u2248 7.943\n\nSo, [NO2-] \u2248 7.943 \u00d7 [HNO2]\n\nThis means that the concentration of the conjugate base [NO2-] is greater than the concentration of the acid [HNO2].\n\nLooking back at the options, this corresponds to:\n\nB. [NO2-] > [HNO2]\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other information I should consider.\n\nThe problem also mentions \"conjugate acid/base pair found in solution.\" In this case, the conjugate pair is HNO2 and NO2-.\n\nOption C mentions [H2NO2+] > [HNO2], and option D mentions [HNO2] > [H2NO2+]. I need to make sure that H2NO2+ is not a significant species in this solution.\n\nWait a minute, H2NO2+ seems to suggest that HNO2 could donate another proton, but actually, HNO2 is a monoprotic acid; it only has one ionizable hydrogen. The formula H2NO2+ doesn't make much sense in this context because HNO2 is already the acid form, and it can't donate another proton to become H2NO2+.\n\nLet me confirm this. Nitrous acid is HNO2, and its conjugate base is NO2-. There isn't a H2NO2+ species in this equilibrium. So, options C and D are probably not relevant to this system.\n\nTherefore, based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the correct answer is B. [NO2-] > [HNO2]\n\nJust to further confirm, let's think about the pH and pKa relationship.\n\nSince pH > pKa (4.2 > 3.3), the solution is more basic than the acid's dissociation constant suggests, which means the conjugate base [NO2-] is in excess relative to the acid [HNO2].\n\nThis aligns with option B.\n\nSo, the answer is B. [NO2-] > [HNO2]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
