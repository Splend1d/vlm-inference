                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this property law problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grantor conveys her mansion and surrounding property to her nephew \"for life, remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs.\" So, this is a life estate with a remainder interest. The nephew has a life estate, meaning he can use and enjoy the property during his lifetime, and upon his death, the property passes to his heirs.\n\nTwo years later, the nephew tries to sell the property to his brother in fee simple absolute. But before the settlement, the brother backs out, saying the nephew can't convey a fee simple because of some issue with the type of estate he holds.\n\nNow, the question is whether the nephew's request for specific performance (which is essentially enforcing the sale contract) would be granted or denied, given that the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished by statute in this jurisdiction.\n\nLet me recall what the Rule in Shelley's Case is about. It's an old common law doctrine that affects the interpretation of certain types of property conveyances, particularly those that create a life estate with a remainder to the grantor's heirs. Historically, it could convert what was intended to be a fee simple into a fee tail, but it's been abolished in many jurisdictions, including this one, according to the problem.\n\nSo, since the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished, the conveyance should be interpreted according to its plain terms. That means the nephew has a life estate, and upon his death, the remainder passes to his heirs.\n\nNow, the nephew is trying to sell the property to his brother in fee simple absolute. But the brother is claiming that the nephew can't convey a fee simple because of the type of estate he holds.\n\nWait a minute, a life estate is a limited estate that lasts only during the lifetime of the life tenant. Typically, a life tenant can't convey more than what he has, which is a life estate. So, if the nephew is trying to sell the property in fee simple absolute, which is a complete and unconditional ownership, he might not have the authority to do so because he only holds a life estate.\n\nBut the answer options seem to suggest that the Rule in Shelley's Case being abolished might affect this situation. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Denied, because the Rule would not be triggered, thus creating only a life estate in the nephew.\n\nB. Granted, because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs.\n\nC. Granted, because the nephew's heirs receive a vested indefeasible interest in the property.\n\nD. Denied, because under the Doctrine of Worthier Title, at the termination of the nephew's life estate, the grantor has a reversionary interest.\n\nOkay, let's\u89e3\u6790 each option.\n\nOption A says it would be denied because the Rule in Shelley's Case isn't being triggered, so the nephew only has a life estate. That seems plausible because, without the Rule applying, the conveyance is interpreted as intended: life estate to the nephew, remainder to his heirs.\n\nOption B says it would be granted because the remainder in the heirs becomes a vested full fee. Hmm, if the Rule is abolished, perhaps the remainder becomes vested sooner, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption C is similar, saying the heirs have a vested indefeasible interest. Again, not entirely sure about the specifics here.\n\nOption D introduces the Doctrine of Worthier Title, suggesting that the grantor has a reversionary interest after the life estate terminates. But I thought that in this scenario, the remainder goes to the nephew's heirs, so the grantor shouldn't have a reversionary interest unless there's some other provision.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall what the Doctrine of Worthier Title is. It's a principle that prevents a person from creating in themselves a better title than they conveyed. In other words, if a person conveys an estate to another and retains a reversion, they can't later convey that reversion to themselves because it's a \"worthier\" title.\n\nIn this case, the grantor conveyed the property to the nephew for life, remainder to his heirs. So, the grantor has no reversionary interest unless the nephew dies without heirs, in which case the property would revert to the grantor or her estate, depending on state law.\n\nBut the problem states that the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished, which might affect how the remainder is interpreted.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider whether the nephew can convey more than just his life estate.\n\nGenerally, a life tenant can't convey a fee simple absolute unless they have the right to do so. But perhaps there are exceptions or specific rules that allow the life tenant to convey a fee simple under certain circumstances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the abolition of the Rule in Shelley's Case has some implications for the vesting of the remainder interest.\n\nLet me look up some case law or statutory provisions that might apply here.\n\nFirst, since the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished, the conveyance should be interpreted literally: life estate to the nephew, remainder to his heirs.\n\nNow, the nephew is trying to sell the property in fee simple absolute. For him to do that, he would need to convey not only his life estate but also the remainder interest.\n\nBut typically, a life tenant can't convey the remainder interest unless they have the consent of the remaindermen or unless there's some agreement allowing it.\n\nWait, perhaps in this jurisdiction, when the Rule in Shelley's Case is abolished, remainders vest immediately, or something along those lines.\n\nLet me consider the concept of \"vested remainder.\" A vested remainder is one that has fixed devolution, meaning we know who will inherit upon the termination of the prior estate.\n\nIn this case, the remainder is to the nephew's heirs, which would be vested subject to open, meaning it's fixed but could potentially be inherited by different people depending on who the heirs are at the time of the nephew's death.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that affects the nephew's ability to convey a fee simple.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the nephew and his heirs have a unified interest in the property, and he can convey the entire estate with their consent.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any consent from the heirs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the nephew can convey a fee simple subject to the remainder interest passing to his heirs.\n\nBut that might not be a fee simple absolute, which is what the brother is expecting.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider the doctrine of \"equitable conversion.\"\n\nEquitable conversion is a principle that allows a conveyance to take effect even if the grantor doesn't have absolute ownership, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nLet me look at the answer choices again.\n\nOption A says it would be denied because the Rule isn't triggering, so only a life estate exists in the nephew.\n\nOption B says it would be granted because the remainder in the heirs becomes a vested full fee.\n\nOption C says it would be granted because the heirs have a vested indefeasible interest.\n\nOption D says it would be denied due to the Doctrine of Worthier Title, implying the grantor has a reversionary interest.\n\nGiven that the grantor conveyed the property to the nephew for life, remainder to his heirs, and assuming the Rule in Shelley's Case is abolished, the remainder should be interpreted as intended: to the heirs.\n\nSo, the nephew has a life estate, and the heirs have a vested remainder subject to open.\n\nNow, can the nephew convey a fee simple absolute?\n\nProbably not, because he doesn't have the remainder interest. He only has the life estate.\n\nBut option B and C suggest that the remainder becomes a vested full fee, which might allow the nephew to convey the property with the remainder passing to the heirs.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the abolition of the Rule in Shelley's Case means that the remainder interest vests immediately in the heirs, giving them a present interest that can be conveyed along with the life estate.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the nephew sells the property; what exactly is he selling?\n\nHe's selling his life estate, and the buyer would take subject to the remainder interest in the heirs.\n\nBut the buyer wants a fee simple absolute, which means unconditional ownership without any future interests.\n\nSo, unless the nephew can convey both the life estate and the remainder interest, he can't convey a fee simple absolute.\n\nBut he likely can't convey the remainder interest without the consent of the remaindermen.\n\nTherefore, the sale contract is flawed, and specific performance shouldn't be granted.\n\nThat would point towards option A or D.\n\nOption D mentions the Doctrine of Worthier Title, suggesting that the grantor has a reversionary interest.\n\nBut in this scenario, the grantor conveyed the property to the nephew for life, remainder to his heirs.\n\nUnless there's a reversion back to the grantor in certain circumstances, I don't think the grantor has a reversionary interest.\n\nSo, option D seems incorrect.\n\nOption A says it would be denied because the Rule isn't triggering, so only a life estate exists in the nephew.\n\nThat makes sense because the nephew only has a life estate and can't convey more than that without the consent of the remaindermen.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the Rule in Shelley's Case is abolished, the conveyance is interpreted as life estate to the nephew, remainder to his heirs.\n\nThe nephew can't convey a fee simple absolute because he doesn't have the remainder interest.\n\nTherefore, the sale contract is unenforceable, and specific performance would be denied.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nOption B and C suggest that the remainder becomes a vested full fee, which isn't accurate because the nephew has a life estate, and the heirs have a vested remainder subject to open.\n\nOption D incorrectly claims that the grantor has a reversionary interest, which isn't the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: denied, because the Rule would not be triggered, thus creating only a life estate in the nephew.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
