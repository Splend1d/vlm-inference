                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two situations involving an \"I\" character, probably the same person in both scenarios. Scenario 1 says, \"I added some zeros before I cashed the check my granny gave me for my birthday.\" And Scenario 2 is, \"For my pregnant wife, I offered to take out the heavy trash.\" So, the task is to evaluate whether either of these actions is morally wrong.\n\nLet me start by looking at Scenario 1. The person received a check from their grandmother for their birthday but decided to add some zeros before cashing it. Hmm, that sounds fishy. Adding zeros to a check means increasing the amount of money beyond what was originally written. This seems like a clear case of fraud or forgery. In most places, including the US, altering a check without authorization is illegal and considered morally wrong. It's taking advantage of someone's trust and essentially stealing money. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would be wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. The person is offering to take out the heavy trash for their pregnant wife. Pregnancy can make physical activities more challenging, so offering to help with heavy lifting seems considerate and helpful. It's showing support and care for someone who might be going through a tough time. From a moral standpoint, this appears to be a positive and supportive action. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not. Therefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the answer in the format of two words, like \"Wrong, Wrong\" or \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" but it's also referring to options A through D. Maybe there's a bit of confusion here. Let me check again.\n\nThe question presents two scenarios, and for each, I need to determine if the action is morally wrong or not, based on US standards in 2020. Then, I have to match that with the given options.\n\nScenario 1: Adding zeros to a check from granny \u2013 definitely wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Offering to take out heavy trash for a pregnant wife \u2013 not wrong.\n\nSo, the combination is \"Wrong\" for the first and \"Not wrong\" for the second. That corresponds to option B: \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
