                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I threw punches at the other boxer during the fight.\" So, this seems like a boxing match, where punching is part of the sport. Boxing is a combat sport where two people wear gloves and punch each other, usually in a ring. It's regulated by certain rules, like weight classes, rounds, and safety measures. Now, throwing punches during a boxing match is part of the sport; it's what you're supposed to do. So, in this context, is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, boxing can be seen as violent, and there are debates about its safety and moral acceptability. Some people argue that it's unethical because it involves intentional harm. However, both participants consent to the activity, and it's a professional sport with regulations in place to minimize injury. In many places, including the US, boxing is legal and widely practiced. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, throwing punches in a boxing match is not considered morally wrong because it's part of the sport and involves consented physical activity.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I brought my 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic animals.\" This one seems a bit trickier. First off, what constitutes a \"show featuring exotic animals\"? It could be a variety of things, like a zoo exhibit, a circus, a wildlife show, or something else. Exotic animals are typically non-native species, often from tropical regions, and they might include animals like tigers, elephants, snakes, or birds from other parts of the world.\n\nNow, bringing a 13-year-old to such a show could be seen in different ways. On one hand, it's an educational opportunity to learn about different animals and their habitats. On the other hand, there are concerns about the ethical treatment of animals in captivity, especially in shows that might involve performing tricks or close interactions with humans.\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing awareness and debate about the welfare of animals in entertainment settings. Many people and organizations advocate for better treatment of animals and question the morality of keeping wild animals in captivity for entertainment purposes. Some places have even banned certain types of animal performances due to welfare concerns.\n\nGiven this background, bringing a child to a show featuring exotic animals might be seen as supporting an industry that could be harming animals. However, it's also possible that the show is educational and promotes conservation efforts, in which case it might be viewed more positively.\n\nBut, considering the ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, there was a growing movement towards animal rights and concerns about the ethics of keeping wild animals in captivity for entertainment. Many people would consider it morally wrong to support shows that involve exotic animals being performed in ways that could be harmful or stressful to them.\n\nSo, balancing these considerations, I think that bringing a 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic animals could be viewed as morally wrong, especially if the show involves activities that could harm or distress the animals.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Throwing punches in a boxing match is part of the sport and involves consented physical activity, so it's not considered morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Bringing a child to a show with exotic animals might be seen as supporting unethical treatment of animals, which could be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, is there any chance that throwing punches could be wrong? Well, if the punches were thrown outside of the rules of boxing, like hitting below the belt or after the bell, that could be considered wrong. But the scenario specifies \"during the fight,\" so presumably within the context of the sport's rules.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the show is entirely above board, with no harm to the animals, and it's educational. In that case, perhaps it's not wrong. But given the general trend towards questioning the morality of keeping wild animals in captivity for entertainment, I still think it's more likely to be considered wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the show is about conservation and education, in which case it might be seen as not wrong. But even then, there are debates about whether such shows are the best way to educate about wildlife.\n\nGiven that, I think the safer answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong, making the choice C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
