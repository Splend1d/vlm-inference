Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration does de las Casas seem to be criticizing in Source 2?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about two sources written by Christopher Columbus and Bartholomew de las Casas. The question is asking which motive for exploration de las Casas seems to be criticizing in Source 2. The options are:\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity\n\nB. Financial gain\n\nC. Personal glory\n\nD. Finding new mates\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each source is saying.\n\nStarting with Source 1 from Christopher Columbus's letter in 1493. He talks about how the Indians would barter their valuable items like cotton and gold for lesser items like fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars. He mentions that he forbade this kind of unfair trading because he thought it was unjust. Instead, he gave the Indians many beautiful and acceptable articles without taking anything in return. His reasons for doing this were to conciliate them, make them more inclined to become Christians, and to foster good relations with the Spanish crown. He also hoped that by doing so, the natives would be more willing to help the Spanish obtain the resources they needed in abundance.\n\nSo, Columbus here is presenting his actions as benevolent and aimed at establishing peaceful and mutually beneficial relationships, with a focus on spreading Christianity and serving the interests of the Spanish monarchy.\n\nNow, moving on to Source 2, written by Bartholomew de las Casas in 1542. His account is much darker and critical. He describes the Spanish treatment of the natives as brutal and compares them to ravenous wolves preying on gentle lambs. He mentions that from the very beginning, the Spanish were violent and merciless, inflicting untold misery and suffering on the natives. He also refers to the use of torture and other cruel methods to subjugate the indigenous people.\n\nDe las Casas points out that the native population of Hispaniola decreased dramatically from three million to only two hundred due to the Spanish actions. He attributes this destruction to the Spanish desire for gold and rapid enrichment, which led them to rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\nSo, de las Casas is criticizing the Spanish conquest and colonization, particularly focusing on the humanitarian disaster it caused and attributing it to the greed for gold and wealth.\n\nNow, looking back at the question: Which of the following motives for exploration does de las Casas seem to be criticizing in Source 2?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity\n\nB. Financial gain\n\nC. Personal glory\n\nD. Finding new mates\n\nBased on de las Casas's account, he is clearly criticizing the Spanish for their treatment of the natives, which he attributes to their desire for gold and financial gain. He describes the Spanish as being motivated by the pursuit of wealth, leading them to commit atrocities against the indigenous people.\n\nIn Source 1, Columbus mentions his interest in converting the natives to Christianity and fostering good relations with them for that purpose. However, in Source 2, de las Casas does not directly criticize the motive of conversion to Christianity. Instead, he criticizes the Spanish for their brutal methods and the pursuit of gold, which led to the near-annihilation of the native population.\n\nTherefore, the motive that de las Casas seems to be criticizing in Source 2 is financial gain, which corresponds to option B.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider if there's any mention or implication of criticizing the other motives:\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity: De las Casas does not criticize this motive directly in Source 2. His criticism is more about the means used by the Spanish, not the ends of spreading Christianity.\n\nC. Personal glory: There is no explicit mention of personal glory in Source 2. The focus is on the pursuit of gold and wealth.\n\nD. Finding new mates: This is not mentioned at all in either source and seems unrelated to the context provided.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B. Financial gain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
