I need to pick the correct answer from these choices.\n\nFirst off, I know that the space race was a big deal between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both countries were competing to achieve firsts in space exploration, like sending humans into orbit or landing on the moon.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. John Glenn: I remember that John Glenn was an astronaut who became famous for orbiting the Earth. I think he was the first American to orbit the Earth, but was he the first American in space overall?\n\nB. Buzz Aldrin: He was an astronaut who went to the moon and was the second person to walk on the moon, after Neil Armstrong. So, he was definitely in space, but not the first American there.\n\nC. Alan Shepard: I recall that Alan Shepard was also an astronaut. I think he might have been the first American in space, but I'm not entirely sure about the details.\n\nD. Neil Armstrong: He's famous for being the first person to walk on the moon. So, again, he was in space, but that was after someone else had already been there.\n\nSo, to figure this out, I need to recall the timeline of these events.\n\nI know that the Soviet Union sent Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, and that was the first human in space. After that, the United States wanted to catch up.\n\nAlan Shepard was part of the Mercury program, which was the first American manned space program. I believe he went into space shortly after Gagarin.\n\nLet me think about the dates:\n\n- Yuri Gagarin went into space on April 12, 1961.\n\n- Alan Shepard had a suborbital flight on May 5, 1961.\n\n- John Glenn orbited the Earth on February 20, 1962.\n\n- Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were part of the Apollo 11 mission, which landed on the moon on July 20, 1969.\n\nSo, if Gagarin went into space in April 1961, and Shepard in May 1961, that means Shepard was the first American in space, even though Gagarin went first.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Alan Shepard.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check this. Maybe there was someone else from the United States who went into space before Shepard.\n\nLet me think: Was there anyone else in the Mercury program before Shepard?\n\nNo, Shepard was the first American to go into space with the Mercury-Redstone 3 mission, also known as Freedom 7.\n\nJohn Glenn was the first American to orbit the Earth, which happened after Shepard's suborbital flight.\n\nBuzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were part of the Apollo program, which came after the Mercury and Gemini programs.\n\nSo, yes, Alan Shepard was indeed the first American in space.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Alan Shepard}} \\]"
