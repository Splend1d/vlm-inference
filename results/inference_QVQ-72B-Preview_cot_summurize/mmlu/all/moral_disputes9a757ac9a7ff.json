                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this comparison between Smith and Jones. It seems like there's some moral debate here about whether killing someone is worse than letting someone die. The options are suggesting different conclusions from this comparison.\n\nFirst, I need to grasp the scenarios involving Smith and Jones. I think Smith is someone who actively causes someone's death, like killing them directly, whereas Jones might be someone who allows someone to die by not intervening or not helping. So, Smith is killing, and Jones is letting die.\n\nNow, the question is asking what Rachels is trying to show with this comparison. The options are:\n\nA. Killing is in itself morally worse than letting die.\n\nB. Letting die in itself is morally worse than killing.\n\nC. Killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct based on Rachels' argument.\n\nI recall that Rachels might be discussing the principle of active versus passive euthanasia or something similar, where people debate whether it's worse to kill someone or to let them die by withholding treatment.\n\nLet me consider an example to clarify this.\n\nSuppose Smith is a doctor who gives a lethal injection to a patient to end their suffering, directly causing their death. Jones, on the other hand, is a doctor who decides not to give life-sustaining treatment to a patient, knowing that this will result in their death.\n\nIn this case, Smith is actively killing, and Jones is passively letting die.\n\nNow, the moral question is: is one of these actions morally worse than the other?\n\nOption A says that killing is worse than letting die. But in some people's view, actively causing someone's death might seem worse because it's a direct action intended to harm.\n\nOption B says that letting die is worse than killing. This might be argued from the perspective that by letting someone die, you're not taking responsibility for their life, which could be seen as morally negligent or worse.\n\nOption C says that killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die. This suggests that both actions are morally equivalent in terms of their wrongness.\n\nOption D says none of the above, which might imply that the comparison doesn't lead to any of these conclusions.\n\nI need to think about what Rachels' position is. I remember that Rachels argues that there is no moral difference between killing and letting die when the outcome is the same. So, in other words, if both actions result in someone's death, and the only difference is whether you did something to cause it or refrained from doing something to prevent it, then morally, they are equivalent.\n\nSo, according to Rachels, killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die. Therefore, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Is there a difference in intent between killing and letting die? In the case of Smith, the intent is to cause death, whereas in Jones' case, the intent might be to allow nature to take its course or to avoid prolonging suffering unnecessarily.\n\nHowever, Rachels might argue that the intent is similar in both cases \u2013 to end the person's life \u2013 and that the method (active vs. passive) doesn't make a moral difference.\n\nAlternatively, some philosophers might argue that omitting an action (letting die) is less blameworthy than commission (killing), but Rachels seems to disagree with that.\n\nGiven that, I think Rachels' point is that killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die, hence option C.\n\nWait, but option C says \"killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die,\" which aligns with Rachels' view that both are morally equivalent when they result in the same outcome.\n\nOption A suggests the opposite, that killing is worse, and option B suggests letting die is worse, which contradicts Rachels' position.\n\nOption D, none of the above, doesn't seem applicable here because Rachels does make a clear statement on this matter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another perspective. Suppose someone argues that there is a moral difference because killing is an active harm, while letting die is a failure to prevent harm, which might be seen as less blameworthy.\n\nHowever, Rachels would counter this by saying that the moral outcome is the same \u2013 someone dies \u2013 and therefore, the actions are morally equivalent.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Rachels compares Smith and Jones to show that killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
