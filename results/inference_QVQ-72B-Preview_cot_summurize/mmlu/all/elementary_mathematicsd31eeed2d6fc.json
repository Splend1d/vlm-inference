                    "text": "Let's see. Rita has 120 rocks to move, and she can carry h rocks in one load. I need to find out how many loads she needs to move all the rocks. So, the total number of loads should be the total rocks divided by the number of rocks per load, right?\n\nSo, if she can carry h rocks per load, then the number of loads should be 120 divided by h. Looking at the options:\n\nA. 120 + h\n\nB. 120h\n\nC. 120 - h\n\nD. 120 / h\n\nHmm, option D seems correct because it's exactly 120 divided by h.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any chance that she might not carry exactly h rocks in the last load if the rocks don't divide evenly?\n\nFor example, if h is 50, then 120 divided by 50 is 2.4. Does that mean she carries 50 rocks twice and then 20 rocks in the third load? So, total loads would be 3.\n\nWait, but 120 / 50 is 2.4, which is not an integer. So, in reality, she would need 3 loads because you can't have a fraction of a load.\n\nBut 120 / h = 120 / 50 = 2.4, which is not equal to 3. So, maybe I need to consider whether the expression should involve rounding up.\n\nBut looking back, the question says \"which expression represents the total number of loads needed,\" and it doesn't specify anything about fractional loads or partial loads.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the answer is simply 120 / h, and we don't need to worry about fractions of loads.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other options are clearly incorrect.\n\nLet's look at option A: 120 + h. That would mean adding the total rocks to the load capacity, which doesn't make sense. If she can carry h rocks per load, adding h to 120 would just make it bigger, but doesn't relate to the number of loads needed.\n\nOption B: 120h. That's total rocks multiplied by the load capacity. That would be the total number of rocks she carries if each load is h, but that doesn't give the number of loads. So, that seems incorrect.\n\nOption C: 120 - h. That would be the total rocks minus the load capacity, which also doesn't give the number of loads.\n\nOption D: 120 / h. This seems the most logical because it's total rocks divided by load capacity.\n\nWait, but in my earlier thought, if h is 50, then 120 / 50 = 2.4, which should be rounded up to 3 loads. But maybe the question assumes that h divides evenly into 120, or perhaps it's acceptable to have a fraction of a load.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the exact calculation without rounding up.\n\nLet me consider another example. Suppose h is 40. Then 120 / 40 = 3, which is an integer, so that works.\n\nIf h is 60, then 120 / 60 = 2, which is also an integer.\n\nIf h is 30, then 120 / 30 = 4, which is an integer.\n\nIf h is 20, then 120 / 20 = 6, which is an integer.\n\nWait, in all these cases, the number of loads is an integer, so no need to round up.\n\nPerhaps the question assumes that h divides evenly into 120, making the number of loads an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simplified and doesn't consider cases where h doesn't divide evenly into 120.\n\nGiven that, option D seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if h is 50, as in my earlier example.\n\nIf h = 50, then 120 / 50 = 2.4. In reality, she would need 3 loads because she can't carry a fraction of a load.\n\nBut according to the expression 120 / h, it would be 2.4 loads, which doesn't make sense in practical terms.\n\nHowever, in mathematical terms, the expression 120 / h gives the exact number of loads if partial loads are allowed, but in reality, you'd need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nBut again, the question seems to suggest choosing the expression without considering rounding.\n\nGiven that, option D is still the most appropriate choice.\n\nMaybe the question assumes that h divides evenly into 120, so the number of loads is exactly 120 / h.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding of division in this context.\n\nIn any case, based on the options provided, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 120 / h"
