                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about income distribution in Niger in 1995, based on World Bank data. It breaks down household income shares by different groups of the population. Specifically, it tells me that:\n\n- The poorest 20% of households had 7.5% of the total income.\n\n- The next 20% had 11.8%.\n\n- The middle 20% had 15.5%.\n\n- The second richest 20% had 21.1%.\n\n- And the top 20% had 44.1%.\n\nAnd the question is asking for the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households. The options are A. 15.50%, B. 34.80%, C. 48.10%, and D. 65.20%.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what \"cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households\" means. Well, the bottom 60% would be the poorest segments of the population combined. In this context, since the data is divided into quintiles (each 20% of the population), the bottom 60% would be the poorest three quintiles.\n\nSo, the bottom 60% consists of:\n\n- The poorest 20% (7.5% of income)\n\n- The next 20% (11.8% of income)\n\n- And the middle 20% (15.5% of income)\n\nTo find the cumulative income share of these three groups, I need to add up their individual shares.\n\nSo, cumulative income share = 7.5% + 11.8% + 15.5%\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n7.5 + 11.8 is 19.3\n\nAnd 19.3 + 15.5 is 34.8%\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households is 34.80%.\n\nLooking back at the options, that corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's another way to interpret the data.\n\nOne thing I notice is that the question mentions \"cumulative income share.\" Is there a possibility that it's referring to something else, like the Lorenz curve or something similar? Probably not, as it's directly referring to the sum of income shares of the bottom 60%.\n\nAnother thought: is there any chance that the middle 20% is considered part of the top 40%, but in this case, the categories are clearly labeled, so I think it's safe to consider the middle 20% as part of the bottom 60%.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, I'll check if the sum of all quintile shares adds up to 100%. Let's see:\n\nPoorest 20%: 7.5%\n\nNext 20%: 11.8%\n\nMiddle 20%: 15.5%\n\nSecond richest 20%: 21.1%\n\nRichest 20%: 44.1%\n\nSum: 7.5 + 11.8 + 15.5 + 21.1 + 44.1\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n7.5 + 11.8 = 19.3\n\n19.3 + 15.5 = 34.8\n\n34.8 + 21.1 = 55.9\n\n55.9 + 44.1 = 100%\n\nPerfect, it adds up to 100%, so the data is complete and there are no missing parts.\n\nTherefore, the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% is indeed 34.80%, which matches option B.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
