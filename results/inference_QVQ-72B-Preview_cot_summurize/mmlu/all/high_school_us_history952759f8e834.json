                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's about a passage from John L. O'Sullivan's \"The Great Nation of Futurity\" from 1839. The passage is pretty grandiose, talking about the future of America being one of greatness, with a \"nation of many nations\" spreading across a hemisphere, under the stars, and governed by divine principles of equality and brotherhood.\n\nThe question is asking which option best states the principle described in this passage. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that colonists were destined to leave the British Empire because of the distance between the New World and England. Hmm, that doesn't really seem to align with what's being said here. The passage is more about America's future expansion and its role in manifesting divine principles, not about colonists leaving the British Empire due to geographical distance. So, I think A is probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B suggests that women are biologically predestined to lives of child rearing and domestic labor. That seems like a completely different topic. The passage is about the nation's future and its divine mission, not about the roles of women. Plus, the language in the passage emphasizes equality and divine principles, which doesn't align with limiting women's roles based on biology. So, I'd say B is also not the best fit.\n\nOption C states that America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned. Now, this sounds more promising. The passage talks about the \"far-reaching, the boundless future\" and the \"domain of space and time,\" which could be referring to territorial expansion. Additionally, it mentions that the nation is \"destined\" to manifest divine principles, which suggests a sense of destiny or inevitability about its growth and development. The idea of manifest destiny was a common belief in the 19th century that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent. This seems to resonate with what O'Sullivan is saying.\n\nOption D says that the abolition of slavery in the United States was certain to come about because slavery was immoral. While the passage does mention divine principles of equality and brotherhood, which would be opposed to slavery, the main focus seems to be on the nation's expansion and its future role in the world, rather than specifically on the abolition of slavery. That being said, abolition was a significant issue in the 19th century, and O'Sullivan was writing around the time when debates about slavery were intensifying.\n\nHowever, considering the overall tone and content of the passage, it appears to be more about the geographical and ideological expansion of the United States and its role in demonstrating divine principles of equality and brotherhood to the world. The abolition of slavery, while related to the idea of equality, isn't the primary focus here.\n\nSo, between options C and D, C seems to better capture the essence of the passage. The idea of America's expansion to the West Coast being inevitable and divinely sanctioned aligns well with the themes of manifest destiny and the nation's role in demonstrating divine principles through its growth.\n\nI think the best answer is C: America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
