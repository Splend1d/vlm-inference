                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand how Weber solves the 'England problem.' I have these options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through each option.\n\nOption A says, \"By denying its existence.\" Hmm, that doesn't seem right. If there's a problem, denying it exists isn't really solving it, is it? Plus, Weber was known for addressing complexities in society, so I doubt he would just dismiss a problem.\n\nOption B: \"By explaining the difference between the common law and civil law.\" Well, that sounds interesting. I know that England has a common law system, while many other countries have civil law systems based on Roman law. Maybe Weber thought that this difference was significant in the development of capitalism. But I'm not sure if that directly solves the 'England problem.'\n\nOption C: \"By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\" This seems more on point. I recall that Weber was interested in the relationship between law and economics, particularly how legal institutions could either promote or hinder capitalist development. So, perhaps he identified specific aspects of English law that were conducive to capitalism.\n\nOption D: \"By recognizing the importance of legitimate domination.\" This one is a bit vague. Legitimate domination sounds like it might relate to authority and state power, which could indirectly affect economic development. But I'm not sure how directly this relates to the 'England problem.'\n\nLet me try to recall what the 'England problem' is in the first place. I think it refers to the fact that England was the first country to industrialize and develop capitalism, and Weber was interested in why that happened there before elsewhere. So, he was looking for factors that made England unique in this regard.\n\nGiven that, option A seems unlikely because denying the problem exists doesn't address the question. Option B mentions the difference between common law and civil law, which could be relevant, but I think it's more about specific features within the English legal system that supported capitalism, not just the general difference between legal systems.\n\nOption C seems the most straightforward. Weber likely looked at particular aspects of English law that fostered capitalist activities, such as property rights, contract enforcement, or the flexibility of common law to adapt to new economic situations.\n\nOption D, \"legitimate domination,\" might relate to the idea that England had a stable system of government that was accepted by its citizens, which provided a conducive environment for economic growth. But again, it's not as directly related to the legal system as option C.\n\nI should also consider that Weber's work, particularly \"Economy and Society,\" discusses various types of authority and domination, including traditional, rational-legal, and charismatic authority. In that context, legitimate domination would refer to authority that is recognized as legitimate by those being governed. While this is important for social order, I'm not sure how it directly solves the 'England problem' regarding the rise of capitalism.\n\nPerhaps I should think about it differently. The 'England problem' is about why capitalism developed in England before elsewhere. Weber was interested in the role of law in facilitating or hindering economic development. So, if he identified specific legal features in England that were particularly supportive of capitalism, that would be a way of solving the problem.\n\nFor example, he might have noted that the English common law system was more flexible and could adapt more readily to new economic activities and relationships. Unlike civil law systems, which are based on comprehensive codes and more rigid structures, common law evolves through judicial decisions and precedents, which might make it better suited to handle novel situations arising from capitalist development.\n\nAdditionally, Weber might have emphasized the importance of a well-developed system of property rights in England, which secured individual ownership and allowed for the free transfer of assets, essential for capitalist enterprise.\n\nHe might also have considered the role of English commercial law in facilitating contracts and business transactions, making it easier for capitalists to operate and expand their operations.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that Weber focused on specific legal features in England that promoted capitalism, which aligns with option C.\n\nLet me check if there's any direct reference in Weber's work that addresses the 'England problem' in this way. I recall that in \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,\" Weber discusses the rise of capitalism in relation to the Protestant work ethic, but that's more about cultural factors. In \"Economy and Society,\" he delves into the sociological aspects of law and economics, so perhaps that's where he addresses the legal foundations of capitalism in England.\n\nI think it's safe to say that Weber solved the 'England problem' by highlighting certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's quickly consider why the other options are less suitable:\n\nOption A: Denying the existence of the problem doesn't solve it; it's more of an avoidance strategy.\n\nOption B: Explaining the difference between common law and civil law is informative but doesn't specifically address why England was conducive to capitalism.\n\nOption D: Recognizing the importance of legitimate domination is relevant to social order but doesn't directly explain the legal foundations that supported capitalist development.\n\nSo, yeah, option C is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
