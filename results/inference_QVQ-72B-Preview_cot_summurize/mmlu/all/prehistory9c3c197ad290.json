                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about archaeological evidence of social stratification and inequality. It's giving me four options, and I need to pick the one that best shows differences in social status or wealth in ancient societies. Let me think through each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that burials without exotic grave goods also contain bones indicating that they engaged in less strenuous labor. So, if I understand this correctly, it's suggesting that people who didn't have fancy or valuable items in their graves were also the ones who had easier jobs during their lives. Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive at first glance. Usually, when we think of social stratification, we think that people with higher status would have better graves and maybe easier lives, while those with lower status might have simpler graves and harder work. But this option is saying that those without exotic grave goods had less strenuous labor. So, maybe they had easier lives, but their graves don't reflect any special status. This could imply that social status wasn't strongly linked to grave goods in this society, or perhaps that other factors were at play. It doesn't seem to directly point to social inequality based on wealth or status as indicated by grave goods.\n\nOption B says that burials with exotic grave goods also contain bones indicating that they engaged in less strenuous labor. This seems more in line with what I'd expect. If people with fancy grave goods also had easier lives, it suggests that they were part of a higher social class or had greater wealth, which allowed them to avoid hard labor. This would indicate some form of social stratification, where certain individuals or families had access to better resources and a higher standard of living. So, this option seems like a strong candidate for showing social inequality.\n\nOption C says that all burials contain equal amounts of exotic grave goods, but some are more impressive than others. This is a bit confusing. If all burials have equal amounts of exotic grave goods, but some are more impressive, does that mean that while everyone gets some nice items, some graves have particularly valuable or elaborate items? That could still indicate social differentiation, where everyone is given a basic level of respect in death, but those with higher status get extra\u5f85\u9047s. This could also suggest social stratification, but it's a bit nuanced. It's not as clear-cut as some graves having significantly more valuable items than others.\n\nOption D says that burials contain bones indicating that people were segregated based on gender, stature, and personal capabilities, including artistic abilities. This seems to be more about differentiation based on individual characteristics rather than social status. Segregation based on gender, for example, might reflect roles and divisions of labor within society but doesn't necessarily indicate a hierarchy of wealth or power. Similarly, differences based on stature or artistic abilities might reflect specialized roles but not necessarily higher or lower social classes. So, while this shows some form of social differentiation, it doesn't directly point to social stratification or inequality in the sense of different levels of wealth or power.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems to be the most straightforward indicator of social stratification and inequality. It shows a clear link between the presence of exotic grave goods (indicating wealth or status) and evidence of less strenuous labor (suggesting a higher standard of living). The other options either don't show as clear a connection or suggest different kinds of social differentiation that aren't as directly tied to status and inequality.\n\nI think the answer is B. Burials with exotic grave goods also contain bones indicating that they engaged in less strenuous labor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
