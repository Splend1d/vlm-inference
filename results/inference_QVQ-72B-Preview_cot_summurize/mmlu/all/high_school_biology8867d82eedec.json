                    "text": "Let me see which of these statements is correct. I'll go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Water flows from hypertonic to hypotonic.\" Hmm, I remember that osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. Hypertonic solutions have higher solute concentrations, and hypotonic solutions have lower solute concentrations. So, water should flow from hypotonic to hypertonic, right? Wait, but the statement says \"from hypertonic to hypotonic.\" That seems backwards. I think this statement is incorrect.\n\nNext, option B: \"Germinating seeds use less oxygen than do nongerminating seeds.\" I know that during germination, seeds become active and start growing. This process requires energy, which is typically obtained through cellular respiration. Cellular respiration involves the use of oxygen to break down glucose and produce energy in the form of ATP. So, if germinating seeds are more metabolically active, they should use more oxygen, not less. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect as well.\n\nMoving on to option C: \"The rate of transpiration decreases with an increase in air movement.\" Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water vapor through their leaves, stems, and flowers, primarily through stomata. I thought that increased air movement could actually increase transpiration because it removes the layer of humid air around the leaves, thereby enhancing the gradient for water vapor diffusion. So, if air movement increases, transpiration should increase, not decrease. Therefore, this statement might be incorrect.\n\nLastly, option D: \"Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis.\" I recall that gel electrophoresis is a method used to separate DNA fragments based on their size. When an electric current is applied to the gel, DNA fragments move through the gel matrix towards the positive electrode. Smaller fragments can move more easily through the pores of the gel and thus migrate faster than larger fragments, which are slowed down by the gel's matrix. So, this statement seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check each one to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nFor option A, remember that in osmosis, water moves from an area of high water potential to low water potential. In terms of solute concentration, water moves from a hypotonic solution (low solute, high water concentration) to a hypertonic solution (high solute, low water concentration). So, water flows from hypotonic to hypertonic, not the other way around. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\nFor option B, germinating seeds are indeed more metabolically active than non-germinating seeds. They require oxygen for cellular respiration to fuel their growth and development. Non-germinating seeds are in a state of dormancy and have much lower metabolic rates, using minimal oxygen. Hence, germinating seeds use more oxygen, making statement B incorrect.\n\nRegarding option C, transpiration in plants is influenced by several factors, including air movement. While it might seem intuitive that increased air movement could decrease transpiration by stabilizing the boundary layer around leaves, in reality, increased air movement typically leads to increased transpiration because it helps to dissipate the moist air near the leaf surface, thereby maintaining a gradient that favors water vapor loss. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.\n\nFinally, option D aligns with the principles of gel electrophoresis. In this technique, DNA fragments are separated based on their size and charge. Smaller fragments can navigate the gel pores more quickly than larger ones, which get partially blocked by the pores. Thus, smaller fragments travel farther in the gel, making this statement correct.\n\nSo, after evaluating all the options, the correct statement is D: Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
