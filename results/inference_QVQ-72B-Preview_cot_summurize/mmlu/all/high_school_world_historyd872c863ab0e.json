                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nSource 1:\n\"You may well ask: \"Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.\"\nGay Liberation Front, Manifesto, 1971\nAccording to the text, the authors of Source 3 see which of the following as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about the Gay Liberation Front's manifesto from 1971. The question is asking, according to the text, what do the authors of Source 3 see as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation? And the options are:\n\nA. Rigid societal gender roles\n\nB. Conflicts with the women's rights movement\n\nC. Societal privileging of some races over others\n\nD. Inequity in pay scales\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall what's in Source 3. It's the Gay Liberation Front's manifesto from 1971. I remember that it talks about the long-term goal of Gay Liberation being to rid society of the gender-role system, which is seen as the root of their oppression. They also mention that this can only be achieved by eliminating social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles.\n\nSo, right off the bat, option A seems relevant because they're specifically talking about the gender-role system as the root of their oppression. That suggests that rigid societal gender roles are seen as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure. Option B is conflicts with the women's rights movement. Hmm, in the manifesto, they actually talk about forming a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement. They say that abolishing gender roles is necessary for women's liberation as well, and they aim to develop their ideas and practice in close relation with the women's liberation movement. So, they're not seeing conflicts with the women's rights movement as an obstacle; quite the opposite, they're seeking to ally with it. So, option B seems unlikely.\n\nOption C is societal privileging of some races over others. While that's certainly an important issue, I don't recall the manifesto specifically mentioning race or racism as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation. They do talk about the need to eliminate social pressures related to gender roles, but nothing directly about racial inequalities. So, maybe not option C.\n\nOption D is inequity in pay scales. Again, while pay equity is an important issue, especially in the context of women's rights, I don't remember the manifesto focusing on pay scales. Their main focus seems to be on the gender-role system and its abolition.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option A, rigid societal gender roles, is the most accurate answer. That's directly addressed in the manifesto as the root of their oppression and something they aim to eliminate.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think back to the manifesto again. They say that children and young people should be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests without conforming to stereotyped gender roles. That reinforces the idea that the gender-role system is something they want to dismantle, which aligns with option A.\n\nThey also mention that they cannot achieve this change alone and need to form an alliance with the women's liberation movement. Again, this suggests that they see the gender-role system as a common enemy and that working together is part of the solution, not an obstacle.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's safe to say that according to the text, the authors of Source 3 see rigid societal gender roles as the main obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
