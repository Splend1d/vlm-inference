                    "text": "So I've got this redox reaction to balance:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + I\u2212 + H+ \u2192 Mn2+ + IO3\u2212 + H2O\n\nAnd I need to figure out which of these options is true once it's balanced. I'm a bit rusty on balancing redox reactions, but I remember there are methods like the half-reaction method that can help with this.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what's being oxidized and what's being reduced. MnO4\u2212 is turning into Mn2+, which seems like a reduction because manganese's oxidation state is decreasing (from +7 in MnO4\u2212 to +2 in Mn2+). I\u2212 is turning into IO3\u2212, which suggests oxidation (iodide to iodate).\n\nSo, I should split this into two half-reactions: one for oxidation and one for reduction.\n\nLet's start with the oxidation half-reaction:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212\n\nI need to balance the atoms and charges.\n\nFirst, balance iodine:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212\n\nAdd water to balance oxygen:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O\n\nNow, balance hydrogen:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O\n\nWait, there are no hydrogen atoms on the left side, but there are six on the right. Since this is in acidic conditions, I can add H+ to balance hydrogen:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O + 6H+\n\nNow, balance charge. The left side has -1 charge, and the right side has -1 from IO3\u2212, but there are also 6 H+ added, which are +6, so total right side charge is +5. So, overall, the left side is -1, and the right side is +5, meaning I need to add 6 electrons to the right side to balance charges:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O + 6H+ + 6e\u2212\n\nNow, the reduction half-reaction:\n\nMnO4\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+\n\nBalance manganese:\n\nMnO4\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+\n\nAdd water to balance oxygen:\n\nMnO4\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nNow, balance hydrogen:\n\nMnO4\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nLeft side has no hydrogen, right side has 8 H from 4 H2O. Add H+ to the left side:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + 8H+ \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nNow, balance charge. MnO4\u2212 has -1 charge, and 8H+ add +8, totaling +7 on the left. Mn2+ has +2 on the right, so I need to add 5 electrons to the left side to balance charges:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + 8H+ + 5e\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nNow, I have both half-reactions balanced:\n\nOxidation: I\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O + 6H+ + 6e\u2212\n\nReduction: MnO4\u2212 + 8H+ + 5e\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nTo combine them, I need to make the number of electrons equal in both half-reactions. The least common multiple of 6 and 5 is 30.\n\nSo, multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 5 and the reduction half-reaction by 6:\n\nOxidation: 5I\u2212 \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 15H2O + 30H+ + 30e\u2212\n\nReduction: 6MnO4\u2212 + 48H+ + 30e\u2212 \u2192 6Mn2+ + 24H2O\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 48H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 15H2O + 6Mn2+ + 24H2O + 30H+\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 48H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 39H2O + 6Mn2+ + 30H+\n\nNow, simplify by removing the excess H+ and H2O.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should not add them directly like that.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting with:\n\nOxidation: 5I\u2212 \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 30H+ + 30e\u2212\n\nReduction: 6MnO4\u2212 + 48H+ + 30e\u2212 \u2192 6Mn2+ + 24H2O\n\nAdd them:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 48H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 24H2O + 6Mn2+ + 30H+\n\nNow, cancel out the 30H+ from both sides:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 18H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 24H2O + 6Mn2+\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let's check the coefficients again.\n\nFrom the balanced equation:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 48H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 24H2O + 6Mn2+ + 30H+\n\nNow, subtract 30H+ from both sides:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 18H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 24H2O + 6Mn2+\n\nNow, check if the equation is balanced:\n\n- I: 5 = 5\n\n- Mn: 6 = 6\n\n- H: 18 = 24 (wait, left side has 18 H+, right side has 24 H from H2O)\n\n- O: 24 (from MnO4\u2212 and H2O) = 24 (from IO3\u2212 and H2O)\n\nHmm, seems like there's an imbalance in H and O. Maybe I need to adjust the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have combined the half-reactions differently.\n\nLet me try balancing the half-reactions again.\n\nStarting over:\n\nOxidation half-reaction:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212\n\nBalance I:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212\n\nAdd H2O to balance O:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O\n\nNow, balance H:\n\nI\u2212 \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O\n\nLeft side has no H, right side has 6 H. Add 6H+ to the left side:\n\nI\u2212 + 6H+ \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O\n\nNow, balance charge. Left side has -1 + 6 = +5, right side has -1 from IO3\u2212, so need to add 6 electrons to the right side:\n\nI\u2212 + 6H+ \u2192 IO3\u2212 + 3H2O + 6e\u2212\n\nReduction half-reaction:\n\nMnO4\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+\n\nBalance Mn:\n\nMnO4\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+\n\nAdd H2O to balance O:\n\nMnO4\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nNow, balance H:\n\nMnO4\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nLeft side has no H, right side has 8 H. Add 8H+ to the left side:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + 8H+ \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nNow, balance charge. Left side has -1 + 8 = +7, right side has +2, so need to add 5 electrons to the left side:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + 8H+ + 5e\u2212 \u2192 Mn2+ + 4H2O\n\nNow, to combine them, make electrons equal. Least common multiple of 6 and 5 is 30.\n\nMultiply oxidation by 5:\n\n5I\u2212 + 30H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 15H2O + 30e\u2212\n\nMultiply reduction by 6:\n\n6MnO4\u2212 + 48H+ + 30e\u2212 \u2192 6Mn2+ + 24H2O\n\nNow, add them:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 78H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 24H2O + 6Mn2+ + 15H2O\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 78H+ \u2192 5IO3\u2212 + 39H2O + 6Mn2+\n\nNow, check if this is balanced:\n\n- I: 5 = 5\n\n- Mn: 6 = 6\n\n- H: 78 = 78 (from 39H2O)\n\n- O: 24 (from MnO4\u2212 and H2O) = 24 (from IO3\u2212 and H2O)\n\nSeems balanced now. So the balanced equation is:\n\n5I\u2212 + 6MnO4\u2212 + 78H+ \u2194 5IO3\u2212 + 6Mn2+ + 39H2O\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The I\u2212 : IO3\u2212 ratio is 3:1.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, it's 5I\u2212 to 5IO3\u2212, which is 1:1, not 3:1. So option A is false.\n\nB. The MnO4- : I- ratio is 6:5.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, it's 6MnO4\u2212 to 5I\u2212, which is indeed 6:5. So option B is true.\n\nC. The MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio is 3:1.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, it's 6MnO4\u2212 to 6Mn2+, which is 1:1, not 3:1. So option C is false.\n\nD. The H+ : I\u2212 ratio is 2:1.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, it's 78H+ to 5I\u2212, which is 78:5 = 15.6:1, not 2:1. So option D is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
