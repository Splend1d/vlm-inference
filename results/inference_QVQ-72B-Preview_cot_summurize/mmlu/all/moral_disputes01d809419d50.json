The question is asking what it means for an action to be intrinsically permissible. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, the doctrine of double effect is a moral principle that deals with actions that have both intended effects and unintended side effects. It's about when it's permissible to cause harm as a side effect of achieving a good outcome. But here, the focus is on intrinsic permissibility, which seems to be about the nature of the action itself, regardless of its consequences.\n\nOption A says that an intrinsically permissible action is one that, apart from its effects, is morally permissible. So, it's saying that the action is okay in itself, regardless of what it leads to. That seems plausible.\n\nOption B says that the action is only permissible because of its effects. That sounds more like consequentialism, where the morality of an action is determined solely by its outcomes. But the doctrine of double effect is more about the intentions and the intrinsic nature of the action, not just its effects.\n\nOption C says that no actual person would ever endorse that action. That seems contradictory because if an action is intrinsically permissible, you'd think that people would endorse it. So, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D says that the action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable. This sounds a bit confusing. It seems to be suggesting that the action's value derives from its connection to other intrinsically valuable things, rather than being intrinsically valuable itself.\n\nGiven these options, I think Option A is the closest to the correct understanding of intrinsic permissibility in the context of the doctrine of double effect. It emphasizes that the action is permissible in itself, apart from its effects, which aligns with the idea of intrinsic properties.\n\nBut let me double-check. The doctrine of double effect does consider the intention behind an action and whether the action itself is morally acceptable, even if it leads to harmful side effects that are not intended. So, yes, it's about the intrinsic nature of the action being permissible, independent of its consequences.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. The action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
