                    "text": "So I have this Python expression: 4 + 3 % 2. I need to figure out what it evaluates to. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that expressions in Python follow certain rules of precedence, right? So, there's an order in which operations are performed. I remember that parentheses come first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. But wait, in this case, I have addition and modulus operators. Where does modulus fit in?\n\nLet me recall the exact precedence order. Actually, in Python, the modulus operator (%) has the same precedence as multiplication and division, which is higher than addition and subtraction. So, in the expression 4 + 3 % 2, the modulus operation should be evaluated before the addition.\n\nOkay, so first, compute 3 % 2. The modulus operator gives the remainder of the division of 3 by 2. 3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so 3 % 2 equals 1.\n\nThen, add that result to 4. So, 4 + 1 equals 5.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the addition could be evaluated first? No, because precedence dictates that modulus is done before addition. If I were to write this without considering precedence, I might think 4 + 3 is 7, then 7 % 2 is 1, but that doesn't seem right. No, I need to respect the operator precedence.\n\nLet me double-check with some examples or maybe run a quick check in Python. Hmm, I can't do that right now, but I can think about it logically.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the expression step by step. First, evaluate the modulus, which is 3 % 2, resulting in 1. Then, add that result to 4, giving 5.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the operations from left to right without considering precedence, I'd add 4 and 3 first, getting 7, and then take the modulus of 7 % 2, which is 1. But that would be incorrect because it ignores the precedence of the modulus operator.\n\nSo, to make sure, I'll stick with the initial approach: evaluate the modulus first, then perform the addition, leading to 5.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 5\n\nMy calculation suggests that the answer is D. 5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors at play here. For example, does Python handle modulus differently in some cases? I don't think so. The modulus operator in Python works the same way as in other programming languages, returning the remainder of the division.\n\nAlso, Python follows the standard order of operations, known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), from highest to lowest precedence. Modulus has the same precedence as multiplication and division, which is higher than addition and subtraction.\n\nTherefore, in the expression 4 + 3 % 2, the modulus operation 3 % 2 is evaluated first, resulting in 1, and then added to 4, resulting in 5.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that the correct answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
