                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question about urbanization and its impact on hunger and malnutrition. Let's see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that there's no significant difference because low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries. Hmm, that seems plausible. Maybe urban areas have markets and easier access to food, but if people are poor, they might still struggle to afford it.\n\nOption B claims that urbanization will reduce poverty and hunger because these issues are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas. Wait, is that true? I thought that while rural areas do have high poverty rates, urban poverty is also a significant problem, especially in slums and informal settlements. Maybe not entirely concentrated in rural areas.\n\nOption C states that urban dwellers depend more on purchasing food rather than growing their own, and thus are more vulnerable to food price increases. That makes sense because in rural areas, people might grow some of their own food, whereas in cities, most food has to be bought. So, if food prices go up, it could hit urban poor harder.\n\nOption D says that poor city dwellers eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize, and root crops, and that as the world urbanizes, more of these foods will need to be produced. Interesting, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. I thought that in many urban areas, people might have access to a wider variety of foods, depending on their income.\n\nLet me think about this again. The question is: What difference will urbanization make for hunger and malnutrition?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what urbanization is. Urbanization refers to the process where more people move from rural areas to cities, leading to growth in urban populations. This shift can have various impacts on social, economic, and environmental aspects.\n\nNow, considering hunger and malnutrition, these are complex issues influenced by factors like income, food availability, food access, and utilization.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:** No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries.\n\nIs this accurate? In many developing countries, both urban and rural poor face challenges in accessing sufficient and nutritious food. However, there might be differences in the nature of these challenges.\n\nFor example, in rural areas, factors like limited infrastructure, distance to markets, and reliance on agriculture for food and income can affect food security. In urban areas, even though markets are closer, affordability can be an issue for the poor, especially as living costs can be higher.\n\nBut, I've also heard that urban areas often have better access to diverse foods due to larger markets and supply chains. So, perhaps there are some differences in the types of food consumed, but in terms of hunger and malnutrition, the constraints might be similar for the poorest segments.\n\n**Option B:** It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas.\n\nThis seems too optimistic. While it's true that rural areas often have higher poverty rates, urban poverty is also a significant issue, especially in rapidly urbanizing regions like Africa and Asia.\n\nIn fact, as cities grow, so does the number of people living in poverty in urban areas. Slums and informal settlements are common, where people lack basic services and secure livelihoods. Therefore, simply increasing urbanization doesn't automatically reduce poverty and hunger.\n\n**Option C:** Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\n\nThis seems plausible. In urban areas, most people rely on buying food from markets or stores rather than growing their own. This dependency on purchased food makes them more susceptible to fluctuations in food prices.\n\nIf food prices rise, urban poor\u2014who already spend a large portion of their income on food\u2014will struggle even more to afford sufficient and nutritious food. This can exacerbate hunger and malnutrition.\n\nIn contrast, rural households might have some degree of self-sufficiency in food production, which could provide some buffer against price increases, although this isn't always the case, especially for smallholder farmers who also sell and buy food.\n\n**Option D:** Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize, and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanizes.\n\nThis seems a bit too specific and perhaps oversimplified. While it's true that in some regions, these crops form a significant part of the diet for low-income urban residents, it's not necessarily universal.\n\nMoreover, as urbanization progresses, the demand for diverse types of food, including vegetables, fruits, and animal-source foods, might increase, depending on income levels and cultural preferences.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that urbanization would lead exclusively to increased demand for sorghum, millet, maize, and root crops.\n\nConsidering all this, Option C seems to be the most accurate statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
