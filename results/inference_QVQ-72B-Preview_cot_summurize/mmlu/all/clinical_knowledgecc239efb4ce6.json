                    "text": "So I have this question about the knee joint, and I need to figure out which of these statements is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst option: \"The knee is a ball and socket joint.\" I remember that a ball and socket joint is like the shoulder or hip, where one bone has a round end that fits into a cup-shaped part of another bone, allowing for a lot of movement in different directions. But the knee doesn't seem like that. The knee is more of a hinge joint, right? It mainly moves back and forth, like a door hinge, allowing flexion and extension. So, I think this first statement is incorrect.\n\nSecond option: \"A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee.\" I've heard of a baker's cyst, but where is it located? Let me recall. A baker's cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, is typically found behind the knee, in the popliteal fossa. So, it's not anterior to the knee; it's posterior. That means this statement is probably false.\n\nThird option: \"The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion.\" Effusion refers to fluid accumulation in a joint, right? So, if there's fluid in the knee joint, the patellar tap is a way to check for that. I think this is correct. Let me confirm. The patellar tap involves pressing on the soft spot below the patella, and if there's fluid, you can feel a fluid wave or see the patella move slightly. Yeah, that sounds right. So, this seems to be a true statement.\n\nFourth option: \"'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum.\" Okay, what is knock knee? I think it's when the knees are close together and the ankles are far apart, like the legs are bowed inward. Genu varum means the legs are bowed outward, with the knees far apart and ankles close together, like in bowleggedness. So, knock knee is the opposite; it's genu valgum. Therefore, this statement is incorrect because knock knee is genu valgum, not genu varum.\n\nSo, from these options, the only correct statement is C: The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me double-check each point.\n\n- A: Knee is a ball and socket joint \u2013 No, it's a hinge joint.\n\n- B: Baker's cyst is anterior to the knee \u2013 No, it's posterior, in the popliteal fossa.\n\n- C: Patellar tap for effusion \u2013 Yes, that's a standard method to check for fluid in the knee joint.\n\n- D: Knock knee is bilateral genu varum \u2013 No, knock knee is genu valgum, while genu varum is bowleggedness.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
