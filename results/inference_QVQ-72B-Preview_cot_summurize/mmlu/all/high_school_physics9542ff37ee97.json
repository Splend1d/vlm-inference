                    "text": "So I have this problem here about the Space Shuttle and the gravitational acceleration it experiences while orbiting 300 km above Earth's surface. Earth's radius is given as 6,400 km, and I need to find the gravitational acceleration at that height. The options are zero, 4.9 m/s\u00b2, 9.8 m/s\u00b2, and 8.9 m/s\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how gravitational acceleration changes with distance from Earth's center. I know that gravitational force follows the inverse square law, which means that the acceleration due to gravity decreases as you go farther from the center of Earth.\n\nThe formula for gravitational acceleration (g) at a distance (r) from the center of Earth is:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of Earth,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of Earth.\n\nGiven that, I need to find \\( r \\) for the Space Shuttle's orbit. Since the shuttle is 300 km above Earth's surface, and Earth's radius is 6,400 km, the distance from the center is:\n\n\\[ r = 6,400 \\, \\text{km} + 300 \\, \\text{km} = 6,700 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\nBut wait, the options are in m/s\u00b2, so I should probably convert kilometers to meters to match the units. I know that 1 km = 1,000 meters, so:\n\n\\[ r = 6,700 \\, \\text{km} \\times 1,000 = 6,700,000 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNow, I need the values for \\( G \\) and \\( M \\). I remember that \\( G \\) is approximately \\( 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\), and the mass of Earth \\( M \\) is roughly \\( 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 5.972 \\times 10^{24}}{(6,700,000)^2} \\]\n\nFirst, I'll multiply \\( G \\) and \\( M \\):\n\n\\[ GM = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\]\n\nTo multiply these, I can multiply the coefficients and add the exponents:\n\n\\[ 6.674 \\times 5.972 \\approx 40.07 \\]\n\n\\[ 40.07 \\times 10^{-11 + 24} = 40.07 \\times 10^{13} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\]\n\nBut actually, it's better to keep more decimal places for accuracy:\n\n\\[ GM = 6.674 \\times 5.972 = 40.071664 \\times 10^{13} = 4.0071664 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = (6,700,000)^2 = 44,890,000,000,000 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nNow, divide \\( GM \\) by \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} \\]\n\nWait, let's write that properly:\n\n\\[ r^2 = 6,700,000^2 = 44,890,000,000,000 = 4.489 \\times 10^{13} \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} \\]\n\nTo divide these, I can divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664}{4.489} \\times 10^{14 - 13} = 0.9 \\times 10^{1} = 9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nHmm, that came out to be 9 m/s\u00b2, which is option C, 9.8 m/s\u00b2. But wait, I think there might be a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me check the division more carefully:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} = \\frac{4.0071664}{4.489} \\times 10^{1} \\]\n\nNow, dividing 4.0071664 by 4.489:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4.0071664}{4.489} \\approx 0.9 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 0.9 \\times 10^{1} = 9 \\), which gives 9 m/s\u00b2. But option C is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, and option D is 8.9 m/s\u00b2. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?\n\nLet me double-check the value of \\( GM \\):\n\n\\[ GM = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\]\n\nMultiplying 6.674 and 5.972:\n\n\\[ 6.674 \\times 5.972 = 40.071664 \\]\n\nSo, \\( GM = 40.071664 \\times 10^{13} = 4.0071664 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\)\n\nAnd \\( r^2 = 6,700,000^2 = 44,890,000,000,000 = 4.489 \\times 10^{13} \\, \\text{m}^2 \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} = \\frac{4.0071664}{4.489} \\times 10^{1} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\frac{4.0071664}{4.489} \\):\n\nLet's perform the division:\n\n4.0071664 \u00f7 4.489 \u2248 0.9\n\nSo, \\( g \u2248 0.9 \\times 10^{1} = 9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n\nBut this is too approximate. Let's use a more precise calculation.\n\nActually, using a calculator for better accuracy:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} = \\frac{4.0071664}{4.489} \\times 10 = 0.9 \\times 10 = 9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nWait, but I know that at the Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is about 9.8 m/s\u00b2. So, at 300 km above the surface, it should be slightly less than that, but not zero. Maybe I need to consider more significant figures.\n\nLet's use more decimal places for \\( G \\) and \\( M \\):\n\n\\( G = 6.67408 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\)\n\n\\( M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ GM = 6.67408 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 5.972 \\times 10^{24} = 4.0071664 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\]\n\nAnd \\( r = 6,700,000 \\, \\text{m} \\), so \\( r^2 = 4.489 \\times 10^{13} \\, \\text{m}^2 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} = \\frac{4.0071664}{4.489} \\times 10 = 0.9 \\times 10 = 9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nWait, this still gives 9 m/s\u00b2, but the options are 9.8 m/s\u00b2 and 8.9 m/s\u00b2. Maybe I need to consider that the shuttle is in orbit and experiencing free fall, but the question is specifically about the gravitational acceleration it experiences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem. Maybe using the relationship between gravitational acceleration at different altitudes.\n\nI recall that gravitational acceleration at sea level is:\n\n\\[ g_0 = \\frac{GM}{R^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( R \\) is Earth's radius.\n\nGiven that, at a height \\( h \\) above the surface, the gravitational acceleration \\( g \\) is:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{GM}{(R + h)^2} \\]\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{GM}{(6,400,000 + 300,000)^2} = \\frac{GM}{6,700,000^2} \\]\n\nUsing \\( GM = 4.0071664 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}^2 \\)\n\nAnd \\( r^2 = 6,700,000^2 = 4.489 \\times 10^{13} \\, \\text{m}^2 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} = 9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nBut this seems too low compared to the sea-level value of 9.8 m/s\u00b2. Maybe I need to use the exact formula for gravitational acceleration at sea level to compare.\n\nAt sea level:\n\n\\[ g_0 = \\frac{GM}{R^2} = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{6,400,000^2} = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.096 \\times 10^{13}} = 9.802 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nSo, at sea level, \\( g_0 \\approx 9.802 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\), which aligns with the common value of 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, at 300 km above the surface, \\( g \\approx 9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\), which is less than at sea level, as expected.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, which is the sea-level value, and option D is 8.9 m/s\u00b2. Since my calculation gives approximately 9 m/s\u00b2, which is closer to 8.9 m/s\u00b2 when considering significant figures, but not exactly matching.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in converting units or in the calculation. Let me try recalculating \\( g \\) with more precision.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} \\]\n\nDividing numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664}{4.489} \\times 10 = 0.9 \\times 10 = 9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nBut perhaps using more precise values:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} = 9.0 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nWait, but option D is 8.9 m/s\u00b2, which is slightly less. Maybe I need to consider more decimal places.\n\nLet's use \\( GM = 6.67408 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}^2 \\) and \\( M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\), and \\( r = 6,700,000 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6.67408 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 5.972 \\times 10^{24}}{(6,700,000)^2} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( GM \\):\n\n\\[ GM = 6.67408 \\times 5.972 \\times 10^{14} \\]\n\n\\[ 6.67408 \\times 5.972 \\approx 40.071664 \\]\n\n\\[ GM = 40.071664 \\times 10^{13} = 4.0071664 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}^2 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{4.0071664 \\times 10^{14}}{4.489 \\times 10^{13}} = 9.0 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nStill getting 9 m/s\u00b2, which is option C, but option D is 8.9 m/s\u00b2. Maybe there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for orbital velocity or centripetal acceleration, since the shuttle is in orbit.\n\nThe orbital velocity \\( v \\) for a circular orbit at distance \\( r \\) from Earth's center is:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\]\n\nAnd the centripetal acceleration \\( a \\) is:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{v^2}{r} = \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as the gravitational acceleration formula I used earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion lies in understanding what the shuttle experiences in orbit.\n\nIn orbit, the shuttle is in free fall around Earth, experiencing weightlessness, but it still feels the gravitational force, which provides the centripetal acceleration needed for its orbit.\n\nTherefore, the gravitational acceleration it experiences is indeed \\( g = \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\), which we calculated as approximately 9 m/s\u00b2.\n\nBut the sensation inside the shuttle is of weightlessness because everything is falling together at the same rate.\n\nSo, the actual acceleration due to gravity is still present, but the effects we typically associate with gravity (like things falling to the ground) are not observed because of the orbit.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer should be approximately 9 m/s\u00b2, which is closest to option C, 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, 9 m/s\u00b2 is closer to 9.8 m/s\u00b2 than to 8.9 m/s\u00b2.\n\nPerhaps the options are not precise, and I should choose the closest one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that at 300 km altitude, the gravitational acceleration is not zero, but it's reduced from the sea-level value of 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nGiven that, 9 m/s\u00b2 is less than 9.8 m/s\u00b2, which aligns with the idea that gravity decreases with distance.\n\nBut option C is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, which is the sea-level value, and option D is 8.9 m/s\u00b2.\n\nGiven that my calculation gives approximately 9 m/s\u00b2, which is closer to 8.9 m/s\u00b2, but not exactly matching.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider more significant figures.\n\nLet's use more precise values for \\( GM \\), \\( r \\), and \\( r^2 \\).\n\nGiven:\n\n\\( GM = 6.67408 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}^2 \\)\n\n\\( M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\n\\( r = 6,700,000 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6.67408 \\times 5.972 \\times 10^{14}}{6,700,000^2} \\]\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n\\[ 6.67408 \\times 5.972 = 4"
