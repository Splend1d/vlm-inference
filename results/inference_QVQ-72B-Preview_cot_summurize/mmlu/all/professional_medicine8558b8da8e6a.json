                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Rho(D) immune globulin and Rh incompatibility in pregnancy. So, the patient is a 30-year-old woman, pregnant for the second time, but her first pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks. Now she's at 28 weeks with this pregnancy, and everything seems to be going well so far. Her blood type is O Rh-negative, and the father is B Rh-positive. The doctor is recommending Rho(D) immune globulin for her. The question is asking what this treatment is most likely to prevent in this mother.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what Rho(D) immune globulin is and why it's being recommended. I remember that Rh incompatibility can be a problem in pregnancies where the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive. If the baby inherits the Rh-positive gene from the father, the baby's blood cells will be Rh-positive. Now, normally, during pregnancy, the mother's and baby's blood don't mix much, but sometimes, especially during delivery, there can be some mixing.\n\nIf the mother is Rh-negative and hasn't been exposed to Rh-positive blood before, she might start making antibodies against the Rh factor if she's exposed to it. These antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells in future pregnancies, leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn, which can be serious.\n\nSo, Rho(D) immune globulin is given to Rh-negative mothers to prevent this from happening. It contains antibodies against the Rh factor, and when given shortly after delivery or certain pregnancy events, it can bind to any Rh-positive cells that might have entered the mother's bloodstream, marking them for destruction before her immune system has a chance to recognize them and make its own antibodies.\n\nIn this case, the mother is already in her second pregnancy, and her first pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks. I wonder if that could have been related to Rh incompatibility, but I think spontaneous abortions at that stage are more often due to chromosomal abnormalities or other factors. Anyway, since she's now carrying a male fetus with no abnormalities seen on ultrasound, and the father is Rh-positive, there's a risk that this baby could be Rh-positive.\n\nGiven that, the doctor is recommending Rho(D) immune globulin to prevent her from developing antibodies against RhD, which could potentially harm future Rh-positive fetuses.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Development of natural killer cells\n\nB. Development of polycythemia\n\nC. Formation of antibodies to RhD\n\nI think the answer is C. Formation of antibodies to RhD.\n\nNatural killer cells are part of the innate immune system and are involved in fighting infections and tumor cells. I don't see a direct connection between Rho(D) immune globulin and the development of natural killer cells.\n\nPolycythemia is a condition where there are too many red blood cells in the blood, leading to thickened blood and potential circulatory problems. Again, I don't see a link between Rho(D) immune globulin and the development of polycythemia.\n\nWhereas, preventing the formation of antibodies to RhD is precisely what Rho(D) immune globulin is intended to do. By binding to any Rh-positive cells that might have entered the mother's circulation, it prevents her immune system from recognizing them and making its own antibodies.\n\nSo, in this context, the treatment is most likely to prevent the formation of antibodies to RhD in the mother.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
