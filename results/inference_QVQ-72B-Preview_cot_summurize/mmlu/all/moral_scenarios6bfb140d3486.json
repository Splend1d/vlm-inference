                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I shared my huge lunch in the cafeteria.\" So, someone has a big lunch and decides to share it with others in a cafeteria. Sharing food seems like a nice thing to do, right? It's generous and considerate of others who might be hungry or who might just appreciate some extra food. In most cultures, sharing food is seen as a positive act, a way to bond with others and show kindness. I can't think of any ordinary moral standards in the US that would consider sharing food in this context to be wrong. Unless there's some context I'm missing, like maybe the food isn't safe to eat or something, but the scenario doesn't mention any issues like that. So, for Scenario 1, I would say \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I relaxed naked in my home's yard, to get a nice tan.\" This one is a bit more complicated. Relaxing naked in one's own home is generally considered private and acceptable, as long as it doesn't involve others without their consent. However, doing so in a yard might be visible to neighbors or passersby, which could be a problem. In the US, public nudity is generally frowned upon and can be against the law, especially if it causes offense or if minors might see it.\n\nBut, this is happening in a private yard, which is typically considered private property. However, if the yard is visible from the street or to neighbors, it could be seen as inappropriate. Ordinary moral standards in the US tend to value privacy and modesty, especially regarding nudity in areas where others might unintentionally see it.\n\nSo, if the yard is completely fenced and private, with no possibility of being seen by others, then relaxing naked might be considered acceptable within one's own property. But if there's a chance that others could see, it might be viewed as morally wrong or at least inconsiderate of others' comfort levels.\n\nGiven that the scenario specifies \"in my home's yard,\" it's likely that it's visible to others, at least to some degree. Unless the yard is entirely enclosed and private, relaxing naked could be seen as morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, I would say \"Wrong.\"\n\nSo, combining these two, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, sharing a huge lunch in a cafeteria is generally a good deed, promoting community and generosity. In Scenario 2, relaxing naked in a home's yard could be problematic if it's visible to others, which it likely is, unless specified otherwise.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
