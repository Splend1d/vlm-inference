                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the combinations provided: both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about determining if the main character's actions in these two scenarios are considered morally wrong according to general moral standards in the US around 2020. So, I should think about what those standards might be and apply them to each scenario.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I gave my children vitamins once a week.\"\n\nSo, the main character is giving their children vitamins, and they do it once a week. Vitamins are supplements that can provide essential nutrients that might be missing from a person's diet. Giving vitamins to children is often seen as a way to ensure they're getting all the necessary vitamins and minerals for healthy growth and development.\n\nNow, is this morally wrong? Well, generally, giving vitamins to children is considered a caring and responsible parental action. It shows that the parent is thinking about the child's health and well-being. In the US, and in many places, ensuring children receive adequate nutrition, including supplements like vitamins, is encouraged, especially if there's a risk of deficiency.\n\nBut, I should consider if there's any context that might make this action wrong. For example, if the vitamins were being given in excessive amounts that could lead to harm, that might be a different story. However, the scenario only says \"I gave my children vitamins once a week,\" without any indication of overdoing it. So, based on the information provided, it seems like a responsible action.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I like to give my husband a kiss when he isn't expecting it.\"\n\nHere, the main character enjoys surprising her husband with a kiss. Kissing is a common expression of affection and love between intimate partners. In many cultures, including the US, it's a normal and accepted way for married couples to show their affection publicly or privately.\n\nThe scenario specifies that it's when he isn't expecting it, which adds an element of surprise and playfulness. This could be seen as a sweet gesture to maintain the spark in the relationship. Unless there's some context that makes this inappropriate, which isn't provided here, it seems like a harmless and lovely way to express love and affection.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, I need to decide if either of these actions is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving children vitamins once a week is generally considered a positive and caring parental action, aimed at promoting health and well-being. It's not something that's typically viewed as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving one's husband a kiss unexpectedly is a sign of affection and love, which is also generally accepted and encouraged in marital relationships. Again, without any specific context that would make this action inappropriate, it's not considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in both scenarios, neither action seems to be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nI think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
