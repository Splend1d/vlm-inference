                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. Estrella took a screening exam for paramedic training, and the scores are normally distributed with a mean (\u03bc) of 80 and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 9. She scored 90 on the test, and we need to find out her percentile rank and whether she qualifies for further evaluation based on being in the top 15%.\n\nFirst, since the scores are normally distributed, we can use z-scores to standardize her score and find its corresponding percentile. The z-score formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( x \\) is Estrella's score (90)\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean (80)\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (9)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{90 - 80}{9} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.111 \\]\n\nSo, her z-score is approximately 1.111.\n\nNext, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve to the left of this z-score, which will give us her percentile rank. I can use a z-table or a calculator to find this area.\n\nLooking up z = 1.11 in the z-table, I find that the cumulative probability is approximately 0.8665, or 86.65%.\n\nThis means Estrella is in the 86.65th percentile. Now, the question is whether she qualifies for further evaluation, which requires being in the top 15%. Since she's in the 86.65th percentile, she is indeed in the top 13.35% (100% - 86.65% = 13.35%), but wait\u2014hold on. If she's in the 86.65th percentile, that means she's in the top 13.35%, which is less than 15%. But the qualification requires being in the top 15%, so actually, she should qualify.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options:\n\nA. 13.35; she didn't qualify.\n\nB. 54.38; she didn't qualify.\n\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\n\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.\n\nGiven that her percentile is 86.65, which is in the top 13.35%, and the cutoff is the top 15%, she should qualify. So option C seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, z-score calculation:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{90 - 80}{9} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.111 \\]\n\nLooking up z = 1.11 in a standard normal table, the cumulative probability is indeed approximately 0.8665.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator or software to find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution for z = 1.111, I should get the same result.\n\nSo, her percentile rank is correctly calculated as approximately 86.65%.\n\nNow, to find out if she qualifies, we need to determine if she is in the top 15%. Since 86.65% is greater than 85% (which would be the top 15%), she is indeed in the top 15%.\n\nWait, but 86.65% is actually higher than 85%, so she is in the top 15%. But let's confirm the percentile to ensure accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the z-score that corresponds to the top 15%. The top 15% is the same as the upper 15% of the distribution. To find the z-score that corresponds to 0.85 (85%) of the area to the left, we can look it up in the z-table or use the inverse normal function.\n\nLooking up the z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.85, we find that z \u2248 1.036.\n\nSo, any z-score greater than approximately 1.036 would be in the top 15%.\n\nEstrella's z-score is approximately 1.111, which is greater than 1.036, confirming that she is in the top 15% and thus qualifies for further evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 86.65; she qualified.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other way to interpret the percentile or the qualification criteria. For example, perhaps the \"top 15%\" refers to the upper 15% of the distribution, which would correspond to percentiles above 85%, since the normal distribution is symmetric.\n\nGiven that, Estrella's 86.65th percentile would indeed place her within the top 13.35%, which is still within the top 15%, so she qualifies.\n\nAlternatively, if the qualification was based on a certain z-score threshold, and we've determined that z \u2248 1.036 is the cutoff for the top 15%, and Estrella's z-score is higher than that, she should qualify.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 86.65; she qualified.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
