                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Replacing a 'failure identity' with a 'success identity' is a goal of treatment for practitioners of _______ therapy.\" And the options are A. Gestalt, B. reality, C. solution-focused, D. Adlerian. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these therapies focuses on replacing a failure identity with a success identity.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a \"failure identity\" and a \"success identity\" mean in this context. I think a failure identity refers to a person's self-perception as someone who can't succeed or achieve their goals, maybe due to past experiences or negative beliefs about themselves. On the other hand, a success identity would involve seeing oneself as capable, confident, and able to achieve what they set out to do.\n\nSo, the goal here is to help clients change their self-perception from negative to positive, from failure to success. Now, I need to recall which type of therapy emphasizes this kind of shift in self-concept.\n\nLet me think about Gestalt therapy first. Gestalt therapy focuses on self-awareness and personal responsibility. It encourages clients to be aware of their feelings and thoughts in the present moment and to take responsibility for their actions. While it does aim to help clients become more self-aware and empowered, I don't recall it specifically targeting a shift from failure to success identity. Maybe it's not the best fit here.\n\nNext, reality therapy. Reality therapy is all about taking responsibility for one's choices and learning to make better decisions. It emphasizes the importance of healthy relationships and personal accountability. Again, while it helps clients improve their lives, I don't think it specifically focuses on changing one's identity from failure to success.\n\nThen there's solution-focused therapy. This approach concentrates on finding solutions in the present time and building on the client's strengths. It downplays past problems and instead looks at what the client is doing well and how they can do more of that. This seems a bit closer because it focuses on strengths and building success, but I'm not sure if it's the primary goal to replace a failure identity with a success identity.\n\nLastly, Adlerian therapy. Adlerian therapy is based on the ideas of Alfred Adler and focuses on social interest, the desire to connect with others and contribute to society. It also emphasizes the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping personality and self-perception. Adlerian therapists work on helping clients overcome feelings of inferiority and develop a healthier sense of self.\n\nWait a minute, feelings of inferiority sound a lot like a failure identity. Adlerian therapy does focus on helping clients overcome inferiority feelings and develop a more positive self-image. This seems quite aligned with replacing a failure identity with a success identity.\n\nLet me double-check. Adlerian therapy uses techniques like re-framing negative beliefs, encouraging social interest, and addressing early recollections to help clients understand and change their self-perception. So, yes, it does seem to directly address changing one's identity from one of failure to one of success by overcoming inferiority feelings.\n\nComparing it back to the other therapies, Gestalt therapy focuses more on awareness and personal responsibility, reality therapy on decision-making and relationships, and solution-focused therapy on building on strengths and finding solutions. While these therapies can indirectly lead to a more positive self-image, Adlerian therapy seems to have a more direct focus on inferiority feelings and developing a healthier self-concept.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Adlerian therapy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
