No, because the woman's order was too indefinite to constitute an offer, since it didn't contain a price term.\nB.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a woman ordering widgets from a manufacturer, and I need to figure out if there's an enforceable contract between them. Let me try to understand what's going on here step by step.\n\nFirst, on March 7, the woman sends a purchase order to the manufacturer asking them to \"promptly ship 1,000 widgets, catalogue #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price to our warehouse.\" This order is received by the manufacturer on March 9. So, at this point, the woman has made an offer to buy 1,000 widgets at the current wholesale price.\n\nNow, the next day, which is March 10, the manufacturer replies by fax. They say, \"Your order has been received. Shipment date will be March 12. Price $50 for each widget delivered. Be advised that these are the last widgets, under catalogue #B4-IEU, that we can deliver, since this variety is no longer being manufactured.\"\n\nSo, the manufacturer is acknowledging the order and providing specific details about the shipment and the price. They also mention that these are the last widgets of this type because they're no longer being manufactured.\n\nUpon receiving this fax, the woman immediately sends another fax saying, \"Cancel our previous order for 1,000 widgets under catalogue #B4-IEU. Price too high.\"\n\nAlright, so the woman is trying to cancel her order because she thinks the price is too high. But the question is, is there already an enforceable contract in place by this point?\n\nLet me think about the elements of a contract. There needs to be an offer, an acceptance, consideration, and intent to create a legal relationship. Assuming those are present, let's focus on the offer and acceptance in this scenario.\n\nThe woman's purchase order is an offer to buy 1,000 widgets at the current wholesale price. The manufacturer receives this offer on March 9. The next day, March 10, they respond via fax with specific details about the shipment and confirm the price as $50 per widget.\n\nNow, the question is whether this response from the manufacturer is an acceptance of the woman's offer or a counteroffer. If it's an acceptance, then a contract is formed. If it's a counteroffer, then the original offer is rejected, and a new offer is made by the manufacturer.\n\nIn their response, the manufacturer says, \"Price $50 for each widget delivered.\" Since the woman specified \"at the current wholesale price,\" and assuming $50 is indeed the current wholesale price, this might just be confirming the terms of the original offer rather than changing them.\n\nWait, the problem says to assume that $50 per widget was the current wholesale market price. So, if that's the case, then the manufacturer is agreeing to sell the widgets at the current wholesale price, which is $50 each. So, this seems like an acceptance of the woman's offer.\n\nBut then the woman immediately sends a fax to cancel the order, saying the price is too high. So, the question is, was there already a contract in place when she sent the cancellation fax?\n\nLet me consider the timing. The woman's offer was made on March 7, received on March 9. The manufacturer's response was sent on March 10, and the woman's cancellation was sent immediately after receiving the manufacturer's fax on March 10.\n\nSo, if the manufacturer's fax of March 10 is an acceptance of the woman's offer, then a contract would be formed upon the woman's receipt of that acceptance, which would be when she received the fax on March 10.\n\nBut then she immediately sends a fax to cancel the order. So, the question is, can she cancel the order after the contract has already been formed?\n\nWell, generally, once a contract is formed, you can't just unilaterally cancel it. You'd need to seek agreement from the other party or possibly pay damages if you breach the contract.\n\nSo, if the manufacturer's fax was an acceptance, then there's a contract, and the woman can't unilaterally cancel it.\n\nBut let's make sure that the manufacturer's fax was indeed an acceptance. Is there any indication that it was a counteroffer instead?\n\nThe manufacturer says, \"Price $50 for each widget delivered.\" Since $50 is the current wholesale price, as per the woman's offer, this seems like agreement on the price. They also specify the shipment date, which adds more detail but doesn't necessarily change the terms of the original offer.\n\nHowever, sometimes adding details can be seen as modifying the terms, which could turn the response into a counteroffer.\n\nBut in this case, specifying a shipment date might just be providing information about when the widgets will be delivered, not changing the terms of the sale.\n\nAlso, they mention that these are the last widgets of this type because they're no longer being manufactured. This seems like additional information, not a change to the terms of the offer.\n\nSo, overall, it seems like the manufacturer is accepting the woman's offer and providing additional details about the shipment and confirming the price.\n\nTherefore, when the woman received the manufacturer's fax on March 10, a contract was formed at that point.\n\nHer attempt to cancel the order immediately after receiving the fax would not be effective because the contract was already in place.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Yes, because the manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says no, because the woman's order was too indefinite to constitute an offer, since it didn't contain a price term.\n\nBut that doesn't seem correct. The woman specified \"at the current wholesale price,\" which is a clear price term. And we're assuming that $50 is indeed the current wholesale price, so the price is definite.\n\nOption B says no, because even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance.\n\nBut in this scenario, the manufacturer accepted the offer on March 10, and the woman tried to cancel after that. So, the revocation would have to happen before acceptance, which didn't happen here.\n\nOption C says yes, because the woman's order created a valid option contract.\n\nHmm, an option contract is when one party pays consideration for the other party to keep an offer open for a certain period. But in this scenario, there's no mention of payment to keep the offer open, so I don't think that applies here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Yes, because the manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer, forming a binding contract before she attempted to cancel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
