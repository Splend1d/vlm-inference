One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nVoltaire is best known for supporting which of the following demands of the Enlightenment philosophes?\n\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\nB. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\nC. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\nD.

                    "text": "So I've got this question about Voltaire and his views, especially in relation to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The question is asking what Voltaire is best known for supporting among the demands of the Enlightenment philosophes. The options are:\n\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\n\nB. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\n\nC. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\n\nD. Religious tolerance should be given to all people of all religions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Enlightenment was and what Voltaire's role in it was. The Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, was a philosophical movement that emphasized reason, science, and individualism over tradition and religious dogma. Philosophes like Voltaire advocated for ideas such as liberty, equality, and fraternity, which later influenced the French Revolution.\n\nVoltaire was a prominent figure in the Enlightenment, known for his wit and his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of speech and separation of church and state. He was a fierce critic of the Catholic Church and absolutism, advocating instead for a constitutional monarchy.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\n\nDeism is the belief in a supreme being who created the universe but does not intervene in it. Voltaire was known for his criticism of organized religion, particularly the Catholic Church, but he did believe in God. He often expressed deistic views, suggesting that God was the creator of the universe but did not interfere with its natural laws. However, I don't recall him advocating that deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion. He respected individual freedom of thought and belief.\n\nB. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\n\nThis seems contradictory to Voltaire's known positions. He was a strong advocate for religious tolerance, famously saying, \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" He believed that tolerance was essential for social harmony and that persecution only led to more problems. So, this option doesn't align with his views.\n\nC. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\n\nVoltaire was known for his skeptical approach to many subjects, especially those related to religion and metaphysics. He encouraged critical thinking and questioned established doctrines and traditions. Therefore, it's unlikely that he would dismiss skepticism as unreliable for examining information. In fact, it was a key part of his philosophical method.\n\nD. Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.\n\nThis seems to align closely with Voltaire's known positions. He was a staunch advocate for freedom of religion and believed that people should be free to practice their own faith without persecution. His famous essay \"Treatise on Tolerance\" (1763) was a defense of religious liberty and a critique of religious intolerance.\n\nConsidering this background, option D seems to be the most accurate reflection of Voltaire's views. However, I should double-check, especially given the specific context of the Lisbon earthquake mentioned in the question.\n\nThe Lisbon earthquake of 1755 was a catastrophic event that occurred on November 1, All Saints' Day, when many people were in church. The earthquake, followed by fires and a tsunami, resulted in the destruction of most of the city and an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 deaths. This event had a profound impact on European thought, challenging the optimism of the age that the world was improving and that God was benevolent and rational.\n\nIn the letter excerpt provided, Voltaire expresses his views on the tragedy. He criticizes the cruelty of nature and questions the so-called \"best of possible worlds\" philosophy popularized by Leibniz. He also makes a sarcastic remark about the Inquisition, suggesting that if its building survived, it should teach people not to persecute each other since disasters befall everyone.\n\nThis letter reflects Voltaire's critique of\u76f2\u76ee\u4e50\u89c2ism and his advocacy for a more realistic view of the world. It also shows his opposition to religious persecution, as indicated by his reference to the Inquisition.\n\nGiven this context, it reinforces the idea that Voltaire supported religious tolerance. Therefore, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly be correct.\n\nOption A: While Voltaire had deistic tendencies, he did not advocate for deism as the only logical religion for everyone. He believed in individual freedom of thought and religion.\n\nOption B: This contradicts Voltaire's known positions on religious tolerance. He believed that tolerance was essential for social unity and peace.\n\nOption C: Voltaire was a proponent of skepticism as a means to question and examine information critically. Dismissing skepticism would go against his philosophical approach.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that option D, \"Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions,\" is the correct answer, reflecting Voltaire's most famous and consistent demand of the Enlightenment philosophes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
