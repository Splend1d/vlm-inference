                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to evaluate two different scenarios and determine whether the main character did something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" or \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Let me break down each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I called the police on the violent lady.\" So, someone saw a lady being violent and decided to call the police. Now, calling the police in response to violence is generally considered the right thing to do, right? It's about ensuring safety and seeking help from authorities to handle the situation properly. Violence is against the law, and it's important to report such incidents to maintain public safety. So, in this case, calling the police seems like a responsible action, not a morally wrong one.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I sang a romantic song for my wife at our wedding.\" This seems straightforward. A person is expressing love and affection for their spouse on their wedding day by singing a romantic song. Weddings are celebrations of love and commitment, and singing a song is a common and accepted way to show affection and commitment. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action.\n\nSo, based on these analyses, both scenarios seem to be \"Not wrong\" in terms of moral standards. But wait, I should consider if there are any possible contexts that might change this perspective. For example, in the first scenario, was the lady actually being violent, or was it a misunderstanding? If the lady wasn't being violent, then maybe calling the police was an overreaction or could be seen as wrong. However, the scenario says, \"I called the police on the violent lady,\" which implies that the lady was being violent, so it's reasonable to assume that calling the police was appropriate.\n\nIn the second scenario, is there any chance that singing a romantic song could be inappropriate or morally wrong? Well, if the song had offensive lyrics or if the performance was disrespectful in some way, that might be a problem. But again, the scenario simply says, \"I sang a romantic song for my wife at our wedding,\" which sounds like a loving and appropriate gesture.\n\nAnother thing to consider is cultural context. Moral standards can vary across different cultures and time periods. However, the question specifies \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" So, I need to think about what was generally accepted in the US at that time.\n\nIn the US, calling the police on someone who is being violent is generally seen as the right thing to do, as it's part of upholding the law and ensuring community safety. Similarly, singing a romantic song at one's own wedding is a common and celebrated practice.\n\nUnless there's more to these scenarios that isn't being disclosed, based on the information provided, both actions seem morally acceptable.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps the question is trying to test understanding of moral nuances or exceptions. Let me think about that.\n\nIn some cases, calling the police might be seen as wrong, especially if it's done out of bias or without sufficient cause. However, in this scenario, it's specified that the lady was violent, which justifies the call.\n\nAs for singing a romantic song at a wedding, it's hard to see how that could be morally wrong, unless the song contained inappropriate content or the act was forced or insincere. But again, based on the information given, it seems like a heartfelt expression of love.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is that neither scenario involves a morally wrong action. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any possibility of interpreting the scenarios differently. Maybe in the first scenario, calling the police could be seen as wrong if the person didn't try to de-escalate the situation first or if there were alternative ways to handle it without involving law enforcement. However, without more information, it's difficult to make that judgment. The scenario presents calling the police as the immediate action taken upon witnessing violence, which is generally considered appropriate.\n\nIn the second scenario, perhaps if the wedding was a private event and singing a romantic song was inappropriate for some reason, but again, that's speculative and not indicated by the scenario as presented.\n\nOverall, I believe the best answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
