                    "text": "So I have this question about the rabies vaccine, and I need to identify a special feature of it. There are four options, and I have to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"The vaccine has not changed since the time of L. Pasteur.\" I remember that Louis Pasteur developed the first rabies vaccine in the 19th century. But I think that the vaccine has been improved since then. Maybe not drastically, but some modifications must have been made over time. So, I'm a bit skeptical about this option.\n\nOption B states, \"The original air-dried spinal cord of infected rabbits was a killed vaccine.\" I recall that Pasteur's vaccine involved drying the spinal cords of rabbits infected with rabies. This process was supposed to attenuate the virus, making it less harmful while still able to stimulate the immune system. So, it was indeed a killed vaccine. This seems like a plausible special feature.\n\nOption C mentions, \"The vaccine still needs 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity.\" I know that the original Pasteur vaccine required multiple injections, like 16 doses over a period of time. But I think that modern vaccination schedules have been optimized and don't require as many doses or injections into the peritoneal cavity. Maybe it's different now.\n\nOption D says, \"The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo.\" This sounds familiar. I've heard that some vaccines are cultivated in cell lines derived from human tissues, and sometimes these cell lines have origins from aborted fetuses. Rabies vaccines do use human diploid cells for production, which are often derived from embryonic tissues.\n\nNow, I need to choose the correct special feature. Let me think again.\n\nOption A: Vaccine hasn't changed since Pasteur. I think this is incorrect because advancements have been made in vaccine production and administration since then.\n\nOption B: Original vaccine was a killed vaccine using air-dried spinal cords of infected rabbits. This seems accurate and is a significant feature of the early vaccine development.\n\nOption C: Still needs 16 doses into the peritoneal cavity. I believe that modern vaccination regimens are more efficient and don't require as many doses or injections into the peritoneal cavity. So, this might not be current practice.\n\nOption D: Modern vaccine grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo. This is a known fact about some rabies vaccines, making it a special feature.\n\nBetween options B and D, both seem to be correct in their own ways. But the question asks for a \"special feature.\" Maybe \"special\" refers to something unique or particularly noteworthy about the rabies vaccine.\n\nOption B highlights the historical significance and the method used in the early vaccine, which was a major advancement in medicine. Option D refers to the modern production method, which is also significant and relevant today.\n\nHowever, considering that the question might be looking for a feature that is unique or particularly distinctive about the rabies vaccine, I think Option D stands out. The use of human diploid cells derived from an aborted embryo is a specific and modern approach in vaccine production that sets it apart from other vaccines.\n\nTherefore, I would go with Option D as the special feature of the rabies vaccine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
