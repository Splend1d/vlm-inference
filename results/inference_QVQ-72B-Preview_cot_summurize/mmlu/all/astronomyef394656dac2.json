                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a sandbag on Earth and on another planet with half the gravity. It says the sandbag has a mass of 5 kg and weighs 50 N on Earth. I need to find out what its mass and weight would be on a planet where gravity is half of Earth's.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what mass and weight are. Mass is like how much stuff is in an object, right? So, if I have a sandbag, the amount of sand doesn't change just because I move it to another planet. So, the mass should stay the same, which is 5 kg. That means options D, which says mass is 10 kg, is probably wrong.\n\nNow, weight is different. Weight depends on gravity. On Earth, the weight is given by the formula weight = mass \u00d7 gravity. So, on Earth, 5 kg times 9.8 m/s\u00b2 gives 49 N, but the problem says it's 50 N. Maybe they're rounding it or something, but generally, weight is mass times gravity.\n\nOn another planet where gravity is half of Earth's, gravity would be 4.9 m/s\u00b2 (since half of 9.8 is 4.9). So, if the mass remains 5 kg, the weight should be 5 kg times 4.9 m/s\u00b2, which is 24.5 N. Looking at the options:\n\nA. Mass 5 kg, weight 100 N\n\nB. Mass 5 kg, weight 50 N\n\nC. Mass 5 kg, weight 25 N\n\nD. Mass 10 kg, weight 100 N\n\nSo, option C seems close, but it says 25 N. Maybe they rounded it or something. But no, 5 times 4.9 is 24.5, which is not exactly 25. Maybe the problem expects us to use 5 instead of 4.9 for simplicity.\n\nWait, in the problem, it says the sandbag weighs 50 N on Earth, but 5 kg times 9.8 is 49 N, not 50 N. So maybe they're using 5 m/s\u00b2 instead of 9.8 m/s\u00b2. If that's the case, then half the gravity would be 2.5 m/s\u00b2, and the weight would be 5 kg times 2.5 m/s\u00b2, which is 12.5 N. But none of the options show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that on Earth, gravity is 10 m/s\u00b2, which would make weight = 5 kg \u00d7 10 m/s\u00b2 = 50 N, matching the given weight. So, if Earth's gravity is 10 m/s\u00b2, then half would be 5 m/s\u00b2, and the weight on the other planet would be 5 kg \u00d7 5 m/s\u00b2 = 25 N.\n\nSo, mass remains 5 kg, and weight becomes 25 N. That would correspond to option C.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because standard gravity on Earth is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, not 10 m/s\u00b2. Maybe in this problem, they're using a simplified value. It's important to go with the numbers given in the problem.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- On Earth: mass = 5 kg, weight = 50 N\n\n- Assuming gravity on Earth is 10 m/s\u00b2 (even though it's actually 9.8 m/s\u00b2), then weight = mass \u00d7 gravity \u21d2 5 kg \u00d7 10 m/s\u00b2 = 50 N, which matches the given weight.\n\n- On the other planet, gravity is half of Earth's, so gravity = 5 m/s\u00b2.\n\n- Therefore, weight on the other planet = 5 kg \u00d7 5 m/s\u00b2 = 25 N.\n\n- Mass remains 5 kg because it's the amount of matter in the sandbag, which doesn't change.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C: mass 5 kg, weight 25 N.\n\nJust to double-check, if mass is invariant and only weight changes with gravity, and gravity is halved, then weight should be halved as well, from 50 N to 25 N.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
