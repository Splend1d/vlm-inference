                    "text": "So I have this problem: I need to find the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that's closest to the origin. The options are given, but I want to understand how to find it myself.\n\nFirst, I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a plane is along the line that's perpendicular to the plane. So, if I can find the equation of the normal vector to the plane, that should point in the direction of the shortest line from the plane to the origin.\n\nThe equation of the plane is 2x + y + 3z = 3. The coefficients of x, y, and z in the plane equation give the components of the normal vector. So, the normal vector is <2, 1, 3>.\n\nNow, the point on the plane closest to the origin should be where the line from the origin in the direction of the normal vector intersects the plane.\n\nSo, let's parameterize this line. Starting from the origin, moving in the direction of the normal vector <2, 1, 3>, the parametric equations of the line would be:\n\nx = 2t\n\ny = t\n\nz = 3t\n\nNow, I need to find the value of t where this line intersects the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3.\n\nSubstitute x, y, z from the parametric equations into the plane equation:\n\n2(2t) + t + 3(3t) = 3\n\nSimplify:\n\n4t + t + 9t = 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n14t = 3\n\nSo, t = 3/14\n\nNow, plug this back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates:\n\nx = 2*(3/14) = 6/14 = 3/7\n\ny = 3/14\n\nz = 3*(3/14) = 9/14\n\nSo, the point should be (3/7, 3/14, 9/14), which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the normal vector is indeed <2, 1, 3>, which comes from the coefficients of x, y, z in the plane equation.\n\nThe parametric equations are x = 2t, y = t, z = 3t, which are in the direction of the normal vector.\n\nPlugging into the plane equation gives 2*(2t) + t + 3*(3t) = 4t + t + 9t = 14t = 3, so t = 3/14.\n\nPlugging back in gives x = 6/14 = 3/7, y = 3/14, z = 9/14.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane, but since the question asks for the coordinates of the closest point, this approach should suffice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if this point lies on the plane.\n\nPlug (3/7, 3/14, 9/14) into the plane equation:\n\n2*(3/7) + (3/14) + 3*(9/14) = (6/7) + (3/14) + (27/14) = (12/14) + (3/14) + (27/14) = (12 + 3 + 27)/14 = 42/14 = 3, which matches the plane equation. So, it lies on the plane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. (3/7, 3/14, 9/14)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
