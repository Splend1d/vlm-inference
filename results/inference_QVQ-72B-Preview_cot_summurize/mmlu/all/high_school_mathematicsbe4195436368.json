                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an object moving along a line with a velocity function v(t) = t cos(t) - ln(t + 2), and I need to figure out how many times it reverses direction between t = 0 and t = 10. The options are none, one, two, or three. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what it means for the object to reverse direction.\n\nI know that the velocity function tells me the speed and direction of the object at any time t. When the velocity is positive, the object is moving forward, and when it's negative, it's moving backward. So, a direction reversal would happen when the velocity changes sign, either from positive to negative or from negative to positive.\n\nTherefore, to find out how many times the object reverses direction, I need to determine how many times v(t) crosses the horizontal axis (i.e., changes sign) within the interval [0, 10].\n\nFirst, I should check the sign of v(t) at the endpoints t = 0 and t = 10.\n\nLet's calculate v(0):\n\nv(0) = (0) cos(0) - ln(0 + 2) = 0 - ln(2) \u2248 0 - 0.693 = -0.693\n\nSo, at t = 0, v(t) is negative.\n\nNow, v(10):\n\nv(10) = 10 cos(10) - ln(10 + 2) = 10 cos(10) - ln(12)\n\nI need to calculate the numerical value to determine the sign.\n\nCos(10 radians) is approximately -0.839, and ln(12) is approximately 2.485.\n\nSo, v(10) \u2248 10*(-0.839) - 2.485 = -8.39 - 2.485 = -10.875\n\nThat's also negative. So, both endpoints have negative velocity.\n\nBut that doesn't tell me much yet. I need to see if there are any points within [0,10] where v(t) changes sign.\n\nA direction reversal would occur where v(t) = 0, and the sign changes.\n\nSo, I need to find how many times v(t) crosses zero in the interval.\n\nTo do that, it would help to analyze the function v(t) = t cos(t) - ln(t + 2).\n\nThis looks a bit complicated because of the t cos(t) term and the natural log.\n\nMaybe I can plot the function to get an idea, or try to find where v(t) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the behavior of v(t) by looking at its components.\n\nFirst, t cos(t): this oscillates between positive and negative values depending on t and the cosine function.\n\nSecond, -ln(t + 2): this is always negative for t >= 0, and it decreases as t increases because the natural log is an increasing function.\n\nSo, the first term can be positive or negative, while the second term is always negative.\n\nMaybe I can consider the derivative of v(t) to see how it's changing.\n\nThe derivative v'(t) would be the acceleration, which could tell me about the behavior of v(t).\n\nLet's compute v'(t):\n\nv(t) = t cos(t) - ln(t + 2)\n\nUsing the product rule on the first term and the derivative of ln(t + 2):\n\nv'(t) = cos(t) - t sin(t) - 1/(t + 2)\n\nHmm, that's v'(t) = cos(t) - t sin(t) - 1/(t + 2)\n\nNot sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can analyze the sign changes of v(t) by evaluating it at specific points.\n\nLet's pick some t values between 0 and 10 and evaluate v(t):\n\nFirst, t = 0: v(0) = -ln(2) \u2248 -0.693\n\nt = 1: v(1) = 1*cos(1) - ln(3) \u2248 1*(0.540) - 1.099 \u2248 0.540 - 1.099 = -0.559\n\nStill negative.\n\nt = 2: v(2) = 2*cos(2) - ln(4) \u2248 2*(-0.416) - 1.386 \u2248 -0.832 - 1.386 = -2.218\n\nNegative again.\n\nt = 3: v(3) = 3*cos(3) - ln(5) \u2248 3*(-0.989) - 1.609 \u2248 -2.967 - 1.609 = -4.576\n\nStill negative.\n\nt = 4: v(4) = 4*cos(4) - ln(6) \u2248 4*(-0.653) - 1.792 \u2248 -2.612 - 1.792 = -4.404\n\nNegative.\n\nt = 5: v(5) = 5*cos(5) - ln(7) \u2248 5*(-0.284) - 1.946 \u2248 -1.420 - 1.946 = -3.366\n\nNegative.\n\nt = 6: v(6) = 6*cos(6) - ln(8) \u2248 6*(0.960) - 2.079 \u2248 5.760 - 2.079 = 3.681\n\nNow it's positive.\n\nSo, between t = 5 and t = 6, v(t) changes from negative to positive.\n\nThat suggests a direction reversal there.\n\nLet's check t = 7:\n\nv(7) = 7*cos(7) - ln(9) \u2248 7*(-0.754) - 2.197 \u2248 -5.278 - 2.197 = -7.475\n\nNegative again.\n\nSo, between t = 6 and t = 7, it changes from positive to negative.\n\nAnother direction reversal.\n\nNow, t = 8: v(8) = 8*cos(8) - ln(10) \u2248 8*(-0.989) - 2.303 \u2248 -7.912 - 2.303 = -10.215\n\nStill negative.\n\nt = 9: v(9) = 9*cos(9) - ln(11) \u2248 9*(-0.911) - 2.398 \u2248 -8.200 - 2.398 = -10.598\n\nNegative.\n\nt = 10: v(10) = 10*cos(10) - ln(12) \u2248 10*(-0.839) - 2.485 \u2248 -8.39 - 2.485 = -10.875\n\nNegative.\n\nSo, from t = 0 to t = 6, v(t) is negative, then positive at t = 6, then negative again around t = 7, and stays negative until t = 10.\n\nTherefore, there are two direction reversals: one from negative to positive around t = 6, and one from positive back to negative around t = 7.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nFrom t = 0 to t \u2248 5.5, v(t) is negative.\n\nAt t \u2248 6, v(t) becomes positive.\n\nThen at t \u2248 7, it becomes negative again.\n\nAnd remains negative up to t = 10.\n\nSo, yes, two changes in sign, hence two direction reversals.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. two.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there are any other sign changes.\n\nLet's try t = 4.5:\n\nv(4.5) = 4.5*cos(4.5) - ln(6.5) \u2248 4.5*(-0.711) - 1.872 \u2248 -3.20 - 1.872 = -5.072\n\nNegative.\n\nt = 5.5: v(5.5) = 5.5*cos(5.5) - ln(7.5) \u2248 5.5*(-0.547) - 2.015 \u2248 -3.01 - 2.015 = -5.025\n\nStill negative.\n\nt = 6.5: v(6.5) = 6.5*cos(6.5) - ln(8.5) \u2248 6.5*(0.560) - 2.140 \u2248 3.64 - 2.140 = 1.500\n\nPositive.\n\nt = 7.5: v(7.5) = 7.5*cos(7.5) - ln(9.5) \u2248 7.5*(-0.660) - 2.250 \u2248 -4.95 - 2.250 = -7.200\n\nNegative.\n\nSo, between t = 6.5 and t = 7.5, v(t) changes from positive to negative.\n\nThis confirms that there are two direction reversals in the interval [0,10].\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. two.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
