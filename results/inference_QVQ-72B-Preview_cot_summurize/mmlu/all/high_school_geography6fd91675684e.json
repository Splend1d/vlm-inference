Nationalism, B. Resource dispute, C. Irredentism, D. Positional dispute.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I need to understand what's happening in this scenario. So, there's a state whose people want to bring in another territory that has people who are ethnically similar to them, but this territory is currently part of another state. Essentially, they want to annex, or add, this territory to their own state.\n\nFirst, I should think about what nationalism means. Nationalism is generally the idea of being proud of one's nation and often wanting what's best for it. But does that specifically apply to annexing a territory based on ethnic similarities? Maybe, but it seems a bit broad.\n\nA resource dispute might involve countries fighting over natural resources like oil, water, or minerals. But in this case, the reason given is ethnic relations, not resources. So, maybe not.\n\nA positional dispute could be about where boundaries are drawn, perhaps over land or sea borders. But again, that seems more about geography and less about the people living in the territory.\n\nIrredentism sounds like a term I've heard before, but I'm not sure what it means exactly. Let me recall. Irredentism is when a country claims a territory outside its current borders that it believes rightfully belongs to it, often due to historical or ethnic ties.\n\nWait, that sounds similar to the scenario described in the question. So, in irredentism, a state may want to annex a territory that was once part of it historically or where people share the same ethnicity or culture as the majority in the state.\n\nLet me see if this fits. The question says \"people of one state want to annex a territory whose population is ethnically related to that state's population but now under the rule of another state.\" So, it's about ethnic ties and annexation.\n\nIrredentism seems to align with that description. It's about claiming territories that are considered part of the nation but are not under its control.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another example. Say, Italy after World War I might have wanted to annex areas in Eastern Europe where Italian-speaking communities lived, but those areas were under different states. That would be an example of irredentism.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of Germany before World War II, there was a push to unite all German-speaking people under one state, which led to the annexation of Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia.\n\nSo, in both cases, it's about ethnic relations and the desire to incorporate those territories into the state.\n\nNow, is nationalism the same as irredentism? Not exactly. Nationalism is a broader concept that can fuel irredentist claims, but irredentism is more specifically about reclaiming lost territories based on ethnic or historical grounds.\n\nA resource dispute would be more about economic interests, like oil fields or mineral deposits, rather than ethnic relations.\n\nA positional dispute might be about strategic locations, like border areas or access to seas, but again, not directly related to ethnicity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer to the question is C. Irredentism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Irredentism}} \\]"
