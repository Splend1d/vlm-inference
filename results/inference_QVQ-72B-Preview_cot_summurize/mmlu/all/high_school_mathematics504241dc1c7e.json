                    "text": "Let's see what we've got here. The problem is to find a counting number that's equivalent to this expression: \\(1990 \\times 1991 - 1989 \\times 1990\\). Hmm, that looks a bit messy at first glance, but maybe there's a clever way to simplify it.\n\nFirst off, I notice that \\(1990\\) appears in both terms. Maybe I can factor it out to make things easier. So, if I factor out \\(1990\\), I should have:\n\n\\[\n1990 \\times (1991 - 1989)\n\\]\n\nOkay, that seems simpler. Now, I just need to subtract \\(1989\\) from \\(1991\\). Let's do that:\n\n\\[\n1991 - 1989 = 2\n\\]\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n1990 \\times 2\n\\]\n\nThat's straightforward. Multiplying \\(1990\\) by \\(2\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n1990 \\times 2 = 3980\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 5\n\nB. 8\n\nC. 3980\n\nD. 1160\n\nSo, option C is 3980, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe I should double-check to make sure there isn't a smarter way to approach this or any possible tricks in the question.\n\nLet me think about it again. The expression is \\(1990 \\times 1991 - 1989 \\times 1990\\). Another way to look at this is to see if there's a difference of squares or any other algebraic identities that could apply here, but I don't think that's necessary since we've already factored out \\(1990\\).\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the properties of numbers around 1990. For example, \\(1991\\) is \\(1990 + 1\\), and \\(1989\\) is \\(1990 - 1\\). So, rewriting the expression:\n\n\\[\n1990 \\times (1990 + 1) - (1990 - 1) \\times 1990\n\\]\n\nExpanding both terms:\n\n\\[\n1990 \\times 1990 + 1990 \\times 1 - 1990 \\times 1990 + 1 \\times 1990\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n(1990 \\times 1990 - 1990 \\times 1990) + (1990 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 1990)\n\\]\n\nThe first two terms cancel each other out, leaving:\n\n\\[\n1990 + 1990 = 3980\n\\]\n\nOkay, this confirms my previous result. So, it seems pretty certain that the answer is 3980.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should plug in the numbers into a calculator to verify. Although, with such large numbers, it might not be the most efficient way, but since we've already simplified it, it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the expression in terms of smaller numbers to see if the same logic applies. For example, let's say we have \\(10 \\times 11 - 9 \\times 10\\). Following the same steps:\n\nFactor out 10:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times (11 - 9) = 10 \\times 2 = 20\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, expanding:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 11 = 110\n\\]\n\\[\n9 \\times 10 = 90\n\\]\n\\[\n110 - 90 = 20\n\\]\n\nWhich matches the factored result. So, this reinforces that the method is correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 3980, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3980} \\]"
