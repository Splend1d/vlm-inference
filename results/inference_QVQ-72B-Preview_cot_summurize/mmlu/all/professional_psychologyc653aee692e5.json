Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says it's \"cultural practices and beliefs that are non-Western in orientation and perspective.\" Hmm, that seems a bit limited. Ethnic identity isn't just about non-Western cultures, is it? I mean, ethnicity can be from any cultural background, right? Not just non-Western ones. Maybe this isn't the best definition.\n\nOption B is \"the collective cultural practices, traditions, and orientations of ethnic minority communities.\" This seems more inclusive. It talks about ethnic minority communities, which could include a variety of cultural practices and traditions. But wait, is ethnic identity only about minority communities? What about ethnic majorities? For example, in some countries, certain ethnic groups are the majority. Would their ethnic identity not be considered part of this definition? Maybe it's too narrow.\n\nOption C says it's \"a rejection of Caucasian social, cultural, and institutional standards.\" This seems off. Ethnic identity isn't about rejecting anything; it's about embracing and identifying with one's own cultural background. Plus, this option specifically mentions Caucasian standards, which again limits the concept to interactions with Caucasian cultures. Ethnic identity is broader than that.\n\nOption D defines ethnic identity as \"the extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a given group.\" This seems the most accurate. It focuses on the individual's connection and commitment to their cultural traditions. It doesn't specify whether the culture is Western or non-Western, majority or minority, which makes it more inclusive. Also, it's about endorsement and practice, which aligns with how identity works\u2014it's about what someone identifies with and participates in.\n\nLet me think about this again. Ethnic identity is indeed about an individual's sense of belonging to a particular ethnic group, which includes their cultural practices, traditions, and values. It's about how much someone identifies with and engages in those cultural aspects.\n\nOption A is too restrictive by limiting it to non-Western cultures.\n\nOption B focuses on ethnic minority communities, which might exclude majority ethnic groups in certain contexts.\n\nOption C suggests that ethnic identity involves rejecting Caucasian standards, which is not accurate; ethnic identity is about positive identification and pride in one's own culture, not about rejecting others.\n\nOption D seems the most comprehensive and accurate, as it refers to the degree to which an individual embraces and practices the cultural traditions of a particular group, regardless of the group's origin or status.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is Option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
