                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out this problem about productivity between two countries, X and Z. So, first things first, I need to understand what productivity of labor means. I think it's like how much output each worker produces on average. So, if a country has higher productivity, each worker is generating more output.\n\nAlright, so for country X, the output is 30,000 units with 3,000 workers. For country Z, it's 40,000 units with 8,000 workers.\n\nI should calculate the productivity for each country. I think productivity is output per worker. So, for country X, it would be 30,000 divided by 3,000. Let me do that: 30,000 \u00f7 3,000 = 10 units per worker.\n\nFor country Z, it's 40,000 \u00f7 8,000 = 5 units per worker.\n\nSo, productivity in country X is 10 units per worker, and in country Z, it's 5 units per worker.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the relationship between these productivities. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The productivity of labor in country Z is 33 percent higher than in country X.\n\nB. The productivity of labor in country Z is 25 percent higher than in country X.\n\nC. The productivity of labor in country X is 33 percent higher than in country Z.\n\nD. The productivity of labor in country X is twice as much as country Z.\n\nOkay, so based on my calculations, productivity in country X is 10 and in country Z is 5. So, country X has higher productivity than country Z, because 10 is greater than 5.\n\nSo, options A and B suggest that Z has higher productivity than X, but that's not the case based on my calculations. So, those might be incorrect.\n\nOption C says that productivity in country X is 33 percent higher than in country Z. Hmm, let's check that.\n\nTo find the percentage increase from Z to X, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = [(X - Z) / Z] * 100%\n\nWhere X is productivity in country X and Z is productivity in country Z.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: [(10 - 5) / 5] * 100% = (5 / 5) * 100% = 100%.\n\nWait, that can't be right. That would mean productivity in X is 100% higher than in Z, not 33%. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says that productivity in country X is twice as much as in country Z. Well, since X has 10 and Z has 5, yes, 10 is twice 5, so that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, productivity for X: 30,000 units / 3,000 workers = 10 units per worker. That seems right.\n\nProductivity for Z: 40,000 units / 8,000 workers = 5 units per worker. That's correct too.\n\nSo, productivity in X is indeed twice that of Z. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question or if there's a trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility of different productivity measures, like maybe considering hours worked or something else? The problem seems straightforward, though, using output per worker.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want me to consider the total factor productivity or something, but that seems unlikely given the information provided.\n\nNo, I think it's safe to conclude that productivity in country X is twice that of country Z, making option D the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
