It's asking for the term that represents unavoidable past costs that cannot be changed no matter what action is taken. The options are prime costs, sunk costs, opportunity costs, and incremental costs. Hmm, let's see which one fits the description.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these terms means. Starting with prime costs, I think that's the direct expenses related to producing a good or service, like raw materials and direct labor. So, those are costs that are directly attributable to the production process. But the question is about past costs that can't be changed, so maybe prime costs aren't the right fit here.\n\nNext, sunk costs. I've heard this term before. Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, no matter what you do next. So, they're like past expenditures that you can't get back. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing\u2014unavoidable past costs that can't be changed. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nOpportunity costs are a bit different. They're the potential benefits that are given up when one option is chosen over another. For example, if you choose to invest in one project, the opportunity cost is the return you could have gotten from the next best alternative. So, it's not about past costs but about foregone benefits in the future. That doesn't seem to match the description in the question.\n\nIncremental costs, also known as marginal costs, are the costs that change with each additional unit of production. So, if you produce one more unit, what extra cost does that incur? This is about future costs that vary with production levels, not about past costs that can't be changed.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like sunk costs are the ones that fit the description of unavoidable past costs that cannot be changed no matter what action is taken. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nSunk costs are indeed past costs that have already been paid and cannot be recovered. They don't affect future decisions because they're already spent and can't be changed. So, in that sense, they are unavoidable past costs that can't be changed by any future action.\n\nPrime costs, on the other hand, are current costs related to production and can be influenced by changes in production levels or efficiency improvements. Opportunity costs are about comparing different options and don't relate to past expenditures. Incremental costs are about the cost of producing additional units in the future.\n\nTherefore, the correct term for unavoidable past costs that cannot be changed no matter what action is taken is sunk costs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Sunk costs}} \\]"
