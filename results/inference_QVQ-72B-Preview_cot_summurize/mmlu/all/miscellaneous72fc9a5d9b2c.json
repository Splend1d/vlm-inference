                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of these famous baseball figures was once acquitted at court-martial for insubordination?\" And the options are A. Abner Doubleday, B. Ty Cobb, C. Jackie Robinson, and D. Billy Martin. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which one of these baseball legends faced a court-martial for insubordination and was acquitted.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand what a court-martial is. A court-martial is a military court that tries members of the armed forces for violations of military law. So, this person must have been in the military at some point to be court-martialed.\n\nNow, insubordination generally means refusing to obey orders or showing disrespect to a superior officer. So, the person in question must have been accused of doing something like that.\n\nAlright, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nA. Abner Doubleday: I remember him as the person often credited with inventing baseball, though that's been debated. He was a Union officer in the American Civil War. Did he face a court-martial for insubordination? I don't recall any stories about that. In fact, he had a distinguished military career, so I think it's unlikely.\n\nB. Ty Cobb: He's famous for being one of the greatest baseball players of all time, known for his high batting averages and aggressive playing style. He served in the U.S. Army during World War I, I believe. Maybe something happened during his service that led to a court-martial. But I can't recall any specific incidents involving insubordination.\n\nC. Jackie Robinson: He's celebrated for breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball. He also served in the U.S. Army during World War II and faced some racial discrimination there. I think he might have had some run-ins with the military authorities, possibly involving insubordination, but I'm not sure about the specifics.\n\nD. Billy Martin: He was a famous player and manager in baseball, known for his fiery personality and multiple stints managing the New York Yankees. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II as well. Again, I don't specifically remember any court-martial for insubordination in his case.\n\nLet me think more carefully. Maybe I should consider their military service histories.\n\nStarting with Abner Doubleday: He was a Union general in the Civil War, and I don't think he was ever court-martialed for insubordination. In fact, he had a reputable military career.\n\nTy Cobb: He enlisted in the Army during WWI and served in France. While he was known for his temper on the baseball field, I can't find any records suggesting he was court-martialed for insubordination.\n\nJackie Robinson: He enlisted in the Army in 1942 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was court-martialed in 1944 for refusing to move to the back of a bus on a military base, which was an act of resistance against segregation. He was acquitted of the charges. This sounds like it could be considered insubordination, and he was acquitted.\n\nBilly Martin: He served in the Army during WWII and was a paratrooper. I don't recall any incidents of him being court-martialed for insubordination.\n\nSo, based on this, Jackie Robinson seems to be the one who was acquitted at a court-martial for insubordination.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if there's any other information about the other figures.\n\nAbner Doubleday: No, he had a distinguished military career without any known court-martial for insubordination.\n\nTy Cobb: While he was known for his fiery personality, there's no evidence he was court-martialed for insubordination.\n\nBilly Martin: Similarly, no records indicate he faced a court-martial for insubordination.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Jackie Robinson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
