The options are:\n\nA. facilitate the performance of novel and difficult tasks\n\nB. facilitate the performance of easy tasks\n\nC. hinder the performance of all tasks\n\nD. hinder the performance of easy tasks\n\nHmm, I need to recall what I learned about this. I think there's a psychological concept called \"social facilitation\" that deals with this. It's about how the performance of an individual is influenced by the presence of others.\n\nLet me think about social facilitation. I remember that it suggests that the presence of others can either improve or impair performance, depending on the nature of the task and the individual's familiarity with it.\n\nOption A says that the presence of others facilitates the performance of novel and difficult tasks. But wait, I think I recall that for novel or difficult tasks, the presence of others might actually hinder performance because the individual might feel anxious or self-conscious. So, maybe option A is not correct.\n\nOption B says that the presence of others facilitates the performance of easy tasks. This seems plausible. I think social facilitation theory proposes that when tasks are easy or well-learned, the presence of others can enhance performance because the natural arousal caused by being around others boosts efficiency.\n\nOption C says that the presence of others hinders the performance of all tasks. That seems too extreme. Not all tasks are equally affected, so this can't be right.\n\nOption D says that the presence of others hinders the performance of easy tasks. That contradicts what I know about social facilitation. If anything, easy tasks are typically performed better in the presence of others, not worse.\n\nLet me double-check this. I think there's a concept called \"evaluation apprehension\" which suggests that people perform better on simple tasks when observed because they're motivated to look good, but on complex tasks, the pressure might lead to worse performance.\n\nWait, maybe both options A and B are partially correct, but I have to pick one that best fits. Given that, I think option B is the most accurate because social facilitation primarily facilitates the performance of well-learned or easy tasks.\n\nI don't think option D is correct because, in reality, easy tasks are generally performed better in front of others due to increased motivation and arousal.\n\nSo, my answer would be option B: facilitate the performance of easy tasks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
