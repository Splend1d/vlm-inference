                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"For how many positive integers \\( k \\) does the ordinary decimal representation of the integer \\( k! \\) end in exactly 99 zeros?\" And the options are none, one, four, or five.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means for \\( k! \\) to end in exactly 99 zeros. In decimal representation, a zero at the end of a number means that the number is divisible by 10, and each zero represents an additional factor of 10. So, having exactly 99 zeros means that \\( k! \\) is divisible by 10 raised to the 99th power, but not by 10 to the 100th.\n\nNow, 10 is 2 times 5, so the number of trailing zeros in \\( k! \\) is determined by the lesser of the number of 2s and the number of 5s in its prime factorization. Since there are always more 2s than 5s in \\( k! \\), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s in the prime factorization of \\( k! \\).\n\nSo, to find the number of trailing zeros in \\( k! \\), I can calculate the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( k! \\). That is, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of trailing zeros} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor \\) denotes the floor function, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\).\n\nI need to find all positive integers \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots = 99\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the range of \\( k \\) where this sum equals 99.\n\nFirst, I should find an approximate value of \\( k \\) that would give me 99 zeros. I can start by ignoring the floor functions for a rough estimate.\n\nIf I ignore the floor functions, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k}{5} + \\frac{k}{25} + \\frac{k}{125} + \\frac{k}{625} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term \\( \\frac{k}{5} \\) and common ratio \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\). The sum of this infinite series is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k/5}{1 - 1/5} = \\frac{k/5}{4/5} = \\frac{k}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{k}{4} \\approx 99 \\), which gives \\( k \\approx 396 \\).\n\nBut since I ignored the floor functions, this is just a rough estimate. I need to consider the actual floor values.\n\nLet me consider the terms of the sum one by one.\n\nFirst term: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{5} \\right\\rfloor \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{25} \\right\\rfloor \\)\n\nThird term: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{125} \\right\\rfloor \\)\n\nFourth term: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{625} \\right\\rfloor \\)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to find \\( k \\) such that the sum of these terms equals 99.\n\nLet me consider \\( k \\) in the range where \\( k/5 \\) is just enough to make the sum close to 99.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., are there up to \\( k \\).\n\nLet me try to compute the sum for \\( k = 395, 396, 397, \\ldots, 400 \\), since my rough estimate was around 396.\n\nFirst, let's compute the sum for \\( k = 396 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{396}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 79 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{396}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 15 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{396}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{396}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 79 + 15 + 3 + 0 = 97 \\), which is less than 99.\n\nNow, \\( k = 397 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{397}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 79 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{397}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 15 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{397}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{397}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 79 + 15 + 3 + 0 = 97 \\), same as before.\n\nWait, even though \\( k \\) increased by 1, the floor terms didn't change. That suggests that \\( k \\) is not a multiple of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\nLet me check \\( k = 395 \\), which is a multiple of 5.\n\nFor \\( k = 395 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{395}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 79 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{395}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 15 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{395}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{395}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 79 + 15 + 3 + 0 = 97 \\), same as above.\n\nNow, let's try \\( k = 400 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\), which is exactly what we want.\n\nSo, \\( k = 400 \\) gives exactly 99 trailing zeros.\n\nNow, let's check \\( k = 401 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{401}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{401}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{401}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{401}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\), again exactly 99 zeros.\n\nWait a minute, so \\( k = 400 \\) and \\( k = 401 \\) both give 99 trailing zeros.\n\nNow, let's check \\( k = 402 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{402}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{402}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{402}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{402}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\), still 99 zeros.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, \\( k = 400, 401, 402 \\) all give 99 trailing zeros.\n\nNow, let's check \\( k = 403 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\), still 99 zeros.\n\nWait, this is unusual. Normally, the number of trailing zeros increases by 1 every time \\( k \\) passes a multiple of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\nBut here, from \\( k = 400 \\) to \\( k = 403 \\), the number of trailing zeros remains 99.\n\nLet me check \\( k = 404 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{404}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{404}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{404}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{404}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\), still 99 zeros.\n\nThis is interesting. So, from \\( k = 400 \\) to \\( k = 404 \\), the number of trailing zeros is consistently 99.\n\nNow, let's check \\( k = 405 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{405}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 81 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{405}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{405}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{405}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 81 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 100 \\), which is one more than 99.\n\nSo, at \\( k = 405 \\), the number of trailing zeros jumps to 100.\n\nTherefore, the values of \\( k \\) that give exactly 99 trailing zeros are \\( k = 400, 401, 402, 403, 404 \\).\n\nThat's five values of \\( k \\).\n\nWait a second, but according to the options, the answer could be none, one, four, or five. So, it seems like the answer is five.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, I estimated \\( k \\) around 396 based on \\( k/4 = 99 \\), which gave \\( k = 396 \\). Then, I checked \\( k = 396 \\) and found that it gives 97 trailing zeros, which is less than 99.\n\nThen, I checked \\( k = 400 \\), which gave exactly 99 zeros, and \\( k = 401, 402, 403, 404 \\) also gave 99 zeros, while \\( k = 405 \\) gave 100 zeros.\n\nSo, indeed, there are five consecutive values of \\( k \\) that give exactly 99 trailing zeros.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be five.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option D is five, but the answer choices include none, one, four, and five, and the question is to select from these options.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem statement, the options are:\n\nA. None\n\nB. One\n\nC. Four\n\nD. Five\n\nAnd according to my calculation, the answer is five, which is option D.\n\nBut perhaps there is a mistake in my calculation. Let me verify again.\n\nLet's recalculate for \\( k = 399 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{399}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 79 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{399}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 15 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{399}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{399}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 79 + 15 + 3 + 0 = 97 \\), same as before.\n\nThen, \\( k = 400 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\).\n\nThen, \\( k = 401 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{401}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{401}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{401}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{401}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( k = 402 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{402}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{402}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{402}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{402}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\).\n\nThen, \\( k = 403 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\).\n\nAnd \\( k = 404 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{404}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 80 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{404}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{404}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{404}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\).\n\nThen, \\( k = 405 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{405}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 81 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{405}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{405}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{405}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\nTotal: \\( 81 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 100 \\).\n\nSo, indeed, \\( k = 400, 401, 402, 403, 404 \\) all give exactly 99 trailing zeros, and \\( k = 405 \\) gives 100 zeros.\n\nTherefore, there are five consecutive positive integers \\( k \\) that satisfy the condition.\n\nHence, the answer should be five, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there are any other ranges of \\( k \\) that might also give exactly 99 trailing zeros.\n\nFor example, perhaps there are other ranges where the number of trailing zeros remains constant before increasing.\n\nLet me try checking \\( k = 390 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{390}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 78 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{390"
