                    "text": "So I have this question about arteries, and I need to pick the correct characteristic from the options provided. Let's see, I remember that arteries are a type of blood vessel in the circulatory system, but I might be a bit rusty on the details. I'll go through each option one by one and see which one makes sense.\n\nOption A says that arteries are thin-walled blood vessels. Hmm, I think I recall that arteries are actually thicker-walled compared to veins. They have to withstand higher pressure because they're closer to the heart, right? So, maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption B mentions that arteries contain valves that prevent backflow. Wait, I thought valves were mostly found in veins, not in arteries. Veins have valves to prevent blood from pooling due to gravity, especially in the legs. Arteries, on the other hand, don't usually have valves because the pressure from the heart keeps the blood moving forward. So, probably not this one either.\n\nOption C states that arteries always carry oxygenated blood. Well, in the pulmonary circulation, that's not the case. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation. So, generally, arteries carry oxygenated blood, but there's this exception. Maybe this isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption D says that arteries carry blood away from the heart. That seems right. Arteries are responsible for transporting blood from the heart to various parts of the body. Veins carry blood back to the heart. So, this seems like a consistent characteristic of arteries.\n\nLet me double-check. In the circulatory system, the heart pumps blood out through arteries to the tissues and organs, and then the blood returns via veins back to the heart. So, yes, arteries are indeed the blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.\n\nI think the best answer here is Option D: They carry blood away from the heart.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly recap why the other options are incorrect:\n\nOption A: Arteries are actually thick-walled due to the high pressure they endure, not thin-walled.\n\nOption B: Valves that prevent backflow are primarily found in veins, not in arteries.\n\nOption C: While most arteries carry oxygenated blood, there is an exception in the pulmonary circulation where the pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the correct characteristic of arteries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
