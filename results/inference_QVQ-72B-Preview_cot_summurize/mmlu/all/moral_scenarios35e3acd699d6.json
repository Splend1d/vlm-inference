                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether these two scenarios involve something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"To finish my thesis quicker I worked on it all night.\"\n\nSo, the person wanted to finish their thesis faster, and to do that, they stayed up all night working on it. Hmm, staying up all night to work on something seems pretty normal, especially if you have a deadline coming up. It doesn't sound like anything morally wrong there. Maybe it's not the healthiest choice in the long run, but morally wrong? I don't think so.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wanted my parents to let me quit piano lessons so I asked them.\"\n\nHere, the person wants to stop taking piano lessons and asks their parents for permission. Again, this seems like a personal preference or a decision based on interests. Asking to quit something doesn't seem morally wrong either. It's just expressing a desire to stop doing something that isn't fulfilling anymore.\n\nSo, based on these scenarios, neither of them seems to involve anything morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me think again to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, working all night to finish a thesis quicker\u2014 that could be seen as\u52e4\u594b or dedicated, but is there any way it could be considered morally wrong? Well, maybe if staying up all night affects other people negatively, like if they rely on you for something else that you couldn't do because you were working. But the scenario doesn't mention any negative impact on others, so I think it's safe to say it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, asking to quit piano lessons\u2014 unless there's some context that makes this request immoral, like if the lessons were court-ordered or something, but again, the scenario doesn't provide any additional context that would change that. It seems like a straightforward request based on personal preference.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the question is trying to test some subtle moral nuances that I'm not picking up on. Let me consider that.\n\nIn Scenario 1, working all night to finish the thesis quicker\u2014 is there any chance that this could be considered morally wrong? Well, perhaps if the person is compromising the quality of their work in the pursuit of speed, but again, the scenario doesn't suggest that. It just says they worked all night to finish quicker. Assuming they're still producing honest and original work, I don't see anything morally wrong there.\n\nIn Scenario 2, asking to quit piano lessons\u2014 maybe if the lessons were a condition of some agreement, like a scholarship or something, and quitting would violate that agreement. But again, the scenario doesn't provide any information to suggest that. It just says they asked their parents to let them quit.\n\nSo, based on the information given, neither scenario involves anything morally wrong.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A: \"Wrong, Wrong\" \u2014 that would imply both scenarios are morally wrong, which doesn't seem to align with the scenarios presented.\n\nOption B: \"Wrong, Not wrong\" \u2014 that would suggest that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, but Scenario 2 is not. As I see it, neither is morally wrong, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: \"Not wrong, Wrong\" \u2014 this would suggest that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, but Scenario 2 is. Again, I don't see anything morally wrong in either scenario.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is Option D: \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
