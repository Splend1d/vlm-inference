                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What number multiplied by 4 equals 36?\" And there are options A, B, C, and D, which are 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. I need to figure out which one of these, when multiplied by 4, gives me 36.\n\nFirst, I should recall that multiplication is the opposite of division. So, if I have a number multiplied by 4 to get 36, I can find that number by dividing 36 by 4. That should give me the answer directly.\n\nLet me do that: 36 divided by 4 equals 9. So, the number is 9.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can use another approach to confirm.\n\nI know that 4 times 9 is 36. So, 4 multiplied by 9 is indeed 36. That matches the question.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. 6: 4 times 6 is 24, which is less than 36.\n\nB. 7: 4 times 7 is 28, still less than 36.\n\nC. 8: 4 times 8 is 32, closer but still not 36.\n\nD. 9: 4 times 9 is 36, which is exactly what we're looking for.\n\nSo, all the other options result in products that are less than 36, except for 9, which gives the exact value.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to set up an equation. Let's say the unknown number is X. Then, the equation would be:\n\n4 * X = 36\n\nTo solve for X, I can divide both sides by 4:\n\nX = 36 / 4\n\nX = 9\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other method or if perhaps there's a trick here that I'm missing. But the question seems straightforward: it's asking for the number that, when multiplied by 4, equals 36.\n\nLet me think about multiplication tables for 4:\n\n4 times 1 is 4\n\n4 times 2 is 8\n\n4 times 3 is 12\n\n4 times 4 is 16\n\n4 times 5 is 20\n\n4 times 6 is 24\n\n4 times 7 is 28\n\n4 times 8 is 32\n\n4 times 9 is 36\n\n4 times 10 is 40\n\nFrom this list, it's clear that 4 times 9 is 36.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can use my fingers to count up to 36 in increments of 4.\n\nStarting with 0, then 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36. That's nine steps, which again confirms that 4 times 9 is 36.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to arrive at the answer, and all of them point to the number 9 being the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can approach this differently. Suppose I consider the problem in terms of division facts. If 4 times a number is 36, then 36 divided by 4 should give me that number.\n\nAs I did earlier, 36 divided by 4 is 9.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of repeated subtraction. Starting from 36, subtracting 4 repeatedly until I reach 0, and count how many times I subtracted 4.\n\n36 - 4 = 32\n\n32 - 4 = 28\n\n28 - 4 = 24\n\n24 - 4 = 20\n\n20 - 4 = 16\n\n16 - 4 = 12\n\n12 - 4 = 8\n\n8 - 4 = 4\n\n4 - 4 = 0\n\nI subtracted 4 a total of 9 times to reach 0, which again confirms that 4 times 9 is 36.\n\nI feel confident now that the answer is indeed 9. But just to make sure there isn't any confusion, I'll check the other options quickly.\n\nOption A is 6, but 4 times 6 is 24, which is less than 36.\n\nOption B is 7, which gives 4 times 7 is 28, still less than 36.\n\nOption C is 8, resulting in 4 times 8 being 32, which is closer but still not 36.\n\nOption D is 9, which we've established gives the exact product of 36.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 9.\n\nI think that's it. I've used multiple methods to confirm that 9 is the number that, when multiplied by 4, equals 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
