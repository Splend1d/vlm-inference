The question is about how a cross-sectional design works in developmental research. Let's see what each option means.\n\nOption A says \"some people are studied over a long period of time.\" That sounds more like a longitudinal study, where the same group of people is followed and assessed over multiple points in time. So, probably not the right choice for a cross-sectional design.\n\nOption B says \"different group divided by age are assessed at the same time.\" This seems plausible for a cross-sectional design. In cross-sectional studies, typically, you compare different groups at one specific point in time. So, if you're looking at different age groups all assessed at the same time, that fits the cross-sectional approach.\n\nOption C says \"combines longitudinal and cross-sequential design.\" Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. If it's combining longitudinal and cross-sequential, but cross-sequential isn't a standard term in research design. Maybe it's a typo and should be cross-sectional? Or perhaps it's referring to a sequential design that includes cross-sectional elements. Either way, this option seems a bit mixed and not clearly defining cross-sectional design.\n\nOption D says \"representative samples of different ages are assessed multiple times.\" This sounds more like a longitudinal design, where you're following the same groups over time, or perhaps a cohort design. But in a cross-sectional design, you usually assess different groups at one point in time, not multiple times.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to best describe how a cross-sectional design works in developmental research: different age groups are assessed at the same time. That makes sense because cross-sectional studies compare different cohorts at a single point in time, which allows researchers to see differences that might be due to age or other factors.\n\nI think the correct answer is B. different group divided by age are assessed at the same time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
