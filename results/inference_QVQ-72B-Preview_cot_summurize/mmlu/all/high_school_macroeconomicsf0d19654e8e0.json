                    "text": "Let's see here. So, the question is about what happens when a country is at full employment and the central bank does a contractionary monetary policy. I need to figure out how this affects interest rates, purchases of new homes, and the unemployment rate. The options are given, but I want to understand why one of them is correct.\n\nFirst, what does full employment mean? It means that everyone who wants a job has one, right? So, the economy is running at its maximum capacity. But even then, there's still some inflation, I think.\n\nNow, contractionary monetary policy is when the central bank decides to reduce the money supply in the economy. They usually do this by raising interest rates, selling government securities, or increasing reserve requirements for banks. The main goal is to slow down economic growth because maybe inflation is getting too high.\n\nSo, if the central bank raises interest rates, that should make borrowing more expensive. This would discourage people and businesses from taking out loans, which in turn should reduce spending and investment. Less spending means less demand for goods and services, which can help control inflation.\n\nBut the question is about interest rates, new home purchases, and the unemployment rate.\n\nOption A says interest rates decrease, new homes increase, and unemployment increases.\n\nOption B says interest rates decrease, new homes decrease, and unemployment decreases.\n\nOption C says interest rates increase, new homes decrease, and unemployment decreases.\n\nOption D says interest rates increase, new homes decrease, and unemployment increases.\n\nGiven that the central bank is engaging in contractionary policy, it's likely raising interest rates to cool down the economy. So, interest rates should increase. That eliminates options A and B.\n\nNow, between options C and D, I need to figure out what happens to new home purchases and the unemployment rate.\n\nIf interest rates increase, borrowing becomes more expensive. This should make buying a new home more costly, so people might buy fewer homes. So, new home purchases should decrease. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the tricky part is the unemployment rate. At full employment, the unemployment rate is already low. If the central bank tightens monetary policy to cool down the economy, this could lead to a slowdown in job creation or even some job losses. So, the unemployment rate might edge up slightly as companies hire fewer people or even lay off some workers due to reduced demand.\n\nBut, on the other hand, if the economy was previously at full employment, a slight increase in unemployment might be acceptable to bring down inflation pressures.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems the most plausible: interest rates increase, new home purchases decrease, and the unemployment rate increases.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe the unemployment rate doesn't increase right away, or perhaps the central bank can achieve its goals without causing unemployment to rise.\n\nI recall that contractionary policy is intended to reduce aggregate demand. If successful, it should slow down inflation without necessarily increasing unemployment by too much. However, in reality, when demand decreases, businesses might cut back on hiring or even lay off workers, leading to a rise in unemployment.\n\nSo, in the short term, it's possible to see a slight increase in unemployment as a result of contractionary policy.\n\nTherefore, option D seems correct: interest rates increase, new home purchases decrease, and the unemployment rate increases.\n\nWait a minute, but option C says unemployment decreases. Why would unemployment decrease if the central bank is tightening policy? That doesn't make much sense. If anything, tighter monetary policy should lead to higher unemployment, not lower.\n\nUnless the economy was previously facing such high inflation that the increase in interest rates actually helps to stabilize prices, making businesses more confident and thus hiring more. But that seems counterintuitive.\n\nNo, I think the straightforward answer is that contractionary policy leads to higher interest rates, decreased spending, including on big-ticket items like homes, and potentially higher unemployment as economic activity slows down.\n\nSo, I'll go with option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
