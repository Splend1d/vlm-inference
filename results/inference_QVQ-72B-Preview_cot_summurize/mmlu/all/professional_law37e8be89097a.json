They agreed that the developer would pay for the architect's plans, but there was a condition: the architect had to abstain from alcohol during the six months it took to do the work. The architect had a history of substance abuse, which is why this condition was included.\n\nAfter two months, the architect started drinking again, having several alcoholic drinks each day. The developer found out about this before seeing the preliminary plans. But when the developer saw the preliminary plans, they were impressed and looked forward to the final plans. The architect kept drinking and finished the plans on time. Then, the developer refused to review, accept, or pay for the final plans, citing the architect's continued alcohol use. Now, the architect is suing for breach of contract.\n\nI need to find the argument that best supports the architect's claim. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. The alcohol use was not a material breach of contract by the architect, since it did not affect the quality of the work.\n\nWell, a material breach is a significant violation of the contract terms that substantially defeats the purpose of the agreement. Here, the condition was to abstain from alcohol, which was likely seen as crucial for the architect's performance due to their history. If the architect didn't abstain from alcohol, that could be considered a material breach. However, the argument suggests that the quality of the work wasn't affected, which might mitigate the breach's materiality. But the condition was clear, and the purpose was probably to ensure the architect's reliability and performance, not just the end result.\n\nB. The developer waived the condition of no alcohol use.\n\nWaiver means that one party gives up their right to enforce a particular term of the contract. Here, the developer saw the preliminary plans, was impressed, and expressed anticipation for the final plans, even though they knew about the architect's drinking. This could be seen as waiving the condition, especially since they proceeded with the project despite knowing about the breach. Waiver can be express or implied by conduct, and the developer's actions might suggest they no longer considered the no-alcohol condition essential.\n\nC. The no-alcohol term was functionally a penalty clause and therefore was unenforceable.\n\nA penalty clause is one that imposes a sanction disproportionate to the actual harm caused by the breach. Such clauses are generally unenforceable because they're seen as unconscionable. In this case, the no-alcohol condition was likely included to ensure the architect's performance quality and reliability, given their history. It's not clear that the penalty (refusing to pay for the plans) is disproportionate to the harm caused by the architect's drinking. If the drinking didn't affect the quality of the work, as option A suggests, then maybe the penalty is too harsh. But generally, conditions like this are enforceable if they're reasonable and related to the contract's purpose.\n\nD. The no-alcohol term would be interpreted as a promise and not a condition.\n\nIn contract law, terms can be conditions or warranties. A condition is a fundamental term that, if breached, allows the other party to terminate the contract and sue for damages. A warranty is a less significant term, and its breach typically only entitles the injured party to damages, not termination. If the no-alcohol term was a promise or a warranty rather than a condition, then the developer wouldn't be able to refuse to accept and pay for the plans based solely on the architect's drinking. However, given that the term was likely intended to ensure the architect's performance, it might have been drafted as a condition.\n\nConsidering these options, I think the strongest argument for the architect is that the developer waived the no-alcohol condition. The developer knew about the architect's drinking but proceeded with the project and expressed satisfaction with the preliminary plans. This behavior suggests that the developer was willing to overlook the architect's drinking as long as the work was satisfactory. Therefore, the developer waived the condition, and cannot now refuse to accept and pay for the final plans based on the architect's alcohol use.\n\nSo, the best answer is B. The developer waived the condition of no alcohol use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
