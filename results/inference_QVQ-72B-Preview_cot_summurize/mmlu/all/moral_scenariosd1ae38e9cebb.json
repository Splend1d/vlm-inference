                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and what actions are being taken by the main character, who refers to themselves as \"I,\" \"me,\" or \"my.\"\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"Last night during dinner at my favorite restaurant, I bent a knee and proposed to my long-time girlfriend.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the person is proposing marriage to their girlfriend in a restaurant. Proposing marriage is generally considered a positive and loving gesture, right? It's a commitment to spend their lives together, and doing it in a restaurant might make it a memorable and romantic moment. From what I know, proposing marriage is not considered morally wrong in US culture; in fact, it's often celebrated as a happy event.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some contexts or details that could change this. For example, if the person proposing was already married to someone else, that would be an issue. But the scenario doesn't indicate anything like that. It just says they're proposing to their long-time girlfriend, so I think it's safe to assume that this is a consensual and positive step in their relationship.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I moved to the United States to get welfare.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. So, the person moved to the US specifically to receive welfare benefits. Welfare in the US is a system designed to provide assistance to those in need, such as low-income individuals or families. It's meant to help people who are struggling financially.\n\nNow, moving to another country to take advantage of its social services might raise some ethical questions. Some might argue that using another country's resources without contributing anything in return could be seen as unfair or even exploitative. On the other hand, if someone is in need and the US offers programs that can help them, perhaps they have a right to seek that assistance.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, how is this viewed? Well, there's been a lot of debate about immigration and welfare usage. Some people believe that immigrants, especially those who come specifically for welfare, are a burden on the system. Others argue that everyone, regardless of nationality, should have access to basic assistance if they need it.\n\nI need to consider the intent behind moving. If the person is moving solely to receive welfare without any plans to contribute to society or find work, that might be seen as taking advantage of the system. However, if they're moving and plan to work but need temporary assistance, that might be more acceptable.\n\nThe scenario doesn't specify the person's intentions beyond wanting to get welfare. It says they moved to the US to get welfare, but doesn't say anything about their plans to work or contribute in other ways. So, based on the information given, it seems like their primary purpose is to receive welfare benefits.\n\nIn the US, there are actually laws that restrict non-citizens' access to welfare benefits. For example, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) imposed significant restrictions on welfare benefits for non-citizens. So, depending on the person's immigration status, they might not even be eligible for most welfare programs.\n\nBut assuming that the person is eligible for welfare, is it morally wrong to move to the US specifically to receive it? I think this is a gray area. Some might see it as morally acceptable if the person is in genuine need and the US has the resources to help. Others might view it as morally wrong because it's seen as freeloading off the US taxpayer.\n\nConsidering the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think there's a tendency to view welfare as a safety net for those who are already part of the community and contributing in some way. Someone who moves solely to receive benefits might be seen as taking without giving back, which could be considered morally questionable.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the person's circumstances. Maybe they're fleeing from a difficult situation in their home country and need assistance. In that case, seeking welfare might be seen as a necessary step for survival.\n\nBut again, the scenario doesn't provide any additional context about the person's background or situation. It just says they moved to the US to get welfare. So, based on that, it seems like the action is more inclined towards being morally wrong, at least from a US perspective.\n\nNow, to answer the question: For which of these two scenarios does the main character do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?\n\nLooking back, in Scenario 1, proposing to one's girlfriend is generally considered a positive and loving action, not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, moving to the US specifically to get welfare might be seen as morally wrong due to the implications of potentially taking advantage of the welfare system without contributing.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIs proposing to someone in a public place like a restaurant considered morally wrong? Generally, no. It's a personal decision and a expression of love and commitment. Unless there are other factors involved that we don't know about, it's hard to see how this action is morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, moving to another country solely for the purpose of receiving welfare could be seen as morally wrong because it might involve using resources intended for residents or citizens in need, without the intention of contributing to the society in other ways.\n\nSo, my final answer is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the appropriate choice.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's a different perspective. Perhaps someone might argue that moving to the US for welfare isn't necessarily morally wrong if the person is in need and the US has the means to help. However, given the emphasis on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and considering the debates around immigration and welfare, I think the prevailing view would consider this action morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
