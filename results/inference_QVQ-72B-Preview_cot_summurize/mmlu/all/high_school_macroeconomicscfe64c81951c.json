                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics problem. So, the scenario is that the reserve ratio is 10 percent, and the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks. We're also told that money demand is perfectly elastic, and we need to figure out what's likely to happen to the money supply, interest rates, and aggregate demand (AD). The options are:\n\nA. Money supply increases by $10 million, lowering the interest rate and increasing AD.\n\nB. Money supply remains constant, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase.\n\nC. Money supply increases by $10 million, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase.\n\nD. Money supply decreases by $10 million, raising the interest rate and decreasing AD.\n\nOkay, first things first, let's understand what's going on here. The Fed buying Treasury securities from commercial banks is a form of open market operation. When the Fed buys securities, it injects money into the banking system, which can potentially increase the money supply.\n\nThe reserve ratio is 10%, which means that banks have to keep 10% of deposits as reserves. The money multiplier formula is 1/reserve ratio, so in this case, it would be 1/0.10 = 10. This means that the initial injection of $1 million could potentially lead to a maximum increase in the money supply of $10 million if all the money is lent out and redeposited repeatedly.\n\nSo, option A suggests that the money supply increases by $10 million. That aligns with the money multiplier calculation.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that money demand is perfectly elastic. I need to think about what that implies. If money demand is perfectly elastic, it means that people are willing to hold any amount of money at the current interest rate. This could affect how changes in the money supply influence interest rates.\n\nLet me recall the equation for the money market equilibrium: Money supply (MS) equals money demand (MD). If MD is perfectly elastic, it's a horizontal line at a certain interest rate. So, any increase in MS would not lead to a change in the interest rate; instead, it would lead to an increase in the quantity of money held without a change in price (interest rate).\n\nGiven that, if the Fed increases the money supply by $10 million, and money demand doesn't change (since it's perfectly elastic), then the interest rate shouldn't change. That would mean that option A, which suggests that the interest rate lowers, might not be correct in this scenario.\n\nOption C also says the money supply increases by $10 million, but the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase. This seems plausible because if money demand is perfectly elastic, an increase in money supply might not lead to a change in interest rates.\n\nHowever, I need to think about how an increase in money supply, even if interest rates don't change, could affect aggregate demand. Typically, an increase in the money supply makes borrowing easier, which can stimulate spending and investment, thereby increasing AD. But if interest rates don't change, perhaps the stimulus to spending is lessened.\n\nWait a minute, if money demand is perfectly elastic, and the Fed increases the money supply, but interest rates don't change, then perhaps AD doesn't increase significantly because the cost of borrowing hasn't decreased.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Even if interest rates don't change, having more money in the system could still lead to increased spending, as people and businesses have more cash on hand, regardless of the interest rates.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Suppose the Fed injects $1 million into the banking system by buying Treasury securities. With a reserve ratio of 10%, banks can lend out $900,000 (since they have to keep $100,000 in reserves). Then, the borrowers spend that $900,000, which gets deposited into another bank, which keeps 10% as reserves and lends out $810,000, and so on. Theoretically, this process can lead to a maximum money supply increase of $10 million.\n\nNow, if money demand is perfectly elastic, people are willing to hold any amount of money at the current interest rate. So, even if the money supply increases by $10 million, as long as people are willing to hold that extra money without demanding higher interest rates, the interest rate shouldn't change.\n\nIn that case, option A is incorrect because it suggests the interest rate lowers, which doesn't align with the perfectly elastic money demand scenario.\n\nOption B says the money supply remains constant. But according to the money multiplier, it should increase by $10 million. So, option B is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C says the money supply increases by $10 million, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase. This seems plausible because, with money demand being perfectly elastic, the interest rate shouldn't change, and thus AD might not increase.\n\nBut wait, option D says the money supply decreases by $10 million, which contradicts the initial action of the Fed buying securities and injecting $1 million into the system. So, option D is likely incorrect.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities, it increases the money supply. With a money multiplier of 10, the potential increase is $10 million. If money demand is perfectly elastic, and assuming that the increase in money supply is fully absorbed by the economy without causing inflation, then the interest rate should remain constant.\n\nIn this scenario, AD might still increase because of the increased money supply, even if interest rates don't change. People have more money to spend, which could lead to increased consumption and investment, thereby raising AD.\n\nBut the problem states that money demand is perfectly elastic, which might imply that people are holding onto the extra money without spending it, hence AD doesn't increase.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look up what perfectly elastic money demand implies.\n\nIn economics, if money demand is perfectly elastic, it means that the demand for money is insensitive to changes in the interest rate. People are willing to hold any amount of money at the prevailing interest rate. So, if the money supply increases, and money demand doesn't change, the interest rate should remain the same.\n\nIn this case, the Fed increases the money supply by $1 million, leading to a potential $10 million increase through the money multiplier. Since money demand is perfectly elastic, people are willing to hold this extra money without demanding higher interest rates.\n\nNow, if people are holding onto this extra money, it might not lead to increased spending immediately, which could mean that AD doesn't increase significantly in the short term.\n\nHowever, in reality, when people have more money, they might spend some of it, even if interest rates don't change. But given the assumption of perfectly elastic money demand, perhaps the model suggests that AD doesn't increase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase in money supply leads to increased spending via the velocity of money, even if interest rates remain constant.\n\nI think I need to consider the equation of exchange: MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is real output.\n\nIf the money supply increases by $10 million (from the money multiplier), and assuming velocity remains constant, then PQ must increase. If Q is at potential GDP, then P must increase, indicating inflation.\n\nBut the problem mentions AD, which is related to total spending in the economy. If money supply increases and interest rates don't change, AD might still increase due to the increased spending from the additional money in circulation.\n\nHowever, the problem states that money demand is perfectly elastic, which might imply that people are holding onto the extra money without spending it, hence AD doesn't increase.\n\nThis is still confusing. Maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet's consider the liquidity preference theory. If money demand is perfectly elastic, it's like a horizontal curve at a certain interest rate. An increase in money supply would shift the money supply curve to the right, but since the money demand curve is horizontal, the interest rate remains the same, and the quantity of money held increases.\n\nIn this case, if interest rates don't change, there's no incentive for increased borrowing or spending, so AD might not increase.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the increased money supply could still lead to increased spending if people choose to spend some of the extra money they hold.\n\nPerhaps the key here is that with perfectly elastic money demand, people are willing to hold any amount of money at the current interest rate, so they don't necessarily spend the extra money, leading to no change in AD.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most appropriate answer: money supply increases by $10 million, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests the interest rate lowers, which shouldn't happen with perfectly elastic money demand.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the money supply does increase, not remain constant.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the money supply increases, not decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
