                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Modern computer microchips are primarily composed of what element?\" And the options are Sodium, Silicon, Aluminum, and Silver. Hmm, I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that microchips are an essential part of computers and other electronic devices. They're like the brains that make everything work. But what are they made of? I think I recall that silicon is a key component, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Sodium. I know sodium is a soft, reactive metal, often used in things like batteries or streetlights. But I don't think it's the primary material in microchips. It seems a bit too reactive for the delicate environment inside a computer.\n\nNext is Silicon. This one rings a bell. I've heard of silicon valleys and silicon-based semiconductors. Silicon is a semiconductor, which means it can control the flow of electricity, right? That sounds important for microchips because they rely on controlling electrical signals to process information. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nThen there's Aluminum. Aluminum is a light metal commonly used in things like beverage cans and construction materials. It's also used in some electronic components, like heat sinks, but I don't think it's the primary material in microchips. Maybe it's used in some parts, but not as the main component.\n\nLastly, Silver. Silver is known for its excellent conductivity, both electrically and thermally. It's often used in high-performance electrical connections and soldering. However, it's also quite expensive and not as abundant as some other metals. I doubt it's the primary material in microchips, though it might be used in small amounts.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Silicon seems to be the most logical choice. It's a semiconductor, which is crucial for the functioning of microchips, and it's widely used in the electronics industry for this purpose.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other elements that might be used in microchips. For example, Germanium is another semiconductor, but I think Silicon is more commonly used these days. Also, some microchips might use compounds like Gallium Arsenide, but again, Silicon is still the most prevalent.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that microchips have multiple layers, including the semiconductor material and various insulators and conductors. But the question specifies the primary composition, so it's likely referring to the base material that makes up the transistors and other active components.\n\nLet me also think about the manufacturing process of microchips. They are typically made on Silicon wafers, which are sliced from large crystals of Silicon. These wafers form the basis of the microchip, with layers of insulating materials and metal interconnects added on top.\n\nSo, based on this, Silicon is indeed the primary material used in modern computer microchips.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider the properties of each element:\n\n- Sodium: Reactive metal, not suitable for microchips.\n\n- Silicon: Semiconductor, ideal for controlling electricity in microchips.\n\n- Aluminum: Light metal, primarily used for different purposes in electronics.\n\n- Silver: Excellent conductor but too costly for primary use in microchips.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Silicon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Silicon}} \\]"
