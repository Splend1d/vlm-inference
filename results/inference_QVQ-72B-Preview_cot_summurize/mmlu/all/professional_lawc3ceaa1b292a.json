For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?\n\nA. No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.\nB.

                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this scenario about a condominium development with two buildings: one has balconies, and the other doesn't. The association passed an amendment that says balcony units can't be sold to families with minor children anymore, but existing families with kids in those units aren't being kicked out. This amendment was recorded, and the condo association has a rule that all sales need their approval.\n\nThen, someone tries to sell a balcony unit to a family with kids after the amendment is in place. The association tells the buyers they can't buy it because they have minor children, but suggests there are other units available without balconies. The buyers complain to a fair housing agency, saying this amendment violates federal fair housing laws.\n\nNow, the question is whether there's reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred. The options are:\n\nA. No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.\n\nB. No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues.\n\nC. Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.\n\nD. Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\n\nI need to think through this carefully.\n\nFirst, I should recall what federal fair housing laws say. The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate against people in housing based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or family status. Family status includes having children.\n\nSo, the amendment seems to be discriminating against families with children by not allowing them to buy balcony units in the future.\n\nBut wait, the association is saying it's for safety reasons. Maybe they think balconies are unsafe for children or something like that.\n\nHowever, the fact that existing families with children are allowed to stay suggests that the safety concern isn't urgent enough to require immediate evacuation or anything like that.\n\nAlso, they're offering units without balconies to families with children, which seems like an alternative, but is that acceptable under fair housing laws?\n\nI think the key here is that the association is segregating families with children by not allowing them to buy balcony units, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nOption A says no because families with children can buy units without balconies. But is that sufficient? Isn't it still a form of discrimination to say they can't have certain units?\n\nOption B says no because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues. But is the safety concern substantial enough to override fair housing protections? I need to see if there's evidence that the balconies are indeed unsafe for children, and if there are no other solutions besides prohibiting sales to families with children.\n\nOption C says yes because families with children are already living in units with balconies. But I'm not sure if that's relevant. The amendment is about future sales, not current residents.\n\nOption D says yes because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development. This seems to align with fair housing principles. Discriminating against families with children by restricting where they can live within the development is likely a violation.\n\nI think the best answer is D. Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\n\nJust because there are units without balconies available to families with children doesn't mean it's okay to prevent them from buying balcony units. That still amounts to discrimination based on family status.\n\nMoreover, even if there are safety concerns, the association would need to show that balconies are inherently unsafe for children and that there's no reasonable way to make them safe, to justify such a restriction. Otherwise, it's likely a violation of fair housing laws.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
