                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an FDA investigator testing the weight of aspirin tablets. The bottle says each tablet should weigh 300 milligrams, but when the investigator weighs a sample of seven tablets, she gets weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303 mg. Then, there's a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim, and I need to find which option gives the p-value of this test.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being tested here. The manufacturer claims that the average weight of the tablets is 300 mg. The FDA investigator is checking if this claim is accurate by taking a sample and seeing if the sample mean is significantly different from 300 mg.\n\nSo, the null hypothesis (H\u2080) is that the true mean weight of the tablets is 300 mg, and the alternative hypothesis (H\u2090) is that it's not 300 mg. This seems like a two-tailed test because the investigator is interested in deviations from 300 mg in either direction.\n\nNow, since the sample size is small (only seven tablets), and I assume that the population standard deviation is unknown, I should use a t-test. The t-statistic is calculated as:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nI need to calculate the sample mean and the sample standard deviation.\n\nFirst, let's find the sample mean (x\u0304):\n\nx\u0304 = (299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) / 7\n\nLet me add up the weights:\n\n299 + 300 = 599\n\n599 + 305 = 904\n\n904 + 302 = 1206\n\n1206 + 299 = 1505\n\n1505 + 301 = 1806\n\n1806 + 303 = 2109\n\nSo, the total weight is 2109 mg.\n\nNow, the sample mean is 2109 / 7 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n2109 divided by 7.\n\n7 \u00d7 300 = 2100, so 2109 - 2100 = 9, so 300 + 9/7 = 300 + 1.2857... which is approximately 301.2857 mg.\n\nSo, x\u0304 \u2248 301.2857 mg.\n\nNext, the sample standard deviation (s).\n\nThe formula for the sample standard deviation is:\n\ns = sqrt[ \u03a3(x_i - x\u0304)\u00b2 / (n - 1) ]\n\nWhere x_i are the individual weights, x\u0304 is the sample mean, and n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, calculate (x_i - x\u0304) for each x_i:\n\nFor x_i = 299: 299 - 301.2857 \u2248 -2.2857\n\nFor x_i = 300: 300 - 301.2857 \u2248 -1.2857\n\nFor x_i = 305: 305 - 301.2857 \u2248 3.7143\n\nFor x_i = 302: 302 - 301.2857 \u2248 0.7143\n\nFor x_i = 299: 299 - 301.2857 \u2248 -2.2857\n\nFor x_i = 301: 301 - 301.2857 \u2248 -0.2857\n\nFor x_i = 303: 303 - 301.2857 \u2248 1.7143\n\nNow, square each of these:\n\n(-2.2857)\u00b2 \u2248 5.2224\n\n(-1.2857)\u00b2 \u2248 1.6531\n\n(3.7143)\u00b2 \u2248 13.8024\n\n(0.7143)\u00b2 \u2248 0.5102\n\n(-2.2857)\u00b2 \u2248 5.2224\n\n(-0.2857)\u00b2 \u2248 0.0816\n\n(1.7143)\u00b2 \u2248 2.9384\n\nNow, sum these squared deviations:\n\n5.2224 + 1.6531 = 6.8755\n\n6.8755 + 13.8024 = 20.6779\n\n20.6779 + 0.5102 = 21.1881\n\n21.1881 + 5.2224 = 26.4105\n\n26.4105 + 0.0816 = 26.4921\n\n26.4921 + 2.9384 = 29.4305\n\nSo, \u03a3(x_i - x\u0304)\u00b2 \u2248 29.4305\n\nNow, divide by (n - 1) = 6:\n\n29.4305 / 6 \u2248 4.9051\n\nThen, the sample standard deviation s = sqrt(4.9051) \u2248 2.2147 mg\n\nNow, calculate the t-statistic:\n\nt = (x\u0304 - \u03bc) / (s / sqrt(n)) = (301.2857 - 300) / (2.2147 / sqrt(7)) \u2248 1.2857 / (2.2147 / 2.6458)\n\nWait, sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458.\n\nSo, 2.2147 / 2.6458 \u2248 0.8367\n\nThen, t \u2248 1.2857 / 0.8367 \u2248 1.536\n\nSo, the t-statistic is approximately 1.54, which matches what's given in the options.\n\nNow, the degrees of freedom (df) is n - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nSince it's a two-tailed test, the p-value is twice the area in one tail.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n\nB. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n\nC. P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n\nD. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n\nSo, the t-statistic is 1.54, df = 6, and it's a two-tailed test.\n\nTherefore, the p-value is 2 times P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.\n\nSo, the correct option is B. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
