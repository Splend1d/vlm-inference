                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand what an act jure gestionis is, and I've got these options to choose from. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I know that jure gestionis is related to acts that a state does in a more managerial or business-like capacity, as opposed to its sovereign functions. So, it's kind of like when a state is acting like a regular person or a company, not exercising its sovereign power.\n\nOption A says that acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by states in a private capacity. That sounds similar to what I just thought. If a state is acting like a private person or entity, not using its sovereign authority, then that would be considered jure gestionis.\n\nOption B says that all purchases by the state are acts jure gestionis. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. States buy a lot of things\u2014supplies, equipment, services. Some of these purchases might be for public use, like buying textbooks for schools or purchasing medicine for hospitals. Are these all considered jure gestionis? I think some might be considered jure imperii, which is the exercise of sovereign power. For example, buying arms or diplomatic vehicles might be seen as sovereign acts.\n\nOption C says that all acts undertaken by state corporations are jure gestionis. State corporations are companies owned by the state, right? They operate in various sectors, like energy, transportation, or telecommunications. Now, just because they're state-owned, does that mean all their actions are automatically jure gestionis? I don't think so. Some of their activities might be commercial in nature, like selling products or services, which would be jure gestionis. But perhaps some of their functions are regulatory or involve exercising state authority, which might be jure imperii.\n\nOption D says that all conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jure gestionis. That seems off to me. Government officials are people too, and when they're off duty, their actions are probably just considered personal actions, not state actions at all. So, I don't think that's correct.\n\nLet me summarize what I've thought so far:\n\n- Jure gestionis refers to acts where the state is acting in a non-sovereign, more business-like capacity.\n\n- Jure imperii refers to acts where the state is exercising its sovereign power.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to align with the definition of jure gestionis.\n\nOption B suggests that all state purchases are jure gestionis, but I have doubts because some purchases might be considered sovereign acts.\n\nOption C claims that all acts by state corporations are jure gestionis, but I think some of their activities could be jure imperii depending on the nature of the act.\n\nOption D proposes that all conduct by government officials in their free time is jure gestionis, which I believe is incorrect because their personal actions aren't state actions.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is Option A: Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by states in a private capacity.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me do a quick search to confirm.\n\n[Imagining searching for \"jure gestionis definition\"]\n\nOkay, according to various legal sources, jure gestionis refers to acts performed by a state in its capacity as a private actor, such as engaging in commercial transactions or managing property. On the other hand, jure imperii refers to acts performed by a state in exercising its sovereign authority, such as making laws, conducting foreign relations, or maintaining public order.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems accurate: acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by states in a private capacity.\n\nOption B, stating that all purchases by the state are acts jure gestionis, might not be correct because some purchases could be directly related to the exercise of sovereign functions, thereby classifying as jure imperii.\n\nOption C suggests that all acts undertaken by state corporations are jure gestionis. However, state corporations can sometimes perform functions that are inherently sovereign in nature, such as regulating certain industries or providing public services that are part of the state's sovereign duties. Therefore, not all their acts would be considered jure gestionis.\n\nOption D asserts that all conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jure gestionis. But in reality, officials' private actions are their own and don't constitute state actions; hence, they wouldn't fall under either jure gestionis or jure imperii.\n\nIn conclusion, the best answer is Option A: Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by states in a private capacity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
