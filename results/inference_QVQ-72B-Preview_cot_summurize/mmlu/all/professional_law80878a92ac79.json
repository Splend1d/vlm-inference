                    "text": "So I've got this mortgage scenario with multiple lenders and I need to figure out how the money gets distributed in a foreclosure. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the homeowner gives his friend a mortgage on his property to secure a $100,000 loan. Then, he gives an investor a mortgage on the same property to secure an $80,000 loan. After that, the friend records his mortgage. Next, the homeowner gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a $50,000 loan, and then the investor records, followed by the bank recording.\n\nNow, the homeowner loses his job and can't pay the mortgages, so there's a foreclosure proceeding involving the friend, the investor, and the bank. The property sells for $160,000, and I need to determine how much, if any, of that should go to the friend.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the priority of these mortgages. Generally, in real estate law, the priority of mortgages is determined by the order in which they were recorded. There's a principle called \"first in time, first in right,\" which means the first mortgage to be recorded has the highest priority.\n\nSo, let's list out the sequence of events:\n\n1. Friend gives a $100,000 loan secured by a mortgage.\n\n2. Investor gives an $80,000 loan secured by a mortgage.\n\n3. Friend records his mortgage.\n\n4. Bank gives a $50,000 loan secured by a mortgage.\n\n5. Investor records his mortgage.\n\n6. Bank records its mortgage.\n\nNow, the recording statute says that unless recorded, instruments affecting title are void against subsequent purchasers who pay value and lack notice.\n\nSo, recording is crucial for protecting one's interest against subsequent lenders or buyers.\n\nLet's consider the priorities:\n\n- Friend's mortgage was recorded first.\n\n- Then Investor's mortgage was recorded.\n\n- Finally, the Bank's mortgage was recorded.\n\nTherefore, the priority should be:\n\n1. Friend's mortgage ($100,000)\n\n2. Investor's mortgage ($80,000)\n\n3. Bank's mortgage ($50,000)\n\nNow, the property sold for $160,000 in foreclosure. We need to pay off these mortgages in order of priority.\n\nFirst, pay the friend's mortgage: $100,000.\n\nThen, pay the investor's mortgage: $80,000.\n\nTotal paid so far: $100,000 + $80,000 = $180,000.\n\nBut the property only sold for $160,000.\n\nWait a minute, $160,000 is less than $180,000, so there's a shortfall.\n\nThat means there isn't enough money from the sale to pay off both the friend and the investor in full.\n\nSo, how is this handled?\n\nGenerally, each mortgagee gets paid in order of priority until the sale proceeds are exhausted.\n\nSo, the friend gets paid first, up to the available proceeds.\n\nBut wait, the friend has the first priority on the entire $100,000.\n\nSince the property sold for $160,000, the friend would get the full $100,000.\n\nThen, the investor, who has the second priority, would get the remaining $60,000 ($160,000 - $100,000 = $60,000).\n\nBut the investor originally lent $80,000, so they would only recover $60,000 in this scenario, leaving them with a $20,000 loss.\n\nThe bank, being third in priority, gets nothing in this case since there are no remaining proceeds after paying the friend and the investor.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how much should go to the friend.\n\nAccording to this calculation, the friend should get $100,000.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other consideration.\n\nIs there any possibility that the friend's mortgage is subordinated or that there are any other factors that might affect the distribution?\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any subordination agreements or other complications, so it seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the friend should receive $100,000 from the foreclosure proceeds.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $0.00\n\nB. $30,000.00\n\nC. $80,000.00\n\nD. $100,000.00\n\nThe correct answer should be D. $100,000.00.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nThe recording order is friend first, then investor, then bank.\n\nThe friend has the first lien, so he gets paid first.\n\nEven if the property sold for less than the amount owed, the friend still gets the full amount as long as there are sufficient proceeds.\n\nIn this case, $160,000 is more than enough to cover the friend's $100,000 mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the friend should receive $100,000.\n\nI think the answer is D. $100,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
