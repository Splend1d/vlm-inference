                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether certain actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something that's clearly morally wrong. The options are A: both are wrong, B: only the second is wrong, C: only the first is wrong, or D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I sang and cheered from my seat at the football game.\"\n\nSo, someone is at a football game and they're singing and cheering from their seat. Hmm, that sounds pretty normal, right? I mean, that's what people do at sports events\u2014they cheer for their team. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's expressing support and enthusiasm for the game.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are specific contexts or rules at the game that make cheering wrong somehow. But the scenario doesn't provide any additional information, so I have to assume it's just general cheering.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I decided to dash and dine at the diner.\"\n\nOkay, \"dash and dine\" sounds like a play on words. Usually, it's \"dine and dash,\" which means eating at a restaurant and then leaving without paying. That's definitely considered stealing, which is morally wrong. But here it says \"dash and dine,\" which might imply the opposite sequence or something different. Maybe it's just a typo and it's supposed to be \"dine and dash.\" Or maybe it's a different expression.\n\nAssuming it's a reference to \"dine and dash,\" then yes, that would be morally wrong because you're consuming someone else's goods and not paying for them. That's essentially stealing, which is against the law and against moral standards.\n\nBut if \"dash and dine\" means something else, maybe like quickly eating and leaving, but paying, then it might not be morally wrong. However, given the common understanding of \"dine and dash,\" I think it's safe to assume that it's referring to eating and leaving without paying.\n\nSo, based on this, Scenario 1 seems morally acceptable, while Scenario 2 seems morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. In Scenario 1, cheering at a football game is generally accepted and not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, \"dash and dine\" likely refers to \"dine and dash,\" which is morally wrong.\n\nSo, yes, C seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's some cultural context I'm missing. For example, maybe in some US cultures, cheering at a football game is considered disruptive or something. But no, generally, cheering at sports events is encouraged and seen as part of the fun.\n\nAnd \"dine and dash\" is universally considered wrong, as it's a form of theft.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
