                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the wife's proposed testimony is admissible in court. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, what's the situation? A man and a woman are sitting next to each other in first class on a plane. They don't know each other, I assume. Midway through the flight, the woman goes to the restroom, and while she's gone, the man goes through her purse and steals $100. A flight attendant sees him do this and reports it, leading to his arrest when the plane lands. Now, he's on trial for federal larceny.\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecuting attorney wants to call the man's wife as a witness. She wants to testify that her husband confided in her that he did steal the money during the flight. The defense attorney is objecting on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. So, I need to evaluate these objections.\n\nLet's start with the hearsay objection. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the wife is proposing to testify about what her husband told her\u2014that he stole the money during the flight. So, her testimony would be, essentially, repeating her husband's statement to her. That sounds like hearsay because it's her husband's statement, not her own direct knowledge.\n\nBut, is there an exception to the hearsay rule that might apply here? I need to think about that. Common hearsay exceptions include admissions against interest, excited utterances, present sense impressions, and so on. Does any of these fit?\n\nWell, the statement is an admission against interest by the defendant. Generally, admissions by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, statements by a party-opponent are admissible against that party. So, if the wife is testifying about what the defendant said to her, and he admitted stealing the money, that should be admissible as a party admission.\n\nWait a minute, but the wife is testifying against her husband. Is there any spousal privilege that might prevent her from testifying about private communications between them?\n\nThat brings me to the privilege objection. There is a spousal privilege that generally prevents one spouse from testifying against the other about confidential communications made during the marriage. However, this privilege is usually controlled by the spouse who is the witness. So, in this case, the wife is the witness, and she seems willing to testify. If she waives the privilege, then her testimony should be admissible.\n\nBut, I need to confirm whether the spousal privilege applies in this situation. First, spousal privilege typically applies to confidential communications between spouses. If the husband confided in her in private, then it might be privileged. However, if the wife is willing to testify and doesn't object based on privilege, then the privilege is waived.\n\nAlso, in criminal cases, the spousal privilege may have limitations. For example, in some jurisdictions, the privilege doesn't apply when the spouse is testifying against the defendant in cases involving crimes against the spouse or certain other exceptions.\n\nBut in this scenario, the crime isn't against the spouse; it's against a third party. So, unless there are specific exceptions that apply here, the wife should be able to testify about what her husband told her, provided she waives any privilege.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Hearsay: The wife's testimony is based on the defendant's out-of-court statement, but as a party admission, it should be admissible.\n\n- Privilege: Even if the communication is privileged, the wife seems willing to testify, suggesting she's waiving any privilege.\n\nTherefore, the testimony should be admissible.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.\n\nB. Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.\n\nD. Inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nGiven my analysis, the correct answer should be A. Admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.\n\nWait, but I thought it is hearsay, but it falls under an exception, so it's admissible. So, option A says it's not hearsay. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nActually, the party admission exception does make it not considered hearsay. Under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 801(d)(2), a statement offered against a party is not hearsay if it's the party's own statement. So, in this case, the defendant's statement to his wife is his own statement, and thus not hearsay when offered against him.\n\nSo, it's not hearsay. And as for privilege, since the wife is willing to testify, it's likely that any privilege is waived. Therefore, option A seems correct: admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.\n\nI don't think it's inadmissible based on the information provided. Unless there's some other privilege or rule that I'm missing, which is possible, but based on the standard rules, A seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
