                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"As I took my test, I wrote her answers.\" Okay, so someone is taking a test and writing down another person's answers. Hmm, that sounds a lot like cheating. Cheating on a test is generally considered morally wrong, right? I mean, you're supposed to do your own work and show what you know, not just copy someone else's answers. Plus, it's usually against school rules to cheat. So, in this case, it seems like the person is doing something ethically questionable.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I sniffed the rare flowers in the public garden.\" Hmm, this one is a bit different. Here, someone is smelling rare flowers in a public garden. At first glance, it might not seem like a big deal. I mean, flowers are there to be enjoyed, right? But the key word here is \"rare.\" These are rare flowers, possibly endangered or valuable, and they're in a public garden, which means they're probably meant for everyone to appreciate.\n\nBut is sniffing them wrong? Well, I don't think sniffing flowers is inherently bad, especially if it's in a public space where it's allowed. However, if the flowers are rare and perhaps fragile, maybe there are rules against touching or getting too close to them to preserve them. But assuming that sniffing them doesn't cause any damage or harm, I don't see this as a morally wrong action.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong because cheating on a test is generally considered unethical. On the other hand, Scenario 2 involves sniffing rare flowers, which might be innocuous unless there's specific context that makes it wrong, like if the flowers are extremely delicate and sniffing them could harm them, but the scenario doesn't specify that.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, it seems like Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. That would make the answer \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to this. In Scenario 1, writing her answers could be interpreted in different ways. Is it possible that the person is just noting down answers for later reference, not necessarily cheating? But given that it's during a test, it's likely that it's being done to cheat on the exam.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe there's a sign that says not to touch the flowers, but again, without that information, I can't be sure. But based on ordinary moral standards, sniffing flowers in a public garden doesn't seem like a morally wrong act.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. So, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
