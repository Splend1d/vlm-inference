                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this Johansen \"trace\" test for cointegration. The question is about a system with 4 variables, and we're testing the null hypothesis of 2 cointegrating vectors. I need to figure out which eigenvalues are used in this test.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the Johansen trace test is all about. It's a statistical test used to determine the number of cointegrating relationships in a vector autoregression (VAR) model. Cointegration refers to a long-term equilibrium relationship between non-stationary variables.\n\nIn the Johansen framework, there are two main tests: the trace test and the maximum eigenvalue test. Here, we're dealing with the trace test.\n\nThe trace test simultaneously tests the number of cointegrating vectors. The null hypothesis is that there are at most r cointegrating vectors, against the alternative that there are more than r cointegrating vectors.\n\nGiven that there are 4 variables in the system, the maximum number of possible cointegrating vectors is 3 (since it can't be more than k-1, where k is the number of variables).\n\nThe null hypothesis is that there are at most 2 cointegrating vectors. So, we're testing H0: r \u2264 2 against H1: r > 2.\n\nNow, in the trace test, the test statistic is based on the sum of the logarithms of the eigenvalues that are not restricted by the null hypothesis.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to be more precise. The trace test statistic is the sum of the log determinants of the eigenvalues that are greater than zero, adjusted for the number of variables and the sample size.\n\nBut to answer the question, which eigenvalues are used in the test when testing for 2 cointegrating vectors in a 4-variable system?\n\nLet me think about the eigenvalues in descending order. Suppose we have four eigenvalues, labeled \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, and \u03bb4, with \u03bb1 being the largest and \u03bb4 being the smallest.\n\nThe trace test for H0: r \u2264 r0 against H1: r > r0 is based on the sum of the log determinants of the (k - r0) largest eigenvalues.\n\nWait, no. Actually, I think it's the sum related to the (k - r0) smallest eigenvalues, but I need to double-check that.\n\nLet me look this up to make sure I get it right.\n\nUpon checking, the trace test statistic is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n- T \\sum_{i=r+1}^{k} \\ln(1 - \\hat{\\lambda}_i)\n\\]\n\nwhere T is the sample size, k is the number of variables, r is the number of cointegrating vectors under the null hypothesis, and \\hat{\u03bb}_i are the ordered eigenvalues from largest to smallest.\n\nSo, in this case, k = 4, and r = 2 under the null hypothesis. Therefore, the sum is over the smallest two eigenvalues, i.e., \u03bb3 and \u03bb4.\n\nSo, the trace test statistic uses the smallest two eigenvalues to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis of at most 2 cointegrating vectors.\n\nWait a minute, but I thought that in hypothesis testing, when we test for the number of cointegrating vectors, we look at the eigenvalues that are close to one (or zero, depending on the normalization) to determine the number of cointegrating relationships.\n\nSpecifically, in the context of the Johansen approach, the eigenvalues represent the strength of the cointegrating relationships. Eigenvalues close to one indicate strong cointegration, while those close to zero indicate no cointegration.\n\nTherefore, when testing the null hypothesis of r cointegrating vectors, we are essentially testing whether the last (k - r) eigenvalues are zero, indicating no additional cointegrating relationships beyond r.\n\nHence, in the trace test, the test statistic is based on the sum of the log determinants of the last (k - r) eigenvalues, which are the smallest ones.\n\nSo, in our case, with k = 4 and r = 2, k - r = 2, meaning we are summing the log determinants of the smallest two eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues used in the test are the smallest two.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. All of them\n\nB. The largest 2\n\nC. The smallest 2\n\nD. The second largest\n\nThe correct answer should be C. The smallest 2.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider another perspective.\n\nIn the context of the Johansen trace test, the test is designed to test the null hypothesis that the number of cointegrating vectors is less than or equal to a certain number against the alternative that it is greater.\n\nThe trace test statistic is constructed by summing the log determinants of the eigenvalues that are not restricted by the null hypothesis, which in this case are the last two eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, the trace test for H0: r \u2264 2 in a 4-variable system uses the smallest two eigenvalues.\n\nSo, the answer is C. The smallest 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
