                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a sample of helium gas. Let me read it carefully and make sure I understand what's happening here.\n\nWe have a sample of helium gas that initially occupies a volume of 5.00 liters at a temperature of 127 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 875 millimeters of mercury. Then, the sample is heated at constant pressure until it occupies a volume of 10.00 liters. I need to find the final temperature, in degrees Celsius, of the gas.\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with changes in volume and temperature at constant pressure. This sounds like Charles's Law, which relates the volume and temperature of a gas when pressure is constant.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Charles's Law states. Yeah, it says that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, provided that the pressure remains constant.\n\nSo, mathematically, it's expressed as:\n\nV\u2081/T\u2081 = V\u2082/T\u2082\n\nWhere:\n\n- V\u2081 is the initial volume\n\n- T\u2081 is the initial absolute temperature\n\n- V\u2082 is the final volume\n\n- T\u2082 is the final absolute temperature\n\nAlright, I have V\u2081 = 5.00 L, T\u2081 = 127\u00b0C, V\u2082 = 10.00 L, and I need to find T\u2082.\n\nBut wait, the pressure is given as 875 mm Hg, but since the pressure is constant, I don't need it for Charles's Law. It's only relevant if the pressure changes, which it doesn't in this case.\n\nSo, I can proceed with just V and T.\n\nBut, temperatures must be in Kelvin for absolute temperatures in gas laws.\n\nSo, let's convert T\u2081 from Celsius to Kelvin.\n\nT\u2081 (\u00b0C) to T\u2081 (K): T\u2081 = 127\u00b0C + 273.15 = 400.15 K\n\nSimilarly, T\u2082 will be in Kelvin, and then I'll convert it back to Celsius at the end.\n\nNow, plugging into Charles's Law:\n\n5.00 L / 400.15 K = 10.00 L / T\u2082\n\nSolving for T\u2082:\n\nT\u2082 = (10.00 L * 400.15 K) / 5.00 L\n\nT\u2082 = (4001.5 K-L) / 5.00\n\nT\u2082 = 800.3 K\n\nNow, convert T\u2082 from Kelvin to Celsius:\n\nT\u2082 (\u00b0C) = T\u2082 (K) - 273.15 = 800.3 - 273.15 = 527.15\u00b0C\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 454\u00b0C\n\nB. 527\u00b0C\n\nC. 45\u00b0C\n\nD. 181\u00b0C\n\nSo, the closest to my calculation is option B. 527\u00b0C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, Charles's Law: V\u2081/T\u2081 = V\u2082/T\u2082\n\nInitial volume V\u2081 = 5.00 L\n\nInitial temperature T\u2081 = 127\u00b0C = 400.15 K\n\nFinal volume V\u2082 = 10.00 L\n\nFinal temperature T\u2082 = ?\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n5.00 / 400.15 = 10.00 / T\u2082\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5.00 * T\u2082 = 10.00 * 400.15\n\n5T\u2082 = 4001.5\n\nT\u2082 = 4001.5 / 5\n\nT\u2082 = 800.3 K\n\nConvert to Celsius:\n\n800.3 - 273.15 = 527.15\u00b0C\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider significant figures. The initial data has three significant figures (5.00 L, 127\u00b0C, 875 mm Hg), so my answer should also have three significant figures.\n\n527.15\u00b0C rounded to three significant figures is 527\u00b0C, which matches option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 527\u00b0C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{527^\\circ \\text{C}} \\]"
