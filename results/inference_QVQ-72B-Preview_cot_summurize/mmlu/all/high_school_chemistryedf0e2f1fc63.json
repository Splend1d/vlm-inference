                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about titrating a weak base with a strong acid, and I need to figure out which observation is correct based on what happens during the titration. I'm a bit rusty on titrations, but I remember some key points about how pH changes during different stages.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when you titrate a weak base with a strong acid. The weak base will have a certain pH initially, and as I add the strong acid, the pH should change in a specific way.\n\nOption A says that initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there's a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point. Option B says the pH gradually decreases throughout the experiment, and at the equivalence point, it's below 7. Option C says initially, the pH slowly decreases, then a rapid decrease to give a pH equal to 7 at the equivalence point. Option D mentions something about pOH equaling pKb at the equivalence point, which seems a bit off.\n\nOkay, let's think step by step. In a titration of a weak base with a strong acid, the weak base will have a pH above 7 initially because it's a base. As the strong acid is added, it will react with the base, forming the conjugate acid of the base, and the pH will decrease.\n\nI remember that in the beginning, the pH decreases slowly because the weak base is buffering the solution. As more acid is added, the concentration of the conjugate acid increases, and eventually, all the base is neutralized at the equivalence point.\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the weak base has been converted to its conjugate acid, and the solution's pH depends on the nature of this conjugate acid. Since it's a weak base being titrated with a strong acid, the conjugate acid is stronger than the original base, so the solution should be acidic at the equivalence point, meaning pH < 7.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point.\n\nB. The pH of the solution gradually decreases throughout the experiment and the pH at the equivalence point is below 7.\n\nC. Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH equal to 7 at the equivalence point.\n\nD. Initially, the pH quickly decreases, then there is a gradual decrease to the equivalence point where the pOH equals the pKb of the base.\n\nOption A seems to describe the typical behavior: slow decrease initially due to buffering, then a rapid decrease as the equivalence point is approached, and at the equivalence point, pH < 7.\n\nOption B says the pH gradually decreases throughout, which is similar to option A, but it doesn't mention the rapid decrease near the equivalence point. So, it might be missing that detail.\n\nOption C says the pH at the equivalence point is equal to 7, which I don't think is correct for a weak base-strong acid titration. It should be less than 7.\n\nOption D mentions pOH equaling pKb at the equivalence point. I'm not sure about that. I think it should be related to the pKa of the conjugate acid, not the pKb of the base.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall the relationship between pKa and pKb. For a weak base, B, its pKb is defined as -log(Kb), and its conjugate acid, HB\u207a, will have a pKa = pKw - pKb, where pKw is 14 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nSo, at the equivalence point, the solution contains the conjugate acid HB\u207a, which is a weak acid, and its concentration determines the pH.\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point for a weak base-strong acid titration is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate acid:\n\npH = pKa + log([salt]/[acid]), but at the equivalence point, all base is converted to salt, so it's just the hydrolysis of the salt.\n\nWait, no. Actually, at the equivalence point, all the base has been converted to its conjugate acid.\n\nWait, no. In a weak base-strong acid titration, at the equivalence point, all the base has been converted to its conjugate acid.\n\nSo, the solution contains the conjugate acid, which is a weak acid, and it will hydrolyze to some extent, making the solution acidic.\n\nTherefore, the pH at the equivalence point should be less than 7.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect because it says pH = 7 at the equivalence point.\n\nOption D mentions pOH equals pKb at the equivalence point. I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, pOH = pKw - pH. At the equivalence point, pH < 7, so pOH > 7. But pKb of the base is a constant, so I don't think pOH equals pKb there.\n\nMaybe I need to calculate it.\n\nLet's consider a weak base with Kb = 10^-5, so pKb = 5.\n\nThen, its conjugate acid has pKa = 14 - 5 = 9.\n\nAt the equivalence point, the concentration of the conjugate acid is equal to the concentration of the salt formed.\n\nWait, actually, at the equivalence point, all base has been converted to its conjugate acid.\n\nSo, the solution contains only the conjugate acid, no remaining base.\n\nTherefore, it's a solution of a weak acid, and its pH can be approximated using the formula for a weak acid solution:\n\npH = pKa + log([salt]/[acid]), but since it's all converted to acid, [salt]/[acid] = 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. In a weak base-strong acid titration, at the equivalence point, all base has been converted to its conjugate acid, so it's just a solution of the conjugate acid.\n\nThe pH can be approximated as pH = pKa + log([salt]/[acid]), but since it's all acid, [salt]/[acid] = 0, which would make pH = pKa + log(0), which is undefined.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nActually, at the equivalence point, the number of moles of acid added equals the number of moles of base initially present.\n\nSo, if we have a weak base, say, NH\u2083, and we're titrating it with HCl, at the equivalence point, all NH\u2083 has been converted to NH\u2084\u207a.\n\nSo, the solution contains NH\u2084\u207a ions, which are weakly acidic.\n\nThe NH\u2084\u207a ion will hydrolyze:\n\nNH\u2084\u207a + H\u2082O \u21cc NH\u2083 + H\u2083O\u207a\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka = [H\u2083O\u207a][NH\u2083]/[NH\u2084\u207a] = Kw/Kb for NH\u2083.\n\nSo, Ka = 10^-14 / Kb.\n\nGiven that Kb for NH\u2083 is 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5, then Ka for NH\u2084\u207a is 10^-14 / (1.8 \u00d7 10^-5) \u2248 5.56 \u00d7 10^-10.\n\nNow, at the equivalence point, the concentration of NH\u2084\u207a is equal to the initial concentration of NH\u2083, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry.\n\nSo, we can set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis:\n\nLet's say initial [NH\u2084\u207a] = C M.\n\nThen, at equilibrium:\n\nNH\u2084\u207a \u21cc NH\u2083 + H\u2083O\u207a\n\nInitial: C M 0 M 0 M\n\nChange: -x M +x M +x M\n\nEquilibrium: (C - x) M x M x M\n\nAssuming x is small compared to C, we can approximate (C - x) \u2248 C.\n\nThen, Ka = [H\u2083O\u207a][NH\u2083]/[NH\u2084\u207a] = x\u00b2 / C = 5.56 \u00d7 10^-10.\n\nSo, x = [H\u2083O\u207a] = sqrt(Ka * C).\n\nTherefore, pH = -log(sqrt(Ka * C)) = -0.5 * (log(Ka) + log(C)).\n\nIf C is known, we can calculate pH.\n\nBut in general, for a weak base-strong acid titration, at the equivalence point, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate acid, and it's less than 7.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect because it says pH = 7 at the equivalence point, which is not the case for a weak base-strong acid titration.\n\nOption A seems to describe the typical titration curve: slow decrease initially due to buffering, then a rapid decrease near the equivalence point, and pH < 7 at the equivalence point.\n\nOption B says the pH gradually decreases throughout the experiment and is below 7 at the equivalence point. This is similar to option A but doesn't mention the rapid decrease near the equivalence point.\n\nOption D mentions pOH equals pKb at the equivalence point, which I don't think is correct based on the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be option A, as it describes the behavior of the pH during the titration accurately for a weak base-strong acid titration.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider another example.\n\nSuppose we have a weak base with Kb = 10^-3, then its conjugate acid has pKa = 11.\n\nAt the equivalence point, the solution contains the conjugate acid, which has Ka = 10^-11.\n\nIf the initial concentration of the base was 0.1 M, and we've added enough acid to convert all 0.1 M base to conjugate acid, then at the equivalence point, [conjugate acid] = 0.1 M.\n\nThen, the pH can be approximated using the Ka expression:\n\nKa = [H\u2083O\u207a][conjugate base]/[conjugate acid]\n\nAssuming [conjugate base] is negligible at equilibrium, we have:\n\n[H\u2083O\u207a] \u2248 sqrt(Ka * [conjugate acid]) = sqrt(10^-11 * 0.1) = sqrt(10^-12) = 10^-6 M\n\nTherefore, pH \u2248 6, which is less than 7, confirming that at the equivalence point, pH < 7.\n\nThus, option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
