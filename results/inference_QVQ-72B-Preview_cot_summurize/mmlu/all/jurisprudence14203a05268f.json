                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Dworkin's book \"Justice for Hedgehogs.\" I have to pick the statement that best describes one of his central arguments in this book. The options are:\n\nA. Morality plays no role in the concept of law.\n\nB. Moral arguments operate only in hard cases.\n\nC. The law dictates what moral values should affect our ethical behavior.\n\nD. Moral values are both independent and objective.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"Justice for Hedgehogs\" is about. I know that Dworkin is a prominent legal philosopher, and his work often deals with the relationship between law and morality. I remember that in this book, he explores the idea that morality is an objective reality, and that there are moral truths that exist independently of human beliefs or opinions.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that morality plays no role in the concept of law. This seems contrary to Dworkin's views because he is known for emphasizing the connection between law and morality. In fact, in his earlier work like \"Law's Empire,\" he argues that law is inherently moral and that judges should consider moral principles when making decisions. So, this option doesn't seem to align with his thoughts.\n\nOption B says that moral arguments operate only in hard cases. Again, Dworkin would probably disagree with this. He believes that moral considerations are present in all legal decisions, not just the difficult ones. His view is that law is interwoven with morality, and that every legal case involves some moral judgment. So, limiting moral arguments to only hard cases doesn't reflect his position.\n\nOption C states that the law dictates what moral values should affect our ethical behavior. This seems a bit tricky. Dworkin does believe that law and morality are connected, but I don't think he would say that law dictates moral values. Rather, he might argue that law reflects or incorporates certain moral values. But dictating moral values sounds too prescriptive, and it implies that law has the authority to define what is morally right or wrong, which might not be his exact position.\n\nOption D says that moral values are both independent and objective. This seems to resonate with Dworkin's views. In \"Justice for Hedgehogs,\" he defends the idea that moral values exist independently of human feelings or cultural practices and that they are objective truths. He argues against moral relativism and subjectivism,\u4e3b\u5f20\u9053\u5fb7\u771f\u7406\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4eba\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option D seems to be the best description of one of Dworkin's central arguments in \"Justice for Hedgehogs.\" He is known for his defense of moral realism, which holds that moral values are objective and independent of human sentiments or cultural contexts.\n\nJust to make sure, I should double-check if any of the other options could possibly be correct. For instance, maybe there's a specific argument in the book that could be interpreted differently. But from what I recall, Dworkin consistently maintains that morality is an objective part of the universe, much like facts about the physical world.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: Moral values are both independent and objective.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
