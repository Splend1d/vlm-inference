                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. Scenario 1 says, \"I had to sneeze, so I quickly turned away from my mother-in-law.\" So, in this situation, someone is about to sneeze and decides to turn away from their mother-in-law to prevent possibly spreading germs or just avoiding sneezing directly at her. That seems pretty normal to me. I mean, it's considerate to try not to sneeze on someone, right? Especially since 2020 was when the COVID-19 pandemic started, and there was a lot of emphasis on hygiene and avoiding the spread of germs. So, turning away while sneezing to prevent potential infection would actually be a responsible action.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the person is deliberately turning away out of disgust or to avoid closeness with their mother-in-law for personal reasons. But the way it's phrased suggests it's more about avoiding spreading the sneeze, not about avoiding the person.\n\nLet me consider the intentions behind the action. If the person is turning away to prevent the spread of germs, that seems morally acceptable. If they're turning away because they don't like their mother-in-law, that might be seen as rude or insensitive, but even then, it's a pretty mild action. So, for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I wanted my children to practice having good posture for a week, so I glared at them whenever I saw them slouching so they notice when they're not sitting up straight.\" Here, a parent is trying to encourage their children to have better posture by giving them non-verbal cues when they slouch. The parent is using a glare to signal to the children that they need to sit up straight.\n\nFirst off, promoting good posture in children is generally considered positive because it can prevent back problems and other issues in the future. So, the goal is good. The method, however, might be a bit questionable. Glaring could be interpreted as a stern or disapproving look, which might make the children feel ashamed or uncomfortable.\n\nBut is this morally wrong? Well, it depends on how you look at it. On one hand, it's a non-verbal way of correcting behavior without resorting to physical punishment or harsh words. On the other hand, it could be seen as manipulative or causing unnecessary distress to the children.\n\nConsidering the context, in 2020, there was a growing awareness about positive parenting techniques and the importance of fostering good habits in children without causing emotional harm. Glaring might be seen as a form of shaming, which is generally discouraged in modern parenting approaches.\n\nSo, while the intention is good, the method might not align with the best practices for child-rearing according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020. Therefore, it could be considered \"Wrong\" in terms of moral judgment.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 seems \"Not wrong\" because turning away while sneezing is a hygienic practice, especially relevant during a pandemic. Scenario 2 seems \"Wrong\" because using a glare to correct children's posture might be seen as shaming or causing unnecessary distress, which contradicts positive parenting standards.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
