                    "text": "So I have this question about meiosis, and I need to pick which statement is correct. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that the daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cells. Hmm, I think that's actually a characteristic of mitosis, not meiosis. In meiosis, we have crossing over and independent assortment, which lead to genetic variation in the daughter cells. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption B says that homologues pair during prophase II. Wait a minute, in meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair during prophase I, not during prophase II. Prophase II is more about the chromosomes condensing again after telophase I and cytokinesis. So, this seems incorrect too.\n\nOption C states that DNA replication occurs before meiosis I and meiosis II. I recall that DNA replicates only once, before meiosis I, during the interphase stage. After that, the cell goes through meiosis I and meiosis II without replicating DNA again. So, DNA replication doesn't occur before meiosis II; it's only before meiosis I. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nOption D says that the number of chromosomes is reduced. Yes, that's the whole point of meiosis. It's a reduction division where the chromosome number is halved, producing haploid cells from a diploid parent cell. So, this seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, and in meiosis II, sister chromatids separate, resulting in four haploid daughter cells. So, the chromosome number is indeed reduced by half compared to the parent cell.\n\nSo, based on this, option D is the correct statement about meiosis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
