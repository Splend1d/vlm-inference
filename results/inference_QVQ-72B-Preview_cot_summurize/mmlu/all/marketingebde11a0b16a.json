Let me explain why.\n\nFirst, micromarketing is all about tailoring marketing efforts to specific groups of people who behave similarly or have similar preferences. It's like dividing a big market into smaller segments and then creating customized marketing messages for each segment.\n\nOption A says \"have excess disposable income.\" While having disposable income might make someone a good target for certain products, micromarketing isn't just about income levels. It's about a combination of factors like interests, behaviors, demographics, and more.\n\nOption B is \"are between the ages of 8 and 14.\" Age can be a part of micromarketing segmentation, but it's too specific to say that micromarketing is only directed at this age group. Micromarketing can target any age group depending on the product or service.\n\nOption D says \"have opted out of customized marketing.\" This doesn't make much sense because if someone has opted out, marketers are not supposed to target them with customized marketing. So, micromarketing wouldn't be directed at people who have opted out.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. \"Share similar attitudes and behaviors.\" This aligns perfectly with the concept of micromarketing, which aims to reach consumers who are likely to respond similarly to marketing efforts based on their shared characteristics.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about an example. Suppose a company sells sports equipment. They might use micromarketing to target avid gym-goers who frequently purchase fitness gear. These individuals share similar behaviors (going to the gym regularly and buying fitness equipment) and possibly similar attitudes towards health and fitness.\n\nAnother example could be targeting readers who frequently buy books in a particular genre. These readers share a behavior (buying books) and possibly an attitude towards reading and specific types of stories.\n\nIn both cases, the key is that the target group shares similar attitudes and behaviors, making them a suitable audience for micromarketing campaigns.\n\nSo, to sum it up, micromarketing is directed at potential buyers who share similar attitudes and behaviors, which makes option C the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
