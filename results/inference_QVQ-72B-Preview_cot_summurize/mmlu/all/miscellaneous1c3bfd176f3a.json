                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of these holidays is not attached to a specific date? A. Independence Day, B. New Year's Day, C. Thanksgiving, D. Christmas.\" Hmm, interesting. I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that most holidays are celebrated on fixed dates every year. For example, Independence Day in the United States is on July 4th, and New Year's Day is on January 1st. Christmas is always on December 25th. So, those seem pretty set in stone. But what about Thanksgiving?\n\nLet me recall... Thanksgiving is a holiday that's celebrated in the United States, and I think it's in November. Wait, is it on a specific date, like November 24th or something? No, I don't think so. I think it's on the fourth Thursday of November. So, that means it's not on the same date every year, unlike the other holidays listed.\n\nLet me double-check that. If Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, then its date can vary from year to year depending on how the calendar falls. For instance, November has 30 days, so the Thursdays fall on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th. So, the fourth Thursday would be the 22nd, but that's not a fixed date across all years. In fact, November 22nd is sometimes the 21st or the 23rd depending on the year.\n\nWait, no, actually, November has 30 days, so the Thursdays are always on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th. So, the fourth Thursday is always November 22nd. Is that right?\n\nHold on, but I think some years November has five Thursdays. Wait, no, November always has exactly four Thursdays, because there are 30 days and seven days in a week, so four weeks times seven is 28 days, plus two extra days. So, if November starts on a Tuesday, for example, then the Thursdays would be on the 2nd, 9th, 16th, and 23rd. So, the fourth Thursday would be the 23rd in that case.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. If November starts on a Monday, then the Thursdays are on the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th. So, the fourth Thursday is November 26th. If November starts on a Tuesday, Thursdays are on the 2nd, 9th, 16th, and 23rd. So, the fourth Thursday is November 23rd. Similarly, if November starts on a Wednesday, Thursdays are on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd, making the fourth Thursday November 22nd.\n\nSo, depending on the starting day of November, the date of the fourth Thursday can be the 22nd, 23rd, or 24th. It's not a fixed date like July 4th or December 25th.\n\nTherefore, Thanksgiving is not attached to a specific date, unlike Independence Day, New Year's Day, and Christmas, which are all celebrated on the same date every year.\n\nI think the answer is C. Thanksgiving.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider if there are any other holidays among the options that might not be on a specific date. Independence Day is always on July 4th, New Year's Day is always on January 1st, and Christmas is always on December 25th. So, none of them vary in date from year to year.\n\nThanksgiving, as I've thought through, can fall on different dates depending on the year, specifically the fourth Thursday in November, which can be the 22nd, 23rd, or 24th.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Thanksgiving.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Thanksgiving}} \\]"
