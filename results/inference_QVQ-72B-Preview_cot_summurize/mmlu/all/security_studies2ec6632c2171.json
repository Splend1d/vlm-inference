It seems like there are different perspectives on how to distinguish between these two approaches. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. It also mentions that coercive diplomacy fails if the coercer doesn't achieve its goals and doesn't defeat its adversary in the second stage. Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. Coercive diplomacy involves using the threat or limited use of force to influence another state's behavior without resorting to full-scale war. So, the distinction between limited and full-scale force should be about the degree and intensity of military action, not necessarily about the stages of diplomacy.\n\nOption B suggests that generally, the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. It also mentions that resorting to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Moreover, it states that military action always results from a failure of negotiations and a shift from diplomatic to military spheres. While it's true that military action often follows diplomatic failures, I'm not sure if the distinction between different types of force is negligible. For example, air strikes might be seen as limited compared to a full ground invasion.\n\nOption C emphasizes that the distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force used defines the type of outcome achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then limited force has been employed. This seems plausible. Coercive diplomacy aims to achieve objectives through the threatened or limited use of force, hoping to avoid escalating to full-scale war. So, if the coercer can achieve its goals with minimal force, that would be a successful case of limited force.\n\nOption D argues that the distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resorting to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. It also mentions that the distinction isn't based on the amount of force or the type but on the purpose of the force and the element of choice left to the adversary. Essentially, limited force is seen as a bargaining tool. This also makes sense because in coercive diplomacy, the goal is to influence the adversary's decisions without engaging in all-out war.\n\nBetween options C and D, both make valid points. Option C focuses on the outcome: if the coercer achieves its goals with limited force, it's a success. Option D emphasizes the purpose and the adversary's choice: limited force is used to influence the adversary's decisions, whereas full-scale force is used to impose a solution.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that the distinction between limited and full-scale force is about the intensity and scope of military action, as well as the objectives behind it. Coercive diplomacy relies on limited force to send a signal or to apply pressure without escalating to war. Full-scale force, on the other hand, involves a much larger commitment of military resources and aims to decisively defeat the adversary.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is Option D, as it directly addresses the distinction based on the purpose of the force and the choices left to the adversary. It also highlights that limited force is a bargaining tool, which aligns with the concept of coercive diplomacy.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option C seems to suggest that if a positive policy outcome is achieved, limited force has been employed. That seems reasonable, but it doesn't fully capture the essence of the distinction between limited and full-scale force. It's possible to achieve objectives with full-scale force as well, but that's not the point of coercive diplomacy.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, focuses on the nature of the force used and the adversary's ability to make choices, which is crucial in coercive diplomacy. It's about influencing the adversary's decisions rather than imposing a solution through overwhelming force.\n\nTherefore, I believe Option D provides a more comprehensive understanding of the distinction between limited force and full-scale force in the context of coercive diplomacy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
