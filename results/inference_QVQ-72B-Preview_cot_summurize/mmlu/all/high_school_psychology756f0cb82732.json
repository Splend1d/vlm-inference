I need to figure out which psychological concept this approach relates to from the options given: foot-in-the-door, mere-exposure effect, central route of persuasion, or pluralistic ignorance.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, the foot-in-the-door technique. I remember that this is when someone asks for a small favor first and, once that's granted, asks for a bigger favor. I don't think that's what's happening here with the cookies. She's just giving out cookies with her campaign message, not asking for any particular favor beyond the vote.\n\nNext, the mere-exposure effect. This is the idea that people tend to develop a preference for things they are familiar with. By giving out cookies with her name on them, Edy might be increasing her visibility and familiarity among the students. So, seeing her name repeatedly on the cookies could make students more inclined to vote for her because they're more familiar with her name.\n\nThen, the central route of persuasion. This involves presenting logical and compelling arguments to change someone's attitude or behavior. Giving out cookies with her name on them doesn't seem like it's providing any substantive arguments or information about her platform. It's more of a promotional item rather than a detailed argument for why she should be elected.\n\nLastly, pluralistic ignorance. This is a concept where people incorrectly perceive the opinions of others, thinking that their own views are less common than they actually are. I don't see how giving out cookies directly relates to this. Pluralistic ignorance is more about misperceptions of social norms and opinions, not about promotional campaign materials.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, the mere-exposure effect seems to be the most fitting reason why Edy's approach might improve her chances in the election. By increasing her name recognition and familiarity through the cookies, she could be fostering a positive inclination among the students to vote for her, simply because they've seen her name more often.\n\nI think the answer is B. mere-exposure effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
