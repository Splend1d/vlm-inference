                    "text": "So I have this question about calcium metabolism, and I need to figure out which of these statements is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst option: Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium.\n\nHmm, I thought calcitonin does the opposite. Doesn't it help lower blood calcium levels? Let me recall. Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, and I think it's involved in regulating calcium levels by reducing bone breakdown. So, if anything, it should cause a decrease in plasma calcium, not an increase. Maybe this option is false.\n\nSecond option: Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic.\n\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) is crucial for regulating calcium levels. Hyperparathyroidism means there's too much PTH being produced by the parathyroid glands. This can lead to high blood calcium levels, which can cause various symptoms like bone pain, kidney stones, and digestive issues. But I've heard that many cases are actually asymptomatic, especially in the early stages. People might not even know they have it until it's detected through blood tests. So, this seems plausible.\n\nThird option: Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands.\n\nWait a minute, I thought vitamin D is produced in the skin when exposed to sunlight, and then activated in the liver and kidneys. The parathyroid glands are involved in producing PTH, not vitamin D. So, this doesn't seem right. Maybe this is another false statement.\n\nFourth option: Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n\nHypercalcaemia is high calcium in the blood, which can be caused by things like hyperparathyroidism or certain cancers. Symptoms can include fatigue, confusion, nausea, and frequent urination. Oliguria is reduced urine output, which seems counterintuitive for hypercalcaemia. I think hypercalcaemia can lead to polyuria, which is increased urine output, not decreased. So, oliguria might not be a typical symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n\nBased on my reasoning, it seems like option B\u2014primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic\u2014is the correct statement. The others appear to be incorrect based on my understanding of calcium metabolism.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check quickly. Calcitonin does indeed lower blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption. Hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic, especially in mild cases. Vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands; it's primarily produced in the skin and activated in the liver and kidneys. And oliguria isn't a typical symptom of hypercalcaemia; in fact, polyuria is more common due to calcium's effect on kidney function.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
