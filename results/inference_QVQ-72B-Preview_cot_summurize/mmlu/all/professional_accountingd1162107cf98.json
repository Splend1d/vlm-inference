                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a company that bought a piece of land for $100,000 in year 1. At the end of year 1, the land's fair value dropped to $90,000, and they revalued it to that amount. Then, at the end of year 2, the fair value went up to $105,000. They're using the revaluation model under IFRS for this class of assets. I need to figure out how to account for the change in fair value in year 2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the revaluation model under IFRS entails. IFRS allows companies to revalue certain assets to their fair value, and the revaluation adjustments are typically recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except for certain situations where they might be recognized in profit or loss.\n\nSo, starting point: land was bought for $100,000. At the end of year 1, its fair value is $90,000. That means there was a $10,000 decrease in value. Under the revaluation model, this decrease would be recognized in other comprehensive income, right? So, the carrying amount is adjusted to $90,000, and the $10,000 difference goes to other comprehensive income.\n\nNow, at the end of year 2, the fair value increases to $105,000. So, from the carrying amount of $90,000 to $105,000, that's a $15,000 increase. The question is, how should this $15,000 increase be accounted for?\n\nOption A says recognize $10,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nOption B says recognize $15,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nOption C says recognize $15,000 in profit or loss.\n\nOption D says recognize $10,000 in profit or loss and $5,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that under the revaluation model, increases or decreases in the carrying amount of an asset are generally recognized in other comprehensive income. But there might be exceptions, especially if the asset is subsequently sold or there are specific standards that dictate otherwise.\n\nLet me consider IAS 16, which deals with property, plant, and equipment. Under IAS 16, when the revaluation model is used, revaluations are supposed to be carried out with changes in revaluation surplus being taken to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under revaluation surplus, except to the extent that the increase reverses a prior revaluation decrease of the same asset that was previously recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWait a minute, so if there was a prior decrease recognized in other comprehensive income, and now there's an increase, how does that work?\n\nLet me look at the example:\n\n- Original cost: $100,000\n\n- End of year 1: fair value $90,000\n\n- End of year 2: fair value $105,000\n\nSo, year 1 had a $10,000 decrease, recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nYear 2 has a $15,000 increase.\n\nDoes this $15,000 increase reverse the previous $10,000 decrease and then some?\n\nYes, it does. The $15,000 increase includes reversing the $10,000 decrease and an additional $5,000 increase.\n\nAccording to IAS 16, when a revaluation increase reverses a prior revaluation decrease of the same asset that was previously recognized in profit or loss, that part of the increase should be recognized in profit or loss.\n\nBut in this case, the prior $10,000 decrease was recognized in other comprehensive income, not in profit or loss.\n\nSo, does that mean the entire $15,000 increase should be recognized in other comprehensive income?\n\nOption B suggests recognizing $15,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nBut wait, is there any part of this increase that should go to profit or loss?\n\nLet me check again.\n\nIAS 16 states that increases or decreases in the carrying amount resulting from a revaluation should be recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under revaluation surplus, except to the extent that the increase reverses a prior revaluation decrease of the same asset that was previously recognized in profit or loss.\n\nIn this scenario, the prior revaluation decrease was recognized in other comprehensive income, not in profit or loss.\n\nTherefore, the subsequent revaluation increase should be recognized in other comprehensive income as well.\n\nSo, the entire $15,000 increase should go to other comprehensive income.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: recognize $15,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternative thinking: maybe there's a component that should go to profit or loss if it reverses a previous decrease that was recognized in profit or loss, but in this case, the previous decrease was recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nSo, no, I don't think any part of the increase should be recognized in profit or loss.\n\nHence, the answer should be Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
