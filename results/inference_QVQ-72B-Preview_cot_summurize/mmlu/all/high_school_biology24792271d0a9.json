                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"A feature of amino acids NOT found in carbohydrates is the presence of which atom?\" And the options are carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, or hydrogen. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that amino acids and carbohydrates are both organic molecules, but they have different structures and functions in living organisms. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, while carbohydrates are primarily used for energy storage and structure in cells.\n\nLet me recall the basic structures of these molecules.\n\nStarting with amino acids: They consist of a central carbon atom (the alpha carbon) that is bonded to four groups: an amino group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a variable side chain (R group). The amino group contains nitrogen, and the carboxyl group contains both oxygen and carbon.\n\nSo, in amino acids, we have carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms.\n\nNow, moving on to carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The ratio of carbon to oxygen to hydrogen is typically (CH2O)n, where n is the number of repeating units. They can be simple, like monosaccharides (single sugars like glucose), or complex, like polysaccharides (long chains of sugars like starch or cellulose).\n\nIn carbohydrates, the primary atoms are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Unlike amino acids, nitrogen is not typically present in carbohydrates.\n\nWait a minute, is there any exception where carbohydrates do contain nitrogen? I think some modified carbohydrates or nucleic acids might have nitrogen, but generally speaking, carbohydrates are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen only.\n\nSo, based on this, the feature that amino acids have which carbohydrates do not is the presence of nitrogen atoms.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I look at the formula of a simple sugar like glucose, it's C6H12O6\u2014no nitrogen there. Similarly, in fructose or galactose, same formula, no nitrogen. In more complex carbohydrates like starch or cellulose, which are polymers of glucose, nitrogen still isn't present.\n\nOn the other hand, in amino acids, the amino group (-NH2) contains nitrogen, and this is a key component that distinguishes amino acids from carbohydrates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be nitrogen atoms.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any carbohydrates that do contain nitrogen. I recall that some amino sugars like glucosamine and galactosamine do contain nitrogen, but they are derived from amino acids and are part of more complex molecular structures, such as glycoproteins or glycosaminoglycans. However, these are exceptions rather than the rule, and generally, carbohydrates do not contain nitrogen.\n\nSo, in the context of this question, which is likely referring to the general structures of amino acids and carbohydrates, the presence of nitrogen atoms is a feature unique to amino acids.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. nitrogen atoms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
