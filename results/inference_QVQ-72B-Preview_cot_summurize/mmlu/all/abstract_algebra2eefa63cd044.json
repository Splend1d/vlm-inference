                    "text": "So I have this problem here about irreducibility of polynomials. The statements are:\n\nStatement 1: \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nStatement 2: \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nAnd I need to determine whether these statements are true or false.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a polynomial to be irreducible. In general, a polynomial is irreducible over a field if it cannot be expressed as a product of two non-constant polynomials with coefficients in that field.\n\nBut here, we're dealing with polynomials over integers (\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)) and rationals (\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)). Let's consider each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement 1: \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).**\n\nSo, we need to check if \\(4x - 2\\) can be factored into non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nFirst, let's see if this polynomial can be factored in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\).\n\n\\(4x - 2 = 2(2x - 1)\\).\n\nHere, both 2 and \\(2x - 1\\) are non-constant polynomials in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\). Wait, no, 2 is a constant polynomial, but \\(2x - 1\\) is non-constant.\n\nActually, I think there's a misunderstanding. In \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\), a polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nIn this case, \\(4x - 2 = 2(2x - 1)\\), but 2 is a unit in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) because it has a multiplicative inverse in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), but not in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). However, in the context of \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\), units are the constant polynomials that are units in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), which are 1 and -1.\n\nSo, 2 is not a unit in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), but in the factorization above, it seems like a constant factor.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nIn \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\), a polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nNow, \\(4x - 2 = 2(2x - 1)\\), and both 2 and \\(2x - 1\\) are in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\). However, 2 is a constant polynomial, so this factorization includes a constant factor, which is allowed in the definition of irreducibility.\n\nWait, no. In the definition of irreducibility in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\), a non-zero, non-unit polynomial \\(f(x)\\) is irreducible if whenever \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\), with \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\), then either \\(g(x)\\) or \\(h(x)\\) is a unit in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(4x - 2 = 2(2x - 1)\\). Here, 2 is not a unit in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) because units in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) are the constants that are units in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), i.e., 1 and -1. So, 2 is not a unit, and \\(2x - 1\\) is not a unit either.\n\nTherefore, \\(4x - 2\\) can be factored into two non-constant polynomials in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\), which are 2 and \\(2x - 1\\), where neither is a unit. This means \\(4x - 2\\) is reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nWait, but 2 is a constant, so is this allowed? I think in the definition of irreducibility, if a polynomial can be factored into a unit and another polynomial, it's still considered irreducible. But in this case, 2 is not a unit in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\), so this is a proper factorization into two non-unit polynomials.\n\nTherefore, \\(4x - 2\\) is reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). So, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2: \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).**\n\nNow, we need to check if \\(4x - 2\\) can be factored into non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nFirst, \\(4x - 2 = 4(x - \\frac{1}{2})\\).\n\nHere, 4 is a constant, and \\(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\) is linear. Is there another way to factor \\(4x - 2\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)?\n\nWell, any factorization would involve writing \\(4x - 2\\) as a product of polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nSuppose \\(4x - 2 = a(x)b(x)\\), where \\(a(x)\\) and \\(b(x)\\) are non-constant polynomials in \\(\\mathbb{Q}[x]\\).\n\nBut \\(4x - 2\\) is a linear polynomial, so its degree is 1. The only way to factor it into two non-constant polynomials would be to factor it into a constant and a linear polynomial, or into a linear and a constant.\n\nIn \\(\\mathbb{Q}[x]\\), constants are units, so factoring out a constant is allowed and doesn't make the polynomial reducible.\n\nTherefore, in \\(\\mathbb{Q}[x]\\), \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible because any factorization involves a unit (a non-zero constant) and another polynomial.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
