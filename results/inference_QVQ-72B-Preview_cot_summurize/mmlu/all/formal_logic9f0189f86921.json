                    "text": "Let's see. I have this sentence: \"Brittany likes fish and lizards, but not cats.\" And I need to find which logical formula best represents this statement from the options given. The options are in propositional logic (PL), using symbols F, L, and C, which I assume stand for \"Brittany likes fish,\" \"Brittany likes lizards,\" and \"Brittany likes cats,\" respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its components:\n\n1. Brittany likes fish.\n\n2. Brittany likes lizards.\n\n3. Brittany does not like cats.\n\nThe conjunction \"and\" suggests that the first two statements are both true, and \"but\" indicates a contrast, meaning she does not like cats.\n\nIn propositional logic, we use logical connectives to combine propositions. The ones relevant here are conjunction (\u2022) and negation (~). So, liking fish and liking lizards should be connected with a conjunction, and disliking cats would be represented by the negation of C.\n\nLooking at option A: F \u2022 L \u2022 ~C\n\nThis seems to suggest that all three propositions are conjoined together. However, the original sentence has a \"but,\" which might indicate that the negation applies specifically to cats, but perhaps not directly connected to the previous parts. But in logical terms, \"and\" and \"but\" can both be translated as conjunctions, with \"but\" often implying contrast.\n\nOption B: (F \u2022 L) \u2022 ~C\n\nThis groups the liking of fish and lizards together first, then conjoins that with the negation of liking cats. This seems to capture the meaning of the original sentence more accurately, as it groups the positive likes together and then combines that with the dislike of cats.\n\nOption C: (F \u2022 L) \u2228 ~C\n\nThis uses a disjunction (\u2228) instead of a conjunction. It would mean that either Brittany likes fish and lizards, or she does not like cats, or both. However, the original sentence seems to suggest that she likes fish and lizards and does not like cats, without implying an exclusive choice.\n\nOption D: C \u2022 (F \u2022 L)\n\nThis places the liking of cats conjunctively with the liking of fish and lizards, which contradicts the original sentence that says she does not like cats.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems to be the most accurate representation of the original sentence.\n\nWait a minute, but in option A, F \u2022 L \u2022 ~C, does this mean the same as option B? In propositional logic, conjunctions are associative, but the grouping matters when other connectives are involved. However, in this case, since all are conjunctions, F \u2022 L \u2022 ~C is equivalent to (F \u2022 L) \u2022 ~C. So, options A and B are effectively the same in meaning.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, both options A and B express the same logical proposition. Maybe the parentheses are just for clarity.\n\nBut option D is clearly different and incorrect because it suggests that Brittany likes cats conjunctively with liking fish and lizards, which is the opposite of what the sentence says.\n\nOption C uses a disjunction, which changes the meaning significantly, as it would allow for the possibility that she neither likes fish and lizards nor likes cats, which isn't suggested by the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, between options A and B, both seem correct, but option B is clearer in its grouping, making it easier to see the relationship between the propositions.\n\nWait, but in propositional logic, multiple conjunctions without parentheses are still considered to be conjoined together. So, F \u2022 L \u2022 ~C is logically equivalent to (F \u2022 L) \u2022 ~C, because conjunction is associative. So, both A and B are equivalent.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is option B, as it explicitly groups the liking of fish and lizards together, which matches the sentence structure more closely.\n\nOption A, while logically equivalent, might be considered less clear because it lacks the parentheses that highlight the grouping of propositions.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence is option B: (F \u2022 L) \u2022 ~C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
