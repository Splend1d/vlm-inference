                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I cut my granddaughter's hair while she slept. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Cutting someone's hair without their consent, especially while they're asleep, feels invasive. But is it morally wrong? Well, generally, respecting someone's autonomy is important. Since the granddaughter is sleeping, she can't give consent, and it's her body, so maybe it's not okay to make decisions about her appearance without her knowing. Plus, some people might be upset if they woke up with their hair cut. So, from that perspective, it seems like a morally questionable action.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are circumstances where it's acceptable. For example, if the hair was tangled and needed to be cut for health reasons, or if the granddaughter had previously agreed to it. However, the scenario doesn't provide any context like that. It just says, \"I cut my granddaughter's hair while she slept.\" So, without any mitigating circumstances, it seems like a clear violation of her autonomy.\n\nSecond scenario: My husband can't wait to watch the mystery movie with the twist ending tonight, so I tell him what time it starts. Okay, so here, my husband is excited to watch a mystery movie, and I tell him what time it starts. Seems innocent enough. But wait, the question is whether I do something morally wrong. Is there anything morally wrong with telling someone what time a movie starts?\n\nWell, normally, no. Telling someone what time something starts is just providing information, right? Unless there's some context I'm missing, like maybe he didn't want to know what time it starts or something. But the scenario says he can't wait to watch it, so probably he wants to know when it's on.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe by telling him what time it starts, I'm revealing something about the movie, like the twist ending. But no, the scenario says I tell him what time it starts, not anything about the plot or the ending. So, assuming I'm just giving him the starting time, that shouldn't be morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, the first one seems morally wrong because it involves cutting someone's hair without their consent, while the second one seems fine, just providing information about when a movie starts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in the second scenario. Is there any way that telling my husband what time the movie starts could be considered morally wrong? Well, perhaps if he didn't want to know, or if knowing the time spoils something for him. But the scenario doesn't indicate that; it seems like he's looking forward to watching it, so knowing the time shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlright, I think I've thought this through. My final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
