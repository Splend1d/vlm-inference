                    "text": "Let's tackle this NMR problem. So, I have the 13C chemical shifts for benzene and chloroform: benzene is 128.4 ppm and chloroform is 77.2 ppm. I need to find the difference in their 13C NMR frequencies on a 600 MHz spectrometer. The options are A. 7.73 kHz, B. 30.7 kHz, C. 91.6 kHz, and D. 122 kHz.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what ppm stands for in this context. Ppm means parts per million, which is a unitless measure often used in NMR spectroscopy to express chemical shifts. It's based on a scale where the frequency of the nucleus being observed (here, 13C) is referenced to a standard substance (usually tetramethylsilane, TMS, assigned 0 ppm).\n\nSo, the chemical shift in ppm tells me how much the resonance frequency of a particular carbon atom is shifted relative to the standard.\n\nNow, I have a 600 MHz spectrometer. MHz stands for megahertz, which is a unit of frequency (1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz). In NMR, the operating frequency of the spectrometer corresponds to the Larmor frequency of the nucleus being studied in a magnetic field of a certain strength.\n\nFor 13C, the gyromagnetic ratio is such that in a 14.09 Tesla magnetic field, the Larmor frequency is approximately 600 MHz.\n\nBut I don't need to worry too much about the physics behind it right now. The key point is that the chemical shift in ppm can be converted to a frequency difference in Hz (or kHz) at a given spectrometer frequency.\n\nThe formula to convert ppm to Hz is:\n\n\u0394\u03bd (Hz) = (\u0394\u03b4 / \u03b4ref) * \u03bd0\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u0394\u03bd is the frequency difference in Hz\n\n- \u0394\u03b4 is the difference in chemical shifts in ppm\n\n- \u03b4ref is the reference chemical shift (usually 0 ppm for TMS)\n\n- \u03bd0 is the spectrometer frequency in Hz\n\nBut since \u03b4ref is 0 ppm, the formula simplifies to:\n\n\u0394\u03bd (Hz) = \u0394\u03b4 * \u03bd0\n\nWait, is that right? If \u03b4ref is 0, then \u0394\u03b4 is just the difference between the two chemical shifts.\n\nSo, first I need to calculate the difference in ppm between benzene and chloroform.\n\n\u0394\u03b4 = 128.4 ppm - 77.2 ppm = 51.2 ppm\n\nThen, the frequency difference is:\n\n\u0394\u03bd (Hz) = 51.2 ppm * 600 MHz\n\nBut I need to make sure that the units are consistent. 600 MHz is 600 million Hz.\n\nSo, \u0394\u03bd (Hz) = 51.2 * 600,000,000 Hz = 30,720,000 Hz\n\nThat seems way too high. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again. In NMR, the frequency corresponding to 1 ppm is not equal to \u03bd0, but rather to \u03bd0 divided by some factor. I recall that for 1H NMR, the frequency per ppm is \u03bd0 Hz per ppm, meaning that 1 ppm corresponds to \u03bd0 Hz.\n\nBut for 13C, I think it's similar. So, 1 ppm corresponds to \u03bd0 Hz for the carbon nucleus.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for any nucleus, 1 ppm corresponds to \u03bd0 Hz at a given magnetic field strength.\n\nBut in practice, for 13C, the frequency scale is directly proportional to the spectrometer frequency.\n\nSo, if the spectrometer is 600 MHz, then 1 ppm corresponds to 600 kHz.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLet me check. If TMS is at 0 ppm, and another carbon is at 1 ppm, then its frequency is 600 kHz higher than TMS.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, 1 ppm corresponds to 600 kHz on a 600 MHz spectrometer.\n\nTherefore, for a difference of 51.2 ppm, the frequency difference should be 51.2 * 600 kHz.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n51.2 * 600 = 30,720 kHz\n\nBut 30,720 kHz is 30.72 MHz, which seems too high. Maybe I'm misremembering the conversion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 1 ppm corresponds to \u03bd0 Hz, not kHz.\n\nWait, \u03bd0 is in MHz, and ppm is dimensionless, so 1 ppm corresponds to \u03bd0 Hz.\n\nGiven that, for a 600 MHz spectrometer, 1 ppm corresponds to 600 Hz.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for 1H, which is more common, 1 ppm is 600 Hz on a 600 MHz spectrometer.\n\nSimilarly, for 13C, it should be the same.\n\nSo, 1 ppm = 600 Hz\n\nTherefore, for a difference of 51.2 ppm, the frequency difference is 51.2 * 600 Hz = 30,720 Hz = 30.72 kHz\n\nLooking at the options, B. 30.7 kHz matches this calculation.\n\nBut wait, I have another thought. Maybe for 13C, the scaling is different from 1H.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nI found that for 13C NMR, on a 600 MHz spectrometer, the frequency scale is indeed in Hz per ppm.\n\nSo, 1 ppm corresponds to 600 Hz.\n\nTherefore, for a difference of 51.2 ppm, the frequency difference is 51.2 * 600 Hz = 30,720 Hz, which is 30.72 kHz.\n\nSo, option B. 30.7 kHz seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor to consider.\n\nIs the gyromagnetic ratio of 13C different from that of 1H, and does that affect the frequency per ppm?\n\nYes, the gyromagnetic ratio of 13C is different from that of 1H, but in NMR spectrometers, the frequency is scaled accordingly.\n\nIn practice, for a 600 MHz proton spectrometer, the carbon frequency is around 150 MHz, but modern instruments can adjust for this.\n\nAlternatively, there are dedicated carbon spectrometers that operate at their own Larmor frequencies.\n\nBut in any case, the chemical shift in ppm is universal, and the frequency difference is proportional to the spectrometer frequency.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the actual carbon frequency.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the carbon frequency, not the proton frequency.\n\nLet me check.\n\nFor a 600 MHz proton spectrometer, the magnetic field is such that protons resonate at 600 MHz.\n\nFor 13C, the Larmor frequency is lower, approximately 150 MHz at the same field.\n\nSo, if I'm using a 600 MHz proton spectrometer to measure carbon, the carbon frequency is about 150 MHz.\n\nIn that case, would the frequency difference be based on the carbon frequency or the proton frequency?\n\nI think it's based on the carbon frequency.\n\nSo, if the spectrometer is set to measure carbon at 150 MHz, then 1 ppm corresponds to 150 Hz.\n\nTherefore, for a difference of 51.2 ppm, the frequency difference would be 51.2 * 150 Hz = 7,680 Hz = 7.68 kHz.\n\nThat would correspond to option A. 7.73 kHz.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 30.7 kHz, assuming the spectrometer frequency is 600 MHz for carbon.\n\nClearly, there's confusion here.\n\nI need to clarify which frequency to use.\n\nUpon checking, I find that for a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer, it typically operates at around 150 MHz for 13C.\n\nSo, the carbon frequency is about 150 MHz.\n\nTherefore, for 13C NMR, 1 ppm corresponds to 150 Hz.\n\nThus, for a difference of 51.2 ppm, the frequency difference is 51.2 * 150 Hz = 7,680 Hz, which is approximately 7.7 kHz.\n\nThis matches option A. 7.73 kHz.\n\nWait, but the question mentions a \"600 MHz spectrometer.\" Does that refer to proton frequency or carbon frequency?\n\nI think in NMR terminology, the spectrometer frequency is usually referred to as the proton frequency.\n\nSo, a 600 MHz spectrometer means it's a proton frequency of 600 MHz, and the corresponding carbon frequency is about 150 MHz.\n\nTherefore, the frequency difference for carbon should be based on the carbon frequency, which is 150 MHz.\n\nThus, 1 ppm corresponds to 150 Hz, and for 51.2 ppm, it's 51.2 * 150 Hz = 7,680 Hz, which is approximately 7.7 kHz.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 7.73 kHz.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought it was 30.7 kHz, assuming the spectrometer frequency was for carbon.\n\nPerhaps I need to confirm the relationship between proton and carbon frequencies.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nYes, for a given magnetic field, the Larmor frequency for 13C is approximately one-fourth that of 1H.\n\nSo, if proton frequency is 600 MHz, carbon frequency is approximately 150 MHz.\n\nTherefore, the frequency difference for carbon would indeed be based on 150 MHz, not 600 MHz.\n\nThus, 1 ppm corresponds to 150 Hz, and for 51.2 ppm, it's 51.2 * 150 Hz = 7,680 Hz, which is about 7.7 kHz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 7.73 kHz.\n\nI must remember that in NMR, the spectrometer frequency refers to the proton frequency, and the carbon frequency is scaled accordingly.\n\nThis was a good reminder to consider the specific nucleus being observed and its corresponding frequency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 7.73 \\ \\text{kHz}} \\]"
