                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about interbreeding between anatomically modern humans and Neandertals. It's asking which option is evidence for that interbreeding. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nOption A says that all modern humans share a major percentage of their genome with Neandertals. Hmm, I thought that only some modern humans have Neandertal DNA, not all of them. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me think.\n\nOption B says that all Neandertals share a major percentage of their genome with modern humans. This seems similar to option A but phrased differently. It's about Neandertals sharing DNA with modern humans. I'm not sure if that directly proves interbreeding.\n\nOption C says that a small but significant percentage of the genome of modern humans who trace their ancestry to Europe and Asia originated with Neandertals. This sounds more specific and seems to suggest that only certain modern humans have Neandertal DNA, specifically those from Europe and Asia. That makes sense because Neandertals were primarily in Europe and Western Asia.\n\nOption D says that a small but significant percentage of the genome of Neandertals is found in anatomically modern humans who trace their ancestry to Africa. Wait, Neandertals were separate from modern humans in Africa, so I'm not sure if this is correct. I think modern humans in Africa don't have Neandertal DNA because Neandertals were mostly in Europe and Asia, and modern humans evolved separately in Africa.\n\nOkay, so based on what I know, option C seems the most accurate. It suggests that some modern humans, specifically those with ancestry from Europe and Asia, have a small but significant amount of Neandertal DNA, which is evidence of interbreeding between modern humans and Neandertals.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that when the Neandertal genome was sequenced, it was found that non-African modern humans have between 1-4% Neandertal DNA, whereas African modern humans have very little to none. This suggests that interbreeding occurred when modern humans left Africa and came into contact with Neandertals in Europe and Asia.\n\nSo, option C aligns with this information. It's specifically mentioning modern humans who trace their ancestry to Europe and Asia having Neandertal DNA, which is a result of interbreeding between modern humans and Neandertals.\n\nOption A says \"all modern humans share a major percentage of their genome with Neandertals.\" This seems exaggerated. While there is some shared DNA due to common ancestry, saying \"major percentage\" might not be accurate, especially for African modern humans who have minimal Neandertal DNA.\n\nOption B says \"all Neandertals share a major percentage of their genome with modern humans.\" This is similar to option A but from the perspective of Neandertals. Again, while there is some shared DNA, calling it a \"major percentage\" might not be correct, and it doesn't directly prove interbreeding.\n\nOption D suggests that some Neandertal DNA is found in modern humans from Africa, which I think is incorrect because Neandertals and early modern humans in Africa were separate lineages with little to no interbreeding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: a small but significant percentage of the genome of modern humans who trace their ancestry to Europe and Asia originated with Neandertals.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any recent research that might change this understanding. As of my knowledge, the consensus is that non-African modern humans have some Neandertal ancestry due to interbreeding, whereas African modern humans do not show significant Neandertal DNA, suggesting that interbreeding occurred outside of Africa.\n\nSo, option C is the best choice here as it accurately reflects the current scientific understanding of the genetic relationship between modern humans and Neandertals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
