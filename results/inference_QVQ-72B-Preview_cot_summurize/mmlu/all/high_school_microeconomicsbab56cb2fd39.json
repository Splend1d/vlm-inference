                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about a perfectly competitive firm that experiences a technological innovation, which increases its marginal physical product. I need to figure out what happens to employment and wages as a result of this innovation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about perfect competition. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers for both their output and inputs like labor. That means they can't set their own prices; they have to accept the market price for what they sell and what they buy (like labor).\n\nSo, for the goods they sell, the price is fixed by the market, and similarly, the wage rate they pay to their workers is also fixed by the market.\n\nNow, marginal physical product (MPP) is the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of labor. If there's a technological innovation that significantly raises the firm's MPP, that means each worker can produce more output now.\n\nSince the firm is a price taker in the output market, the revenue per unit of output remains constant. So, with higher output per worker, each worker now generates more revenue.\n\nThis should increase the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor for the firm. MRP is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker, which is equal to the marginal physical product multiplied by the price of the output.\n\nSo, MRP = MPP * Price.\n\nIf MPP increases due to technological innovation, and the price is constant, then MRP increases.\n\nNow, in perfect competition, firms hire workers up to the point where MRP equals the wage rate (W). That is, they set the quantity of labor where MRP = W.\n\nIf MRP increases because of higher MPP, then the firm would want to hire more workers until MRP equals W again.\n\nWait a minute, but if the wage rate is fixed by the market, and MRP increases due to higher MPP, then at the current employment level, MRP > W, which means the firm can benefit by hiring more workers.\n\nSo, the firm should hire more workers to equalize MRP and W.\n\nBut what about the wage rate? In perfect competition, the wage rate is determined by the market supply and demand for labor, not by individual firms.\n\nSo, if one firm hires more workers, but assuming that other firms haven't changed their technology or MPP, the market wage rate shouldn't change immediately.\n\nBut in reality, if one firm hires more workers, it might bid up wages slightly, but in perfect competition with many firms, the impact of one firm's hiring decision on the wage rate is negligible.\n\nTherefore, the wage rate should remain the same in the short run.\n\nGiven that, the firm would hire more workers until MRP equals W again.\n\nBut wait, as the firm hires more workers, the MPP typically decreases due to diminishing marginal returns. So, as the firm hires more workers, MPP decreases, and eventually, MRP would equal W.\n\nBut in this case, since there's a technological innovation that has increased MPP, the firm can hire more workers before MPP starts diminishing.\n\nSo, overall, the firm should hire more workers.\n\nNow, about wages. Since the firm is a price taker in the labor market, it pays the market wage, which is determined by the intersection of market labor supply and demand.\n\nIf only one firm experiences this technological innovation, and other firms haven't changed, then the market demand for labor might not shift much, and thus, the wage rate shouldn't change significantly.\n\nTherefore, the wage rate should stay the same, and the firm should hire more workers.\n\nBut let's think about this again.\n\nIf the firm hires more workers, and assuming that the market wage doesn't change immediately, then the firm can hire more workers without having to pay higher wages.\n\nHowever, in the long run, if the firm is more productive, it might earn higher profits, which could lead to higher wages in the market as firms compete for workers.\n\nBut in the short run, and assuming that the market adjusts slowly, the wage rate might not change immediately.\n\nTherefore, in the short run, the firm would hire more workers at the existing wage rate.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages.\n\nBut let's look at option D: lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages.\n\nIf the firm is a price taker in the labor market, it can't unilaterally raise wages unless the market wage increases. And if only one firm experiences this technological innovation, it shouldn't be able to raise wages above the market wage, because workers can go work for other firms at the market wage.\n\nTherefore, in perfect competition, the firm should not raise wages above the market wage.\n\nSo, option D seems unlikely.\n\nOption B says: raise the workers' hourly wage as they now contribute more marginal revenue.\n\nBut again, in perfect competition, the firm can't set wages above the market wage. The market wage is determined by the interaction of all firms' demand for labor and the supply of labor in the market.\n\nSo, unless the market wage increases, which would require a shift in the market demand or supply curves, the firm shouldn't raise wages just because its MRP has increased.\n\nMoreover, if only one firm experiences this technological innovation, it's unlikely to cause a significant shift in the market demand for labor that would lead to a wage increase.\n\nTherefore, option B seems incorrect.\n\nOption A says: reduce the firm's employment level, because fewer workers are now needed.\n\nBut that contradicts what we've established. Since MRP has increased due to higher MPP, and the wage rate is constant, the firm should hire more workers, not fewer.\n\nSo, option A is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages.\n\nWait, but let's think about this again.\n\nIf the firm hires more workers, and assuming that the market wage doesn't change, then the firm can hire more workers at the same wage.\n\nBut in reality, if one firm starts hiring more workers, it might bid up wages slightly, but in perfect competition with many firms, the impact of one firm's hiring decision on the wage rate is minimal.\n\nTherefore, in theory, the wage rate should remain the same, and the firm should hire more workers.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility that the firm would raise wages.\n\nIn perfect competition, firms are price takers in both product and labor markets. They take the market wage as given.\n\nTherefore, they cannot and should not raise wages above the market wage.\n\nIf they do, workers would prefer to work for other firms that pay the market wage.\n\nTherefore, the firm should not raise wages unless the market wage increases.\n\nSince only one firm has experienced this technological innovation, it's unlikely to cause a market-wide wage increase.\n\nTherefore, the firm should hire more workers at the existing wage rate.\n\nHence, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
