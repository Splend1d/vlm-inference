                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a couple who were cohabitating and then decided to get married. The man wanted to make sure that all his current property stays in his name if they ever divorce, and the woman agreed but wanted a written document. But they got married without signing anything, and three months later, the husband leaves her for another woman. He sends her a notice to vacate the home based on their prenuptial agreement, which was oral, not written. Now, he's suing to enforce that oral prenuptial contract. The question is, will the court likely enforce the husband's claim?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I need to understand what a prenuptial agreement is. It's an agreement between two people who are about to get married that sets out the terms of their property and financial arrangements in case the marriage ends in divorce or death. Usually, these agreements are put in writing and signed by both parties before they get married.\n\nIn this case, they had an oral agreement, but they didn't put it in writing before getting married. Now, the husband is trying to enforce that oral agreement after they've already gotten married and he's left her for another woman.\n\nI recall that in many jurisdictions, prenuptial agreements must be in writing to be enforceable. There's a law called the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in writing to be valid. Marriage contracts are often included in that category.\n\nSo, option C says that a contract in consideration of marriage must be in writing, and since the prenuptial was oral, it's not legal and therefore not enforceable. That sounds plausible.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says yes, because the consideration for the contract was the marriage, and the consummation of the marriage made the contract complete and enforceable. Hmm, but generally, for a contract to be enforceable, it needs to be in writing if it's related to marriage, especially prenuptial agreements.\n\nOption B says yes, because prenuptial agreements are given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to enforcement decisions. But I think that prenuptial agreements are scrutinized carefully by courts, especially if one party is trying to enforce an oral agreement.\n\nOption D says no, because the husband didn't live up to his promise to put the agreement in writing and therefore committed fraud. Fraud is a serious allegation. For fraud to be established, there needs to be a misrepresentation of fact, reliance on that misrepresentation, and resulting damage.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman agreed to the prenuptial agreement but wanted it in writing. The husband didn't provide the written document, and they got married without it. Then, he tried to enforce the oral agreement after leaving her. Did he misrepresent that he would provide a written agreement? If he promised to provide a written agreement and then didn't, that could be seen as fraud.\n\nBut the question is whether the court will enforce the husband's claim based on the oral prenuptial agreement.\n\nGiven that most jurisdictions require prenuptial agreements to be in writing, and considering that they didn't have a written agreement, it seems unlikely that the court would enforce an oral prenuptial agreement.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the husband left her for another woman might influence the court's decision, but that's more about the moral aspect rather than the legal one.\n\nSo, between the options, I think option C is the most accurate: no, because a contract in consideration of marriage must be in writing, and the prenuptial was therefore not legal as long as it remained oral.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about whether there's any possibility that an oral prenuptial agreement could be enforceable under certain circumstances.\n\nPerhaps if there's evidence that both parties clearly agreed to the terms orally and acted on that agreement, but generally, it's very risky to rely on an oral agreement for something as significant as a prenuptial agreement.\n\nAlso, in some jurisdictions, oral agreements might be enforceable if they're confirmed in some written form, like emails or text messages, but in this scenario, it's mentioned that nothing was signed, so presumably, there's no written record of the agreement.\n\nAnother consideration is that the wife might argue that the oral agreement was never intended to be enforceable without a written document, given that she specifically requested a written document.\n\nSo, all things considered, I believe the correct answer is option C: no, because a contract in consideration of marriage must be in writing, and the prenuptial was therefore not legal as long as it remained oral.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
