                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage. It's from \"Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History\" by N. Levtzion and J.F.P. Hopkins, and it's about Sultan Musa of Mali, who was famous for his wealth and his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324, which really put Mali on the map. The passage is attributed to Al-Umari, who was writing around the 14th century.\n\nSo, Al-Zawawi is recounting what Sultan Musa told him about his kingdom's economy, particularly focusing on copper and gold mining and trade. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Musa mentions a town called ZKRY where there's a copper mine. Copper ingots from this mine are taken to another place called BYTY. He says that the only thing in his kingdom on which a duty is levied is this crude copper. So, copper is clearly an important commodity in Mali's economy, significant enough to be taxed.\n\nMoreover, he mentions that they send this copper to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold. Specifically, they sell 100 measures of copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold. That sounds like a lucrative trade, exchanging copper for gold at a favorable rate.\n\nAdditionally, Musa talks about pagan nations in his kingdom whom he doesn't collect the jizya from (which is a tax levied on non-Muslims in Islamic states), but instead, he employs them to extract gold from its deposits. These extractions are done by digging pits about a man's height deep, and the gold is found either embedded in the sides of these pits or collected at the bottom.\n\nAlright, so from this passage, we can gather several points about Mali's economy and its interactions with neighboring regions:\n\n1. Mali has rich mineral resources, particularly copper and gold.\n\n2. They mine copper in ZKRY and process or trade it in BYTY.\n\n3. They export copper to the pagan Sudan in exchange for gold.\n\n4. They employ non-Muslims to extract gold through mining techniques involving digging pits.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Mali was able to forge advanced bronze tools from its mineral resources.\n\nWell, the passage mentions copper mining and trade, but it doesn't specifically mention bronze tool production. Bronze is typically an alloy of copper and tin, and there's no mention of tin mines or bronze production facilities in the passage. So, while it's possible that Mali could have produced bronze tools, the passage doesn't directly support this inference.\n\nB. International trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources.\n\nThis seems quite aligned with what's described in the passage. Mali is trading copper with the pagan Sudan for gold. This suggests that there was an exchange of mineral resources between different regions in Africa. So, this option seems plausible.\n\nC. The jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit.\n\nThis option is a bit tricky. The passage states that Musa doesn't collect jizya from certain pagan nations but instead employs them to extract gold. It doesn't say that jizya could only be collected from unbelievers who have minerals to exploit. It might be that jizya was generally collected from non-Muslims, regardless of whether they had minerals or not. So, this seems like an overinterpretation of the passage.\n\nD. Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth.\n\nThe passage mentions that gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height deep. While this was likely an effective method at the time, it doesn't necessarily indicate \"advanced\" mining technologies by historical standards. Moreover, the passage doesn't compare Mali's mining techniques to those of other regions, so it's hard to conclude that their technologies were relatively advanced.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems to be the most directly supported by the passage. It accurately reflects the description of Mali trading copper for gold with the pagan Sudan, highlighting the exchange of mineral resources in international trade within Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check if the pagan Sudan mentioned here is indeed a part of Sub-Saharan Africa. The term \"Sudan\" historically refers to a region spanning from Senegal to Sudan proper, which is mostly north of the equator but still part of Sub-Saharan Africa. So, yes, this trade would be within Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that this kind of trade was common in West Africa during the medieval period, with kingdoms like Mali and Songhai thriving on the trans-Saharan trade routes that exchanged gold, salt, and other commodities with North Africa and beyond.\n\nSo, based on the information provided in the passage and the historical context, option B is the most appropriate inference.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
