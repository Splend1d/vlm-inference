The options are due care, ignorance of the law, lack of intent, and lack of mental capacity. I need to figure out which one of these would likely be a successful defense in such a case.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what negligence means in this context. Negligence is basically failing to meet the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation. For a CPA, that standard is higher because they're professionals, and they're expected to have specialized knowledge and skills.\n\nSo, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Due care.\n\nThis sounds like the CPA took all the necessary precautions and followed the appropriate standards in their work. If a CPA can show that they exercised due care, meaning they acted as a reasonably prudent CPA would have under similar circumstances, that should defend against a negligence claim. This seems like a strong defense.\n\nB. Ignorance of the law.\n\nGenerally, ignorance of the law is not a defense in legal matters. Even if the CPA didn't know about a particular regulation or law, they're still expected to know it as part of their professional duty. So, claiming they didn't know the law probably wouldn't hold up in court.\n\nC. Lack of intent.\n\nNegligence is different from intentional wrongdoing. Negligence is about carelessness, not about purposefully doing something wrong. So, if the CPA didn't intend to cause harm, but their actions still resulted in damage due to negligence, lack of intent might not be a successful defense because negligence doesn't require intent.\n\nD. Lack of mental capacity.\n\nThis one is interesting. If the CPA had some mental impairment that affected their ability to perform their duties, perhaps that could be a defense. However, CPAs are expected to maintain their professional competence, and if they have a condition that impairs their judgment or abilities, they should probably not be practicing. So, I'm not sure how well this would hold up as a defense.\n\nLet me think about this again. The question is asking for the defense most likely to be successful in a negligence suit against a CPA. Between the options, due care seems the most straightforward and strongest defense. If the CPA can prove they took all the necessary steps and exercised the required level of care, then the claim of negligence should fail.\n\nIgnorance of the law isn't a good defense because CPAs are expected to know and follow the law. Lack of intent might not be relevant in a negligence case because negligence is about the standard of care, not about intentions. And lack of mental capacity could be a factor, but it might not excuse the CPA from liability if they were aware of their limitations and still took on professional responsibilities.\n\nSo, my best answer is A. Due care.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
