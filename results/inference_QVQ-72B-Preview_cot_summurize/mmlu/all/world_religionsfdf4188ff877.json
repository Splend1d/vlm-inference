                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which form of Buddhism teaches that the only hope for salvation is in the saving grace of Amida. The options are Pure Land, Tendai, Shingon, and Soto Zen. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Buddhism has many different schools and traditions, especially in East Asia. Each school has its own emphasis and practices, so I need to recall which one specifically focuses on Amida for salvation.\n\nLet me start by thinking about Pure Land Buddhism. I've heard of this tradition; it's quite popular in Japan and China. It emphasizes faith in Amida Buddha, who is believed to have created a Western Paradise called the Pure Land. The practice often involves reciting the name of Amida Buddha with the belief that this faith will lead to rebirth in the Pure Land, where one can attain enlightenment more easily. So, in this tradition, salvation comes from the mercy and grace of Amida Buddha. This sounds a lot like what the question is asking.\n\nNow, let's consider Tendai. I believe Tendai is another Japanese Buddhist school that developed from Chinese Buddhism. It's known for its comprehensive approach, incorporating various teachings and practices, including both sutras and tantras. Tendai doesn't exclusively focus on Amida Buddha; instead, it has a broader range of deities and practices. So, while Amida might be part of its pantheon, it's not the central figure for salvation in the same way as in Pure Land.\n\nNext is Shingon. This is also a Japanese Buddhist school that emphasizes tantra and esoteric practices. Shingon focuses on achieving enlightenment through mystical rituals and mantras. While Amida might be recognized in some contexts within Shingon, he isn't the central figure for salvation in this tradition. Shingon's path to enlightenment is more about inner transformation through specialized practices rather than faith in a savior buddha.\n\nLastly, there's Soto Zen. Zen Buddhism is known for its emphasis on meditation and direct experience of reality without reliance on scriptures or deities. Soto Zen, in particular, stresses sitting meditation (zazen) as the primary practice to realize one's own Buddha nature. Salvation or enlightenment in Zen comes from personal effort and insight, not from faith in Amida or any other external savior.\n\nSo, comparing all these traditions, Pure Land Buddhism stands out as the one that specifically teaches salvation through the grace of Amida Buddha. Its entire practice is centered around faith in Amida and the aspiration to be reborn in the Pure Land due to his compassionate vow to save all beings who call upon his name.\n\nI think the answer is A. Pure Land.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Pure Land}} \\]"
