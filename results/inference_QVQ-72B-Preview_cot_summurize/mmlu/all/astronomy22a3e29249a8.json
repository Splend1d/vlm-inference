Let me think about this.\n\nI remember that Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer, physicist, and engineer who made significant contributions to the scientific revolution. He was born in 1564 and died in 1642, so he was active during the 16th and early 17th centuries.\n\nNow, about the telescope: I recall that Galileo didn't actually invent the telescope, but he improved it and was one of the first to use it for astronomical observations. I think the telescope was invented by a Dutchman named Hans Lippershey around 1608.\n\nGalileo heard about the telescope and built his own version in 1609, which he presented to the Venetian Republic. He used this telescope to make important astronomical discoveries, like the phases of Venus and the moons of Jupiter.\n\nSo, based on that, 1609 seems like the most plausible year among the options given. Let me double-check this information to be sure.\n\nI found that Galileo indeed built his first telescope in 1609. He used it to observe the night sky and made several groundbreaking observations that supported the heliocentric model of the solar system, which proposed that the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 1609.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly verify if there's any possibility that the telescope was invented in another year mentioned in the options.\n\n1409 is too early; that was the time of the Hussite Wars in Europe, not when Galileo was active.\n\n1509 was the year Henry VIII became King of England, and Galileo wasn't born until 1564.\n\n1709 is too late; Galileo died in 1642.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that 1609 is the correct year when Galileo invented\u2014or rather, improved\u2014the telescope.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 1609} \\]"
