Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, \"What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?\" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, \"Study this, baby!\" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Burglary only.\nB. Attempted violation of the statute.\nC. Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.\nD. Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a student who likes to play pranks, especially involving flashing people. He's been doing this around campus, wearing only a raincoat and boxers, and opening the raincoat to expose himself to young women. He thinks he's committing a crime by doing this, but in this particular jurisdiction, it's only a crime if you're completely nude. So, in this case, since he's wearing boxers, it's not actually a crime.\n\nOne night, he breaks into a sorority house with the intention of flashing the sorority sisters. He goes into one of their bedrooms while they're studying, takes off his raincoat, and makes a comment. Then he runs through the house in his shorts. The police show up and arrest him.\n\nNow, the question is, if he's prosecuted, what should he be found guilty of? The options are:\n\nA. Burglary only.\n\nB. Attempted violation of the statute.\n\nC. Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.\n\nD. Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what burglary is. Burglary is generally defined as entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime inside. In this case, the student broke into the sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. But since flashing isn't a crime in this jurisdiction (as long as he's not nude), does that mean he can't be guilty of burglary?\n\nWait, but he did enter the house unlawfully with the intent to do something that he believed was a crime, even if it's not actually a crime. Does that matter in terms of burglary?\n\nI think there's a concept in law called \"specific intent.\" So, for burglary, it's about the intent to commit a crime when you enter the building, not necessarily whether that crime actually took place or was even possible.\n\nBut here, the crime he intended to commit\u2014flashing\u2014 isn't actually a crime because he was wearing boxers. So, does that mean his intent was to commit an act that he mistakenly believed was a crime?\n\nMaybe this falls under some kind of mistake of fact or law. If he honestly believed that flashing was a crime, but it's not, does that affect his liability for burglary?\n\nLet me think about attempted crimes. An attempt is when someone intends to commit a crime and takes a substantial step towards its commission, but fails to complete it.\n\nIn this case, he intended to flash the sorority sisters and took steps to do so by breaking into the house and exposing himself in his boxers. But since flashing isn't a crime, can there be an attempt to violate a non-existent statute?\n\nWait, the statute says it's a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude. He wasn't nude; he was wearing boxers. So, he didn't meet the elements of the statute. Therefore, he couldn't have violated it, and thus couldn't have attempted to violate it.\n\nBut he did have the intent to flash, which he believed was a crime, and he took actions to do so. However, since the act itself isn't criminal, can there be an attempt?\n\nMaybe it's like trying to commit a crime that doesn't actually exist. In that case, generally, there can't be a conviction for attempting to do something that isn't illegal.\n\nSo, perhaps he can't be guilty of attempting to violate the statute because what he did wasn't a violation of the statute.\n\nNow, back to burglary. He entered the sorority house unlawfully with the intent to commit an act that he believed was a crime, but it wasn't actually a crime. Does that mean he can still be guilty of burglary?\n\nI think in some jurisdictions, the intent to commit a crime is sufficient for burglary, even if the intended crime isn't actually a crime. It's the intent that matters at the time of entry.\n\nSo, he had the specific intent to commit an act that he believed was criminal when he entered the house. Therefore, he could be guilty of burglary.\n\nBut wait, if the intended crime isn't actually a crime, could that affect the burglary charge?\n\nLet me look this up. In the jurisdiction in question, is there a requirement that the intended crime must be an actual crime?\n\nI need to consider the elements of burglary. Typically, it's entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein.\n\nIn this case, he entered unlawfully with the intent to commit an act that he believed was a felony, but it wasn't actually a felony. Does that mean he can't be guilty of burglary?\n\nMaybe it's like a mistake of law. If he mistakenly believed that flashing was a crime, would that affect his liability for burglary?\n\nI think in most legal systems, burglary requires the intent to commit a crime at the time of entry, but whether that crime is actually committed or even possible is irrelevant.\n\nHowever, if the intended crime isn't actually a crime, perhaps the burglary charge falls through.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose someone enters a building intending to commit a crime that doesn't actually exist. Can they still be guilty of burglary?\n\nI recall a case where someone entered a building intending to commit a crime that was later found not to be a crime, and they were still convicted of burglary based on their intent at the time of entry.\n\nBut in this scenario, since flashing isn't a crime because he was wearing boxers, maybe it's different.\n\nWait, the statute specifically says it's a crime to flash or expose oneself in the nude. He wasn't nude; he was wearing boxers. So, his act didn't meet the elements of the statute.\n\nTherefore, he didn't commit the crime he intended to commit because his actions didn't satisfy the statutory definition.\n\nSo, can he still be guilty of burglary based on his intent?\n\nI think the key here is his subjective intent at the time of entry. He intended to commit an act that he believed was a crime, which is sufficient for burglary.\n\nTherefore, he can be guilty of burglary.\n\nAs for the attempted violation of the statute, since his actions didn't meet the elements of the statute, he can't be guilty of attempting to violate it.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. Burglary only.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption C says both burglary and attempted violation of the statute. But as I see it, he can't be guilty of attempting to violate the statute because his actions didn't meet the elements of the crime.\n\nTherefore, C is incorrect.\n\nOption B is attempted violation of the statute only. But as I've thought, he can't be guilty of that because his actions didn't constitute the crime.\n\nOption D is neither, which seems incorrect because he can be guilty of burglary.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct answer: burglary only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
