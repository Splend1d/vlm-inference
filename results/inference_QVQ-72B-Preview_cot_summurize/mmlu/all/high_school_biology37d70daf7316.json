                    "text": "So I have this question about Tay-Sachs disease, which is caused by a recessive allele. It says that people with the disease usually don't survive past a few years and can't reproduce or pass on the gene. But the question is, how does this allele and the disease still stay in the population?\n\nLet me think about this. First, I know that in genetics, when you have a recessive trait, it only expresses itself if someone is homozygous recessive. So, if someone is heterozygous, meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele, they won't show the disease, right? That's because the dominant allele masks the recessive one.\n\nOption A says that heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms. That sounds correct. So, if someone is heterozygous, they don't have the disease, but they can still pass on the recessive allele to their offspring. So, even though the homozygous recessive individuals don't survive to reproduce, the recessive allele can still be passed down through heterozygous carriers. This could explain why the allele doesn't disappear from the population.\n\nOption B mentions spontaneous mutation converting the dominant allele to the recessive form. Well, mutations can happen, but they're generally rare. I don't think that spontaneous mutations are a significant factor in maintaining the frequency of the Tay-Sachs allele in the population.\n\nOption C says that occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual. Hmm, that sounds like it might be referring to some sort of heterozygote advantage. If being heterozygous for the allele provides some benefit, like resistance to a disease, then that could help maintain the recessive allele in the population. But I need to check if that's the case with Tay-Sachs.\n\nI recall that in sickle cell anemia, which is another recessive genetic disorder, heterozygous individuals have some resistance to malaria. That's an example of heterozygote advantage, where the heterozygous state confers a fitness benefit. But does the same thing happen with Tay-Sachs?\n\nI'm not sure about that. I think Tay-Sachs doesn't have a known heterozygote advantage. So, maybe option C isn't applicable here.\n\nOption D states that Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive. Wait, that can't be right. The question says that individuals with the genetic disorder usually do not survive more than a few years and are not able to reproduce. That sounds like the homozygous recessive individuals have severe symptoms, not none. So, if they have symptoms and don't survive to reproduce, then how is the allele being preserved?\n\nMaybe I need to consider the concept of genetic drift or mutation rate, but the options don't mention those. Perhaps the key is that heterozygous individuals don't show symptoms but can pass on the allele, which keeps the recessive allele in the population.\n\nLet me try to think about this differently. Suppose in a population, there are heterozygous carriers who don't have the disease but can pass on the recessive allele to their children. If two carriers have children, there's a 25% chance of having a homozygous recessive child with Tay-Sachs. But if those children don't survive to reproduce, then those alleles aren't passed on further. However, as long as there are heterozygous carriers in the population, the recessive allele isn't completely lost.\n\nSo, the presence of heterozygous individuals who don't show symptoms but can transmit the allele is crucial for maintaining the disease in the population. This makes option A seem plausible.\n\nBut what about option B, spontaneous mutation? Well, mutations can introduce new alleles into the population, but they're not a primary factor in maintaining allele frequencies, especially for a relatively common disorder like Tay-Sachs.\n\nOption C suggests that sometimes the gene increases fitness. If that were the case, we might expect the allele frequency to increase over time, but with Tay-Sachs, it's more about the balance between selection against homozygous recessive individuals and the presence of heterozygous carriers.\n\nOption D is clearly incorrect because it contradicts the information given in the question: Tay-Sachs is indeed symptomatic in homozygous recessive individuals.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is option A: heterozygous individuals show no symptoms but can pass on the recessive allele to their offspring, thereby maintaining it in the population.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
