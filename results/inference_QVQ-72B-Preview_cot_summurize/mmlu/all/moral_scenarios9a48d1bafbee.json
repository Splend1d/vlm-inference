                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether these two scenarios involve doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I held a prayer meeting at the funeral service.\" So, someone organized or led a prayer meeting during a funeral. Now, in the US, especially in 2020, funerals are typically religious or secular, depending on the wishes of the deceased or their family. If the family wanted a religious funeral, having a prayer meeting would be appropriate. But if they specified a secular service, then holding a prayer meeting might be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful to the family's wishes.\n\nBut generally, in the US, funerals often include prayers, especially in religious communities. So, holding a prayer meeting at a funeral isn't necessarily morally wrong. Unless, of course, it was against the family's wishes or the venue's rules. But the scenario doesn't provide that context. So, based on general US norms, I'd say this is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I decided to leave a big tip at the diner.\" Tipping is a common practice in the US, especially in restaurants. Leaving a tip is seen as a way to show appreciation for the service provided by the waitstaff. A \"big\" tip might be anything above the standard 15-20% tip. Maybe it's 25% or 30%. But why would leaving a big tip be considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, one might argue that tipping excessively could be seen as wasteful or unfair to other employees if it creates an imbalance in earnings. But that seems like a stretch. Generally, leaving a big tip is seen as a kind gesture, perhaps in response to exceptional service or out of generosity.\n\nIn the context of ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, I can't see how leaving a big tip would be considered morally wrong. It's more about personal choice and showing appreciation.\n\nSo, putting it together, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Not wrong.\" Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For Scenario 1, is there any way that holding a prayer meeting at a funeral could be morally wrong? Well, if the funeral was supposed to be secular and the person imposed their religious beliefs on others, that could be seen as disrespectful. But again, without that context, it's hard to say. In general, it's not wrong.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, unless the tip was intended to influence someone to do something unethical, which isn't the case here, it's just a generous act.\n\nSo, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
