                    "text": "Let's dive into this genetics problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, we have a population where an autosomal gene, which was previously fixed for one allele, mutates to introduce a new allele. This new allele shows incomplete dominance, and then natural selection acts on it via stabilizing selection. We need to figure out what happens over many generations.\n\nFirst, let's understand the terms:\n\n- **Autosomal gene:** This means the gene is located on one of the non-sex chromosomes, so it affects both males and females equally.\n\n- **Previously fixed:** Means that before the mutation, only one allele was present in the population for this gene.\n\n- **New allele via mutation:** A mutation occurs, introducing a new version of the gene.\n\n- **Incomplete dominance:** This means that when an individual has two different alleles for this gene, the phenotype is a intermediate between the two homozygous states.\n\n- **Stabilizing selection:** This type of natural selection favors the average phenotype and works against extremes. So, individuals with extreme phenotypes have lower fitness.\n\nAlright, so before the mutation, the population was fixed for one allele, let's call it allele A. After the mutation, a new allele, say allele a, is introduced. Since it's incomplete dominance, the heterozygotes (Aa) have a phenotype that's between the two homozygotes (AA and aa).\n\nNow, stabilizing selection is acting on this locus. Stabilizing selection favors the intermediate phenotypes and disfavors the extremes. In this case, it would favor the heterozygotes (Aa) over the homozygotes (AA or aa).\n\nWait a minute, if stabilizing selection favors the intermediate phenotype, which in this case is the heterozygote, then we can expect that the heterozygotes will have higher fitness than the homozygotes.\n\nSo, over time, the frequency of the heterozygotes should increase, right? But let's think carefully.\n\nIn stabilizing selection, the extremes are selected against, so the frequencies of the alleles that lead to extreme phenotypes should decrease, while the allele frequencies that lead to the intermediate phenotype should be favored.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the intermediate phenotype is the heterozygote, we might expect an increase in heterozygosity.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The proportions of both types of homozygote should decrease.\n\n- If stabilizing selection is favoring the heterozygotes, then the homozygotes (AA and aa) should be selected against, meaning their proportions should decrease.\n\nB. The proportion of the population that is heterozygous at this locus should remain constant.\n\n- This seems contradictory to what we just thought. If stabilizing selection is favoring heterozygotes, their proportion should increase, not remain constant.\n\nC. The population's average heterozygosity should increase.\n\n- This seems consistent with our initial thought. If heterozygotes are favored, then heterozygosity should increase.\n\nD. Both A and C\n\n- If A is correct (homozygotes decrease) and C is correct (heterozygosity increases), then D would be correct.\n\nBut let's double-check. If heterozygotes increase, and homozygotes decrease, that makes sense under stabilizing selection. However, in reality, stabilizing selection tends to maintain intermediate allele frequencies by selecting against extremes, which could lead to a stable equilibrium of allele frequencies rather than a continuous increase in heterozygosity.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall how stabilizing selection affects allele frequencies.\n\nIn stabilizing selection:\n\n- The extreme phenotypes have lower fitness, so the alleles contributing to those extremes are selected against.\n\n- The intermediate phenotype has higher fitness, so alleles contributing to that phenotype are favored.\n\nIn the case of incomplete dominance, the heterozygote has a phenotype that's intermediate between the two homozygotes.\n\nSo, if stabilizing selection is favoring the heterozygote, then the heterozygote frequency should increase, and the homozygote frequencies should decrease.\n\nBut in population genetics, the frequency of heterozygotes is influenced by the frequencies of the two alleles. Specifically, in a panmictic population not subject to selection, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq, where p and q are the frequencies of alleles A and a, respectively, and p + q = 1.\n\nHowever, if stabilizing selection is favoring heterozygotes, it should lead to an increase in heterozygotes, but this would typically result in an equilibrium where the alleles are maintained at intermediate frequencies.\n\nBut in the long term, would the heterozygosity keep increasing indefinitely? Probably not, because as heterozygosity increases, the production of homozygotes decreases, leading to a balance.\n\nSo, perhaps in the short term, heterozygosity increases, and homozygosity decreases, but in the long term, an equilibrium is reached where the frequencies stabilize.\n\nGiven that, option A says that the proportions of both types of homozygote should decrease. That seems plausible under stabilizing selection.\n\nOption B says the proportion of heterozygous individuals should remain constant. That contradicts what we've just thought.\n\nOption C says the population's average heterozygosity should increase. This seems consistent with the idea that heterozygotes are favored under stabilizing selection.\n\nOption D combines A and C.\n\nBut considering that in the long term, there might be an equilibrium where heterozygosity stabilizes, but the question is about \"over the course of many generations,\" which could imply reaching that equilibrium.\n\nHowever, in the process of reaching equilibrium, heterozygosity would increase initially and then level off.\n\nSo, during the transition, heterozygosity increases, and homozygosity decreases.\n\nTherefore, options A and C are correct, making D the answer.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"consequently, what should happen over the course of many generations?\" It's possible that over many generations, the population reaches an equilibrium where heterozygosity is maximized, given the selection pressures.\n\nIn that case, both A and C could be correct, but C implies a continuous increase, which might not be accurate over many generations if equilibrium is reached.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is D, as it covers both A and C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is incorrect, and C is correct, leading to D being the right choice.\n\nI think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
