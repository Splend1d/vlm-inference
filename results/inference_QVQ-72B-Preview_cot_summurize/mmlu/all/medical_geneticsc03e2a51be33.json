                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement about Hirschsprung disease is incorrect. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says that it shows an association with Down syndrome. I remember that Hirschsprung disease is a congenital condition where parts of the large intestine lack nerve cells, which leads to problems with passing stool. Down syndrome, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome. I think there is a known association between these two conditions, so this might be correct.\n\nOption B states that it is more common in girls than in boys. I recall that in general, Hirschsprung disease is more common in boys. Let me double-check that. I think the male-to-female ratio is roughly 4:1 for the classic form of the disease. So, if that's the case, then it's actually more common in boys, not girls. That might be the incorrect statement.\n\nOption C mentions that RET is a major susceptibility gene. I know that Hirschsprung disease has a genetic component, and several genes have been identified as contributing to its development. RET is indeed one of the most commonly associated genes, so this seems to be correct.\n\nOption D says that recurrence risks are greater for long segment disease than for short segment disease. Hirschsprung disease can affect different lengths of the colon, from a short segment near the anus to much longer segments. I need to recall if there's a difference in recurrence risks based on the length of the affected segment. I'm not entirely sure about this, so I might need to look it up or think harder.\n\nLet me summarize what I know:\n\n- Hirschsprung disease is more common in boys.\n\n- It is associated with Down syndrome.\n\n- RET is a major gene involved.\n\n- Recurrence risks might vary depending on the segment affected, but I'm unsure about the specifics.\n\nGiven that, option B seems suspect because I thought Hirschsprung disease is more common in boys, not girls. So, if that's the case, then stating it's more common in girls would be incorrect.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any form of Hirschsprung disease that is more common in girls. I know that there are different types, like the short-segment and long-segment forms, and perhaps the incidence varies by type. However, overall, I still recall that it's more common in boys.\n\nTherefore, I think the incorrect statement is option B: it is more common in girls than in boys.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
