                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 75-year-old woman who's experiencing band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen. The pain seems to extend from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back. She came to the office with these symptoms, and upon examination, there was no abdominal tenderness to palpation. Some tests were done: an ultrasound of the gallbladder showed normal results, and her serum amylase concentration was within the reference range. The question is asking for the most likely diagnosis from the options provided: Acalculous cholecystitis, chronic relapsing pancreatitis, diverticulitis of the cecum, or herpes zoster.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the symptoms and the test results. The patient is describing a band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen that wraps around to the midline of the back. This type of pain description can be indicative of several conditions, especially those involving the gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary systems.\n\nFirst, let's consider the location of the pain. The right upper abdomen is commonly associated with issues related to the gallbladder, liver, or right kidney. However, since the pain extends to the midline of the back, it might also involve structures like the pancreas or the lower part of the thoracic spine.\n\nThe fact that there's no abdominal tenderness to palpation suggests that it's not a acute inflammatory process, at least not one that's causing local peritoneal irritation. This might rule out some acute conditions like acute cholecystitis or acute pancreatitis, but we still need to consider other possibilities.\n\nThe ultrasound of the gallbladder was normal, which rules out gallstones or other structural issues with the gallbladder. Her serum amylase concentration is within the reference range, which is typically used to screen for pancreatic issues, particularly acute pancreatitis. A normal amylase makes acute pancreatitis less likely, but it's worth noting that amylase can be normal in some cases of pancreatitis, especially if the episode is mild or if the test is performed too early or too late after the onset of symptoms.\n\nGiven that she's 75 years old, age-related factors could be relevant. Older adults might present with atypical symptoms for many conditions, and their immune responses might differ from younger individuals.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Acalculous cholecystitis. This is inflammation of the gallbladder without the presence of gallstones. It's less common than calculous cholecystitis (with gallstones) and is more often seen in hospitalized patients, particularly those who are critically ill. The typical presentation includes right upper quadrant pain, fever, and sometimes jaundice. However, in this case, the ultrasound is normal, which would make acalculous cholecystitis less likely, as ultrasound is fairly reliable for detecting gallbladder inflammation. Additionally, there's no mention of fever or jaundice in the presentation.\n\nOption B: Chronic relapsing pancreatitis. This is a condition characterized by repeated episodes of pancreatic inflammation over time. Symptoms can include abdominal pain that radiates to the back, similar to what this patient is experiencing. However, chronic pancreatitis often presents with more persistent pain, and there might be a history of alcohol abuse or other risk factors. The normal amylase level makes acute pancreatitis less likely, but in chronic pancreatitis, amylase levels might not be consistently elevated, especially between episodes. Still, ultrasound might show changes in the pancreas, such as calcifications or cysts, which weren't mentioned here.\n\nOption C: Diverticulitis of the cecum. Diverticulitis is inflammation of diverticula in the colon. The cecum is located on the right side of the abdomen, so pain in this area could be related to cecal diverticulitis. However, diverticulitis typically presents with localized pain, tenderness, and possibly fever. In this case, there's no mention of tenderness, which might make diverticulitis less likely. Additionally, diverticulitis in the cecum is less common than in the sigmoid colon.\n\nOption D: Herpes zoster. This is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Herpes zoster typically presents with a painful rash that follows a dermatomal distribution, often described as a band-like pattern. The pain can precede the rash by a few days to a week. Given that the patient is experiencing band-like pain extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back, this could correspond to the thoracic dermatomes, which cover the abdomen and back in a belt-like fashion.\n\nConsidering all this, herpes zoster seems to align best with the patient's symptoms. The band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen extending to the back is consistent with the neuralgia associated with herpes zoster before the rash appears. The absence of abdominal tenderness and the normal ultrasound and amylase levels further support this diagnosis, as they rule out many of the more common gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary conditions.\n\nIt's important to note that early diagnosis and treatment of herpes zoster can help mitigate the severity and duration of symptoms, particularly the neuralgia. Since the rash might not yet be present, it's crucial to consider the diagnosis based on the pain description alone.\n\nIn summary, based on the patient's symptoms and the normal investigative results, herpes zoster is the most likely diagnosis among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
