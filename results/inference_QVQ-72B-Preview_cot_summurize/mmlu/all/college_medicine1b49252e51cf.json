                    "text": "So I have this question about attachment theory, and I need to figure out which child is most likely to attach to a male psychologist in the course of a psychological study. The options are:\n\nA. A two-month-old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment\n\nB. A five-month-old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment\n\nC. An eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child\n\nD. A thirteen-month-old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child\n\nFirst, I need to recall some key points about attachment theory. Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby, focuses on the bonds that form between infants and their caregivers, particularly parents. It suggests that infants form strong emotional bonds with their primary caregivers, who provide them with a sense of security and safety.\n\nNow, the question is about which child is most likely to attach to a male psychologist in the context of a psychological study. The psychologist is previously unknown to the child, so this would be considered a stranger. Normally, infants start to form attachments around 6 to 7 months of age, and by around 8 to 10 months, they may show separation anxiety and prefer familiar caregivers over strangers.\n\nBut in this case, we have children ranging from 2 months to 13 months old. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A two-month-old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment.\n\nAt two months old, infants are still very young. Attachment typically begins to develop around 6 to 7 months, so at two months, it's early for strong attachment bonds to have formed. Additionally, she's been raised in a safe, stable environment, which likely means she has consistent and responsive caregivers. So, she may not be as likely to form an attachment to a stranger at this age.\n\nOption B: A five-month-old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment.\n\nFive months is still before the peak attachment period, which starts around 6 to 7 months. However, infants at this age are starting to show preferences for familiar faces and may be more wary of strangers. Since he's been raised in a safe, stable environment, his needs are likely being met by his primary caregivers, and he may not be as inclined to form an attachment to a stranger.\n\nOption C: An eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child.\n\nThis is interesting. At eight months, infants are firmly in the attachment formation period. They typically show separation anxiety and may cling to familiar caregivers. However, in this case, the caregiver frequently neglects the child. This could lead to insecure attachment styles, such as avoidant or ambivalent/-resistant attachments, depending on the specific care received.\n\nGiven that the caregiver is neglectful, the child might not be getting consistent care and emotional responsiveness. In such cases, the child might be more likely to seek attachment figures elsewhere, possibly including the psychologist in the study. This could be especially true if the psychologist is providing attention and care that the child isn't receiving consistently from the primary caregiver.\n\nOption D: A thirteen-month-old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child.\n\nAt thirteen months, the child is older and has likely formed attachments to her primary caregivers. However, the caregivers occasionally neglect the child, which might affect the strength and security of those attachments. Still, given that there are two caregivers, perhaps they provide some consistency, although not perfect.\n\nConsidering that the child is older and has had more time to form attachments, she might be less likely to form a new attachment to a stranger, even if her primary caregivers are somewhat neglectful.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option C stands out as the most likely candidate to attach to the psychologist. The child is at the peak age for attachment formation (around 8 months), and the primary caregiver is frequently neglectful, which might make the child more receptive to forming an attachment with someone who provides consistent care and attention, like the psychologist in the study.\n\nAdditionally, research in attachment theory suggests that infants who experience inconsistent or neglectful care might form insecure attachments, which can manifest in various ways, including seeking attachment from other figures besides their primary caregivers.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child is most likely to attach to the male psychologist in the course of the psychological study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
