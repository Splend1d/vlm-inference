                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about proving discriminatory classification. It says that to prove discrimination, you have to show that the government intended to discriminate. And then it lists four options, and I need to pick which one doesn't qualify as proof of that intent. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A is \"a law that is discriminatory on its face.\" So, if the law itself says something discriminatory, that seems like direct evidence of intent, right? Like, if the law explicitly treats one group differently because of their race or something, that should be pretty clear intent.\n\nOption B is \"a discriminatory application of a facially neutral law.\" So, even if the law doesn't look discriminatory on its face, if it's applied in a way that discriminates against certain groups, that might show intent too. Maybe the government is pretending the law is neutral, but in practice, they're using it to discriminate.\n\nOption C is \"a discriminatory effect.\" This seems a bit trickier. Sometimes, laws can have a disproportionate impact on certain groups without necessarily intending to discriminate. So, maybe just showing that a law affects one group more than another isn't enough to prove intent.\n\nOption D is \"a discriminatory motive.\" This sounds a lot like intent. If you can show that the government had a reason to discriminate, that seems directly related to intent.\n\nSo, the question is asking which one of these doesn't qualify as proof of discriminatory intent. Let me think about this.\n\nOption A is straightforward\u2014discriminatory law on its face should show intent.\n\nOption B suggests that even if the law looks neutral, how it's applied can reveal intent. That also seems relevant.\n\nOption C is about the effect. Maybe the law wasn't intended to discriminate, but it ended up doing so because of how society is structured or something. In that case, the effect alone might not prove that the government intended to discriminate.\n\nOption D is basically saying that if you can show the government had a discriminatory motive, that should be proof of intent.\n\nSo, comparing these, it seems like options A, B, and D all relate directly to the government's intent, whereas option C is about the outcome, which might not necessarily reflect the intent.\n\nWait, but in law, sometimes effects can be considered, especially in certain contexts like voting rights or housing. But I think for proving intentional discrimination, the effect alone might not be sufficient without showing that the effect was foreseeable and desired.\n\nMaybe I should look up some case laws or legal principles related to discriminatory intent.\n\nI recall something about the difference between disparate treatment and disparate impact. Disparate treatment is intentional discrimination, while disparate impact is when a neutral policy has a discriminatory effect, possibly without intent.\n\nSo, in employment law, for example, a company might have a policy that seems neutral but ends up excluding a disproportionate number of people from a certain group. That's disparate impact, and it can be illegal under certain circumstances, even without proof of intent.\n\nBut in the context of equal protection under the law, especially in cases involving race or other suspect classifications, the court often looks for intentional discrimination.\n\nSo, going back to the question, if I have to prove intentional discrimination, showing a discriminatory effect alone might not be enough if the government didn't intend to discriminate.\n\nWhereas, if I can show that the law is discriminatory on its face, or that it's applied discriminatorily, or that there was a discriminatory motive, that would more directly point to intent.\n\nTherefore, option C, a discriminatory effect, might be the one that doesn't qualify as proof of discriminatory intent.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a specific case where just the effect was considered enough to prove intent.\n\nI think of the case of Washington v. Davis, where the Supreme Court held that proof of discriminatory impact is not sufficient to establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause; there must also be proof of discriminatory intent.\n\nSo, that reinforces my thinking that discriminatory effect alone isn't enough to prove intent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. A discriminatory effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
