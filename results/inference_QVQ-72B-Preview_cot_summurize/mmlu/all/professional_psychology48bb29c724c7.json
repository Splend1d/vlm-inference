                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about Dr. Harold Hanson, a psychologist who's in charge of the personnel committee at a mental health facility. He's recommending that a psychologist, who has an unresolved charge of sexual harassment against him, shouldn't be considered for a promotion. And I need to figure out, in terms of his ethical responsibilities, which option best describes his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the ethical guidelines say about situations like this. Option A says that Dr. Hanson has acted ethically because sexual harassment is explicitly prohibited by the ethical guidelines. That makes sense because, generally, ethical codes for psychologists do prohibit sexual harassment. So, if someone has a charge against them for sexual harassment, it's something that's taken seriously.\n\nOption B says that he has acted ethically as long as he's willing to consider the psychologist for promotion if he's acquitted of the harassment charge. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. So, basically, it's saying that Dr. Hanson's decision is conditional on the outcome of the harassment charge. If the psychologist is found not guilty or the charge is dropped, then Dr. Hanson would consider him for promotion. This might be ethical, but I'm not sure if it's the primary consideration here. Maybe it's more about the current status of the charge rather than waiting for a resolution.\n\nOption C says that he has acted ethically as long as his decision is consistent with the stated promotion policy of the mental health facility. This brings up the idea that there might be a policy in place that dictates how to handle promotions when there are unresolved charges against an employee. If that's the case, then following the policy would be ethical because it shows that he's adhering to the organization's rules and procedures.\n\nOption D says that he has acted unethically by violating the requirements of the ethical guidelines regarding employment procedures. This suggests that Dr. Hanson's decision might be against some ethical standards related to employment. But from the information given, it seems like he's trying to make a decision based on the unresolved charge, which might be seen as precautionary or in line with ethical considerations.\n\nNow, I need to think about which one of these is the most accurate. Let me consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Has he acted ethically because sexual harassment is prohibited? Well, yes, but I'm not sure if that directly answers whether his decision to not consider the psychologist for promotion is ethical. The fact that sexual harassment is prohibited might be a reason to take action, but the action itself needs to be evaluated.\n\nOption B: Willingness to consider the psychologist if acquitted. This seems like a fair approach, but again, it's more about the potential future action rather than the current decision.\n\nOption C: Consistency with the promotion policy. This seems important because organizations often have specific policies on how to handle promotions when there are pending investigations or charges against an employee. If the policy dictates that employees with unresolved charges should not be considered for promotion, then Dr. Hanson's recommendation would be in line with that policy, making his action ethical.\n\nOption D: Acting unethically by violating employment procedures. This seems contrary to what's described. If Dr. Hanson is making a decision based on an unresolved charge, it might be seen as precautionary or responsible, not unethical.\n\nGiven these considerations, Option C seems the most appropriate choice. By ensuring that his decision aligns with the organization's promotion policy, Dr. Hanson is acting ethically and responsibly. It shows that he's considering the broader context and established procedures of the facility.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that following the policy could be unethical in some circumstances? For example, if the policy was discriminatory or unfair, then following it might not be ethical. However, in this scenario, the policy is about not considering someone for promotion who has an unresolved charge of sexual harassment. This seems like a reasonable and ethical policy, aimed at maintaining a safe and respectful workplace.\n\nMoreover, ethical guidelines typically support the idea of following organizational policies, especially when they are designed to promote ethical behavior and prevent harm. So, in this case, Dr. Hanson's decision to follow the promotion policy would be in line with ethical practices.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is Option C: He has acted ethically as long as his decision is consistent with the stated promotion policy of the mental health facility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
