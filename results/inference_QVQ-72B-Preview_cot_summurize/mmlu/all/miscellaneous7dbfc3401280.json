Hmm, I need to think about this. I've heard of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" but I don't remember where it's set off the top of my head. Maybe I can eliminate some options that I know aren't correct.\n\nFirst, Dallas. I know that \"Dallas\" was another TV show, but that's not \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" So, maybe not Dallas. Next, Chicago. I know Chicago is a big city, and a lot of shows are set there, like \"Chicago Fire\" and \"Chicago P.D.,\" but again, I don't recall \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" being set there. Maybe not Chicago.\n\nThen there's New York. New York is a huge hub for TV shows; so many are set there. \"Seinfeld,\" \"Friends,\" \"Sex and the City\" \u2013 all set in New York. But again, I don't think \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is set in New York. Maybe I'm wrong. Wait, no, I think it's somewhere else.\n\nLastly, there's Minneapolis. That seems like a possibility. I seem to recall something about Mary Tyler Moore moving to Minneapolis or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the context of the show.\n\n\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" was a sitcom from the 1970s, right? It was about a single woman working in television news. I think she was a producer or something like that. Maybe I can recall more details.\n\nWait, I think the show was about Mary Richards, who was a single woman in her 30s, working in a TV newsroom in Minneapolis. Yeah, I think that rings a bell. I think the show was set in Minneapolis.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about the iconic opening sequence. I remember Mary Tyler Moore throwing her hat in the air in front of the Minneapolis City Hall. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, that would confirm that the show is set in Minneapolis.\n\nI don't think it's set in New York, Chicago, or Dallas. New York is where \"Murphy Brown\" was set, another show about a single woman in TV news, but not \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\"\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is Minneapolis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Minneapolis}} \\]"
