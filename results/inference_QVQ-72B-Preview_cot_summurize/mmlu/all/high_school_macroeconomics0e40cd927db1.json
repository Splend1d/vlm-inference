Land.\" Hmm, okay, let's try to understand this.\n\nFirst off, in economics, scarcity refers to the limited availability of resources relative to the unlimited wants and needs of people. So, resources are scarce because they are finite, and human desires are infinite.\n\nNow, the options are Labor, Capital, Human wants, and Land. Let's think about each one.\n\nStarting with Labor: Labor is one of the classic factors of production. It's the human effort used in the production of goods and services. People have to work to produce things, right? But is labor scarce? Well, in some contexts, there might be a lot of people willing to work, but in economic terms, labor is still considered a scarce resource because there's always a limit to how much labor is available at a given time and place. Also, skilled labor can be particularly scarce.\n\nNext, Capital: Capital includes things like machinery, buildings, and tools that are used to produce goods and services. These are also limited. We can't just have an infinite amount of capital goods; they take time and resources to produce. So, capital is definitely a scarce resource.\n\nThen, Land: Land refers to natural resources and the earth itself. Land is finite; there's only so much of it, and it's not equally distributed around the world. So, land is also a scarce resource.\n\nLastly, Human wants: This is interesting. Human wants are essentially our desires and needs. Economists consider that human wants are unlimited; people always want more of something, whether it's goods, services, or experiences. So, wants are not scarce because they are infinite, whereas resources to fulfill those wants are limited.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking which of these is not a scarce economic resource. So, if labor, capital, and land are all scarce, and human wants are not scarce because they are unlimited, then the answer should be C. Human wants.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective here. Perhaps in some contexts, wants could be considered scarce, but I don't think so. In standard economic theory, wants are considered unlimited, whereas resources are limited.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe the question is trying to trick me by including \"human wants\" as an option, knowing that wants are not a resource but rather what drives demand. But no, the question specifically says \"economic resource,\" and wants are indeed what drive the need for resources, but they themselves aren't resources.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Human wants. They are not a scarce economic resource because they are unlimited.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
