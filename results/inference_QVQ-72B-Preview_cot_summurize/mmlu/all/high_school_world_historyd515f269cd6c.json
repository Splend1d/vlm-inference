The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested.

I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment.

                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage about Mahatma Gandhi and his message on non-violence and boycotting foreign cloth. It's from 1921, and he's talking about addressing a meeting, the arrest of someone named Maulana Mohamed AH, and encouraging people to spin or weave their own cloth instead of buying foreign-made cloth. He also mentions striving for religious and national rights and maintaining Hindu-Muslim unity despite some troubles with the Moplahs.\n\nNow, the question is asking which historical development most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph. The options are:\n\nA. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies\n\nB. The Great Depression that started in 1929\n\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\n\nD. World War II\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the boycott is about. Gandhi is encouraging Indians to boycott foreign cloth and instead make their own cloth by spinning or weaving. This is part of the Swadeshi movement, which promoted self-reliance and independence from British goods. The ultimate success of this boycott would contribute to India's independence from British rule.\n\nSo, I need to think about how each of these historical developments could have assisted in the success of this boycott and, by extension, the independence movement in India.\n\nLet's consider option A: pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies. The Soviet Union, especially after its establishment in 1922, did advocate for anti-colonial movements, seeing them as allies against capitalism and imperialism. However, in the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet Union was primarily focused on its own internal development and consolidation. While it may have provided some support to anti-colonial movements, its influence was limited compared to other factors.\n\nOption B: The Great Depression that started in 1929. The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic downturn that had profound effects on many countries, including Britain. It led to economic hardships, unemployment, and a decline in trade. For Britain, which was ruling India, the depression meant financial strains and perhaps less ability to suppress independence movements effectively. Additionally, the depression might have made Indians more inclined to support local production and boycott foreign goods, as importing British textiles became more expensive or less desirable.\n\nOption C: The decolonization process already underway in Africa. In the 1920s, while there were movements for independence in some African countries, significant decolonization in Africa didn't occur until after World War II. So, in 1921, decolonization in Africa wasn't yet a major process, making this option less relevant to Gandhi's boycott at that time.\n\nOption D: World War II. World War II lasted from 1939 to 1945 and had a massive impact on Britain's resources and global standing. The war drained Britain's economy and military strength, making it more difficult for them to maintain their empire. Additionally, during the war, Indian nationalists saw an opportunity to press for independence, arguing that India should be free to determine its own future in the post-war world.\n\nConsidering these points, both the Great Depression and World War II had significant impacts on Britain and could have assisted the Indian independence movement. However, the Great Depression was a economic crisis that might have indirectly supported the boycott by making imports more costly, whereas World War II directly sapped Britain's strength and resources, making it harder for them to control their colonies.\n\nMoreover, during World War II, the British promised dominion status to India after the war, which was seen as a step towards independence. The Quit India Movement was launched in 1942, calling for immediate independence, and although it was suppressed, it increased pressure on Britain to grant independence.\n\nTherefore, World War II seems to have had a more direct and substantial impact on the ultimate success of the boycott and the independence movement in India.\n\nI think the answer is D. World War II.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
