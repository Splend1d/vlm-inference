                    "text": "So I've got this question here about criminal procedure, specifically regarding a defendant charged with first-degree murder. The question is asking when such a defendant should be furnished with a list containing the names and addresses of all prospective jurors. The options are:\n\nA. upon court order.\n\nB. upon request.\n\nC. upon request and showing of good cause.\n\nD. under no circumstances.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, I know that in criminal trials, especially in serious cases like first-degree murder, the selection of jurors is a crucial step. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to an impartial jury. So, ensuring that the defendant has information about the jury pool is important for exercising challenges, whether they be peremptory challenges or challenges for cause.\n\nNow, in many jurisdictions, there are rules about when and how much information about jurors can be provided to the defense. Some places have automatic procedures where certain information is provided, while others require a specific request or even a showing of why such information is necessary.\n\nOption A says \"upon court order.\" This suggests that the court has to decide, perhaps based on the circumstances of the case or upon motion by the defense, to provide the list. It's possible that in some jurisdictions, the court has discretion to provide such information.\n\nOption B is \"upon request.\" This might mean that if the defense asks for the list, they get it, perhaps as part of standard pre-trial discovery in serious cases.\n\nOption C adds \"upon request and showing of good cause.\" This implies that the defense not only has to ask for the list but also has to provide a reason why they need it, and that reason has to be sufficient for the court.\n\nOption D is \"under no circumstances,\" which seems pretty absolute. It would mean that under no scenario is the defendant entitled to know the names and addresses of prospective jurors.\n\nI need to think about which one of these is correct in the context of a first-degree murder trial.\n\nFirst, I should consider the general principles of jury selection. In most criminal trials, the defense is entitled to some information about potential jurors to help in the selection process. This can include basic demographic information, occupation, and sometimes more detailed information like answers to questionnaires.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, providing names and addresses of jurors is standard practice, at least upon request, to allow the defense to conduct their own investigations or to contact potential jurors for further information, though direct contact is usually regulated.\n\nHowever, there are also concerns about juror privacy and safety, especially in high-profile or potentially dangerous cases like first-degree murder. In such cases, courts might be more cautious about releasing juror information without sufficient safeguards.\n\nSo, considering that, it's possible that the defense wouldn't automatically get the list of juror names and addresses but would have to request it and possibly show why they need it.\n\nBut, on the other hand, in some jurisdictions, such information is provided as part of standard discovery in criminal trials, particularly in serious offenses where the stakes are high, and the defense needs as much information as possible to prepare their case.\n\nI should also consider if there are any specific rules or statutes that govern this process. For example, in federal courts, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure might provide guidance on this matter. Similarly, state courts have their own rules and procedures regarding juror information.\n\nLet me try to recall if there's any specific rule or case law that addresses this issue.\n\nI remember that in some states, juror lists are public records, and parties can obtain them upon request. However, there might be exceptions or restrictions, especially in cases where there's a risk to juror safety.\n\nIn the context of first-degree murder, where the defendant is accused of a violent crime, there might be concerns that knowing the jurors' identities could pose a risk of intimidation or retaliation. As a result, courts might require some showing of good cause before releasing such information.\n\nAlternatively, some courts might order that juror information be sealed or kept confidential to protect juror privacy and safety, especially if there are specific threats or risks identified.\n\nGiven that, option C\u2014upon request and showing of good cause\u2014seems plausible. It balances the defense's need for information with the need to protect jurors.\n\nBut, I should consider whether in some jurisdictions, such information is provided more routinely.\n\nFor example, in federal courts, under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 24 provides for the selection and service of jurors. It mentions that the court may permit the parties to conduct the examination of prospective jurors or may itself conduct the examination. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether juror lists with names and addresses are provided to the parties.\n\nPerhaps I need to look into case law that deals with juror anonymity and when juror information can be disclosed.\n\nI recall a case called United States v. Cronic, where the Supreme Court discussed the importance of the defendant's right to be present at critical stages of the trial, including jury selection. But that might not directly address the issue of juror information disclosure.\n\nAnother case that comes to mind is United States v. Gonzalez, where the court discussed the disclosure of juror information and the need for a showing of good cause.\n\nWait, I think there was a case called United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, where the Supreme Court addressed the right to select one's own counsel, but again, that's not directly on point.\n\nMaybe I should consider state-specific rules, as state courts handle the majority of criminal cases, including murder trials.\n\nFor instance, in California, which has a lot of high-profile cases, there are rules about juror anonymity and when juror information can be disclosed. In some cases, especially those involving serious crimes or public notoriety, courts may order that juror information be kept confidential to protect the jurors.\n\nSimilarly, in New York, there are procedures for obtaining juror lists, but there might be restrictions based on the nature of the case or specific concerns about juror safety.\n\nGiven that, it seems that in many jurisdictions, while juror information can be obtained, there might be additional hurdles in sensitive cases like first-degree murder.\n\nTherefore, option C\u2014upon request and showing of good cause\u2014seems like a reasonable answer.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should consider if there are any absolute prohibitions against disclosing juror information, which would align with option D.\n\nHowever, I don't think that's the case. While there are certainly measures to protect juror privacy and safety, I don't believe that there's a blanket rule preventing the defense from ever accessing juror information in first-degree murder cases.\n\nIn fact, in many instances, the defense is provided with juror lists to facilitate the selection process and to exercise their challenges effectively.\n\nTherefore, option D is unlikely to be correct.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, I need to decide which one best reflects the typical procedure in first-degree murder cases.\n\nOption B suggests that the list is provided upon request, without any additional requirements. While this might be true in some jurisdictions, especially in less serious cases, I think that in first-degree murder cases, where there are heightened concerns about juror safety, the court might require more than just a request.\n\nOption A says \"upon court order,\" which implies that the court has to make a decision, possibly after considering the defense's request and any opposing arguments from the prosecution or the court itself.\n\nHowever, option C adds the element of \"showing of good cause,\" which suggests that the defense has to provide a reason why they need the juror information, and that reason has to be sufficient for the court.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, especially in federal courts, a showing of good cause is required for obtaining certain types of discovery or information.\n\nGiven that, and considering the sensitivity of juror information in first-degree murder cases, I think option C is the most appropriate answer.\n\nTo confirm this, I can think about what \"good cause\" might entail in this context.\n\nGood cause could involve the defense needing the juror information to conduct background checks, to look for potential biases or connections to the case, or to prepare for voir dire examinations.\n\nIn first-degree murder cases, where the defense is likely to face significant challenges in selecting an impartial jury, having access to juror information could be crucial for ensuring a fair trial.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that the defense would have to request such information and provide a compelling reason for needing it.\n\nIn summary, I believe the correct answer is option C: upon request and showing of good cause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
