They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nWhen the author of the passage above discusses the \"second wall,\" to what is he referring?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from Martin Luther's \"Address to the Nobility of the German Nation,\" and he's talking about the \"second wall\" that the Romanists, or the Roman Catholic Church, have built to protect themselves from reform. He mentions three walls, but the focus here is on the second one. Let me try to understand what he's referring to.\n\nFirst, he says that if pressed by the temporal power, the Church claims that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, and that the spiritual power is above the temporal. That makes sense; it's about the relationship between church and state.\n\nThen, the second wall is about the Scriptures. If someone tries to admonish them with the Scriptures, they object that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope. So, essentially, they're saying that only the Pope has the authority to interpret the Bible.\n\nLuther goes on to criticize this position, saying that even though the Pope and the clergy may not be learned or pious, they claim that the Holy Spirit guides them and that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith. Luther finds this arrogant and points out that if the Pope is infallible, then there's no need for the Scriptures, which are the written Word of God.\n\nSo, in this context, the \"second wall\" is the Church's claim that only the Pope can interpret the Scriptures, and that the Pope is infallible in matters of faith.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of \"Holy Ghost\"\n\nThis seems a bit off because the passage is more about the interpretation of Scriptures and the Pope's infallibility, not specifically about the definition of the Holy Ghost.\n\nB. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts\n\nThis seems closer. The passage is indeed about the dispute over who has the right to interpret the Scriptures\u2014the Pope exclusively, or whether individuals can interpret them with the help of the Holy Spirit.\n\nC. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus\n\nThis isn't directly addressed in the passage. The focus is on the authority to interpret Scriptures and the Pope's infallibility, not specifically on the nature of Jesus' divinity.\n\nD. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism\n\nAgain, the passage doesn't discuss baptism. It's about the interpretation of Scriptures and the Pope's authority.\n\nSo, based on the content of the passage, option B seems to be the most accurate. The \"second wall\" refers to the disagreement between Catholics and Reformers over how biblical texts should be interpreted\u2014whether it's the sole prerogative of the Pope or whether believers can interpret the Scriptures for themselves under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's look back at the passage. Luther says that if they are pressed with the Scriptures, the Church objects that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope. Then he criticizes their assumption that the Holy Spirit dwells only in them, even if they are unlearned and wicked, and that they can decree whatever they like because the Holy Spirit guides them.\n\nThis clearly points to a conflict over the interpretation of Scriptures and the authority to do so, which aligns with option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
