With a seating capacity of 1,500, it is customarily leased for rock concerts, rodeos, sporting events, fashion shows, etc. In January, a rock star held a week-long concert there, drawing a full house each night. Generally, the city leases the auditorium's facilities for a charge of $2,000 per day. In February, a religious sect applied to rent the auditorium for its annual celebration. However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium. When their rental application was denied, the religious sect threatened to take legal action against the city council. They contended unfair discrimination inasmuch as other religious organizations had leased the auditorium in previous months for their religious gatherings. Amid this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the rental of the auditorium to any religious group. The ordinance was passed in a \"closed door\" session, which did not permit any debate or hearings on the matter. Is this newly enacted city ordinance likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.\nB. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. Yes, because the ordinance treats all religious groups equally.\nD. Yes, because a city ordinance is not a state action, per Se, and, therefore, is not subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a city auditorium and some issues with renting it out to different groups. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, the auditorium is owned by the city, right? So, it's a public facility, and they rent it out to various organizations for events like concerts, rodeos, fashion shows, etc. They have a standard rate of $2,000 per day.\n\nThen, in January, there was a big rock concert that sold out every night for a week, which is cool.\n\nIn February, a religious sect wanted to rent the auditorium for their annual celebration. But the city council voted 7 to 3 against letting them use it. When the sect threatened to sue for unfair discrimination, because other religious groups had used the auditorium before, the council passed an ordinance in a closed session that bans any religious group from renting the auditorium.\n\nNow, the question is whether this ordinance is likely to be constitutional. There are four options:\n\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not giving them a hearing.\n\nB. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups, violating the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nC. Yes, because the ordinance treats all religious groups equally.\n\nD. Yes, because a city ordinance isn't state action per se and isn't subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the auditorium is a public facility owned by the city. Cities are part of state governments, so actions by the city council are considered state actions for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. So, option D seems off because the Fourteenth Amendment does apply to city actions.\n\nNow, the council passed an ordinance that prohibits renting the auditorium to any religious group. This seems like it's treating all religious groups the same, but is that fair?\n\nWell, the issue is that this ordinance specifically targets religious groups. It's a classification based on religion, which is a sensitive area. The First Amendment protects the free exercise of religion, and the Fourteenth Amendment makes sure that states (including their cities) don't pass laws that infringe on that right without a compelling reason.\n\nSo, option B suggests that the ordinance violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption A mentions due process and the lack of a hearing. While it's true that procedural due process might require some sort of hearing or notice before depriving someone of a right, I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. The bigger problem seems to be the content of the ordinance itself, which discriminates based on religion.\n\nOption C says yes, because it treats all religious groups equally. But that doesn't seem right. Just because a law treats all members of a particular group the same doesn't mean it's constitutional if that group is being unfairly targeted. For example, a law that says no one can wear hats might treat everyone equally, but it could still be problematic if wearing hats is part of a religious practice.\n\nSo, I think option C is missing the point. The issue isn't about equality among religious groups but about whether it's permissible to single out religious groups at all in this context.\n\nOption B seems to hit the nail on the head. The free exercise clause is designed to protect religious practices from undue government interference. By passing an ordinance that bans religious groups from using the auditorium, the city is effectively saying that religious events are not welcome in a public facility that's otherwise available for various types of events.\n\nMoreover, the fact that other religious groups had used the auditorium before suggests that there might not be a neutral principle at play here, but rather a specific decision to exclude this particular group, leading to the broader ordinance.\n\nAlso, the way the ordinance was passed\u2014in a closed door session without debate or hearings\u2014might add to the suspicion that it wasn't a decision made with proper consideration of the constitutional implications.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the ordinance is likely to be held unconstitutional because it violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
