                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a pipe that's open at both ends, and at 20\u00b0C, it resonates at 440 Hz. Then, on a colder day when the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20\u00b0C, we need to find out at what frequency it resonates.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the resonant frequency of a pipe open at both ends is determined. I know that for such a pipe, the resonant frequencies are given by:\n\n\\[f = \\frac{v}{2L} \\times n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(f\\) is the frequency,\n\n- \\(v\\) is the speed of sound in air,\n\n- \\(L\\) is the length of the pipe,\n\n- \\(n\\) is an integer representing the harmonic number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nBut since the pipe is open at both ends, the fundamental frequency corresponds to n = 1.\n\nWait a minute, actually, for a pipe open at both ends, the resonant frequencies are harmonics, and the fundamental frequency is the first harmonic. So, the fundamental frequency should be:\n\n\\[f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L}\\]\n\nAnd higher harmonics are integer multiples of this fundamental frequency.\n\nGiven that at 20\u00b0C, the pipe resonates at 440 Hz, this must be one of its harmonic frequencies. But which one? To find out, I need to know the fundamental frequency or the harmonic number associated with 440 Hz.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify which harmonic corresponds to 440 Hz. That's a bit tricky. Maybe I can express the frequency in terms of the fundamental frequency.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\(f_n = n \\times f_1\\), where \\(f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L}\\).\n\nSo, \\(f_n = \\frac{n v}{2L}\\).\n\nGiven that at 20\u00b0C, \\(f_n = 440\\) Hz, we can write:\n\n\\[440 = \\frac{n v}{2L}\\]\n\nOn the cold day, the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20\u00b0C. Let's denote the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C as \\(v\\), and on the cold day as \\(v'\\). So, \\(v' = v - 0.03v = 0.97v\\).\n\nNow, the resonant frequency on the cold day for the same harmonic n would be:\n\n\\[f'_n = \\frac{n v'}{2L} = \\frac{n \\times 0.97v}{2L} = 0.97 \\times \\frac{n v}{2L} = 0.97 \\times f_n = 0.97 \\times 440\\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, if the frequency is proportional to the speed of sound, then decreasing the speed of sound by 3% should decrease the frequency by the same percentage.\n\nCalculating 0.97 times 440 Hz:\n\n\\[f'_n = 0.97 \\times 440 = 426.8 \\approx 427 \\text{ Hz}\\]\n\nLooking at the options, B. 427 Hz seems to be the answer.\n\nBut hold on, is this correct? The problem mentions that the pipe is open at both ends, so the harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. If 440 Hz corresponds to a particular harmonic, say the first harmonic (n=1), then reducing the speed of sound by 3% would indeed reduce the frequency by 3%. But what if 440 Hz corresponds to a higher harmonic?\n\nLet me check that. At 20\u00b0C, the speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s (though the exact value might vary, but for now, I'll assume it's 343 m/s at 20\u00b0C).\n\nIf the pipe is open at both ends, the fundamental frequency \\(f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L}\\).\n\nGiven that \\(f_n = n f_1\\), and \\(f_n = 440\\) Hz, then:\n\n\\[440 = n \\times \\frac{v}{2L}\\]\n\nBut without knowing L, the length of the pipe, it's hard to determine n directly. However, perhaps it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states \"the same pipe resonates at a frequency of 440 hertz,\" it's likely referring to one of its harmonic frequencies. Therefore, regardless of which harmonic it is, the frequency scales directly with the speed of sound.\n\nTherefore, if the speed of sound decreases by 3%, the resonant frequency for the same harmonic should also decrease by 3%.\n\nSo, \\(f' = 0.97 \\times 440 = 426.8\\) Hz, which rounds to 427 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 427 Hz.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the frequency besides the speed of sound.\n\nIn an open pipe, the resonant frequencies depend on the speed of sound and the length of the pipe. The temperature affects the speed of sound, which in turn affects the resonant frequencies.\n\nThe formula for the speed of sound in air is:\n\n\\[v = 331 + 0.6T\\]\n\nwhere T is the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, \\(v = 331 + 0.6 \\times 20 = 331 + 12 = 343\\) m/s.\n\nIf the speed of sound decreases by 3%, then \\(v' = 343 \\times 0.97 = 332.71\\) m/s.\n\nNow, the resonant frequency for the same harmonic is:\n\n\\[f' = \\frac{n v'}{2L} = 0.97 \\times \\frac{n v}{2L} = 0.97 \\times f_n = 0.97 \\times 440 = 426.8 \\text{ Hz}\\]\n\nSo, again, 427 Hz.\n\nAlternatively, if the pipe had one end closed, the formula would be different, but since it's open at both ends, this should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 427 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 427 \\ Hz} \\]"
