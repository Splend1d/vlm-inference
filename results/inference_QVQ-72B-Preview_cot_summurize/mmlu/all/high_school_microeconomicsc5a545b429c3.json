It says that when a firm is earning a normal profit from producing a good, which of the following is true?\n\nOption A: Total revenues from production are equal to explicit costs.\n\nOption B: Explicit costs are equal to implicit costs.\n\nOption C: Total revenues from production are equal to implicit costs.\n\nOption D: Total revenues from production are equal to the sum of explicit and implicit costs.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what a normal profit is. I think normal profit is when a firm covers all its costs, both explicit and implicit, but doesn't make any economic profit beyond that. So, economic profit is zero in that case.\n\nExplicit costs are the direct payments a firm makes, like wages, rent, materials, etc. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs, like the return the firm could have earned on its invested capital if it had been used elsewhere.\n\nSo, if a firm is earning a normal profit, it means that its total revenues are equal to its total costs, including both explicit and implicit costs.\n\nLet me look back at the options.\n\nOption A says total revenues equal explicit costs. But that doesn't sound right because firms have both explicit and implicit costs. If they're only covering explicit costs, they're probably making an economic profit or a loss, depending on the implicit costs.\n\nOption B says explicit costs equal implicit costs. That might not necessarily be true; these are two different types of costs and don't have to be equal, right?\n\nOption C says total revenues equal implicit costs. Again, firms have explicit costs too, so just covering implicit costs wouldn't account for those direct payments they have to make.\n\nOption D says total revenues equal the sum of explicit and implicit costs. That seems to align with my understanding of normal profit. When total revenues cover both explicit and implicit costs, the firm is earning a normal profit, meaning it's covering all its costs but not making any extra economic profit.\n\nLet me double-check this. If total revenues equal explicit costs plus implicit costs, then the firm is covering its total costs. Since implicit costs include the normal return to the firm's capital, this means the firm is earning what it needs to stay in business but isn't making any additional profit above that.\n\nSo, in this scenario, economic profit is zero because total revenues equal total costs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option D: total revenues from production are equal to the sum of explicit and implicit costs.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
