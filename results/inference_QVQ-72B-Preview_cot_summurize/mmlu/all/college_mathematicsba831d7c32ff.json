                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem. So, we have Sofia and Tess each choosing a random integer from 1 to 10. We need to find the probability that neither integer chosen is the square of the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for one number to be the square of the other. So, if one person picks 2 and the other picks 4, then 4 is the square of 2. Similarly, if someone picks 1 and 1, since 1 is the square of itself. Wait, but 1 is its own square, right? Okay, so pairs like (1,1), (2,4), (3,9) would be cases where one is the square of the other.\n\nBut the problem says \"neither integer chosen will be the square of the other.\" So, we need to find the probability that neither of the two numbers is the square of the other.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible outcomes. Each person chooses an integer from 1 to 10, independently. So, the total number of possible pairs is 10 \u00d7 10 = 100.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of pairs where neither number is the square of the other.\n\nFirst, let's identify the pairs where one number is the square of the other.\n\nLet\u2019s list out the squares of numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n1\u00b2 = 1\n\n2\u00b2 = 4\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n4\u00b2 = 16 (but 16 >10, so not relevant here)\n\n5\u00b2 = 25 (also >10)\n\n...\n\nSo, the only possible pairs where one is the square of the other are:\n\n(1,1), (2,4), (4,2), and (3,9), (9,3).\n\nWait, is (4,2) a pair where 4 is the square of 2? Yes, 4 is 2 squared. Similarly, 2 is the square root of 4, but the condition is that one is the square of the other, which holds both ways.\n\nSo, the pairs to exclude are:\n\n(1,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,9), (9,3).\n\nAre there any other pairs where one number is the square of the other? Let's check:\n\nIs there any number whose square is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 10? Well, 2.5 squared is 6.25, which is not an integer, so no. Similarly, 3.5 squared is 12.25, which is beyond 10. So, no other pairs.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 pairs where one number is the square of the other: (1,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,9), (9,3).\n\nSo, the number of pairs where neither is the square of the other is 100 - 5 = 95.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 95/100 = 0.95.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.64\n\nB. 0.72\n\nC. 0.81\n\nD. 0.95\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 0.95.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check if there are any other pairs where one number is the square of the other.\n\nWe have (1,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,9), (9,3). That's all, right? Because 4\u00b2=16>10, and 3\u00b2=9, which is included, and 9\u00b2=81>10. So, no more squares within 1 to 10.\n\nAlso, check if there are any pairs where both numbers are squares of each other, like (1,1). Yes, that's already included.\n\nSo, yeah, 5 such pairs, total of 100 - 5 = 95 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.95.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.95} \\]"
