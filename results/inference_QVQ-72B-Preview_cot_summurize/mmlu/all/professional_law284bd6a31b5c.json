                    "text": "So I've got this contract dispute between an actress and a photographer. Let me try to understand what's going on here. They signed a contract on October 15th, where the photographer agreed to provide twelve glossy prints that would capture the actress as a gifted dramatic actress with varied talents. The prints were supposed to be delivered by November 15th, and the actress would pay $1,500 thirty days after that.\n\nThe contract also had a guarantee that the prints would be fully satisfactory and delivered on time. But then, the photographer had an accident the next day, broke his leg, and couldn't photograph the actress until October 31st. Because of this delay, he told the actress that he'd need a few more days beyond November 15th to deliver the prints. The actress said to hurry because she needed the photos for a promotional portfolio for a movie role.\n\nThe photographer worked quickly and delivered the prints on November 18th, which was two days late. The actress's manager thought they were acceptable, but the next day, the actress called and said the prints were awful, made her look horrible, and she was sending them back without paying anything. Now, she's thinking of suing the photographer for breach of contract.\n\nI need to figure out what the photographer's best defense would be if the actress sues him. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The photographs, if subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory.\n\nB. The photographs, if objectively viewed, were not satisfactory.\n\nC. The photographs were not delivered on time, thereby resulting in a failure of condition precedent to the actress's liability.\n\nD. The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each option means.\n\nOption A talks about subjective satisfaction. So, whether the photographs are satisfactory based on the actress's personal feelings or opinions. But the contract says the prints are guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and delivered on time. If the actress is the one deciding what's satisfactory, then her subjective opinion matters. However, if the contract specifies certain objective standards, then it might be different.\n\nOption B mentions objective satisfaction. This would mean whether the photographs meet some external, measurable standards, perhaps industry standards or what a reasonable person would consider satisfactory.\n\nOption C refers to a condition precedent. A condition precedent is a condition that must be met before a party's performance is due. If delivery on time was a condition precedent to the actress's liability, then failing to deliver on time might release her from her obligation to pay. But I need to see if that's the case here.\n\nOption D talks about temporary impracticability of performance due to the photographer's injury. This relates to whether the photographer can be excused from performing on time because of circumstances beyond his control.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the contract guaranteed that the prints would be fully satisfactory and delivered on time. So, there are two main aspects here: the quality of the prints and the timeliness of delivery.\n\nThe prints were delivered late, by two days, and the actress claims they are awful and make her look horrible.\n\nLet's address the quality issue first.\n\nThe contract says the prints are guaranteed to be fully satisfactory. But what does \"satisfactory\" mean in this context? Is it subjective, meaning it's up to the actress's personal taste and feelings, or is it objective, meaning it has to meet certain standards that can be measured independently of her opinion?\n\nIf it's subjective, then the actress's say-so is final. If she's not happy with them, that's that. But if it's objective, then there might be a way to assess whether the prints meet some standard beyond her personal preference.\n\nLooking back at the contract, it says \"fully satisfactory,\" but doesn't specify whether that's subjective or objective. In many contracts, especially in creative fields like photography, satisfaction is often subjective because it's about personal taste and preferences.\n\nHowever, in some contracts, there might be more objective criteria, like resolution, color accuracy, etc.\n\nI think I need to consider whether the contract specifies any objective standards or if it leaves satisfaction to the actress's discretion.\n\nGiven that the contract says \"designed to capture and convey the actress as a gifted dramatic actress with varied talents,\" there seems to be some subjective element involved. It's not just about technical specifications; it's about how the actress is portrayed and perceived, which can be quite subjective.\n\nSo, if the actress says the prints are awful and make her look horrible, and the contract allows for her subjective satisfaction, then her say-so might be enough to reject them.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there are industry standards or previous examples that can be used to judge the quality of the prints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the photographer can argue that the prints are, in fact, satisfactory based on objective measures or industry standards.\n\nNow, moving on to the timeliness issue.\n\nThe prints were supposed to be delivered by November 15th but were delivered on November 18th, which is two days late.\n\nThe actress is claiming that the late delivery is another reason not to pay.\n\nOption C mentions a condition precedent. A condition precedent is a condition that must be fulfilled before a party's performance is required.\n\nIn this case, if delivering the prints on time was a condition precedent to the actress's liability to pay, then failing to deliver on time would mean she doesn't have to pay.\n\nBut I need to see if that's the case here.\n\nThe contract says the prints are to be delivered on or before November 15th, with payment of $1,500 thirty days thereafter.\n\nDoes this make delivery on time a condition precedent to the actress's liability? Maybe.\n\nIn contract law, timing can be crucial, especially if the contract specifies a date by which performance must occur.\n\nHowever, not all delays in performance constitute a breach that relieves the other party from their obligations.\n\nSometimes, delays are excused if they're due to circumstances beyond the control of the performing party.\n\nIn this case, the photographer had an accident and was injured, which caused the delay.\n\nThis brings us to Option D: temporary impracticability of performance due to the photographer's injury.\n\nImpracticability is a doctrine in contract law that allows a party to be excused from performing when performance becomes excessively burdensome or difficult due to unforeseen events.\n\nIn this scenario, the photographer's injury was unforeseen and beyond his control, which led to the delay in photographing the actress and, consequently, in delivering the prints.\n\nIf the photographer can show that his injury made it temporarily impracticable for him to perform on time, he might be excused from the delay, provided that he performed as soon as reasonably possible after the impediment was removed.\n\nIn this case, he photographed the actress on October 31st instead of October 16th (assuming he needed a certain amount of time after the contract to prepare and schedule the shoot), and delivered the prints on November 18th, which was two days late.\n\nIf the injury caused the delay, and he worked diligently to minimize the delay once he was able to work again, that might be a valid defense.\n\nNow, considering all this, which option is the best defense for the photographer?\n\nOption A: subjective satisfaction \u2013 if the contract allows for the actress's subjective satisfaction, then her say-so is probably enough to reject the prints. However, the photographer might argue that her dissatisfaction is unreasonable or that there are objective standards that the prints meet.\n\nOption B: objective satisfaction \u2013 if there are industry standards or other objective measures that the prints meet, the photographer might argue that the prints are satisfactory despite the actress's personal feelings.\n\nOption C: condition precedent \u2013 if delivering on time was a condition precedent to the actress's liability, then being late might relieve her from paying. However, the photographer might argue that the delay was excusable due to circumstances beyond his control.\n\nOption D: temporary impracticability \u2013 this seems relevant because the photographer's injury was unforeseen and beyond his control, causing the delay.\n\nI think Option D is the strongest defense here.\n\nFirst, the photographer's injury was an unforeseen event that made it temporarily impracticable for him to perform on the original timeline.\n\nSecond, he informed the actress about the delay and worked diligently to minimize it, delivering the prints only two days late.\n\nThird, the delay was caused by something outside his control, and he took reasonable steps to mitigate its effects.\n\nTherefore, the photographer can argue that his duty to perform on time was excused due to temporary impracticability, and that he performed within a reasonable time after the impediment was removed.\n\nAs for the quality issue, if the actress is dissatisfied subjectively, but the prints meet objective standards, the photographer might still have a defense on that front, but based on the contract's guarantee of satisfaction, it might be harder.\n\nHowever, given that the main issue seems to be the late delivery and the actress's dissatisfaction, which might be subjective, focusing on the impracticability defense for the delay seems like the best approach.\n\nSo, I would say that Option D is the photographer's best defense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
