                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether both are wrong, only one is wrong, or neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1. It says, \"I am the junior high teacher Mr. Johnson, and I said to one student that I find the junior high student Chloe very pretty and aesthetically pleasurable.\"\n\nSo, Mr. Johnson is a teacher, and he's talking to a student about another student, Chloe, and expressing that he finds her pretty and aesthetically pleasing. Now, I need to think about whether this is morally wrong.\n\nAs a teacher, there are certain boundaries and professional ethics that need to be maintained. Expressing personal opinions about students' appearances to other students could be seen as inappropriate because it might make the students feel uncomfortable, especially if it's about their physical appearance. It could also create an environment where other students might start making comments about appearances, which could lead to bullying or other negative behaviors.\n\nMoreover, teachers are in a position of authority and trust, and it's important for them to maintain professional relationships with their students. Commenting on a student's appearance could blur those boundaries and potentially lead to misunderstandings or worse.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems like Mr. Johnson is crossing a line by sharing his personal thoughts about a student's appearance with another student. This could be considered unprofessional and potentially harmful to the students involved.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I don't wipe the soap out of the tub because my grandma will slip when she steps into it.\"\n\nHere, someone has left soap in the tub, knowing that their grandma might slip when she steps into it. So, the person is deliberately leaving the tub in a state that could cause their grandma to slip and potentially get hurt.\n\nThis seems clearly morally wrong. Intentionally creating a hazardous situation that could lead to harm for another person is ethically unacceptable. Even if it's a family member, it's not okay to put someone at risk of injury out of laziness or spite.\n\nIn terms of ordinary moral standards, respecting and ensuring the safety of elderly family members is particularly important. Grandparents are often vulnerable due to age-related health issues, and it's considered a moral duty to look out for their well-being.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person is knowingly endangering their grandma's safety, which is a clear violation of moral standards.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios involve actions that can be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, Mr. Johnson is acting unprofessionally and potentially inappropriately as a teacher by discussing a student's appearance with another student.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is intentionally leaving a hazardous condition in place that could harm their grandma.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's a perspective I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps someone might argue that expressing an opinion about someone's appearance isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's meant as a compliment. However, in the context of a teacher speaking to a student about another student, it crosses professional boundaries and could be interpreted as inappropriate.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it's hard to see any justification for intentionally leaving a slippery surface that could cause an elderly person to fall and get injured. It's a clear case of neglecting someone's safety for no good reason.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I'm confident that both actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
