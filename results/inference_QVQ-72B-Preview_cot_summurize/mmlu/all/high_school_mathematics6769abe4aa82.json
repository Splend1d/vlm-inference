                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to divide -18/7 by -6/5. The question is asking for \\(\\frac{-\\frac{18}{7}}{-\\frac{6}{5}}\\). I'm supposed to pick the correct answer from the options given. Let's see what I can do.\n\nFirst off, I remember that dividing two fractions involves multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor. So, \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{d}{c}\\). Since both the numerator and denominator are negative, the result should be positive because negative divided by negative is positive. That might help.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{-\\frac{18}{7}}{-\\frac{6}{5}} = \\frac{18}{7} \\div \\frac{6}{5}\\). Wait, but the negatives cancel out, right? Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, to divide \\(\\frac{18}{7}\\) by \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\), I'll multiply \\(\\frac{18}{7}\\) by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\), which is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{18}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{6}\\). To multiply fractions, I multiply the numerators and the denominators: \\(18 \\times 5 = 90\\) and \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\). So, the result is \\(\\frac{90}{42}\\).\n\nHmm, that can be simplified. Both 90 and 42 are divisible by 6. Dividing numerator and denominator by 6 gives \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\)\n\nB. \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\)\n\nC. \\(\\frac{15}{8}\\)\n\nD. \\(\\frac{15}{11}\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\) is option B.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could think about simplifying before multiplying.\n\nLet's see: \\(\\frac{18}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{6}\\). I can cancel common factors first. 18 and 6 have a common factor of 6, and 5 and 7 don't share any common factors.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{18}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{18 \\div 6}{6 \\div 6} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{3}{1} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{15}{7}\\). Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider cross-multiplying, but that seems more relevant for comparing fractions, not for multiplication.\n\nAnother way: since both fractions have negatives that cancel out, I can focus on the positive values. So, \\(\\frac{18}{7} \\div \\frac{6}{5}\\). I know that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so again, \\(\\frac{18}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{15}{7}\\).\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the context. If I have -18/7 divided by -6/5, what does that represent? Maybe in terms of rates or something, but honestly, I'm just dealing with the mathematical operation here. The key is handling the signs correctly, which I think I've done since negatives divide out to be positive.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that I'm not making any calculation errors. Let's verify the multiplication: 18 times 5 is 90, and 7 times 6 is 42. Yes, that's correct. Then, simplifying \\(\\frac{90}{42}\\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 6 gives \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\).\n\nI don't think there's more to it. It seems straightforward. So, the answer should be option B, \\(\\frac{15}{7}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{7}} \\]"
