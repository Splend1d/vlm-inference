                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem about segment reporting. So, Swift Co. has three operating segments: A, B, and C. I need to figure out which of these segments should be separately disclosed in their financial statements for the year ended December 31, year 2. The options are combinations of A, B, and C, so I have to determine which ones meet the criteria for separate disclosure.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the general rules for segment reporting. I think there are specific thresholds that a segment must meet to require separate disclosure. From what I remember, there are tests related to revenue, profit or loss, and assets. These are called the \"quantitative thresholds\" for segment reporting.\n\nLet me list out the data provided:\n\n- Segment A:\n\n- Reported revenue: $42,000\n\n- Reported profit/loss: $12,000\n\n- Assets: $470,000\n\n- Segment B:\n\n- Reported revenue: $121,000\n\n- Reported profit/loss: $65,000\n\n- Assets: $800,000\n\n- Segment C:\n\n- Reported revenue: $14,000\n\n- Reported profit/loss: ($3,000)\n\n- Assets: $80,000\n\n- Total:\n\n- Revenue: $177,000\n\n- Profit/loss: $74,000\n\n- Assets: $1,350,000\n\nI should also note that all figures are in thousands.\n\nNow, according to the accounting standards, specifically IFRS 8 or US GAAP, there are three tests to determine if a segment should be reported:\n\n1. The revenue test: a segment's external revenues should be at least 10% of the combined revenues of all segments.\n\n2. The profit/loss test: the absolute amount of the segment's reported profit or loss should be at least 10% of the greater of:\n\n- The combined reported profits of all profitable segments, or\n\n- The combined reported losses of all loss-making segments.\n\n3. The asset test: the segment's assets should be at least 10% of the combined assets of all segments.\n\nI need to apply each of these tests to each segment to see if they meet the criteria.\n\nLet's start with the revenue test.\n\nRevenue Test:\n\nA segment's external revenues should be at least 10% of the combined revenues of all segments.\n\nCombined revenues = $177,000\n\n10% of combined revenues = $17,700\n\nNow, check each segment's external revenues against this threshold.\n\nSegment A: $42,000 > $17,700 \u2192 passes\n\nSegment B: $121,000 > $17,700 \u2192 passes\n\nSegment C: $14,000 < $17,700 \u2192 fails\n\nSo, segments A and B pass the revenue test, while C does not.\n\nNext, the profit/loss test.\n\nProfit/Loss Test:\n\nThe absolute amount of the segment's reported profit or loss should be at least 10% of the greater of:\n\n- The combined reported profits of all profitable segments, or\n\n- The combined reported losses of all loss-making segments.\n\nFirst, identify the profitable and loss-making segments.\n\nProfitable segments:\n\n- A: $12,000\n\n- B: $65,000\n\nLoss-making segments:\n\n- C: ($3,000)\n\nCombined profits = $12,000 + $65,000 = $77,000\n\nCombined losses = $3,000\n\nSo, the greater of combined profits or losses is $77,000.\n\nNow, 10% of $77,000 is $7,700.\n\nThis means that any segment's absolute profit or loss must be at least $7,700 to pass the profit/loss test.\n\nCheck each segment:\n\nSegment A: $12,000 > $7,700 \u2192 passes\n\nSegment B: $65,000 > $7,700 \u2192 passes\n\nSegment C: $3,000 < $7,700 \u2192 fails\n\nSo, again, segments A and B pass, and C fails.\n\nFinally, the asset test.\n\nAsset Test:\n\nA segment's assets should be at least 10% of the combined assets of all segments.\n\nCombined assets = $1,350,000\n\n10% of combined assets = $135,000\n\nCheck each segment's assets:\n\nSegment A: $470,000 > $135,000 \u2192 passes\n\nSegment B: $800,000 > $135,000 \u2192 passes\n\nSegment C: $80,000 < $135,000 \u2192 fails\n\nOnce more, segments A and B pass, while C fails.\n\nNow, according to the accounting standards, if a segment passes any one of these three tests, it should be reported separately. However, there's also a concept of \"clearly immaterial\" segments where, if a segment doesn't pass any of the tests and is deemed immaterial, it doesn't need separate disclosure.\n\nBut in this case, segments A and B pass all three tests, while segment C fails all three. Therefore, segments A and B are required to be separately disclosed, and segment C is not.\n\nWait a minute, but the options include combinations involving C. Why is that?\n\nOption A: A and B only\n\nOption B: A and C only\n\nOption C: B and C only\n\nOption D: A, B, and C\n\nGiven that A and B pass all tests, and C fails all, it seems like A and B should be disclosed separately, and C shouldn't. So, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something about the \"clearly immaterial\" rule or perhaps there are other considerations.\n\nI recall that even if a segment doesn't pass the quantitative thresholds, if it's considered material based on qualitative factors, it might still need to be reported separately. However, in this problem, it seems like the quantitative thresholds are sufficient to make the determination.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if a segment's revenues are less than 10% but combined with another segment, they might still need to be reported. But in this case, segment C is only $14,000, which is less than 10%, and combined with others, it still doesn't push it over any thresholds.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, segments A and B should be separately disclosed, while segment C is not required to be.\n\nWait, but maybe there's something about the internal transfers or intersegment revenues. The problem mentions \"reported revenue,\" which I assume is external revenue.\n\nAlso, the total revenues are $177,000, and there are no mentions of intersegment revenues, so I think it's safe to assume that all revenues are external.\n\nAnother point: the profit or loss includes both operating and non-operating items, or just operating?\n\nI think in segment reporting, it's the segment profit or loss before corporate items.\n\nBut in this problem, since we're given reported profit/loss, I assume it's the segment's operating profit or loss.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here. The answer should be option A: A and B only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
