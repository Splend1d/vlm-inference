                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options would most effectively help the government avoid the free rider problem. Let's start by making sure I understand what a free rider problem is. I think it's when people benefit from something without paying for it, right? Like, they're riding for free on the efforts of others.\n\nOkay, so in the context of economics, the free rider problem usually comes up with public goods. Public goods are things like national defense, street lighting, or clean air\u2014they're non-excludable (meaning it's hard to prevent people from using them) and non-rivalrous (one person's use doesn't reduce availability for others). Because of that, people might be tempted to let others pay for the good and then just enjoy it without contributing. That's the free rider problem.\n\nSo, the government wants to avoid this problem. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Enact stricter antitrust legislation.\n\nAntitrust laws are about preventing monopolies and promoting competition in the marketplace. While important, I don't see a direct connection between antitrust legislation and the free rider problem in public goods. Monopolies might relate more to market power and prices, not to people freeloading on public goods.\n\nB. Provide more complete information about the relevant goods.\n\nHmm, information can be crucial for many economic issues. If people have better information about the benefits of a public good, maybe they'll be more willing to contribute to it. But in the case of public goods, especially those provided by the government, people often don't have a direct way to contribute beyond taxes. So, while more information might make people appreciate the public good more, it's not clear how it directly addresses the free rider problem.\n\nC. Supply public goods using tax dollars.\n\nThis seems straightforward. The government collects taxes from everyone and uses that money to provide public goods. This way, everyone contributes whether they want to or not, which prevents people from freeloading. It's a compulsory way to ensure that the public good is provided at an optimal level.\n\nD. Tax those creating negative externalities.\n\nNegative externalities are costs imposed on others by an economic activity, like pollution from a factory. Taxing these activities can discourage them and make the polluters pay for the harm they cause. This is related to correcting market failures, but it's not directly about the free rider problem in public goods. It's more about making sure that private costs reflect social costs.\n\nSo, comparing these options, C seems to be the most directly relevant to addressing the free rider problem in public goods. By using tax dollars to supply public goods, the government ensures that everyone contributes to the provision of these goods, thereby preventing people from riding for free on others' contributions.\n\nBut let me think about this a bit more. Is there any way that option D could indirectly help with the free rider problem? For example, if you tax negative externalities, you might improve environmental quality, which is a public good. But that seems like a indirect approach compared to directly funding public goods through taxes.\n\nOption B, providing more information, might help in some cases, but it's not a guarantee that people will voluntarily contribute more. Plus, in many cases, public goods are best provided through compulsory taxation to ensure everyone pays their share.\n\nOption A, stricter antitrust legislation, seems unrelated to the free rider problem in public goods.\n\nTherefore, I think the most effective way for the government to avoid the free rider problem is to supply public goods using tax dollars. That way, everyone contributes, and the public good is provided efficiently without relying on voluntary contributions that might not be sufficient due to freeloading.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
