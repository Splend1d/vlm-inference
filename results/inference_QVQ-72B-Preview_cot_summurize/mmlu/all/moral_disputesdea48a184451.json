It involves the idea of alternative actions open to the agent.\n\nC. It is a strongly impartialist moral theory.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, what is consequentialist moral theory? Consequentialism is a type of ethical theory that judges the rightness or wrongness of an action based on the consequences it produces. The most famous form of consequentialism is utilitarianism, which promotes the greatest happiness principle.\n\nNow, let's look at option A: It is a value-based theory.\n\nConsequentialism does seem to be value-based because it evaluates actions based on their outcomes or consequences. These consequences are typically valued in terms of happiness, well-being, or some other measure of good. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B: It involves the idea of alternative actions open to the agent.\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. In consequentialism, when making a moral decision, one does consider the possible alternatives and their respective consequences. The idea is to choose the action that leads to the best overall outcome. So, yes, consequentialism does involve considering alternative actions and their potential consequences to determine which action is morally right.\n\nOption C: It is a strongly impartialist moral theory.\n\nImpartiality in moral theories generally means that moral considerations shouldn't favor one person over another without good reason. Strong impartiality might suggest that no one's interests should be given extra weight solely based on personal relationships or characteristics like social status.\n\nConsequentialism, especially utilitarianism, is often seen as impartial because it aims to maximize overall happiness or well-being, without giving special consideration to particular individuals. However, there are debates about whether consequentialism is perfectly impartial. For example, some forms of consequentialism might allow for partiality towards certain individuals in certain situations.\n\nBut generally, consequentialism tries to be impartial in the sense that each person's happiness counts equally. So, I think this is also a feature of consequentialist moral theory.\n\nGiven that all three options seem to be features of consequentialist moral theory, the answer should be D: all of the above.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure. Maybe one of these isn't necessarily a feature of consequentialism.\n\nLet me double-check option A: It is a value-based theory.\n\nConsequentialism does base its judgments on the value of outcomes. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: Involves the idea of alternative actions open to the agent.\n\nYes, consequentialism requires comparing different possible actions to see which one leads to the best consequences.\n\nOption C: Strongly impartialist moral theory.\n\nWhile consequentialism aims for impartiality, there might be some exceptions or interpretations that allow for some partiality. However, in general, consequentialism does prioritize impartiality.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
