                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal question about voluntary intoxication as a defense for criminal battery. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, the scenario is that there's a party where everyone, including the adults, has been drinking a lot of beer. They decide to play baseball, and there's an argument over a call made by the umpire, who's also drunk. The host gets really angry about the call and hits the umpire in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire decides to press charges once he sobers up, and the host is charged with criminal battery.\n\nNow, at trial, the defense is trying to use voluntary intoxication as a defense, arguing that the host wasn't mentally capable of forming the intent to commit battery because he was too drunk.\n\nI need to determine whether this defense is going to be successful based on the given options.\n\nOption A says yes, because criminal battery is a specific intent crime, and voluntary intoxication can be asserted as a defense in such cases.\n\nOption B says yes, because voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.\n\nOption C says no, because the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which prevents him from using this defense.\n\nOption D says no, because criminal battery is a general intent crime, and the defense of voluntary intoxication isn't available for those.\n\nAlright, so I need to understand a few things here:\n\n1. What is criminal battery?\n\n2. Is it a specific intent or general intent crime?\n\n3. How does voluntary intoxication affect the mens rea required for the crime?\n\nLet me start by understanding what criminal battery is.\n\nI know that battery is generally defined as the intentional infliction of harmful or offensive contact upon another person without their consent. So, in this case, hitting someone in the face and breaking their nose would likely qualify as battery.\n\nNow, the key here is whether this is a specific intent or general intent crime.\n\nSpecific intent crimes require that the defendant had the purpose or desire to bring about a specific result, whereas general intent crimes only require that the defendant intended to perform the act that constitutes the crime, without necessarily intending the result.\n\nIn the case of battery, is it a specific intent crime where the defendant must have the specific intent to harm or offend, or is it a general intent crime where just intending to make contact is enough?\n\nI think it varies by jurisdiction, but generally, battery is considered a general intent crime because the essence of the crime is the intentional application of force without consent, not necessarily with the specific intent to harm.\n\nWait, but sometimes there's confusion between assault and battery. Assault is often a specific intent crime, intending to cause fear of imminent harm, whereas battery is about the actual harmful or offensive contact.\n\nSo, in many legal systems, battery is seen as a general intent crime because the intent to make contact is sufficient, even if there wasn't an intent to harm.\n\nBut I should check this more carefully.\n\nLet me look up whether criminal battery is considered a specific or general intent crime.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that in most jurisdictions, battery is considered a general intent crime. The defendant must intend to make contact, but not necessarily intend to cause harm beyond that.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then voluntary intoxication wouldn't be a defense because it's only applicable to specific intent crimes.\n\nBut let's make sure about that.\n\nI recall that voluntary intoxication can be used as a defense to negate the mental state required for a crime, but only if the crime requires a specific intent.\n\nSo, if battery is a general intent crime, then being voluntarily intoxicated wouldn't excuse the behavior because the intent to make contact is still present, even if the defendant didn't intend the exact harm that occurred.\n\nIn other words, the host intended to hit the umpire, even if he didn't intend to break his nose specifically.\n\nTherefore, the defense of voluntary intoxication wouldn't be successful in this scenario because battery is a general intent crime.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because criminal battery is a specific intent crime.\n\nBut I think it's not a specific intent crime.\n\nB. Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.\n\nBut this seems too broad. Not all crimes with mens rea allow voluntary intoxication as a defense.\n\nC. No, because the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball.\n\nThis is interesting. So, maybe there's some negligence involved in setting up the situation, but does that preclude using voluntary intoxication as a defense for the specific act of battery?\n\nI'm not sure about this one.\n\nD. No, because criminal battery is a general intent crime and voluntary intoxication isn't available as a defense.\n\nThis seems to align with what I've concluded.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother consideration: even if battery is considered a general intent crime, is there any way that voluntary intoxication could still be a defense?\n\nWell, sometimes, in specific circumstances, if the intoxication was so severe that it made the defendant unable to form any intent at all, perhaps there's a argument there.\n\nBut generally, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense to general intent crimes.\n\nMoreover, public policy often disfavors allowing defendants to use their self-induced intoxication as a defense, especially for crimes like battery where intent to make contact is sufficient.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the host allowed a group of drunk men to play baseball might indicate recklessness or negligence, but that doesn't directly affect the defense of voluntary intoxication for the specific act of battery.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: No, because criminal battery is a general intent crime, and the defense of voluntary intoxication isn't available.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
