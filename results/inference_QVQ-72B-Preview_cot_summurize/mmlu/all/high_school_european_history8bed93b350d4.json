In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about John Calvin and his writings. The passage is from his \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\" dated 1559. It's talking about election and grace and all that, but the question at the end is about another religion that started around the same time as Calvinism and was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism. The options are Huguenots, Lutherans, Presbyterians, or Anabaptists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Calvinism is and when it started. John Calvin was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation, and his ideas formed the basis of Calvinism. He was active in the 16th century, particularly in Geneva, Switzerland. His teachings emphasized predestination, the sovereignty of God, and the authority of the Bible.\n\nNow, the question is asking about another religion that started around the same time as Calvinism, which would be in the 16th century, and was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Huguenots: I know that the Huguenots were French Protestants. They were followers of Calvinism in France. They faced a lot of persecution, including the famous St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572. But they weren't destroyed as a movement; in fact, they continued to exist and were recognized in the Edict of Nantes in 1598. So, they weren't destroyed, and their main belief was Calvinism, not adult baptism and pacifism specifically.\n\nB. Lutherans: Lutheranism was founded by Martin Luther, another key figure in the Reformation, a bit earlier than Calvin. Lutherans believe in baptism of infants, which is contrary to the idea of adult baptism. Also, while there were pacifist Lutherans, pacifism isn't a core tenet of Lutheranism. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nC. Presbyterians: Presbyterianism is another branch of Protestantism that developed around the same time, influenced by Calvin's ideas. It's similar to Calvinism in many ways, especially in its theology of predestination and the organization of the church. Presbyterians also practice infant baptism, not adult baptism. They faced persecution in Scotland and England, but again, they weren't destroyed as a movement. They're still around today.\n\nD. Anabaptists: Now, Anabaptists were a group that emerged during the Reformation, around the same time as Calvinism. They were known for their belief in adult baptism, or believer's baptism, which means that only those who have made a personal choice to follow Christ should be baptized. They also advocated for the separation of church and state and were strongly pacifist, refusing to bear arms or take oaths. This put them at odds with both Catholics and other Protestants, who practiced infant baptism and often supported the state's use of force.\n\nAnabaptists faced severe persecution from all sides. They were seen as radicals and a threat to the established order. Many were martyred for their beliefs, and their movement was heavily suppressed. However, despite the persecution, Anabaptism didn't disappear completely. It gave rise to various groups, including the Mennonites and Amish, who continue to practice adult baptism and pacifism to this day.\n\nGiven this background, Anabaptists seem to fit the description in the question: they started around the same time as Calvinism, were destroyed (or at least severely persecuted to the point of near destruction) for supporting adult baptism and pacifism.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure:\n\n- Huguenots: French Calvinists, faced persecution but weren't destroyed as a movement.\n\n- Lutherans: Earlier than Calvinism, believed in infant baptism, and while some were pacifist, it wasn't a defining characteristic of the movement.\n\n- Presbyterians: Similar to Calvinism, practiced infant baptism, faced persecution but survived and thrived.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D. Anabaptists.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that the question could be interpreted differently. For example, maybe \"destroyed\" doesn't mean the complete eradication of the group, but significant suppression. However, even with that interpretation, Anabaptists still fit best because they were heavily persecuted and their movement was suppressed more severely than the others listed.\n\nAlso, the specific beliefs of adult baptism and pacifism align closely with Anabaptist teachings, whereas the other groups either practiced infant baptism or didn't emphasize pacifism as strongly.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. Anabaptists.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Anabaptists}} \\]"
