                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a skin care company testing their new acne cream formula against their old one. They did a double-blind randomized experiment where volunteers used both formulas on different sides of their faces, and the sides were decided randomly. Then, they measured the difference in the number of pimples between the old and new formulas for each person. Now, they want to know which significance test to use to compare the effectiveness of the two formulas.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. First, I need to understand the design of the experiment. It's a double-blind randomized experiment, which means that both the volunteers and the people evaluating the results didn't know which side was getting which formula. That's to prevent bias in the observations. They had volunteers use two different formulas on different sides of their faces, and the assignment was random.\n\nSo, each volunteer is acting as their own control in a way, because they're using both the old and new formulas. This is called a paired design because you're comparing two treatments on the same subject. In this case, each subject has two measurements: one for the old formula and one for the new formula, each on one side of their face.\n\nThe response variable is the difference in the number of pimples between the old and new formulas for each volunteer. Specifically, it's the difference in the number of pimples on the side with the old formula minus the number on the side with the new formula.\n\nNow, I need to choose the correct significance test from the options given:\n\nA. A two-proportion z-test\n\nB. A two-sample t-test\n\nC. A matched pairs t-test\n\nD. A chi-square test of independence\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: a two-proportion z-test. This test is used to compare two population proportions. It's typically used when you have categorical data and want to see if the proportions of some category are different between two groups. In this experiment, however, we're dealing with the difference in the number of pimples, which is continuous data, not categorical. So, this doesn't seem like the right test to use here.\n\nNext, option B: a two-sample t-test. This test is used to compare the means of two independent groups. It assumes that the two samples are independent and not related to each other. In this experiment, though, the same volunteers are using both formulas\u2014just on different sides of their faces. So, the two measurements for each volunteer are not independent; they're paired. Therefore, using a two-sample t-test wouldn't account for this pairing, which could lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nOption C: a matched pairs t-test. This sounds promising. A matched pairs t-test is specifically designed for situations where you have paired data, such as before-and-after measurements on the same subjects or, in this case, two different treatments applied to the same subjects. It compares the means of the differences between the paired measurements. In this experiment, the pairs are the differences in the number of pimples between the old and new formulas for each volunteer. So, this seems like an appropriate test to use.\n\nFinally, option D: a chi-square test of independence. This test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It's often used with contingency tables to see if one variable is independent of another. In this experiment, we have continuous data (number of pimples), not categorical variables. So, this test isn't suitable here.\n\nTo summarize, the experiment involves pairing two treatments within the same subjects, and we're interested in the differences in their responses to these treatments. Therefore, the most appropriate test is a matched pairs t-test, which directly addresses the paired nature of the data.\n\nI think that's the correct choice. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other factors that might influence the choice of test. For example, is there any reason to suspect that the differences might not be normally distributed? Well, with a large enough sample size, the t-test is still robust to deviations from normality, thanks to the Central Limit Theorem. However, if the sample size is small, one might consider a non-parametric alternative like the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. But the problem doesn't provide information about the sample size or the distribution of the differences, so I'll assume that a t-test is appropriate.\n\nAlso, since it's a double-blind randomized experiment, we can assume that the treatments were assigned randomly, which helps to minimize bias and confounding variables. So, the matched pairs t-test should adequately account for individual variations between volunteers by comparing their own sides.\n\nTherefore, the correct significance test to perform is a matched pairs t-test.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
