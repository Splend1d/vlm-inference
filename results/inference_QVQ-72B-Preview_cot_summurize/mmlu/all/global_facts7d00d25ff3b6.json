                    "text": "So I remember hearing about Ross Perot. He was a businessman who ran for president in the 90s, right? I think he was kind of famous for being a third-party candidate and making a pretty big splash in the polls at one point. The question says he led the presidential race briefly in June with 39% of the popular vote, which is impressive for a third-party candidate. But then it says he wound up with a certain percentage in the end, and I need to choose from the options: 1%, 7%, 13%, or 19%.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what happened in that election cycle. I think Ross Perot was running in 1992 against Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. He was an independent candidate, which means he wasn't affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican parties. That's pretty rare in American politics, where usually it's one of the two major parties that dominate.\n\nI recall that at one point, Perot was doing really well in the polls, even leading both Clinton and Bush. The question mentions that he led in June with 39%. That must have been a surprise to a lot of people. But then, he ended up with a lower percentage on election day.\n\nI need to think about why his support might have dropped. Maybe some people who initially supported him changed their minds closer to the election. Or perhaps there were events or campaigns that influenced voters to choose one of the major party candidates instead.\n\nLet me consider the context of the 1992 election. The economy was a big issue then; there was a recession, and Perot made that a central part of his campaign. He was known for his folksy style and his emphasis on balancing the budget. Both Clinton and Bush were also addressing these issues, so maybe as the campaign progressed, some voters decided to back one of the major candidates for various reasons.\n\nI should also consider the electoral college system. In the United States, the president is elected through the electoral college, not just by the popular vote. Third-party candidates often face a challenge in getting enough electoral votes to make a significant impact.\n\nGiven that, maybe some voters who initially supported Perot decided to vote strategically for Clinton or Bush to ensure their preferred major party candidate won.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it's asking what percentage of the popular vote Perot ended up with on election day. The options are 1%, 7%, 13%, or 19%.\n\nI remember that Perot did manage to get a notable share of the vote, but not as much as his early polling suggested. He didn't win any electoral votes, I think, but he still had a significant impact on the election.\n\nLet me see if I can recall the exact percentage. I think he got around 19% of the popular vote. Wait, no, I think that was higher than what he actually got.\n\nLet me try to verify this. I think in the 1992 presidential election, Bill Clinton won with around 43% of the popular vote, George H.W. Bush had about 38%, and Ross Perot had around 19%. So, that would make sense.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing it with another election. Let me check.\n\nIn 1992, according to my memory, Bill Clinton won with 43%, George H.W. Bush had 38%, and Ross Perot had 19%. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut the question is saying that in June, Perot led with 39%, but then he wound up with a certain percentage, and I need to choose from the options: 1%, 7%, 13%, or 19%.\n\nHmm, if he led with 39% in June but ended up with 19%, that would make sense. But 19% is one of the options.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because I recall that in the 1996 election, Perot ran again as the Reform Party candidate and got about 8% of the popular vote. So, maybe there's some confusion between the two elections.\n\nLet me double-check. The question specifies that this was in June, and he led with 39%, but then wound up with a lower percentage. The options are 1%, 7%, 13%, or 19%.\n\nGiven that, and considering that in 1992, he got 19%, that seems like the most plausible answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he got 13%. Let me think if there's any other information that could help me decide.\n\nI recall that Perot was known for his independent campaign and his emphasis on fiscal responsibility. He was popular among disaffected voters from both major parties. Given that, his support was substantial, but not enough to win the election.\n\nComparing to the other options: 1% seems too low, as that's typical for minor candidates who don't have much national support. 7% might be possible, but I think Perot had more support than that. 13% could be possible, but I think he did better than that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me try to recall the exact percentages.\n\nIn 1992, Bill Clinton won with 43%, George H.W. Bush had 38%, and Ross Perot had 19%. So, that adds up to 100%. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 19%.\n\nBut the question mentions that he led briefly in June with 39% and wound up with a certain percentage. If he led with 39% in June and ended up with 19%, that makes sense, as it shows a decrease from his peak popularity.\n\nAlternatively, if he ended up with 13%, that would be lower than his peak but still significant. However, based on my recollection, 19% seems more accurate.\n\nI think the correct answer is D. 19%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
