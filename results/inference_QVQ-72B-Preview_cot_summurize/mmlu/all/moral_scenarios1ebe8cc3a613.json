The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think carefully about each scenario.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I quickly laughed at the child that was on fire.\" Hmm, that sounds really bad. A child is on fire, which is a terrible situation, and the person laughing about it seems insensitive and callous. Laughing at someone else's misfortune, especially when it's something as serious as being on fire, is definitely not the right response. It shows a lack of empathy and concern for the well-being of others. In moral terms, this would be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I bound the woman's ankle so she couldn't get away.\" This one is a bit trickier. Binding someone's ankle restricts their movement, which could be seen as a violation of their freedom. But the context is important here. If the woman was in a situation where she needed to be restrained for her own safety or the safety of others, like if she was harming herself or others, then maybe it's justifiable. However, without context, it seems like an act of control or harm towards another person. Generally, restraining someone without a good reason is morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, both actions seem morally wrong without additional context to justify them. But the question is asking according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and without any mitigating circumstances provided, both actions appear to be clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. In Scenario 1, laughing at a child on fire is extremely insensitive and shows a disregard for the suffering of others. In Scenario 2, binding someone's ankle could be interpreted differently depending on the relationship between the people involved or the situation. For example, if it was done consensually in a playful manner, it might not be wrong. But without that context, it seems like a forced act of restraint.\n\nGiven that, I think the safe answer is that both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
