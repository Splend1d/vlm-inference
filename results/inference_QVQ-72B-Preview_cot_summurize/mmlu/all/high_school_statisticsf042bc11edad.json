                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about calculating the standard deviation of total student costs. There are four categories: tuition, books, room and board, and personal expenditures. Tuition is fixed at $4500 for everyone, and the other three have means and standard deviations given. I need to find the standard deviation of the total costs, assuming independence among these categories.\n\nFirst, since tuition is fixed, it doesn't vary; so, it has no standard deviation. That means it won't contribute to the standard deviation of the total costs.\n\nNext, for books, the mean cost is $350 with a standard deviation of $65.\n\nFor room and board, the mean is $2800 with a standard deviation of $380.\n\nAnd for personal expenditures, the mean is $675 with a standard deviation of $125.\n\nI need to find the standard deviation of the sum of these costs: total cost = tuition + books + room and board + personal expenditures.\n\nSince tuition is fixed, it doesn't affect the standard deviation. So, total cost = books + room and board + personal expenditures.\n\nI recall that for independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\n\nSo, variance of total costs (Var(T)) = Var(books) + Var(room and board) + Var(personal expenditures).\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the standard deviations provided.\n\nWait, standard deviation is the square root of variance, so variance is the square of standard deviation.\n\nSo, Var(books) = ($65)^2 = $4225\n\nVar(room and board) = ($380)^2 = $144400\n\nVar(personal expenditures) = ($125)^2 = $15625\n\nNow, Var(T) = $4225 + $144400 + $15625 = let's add these up.\n\n$4225 + $144400 = $148625\n\n$148625 + $15625 = $164250\n\nSo, Var(T) = $164250\n\nNow, standard deviation is the square root of variance.\n\nSo, SD(T) = sqrt($164250)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, sqrt(164250).\n\nWell, 400^2 = 160000, 405^2 = 164025, 406^2 = 164836.\n\nSo, 405^2 = 164025, which is close to 164250.\n\nThe difference is 164250 - 164025 = 225.\n\nSo, sqrt(164250) = 405 + sqrt(225) / (2*405)\n\nBut 225^0.5 = 15, so it's 405 + 15/(810), which is 405 + roughly 0.0185, so about 405.0185.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. $24\n\nB. $91\n\nC. $190\n\nD. $405\n\nSo, 405 is one of the options.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in adding the variances.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nVar(books) = 65^2 = 4225\n\nVar(room and board) = 380^2 = 144400\n\nVar(personal expenditures) = 125^2 = 15625\n\nSum = 4225 + 144400 + 15625 = 164250\n\nSquare root of 164250 is approximately 405, as calculated.\n\nBut let's confirm if this is the correct approach.\n\nIs there any other consideration I should make? For example, are the costs truly independent? The problem assumes independence, so I think this is acceptable.\n\nAlso, tuition is fixed, so it doesn't affect the variability.\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the total costs should be $405.\n\nLooking at the options, D. $405 seems correct.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nIs there any unit conversion or anything like that? No, all costs are in dollars.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. $405.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
