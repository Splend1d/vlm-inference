                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Aaron Beck's negative triad theory about depression. From what I've read, it's about how depressed people see themselves, the world, and their future in a negative way. Let me see which option matches that.\n\nOption A says that depressed individuals cope with three primary stresses\u2014change, death, and monetary instability\u2014through withdrawal. Hmm, that sounds more like a description of how people might cope with stress in general, not specifically about Beck's negative triad. Maybe I need to look closer.\n\nOption B says that depressed individuals believe that when they're in a group, at least three individuals will view them negatively. That seems more related to social anxiety or paranoia, not directly to Beck's theory of the negative triad. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nOption C states that depressed individuals hold a negative view of themselves, the world, and their futures. This sounds a lot like Beck's negative triad. He theorized that depressed people have a negative schema or pattern of thinking about these three areas, which reinforces their depressive state. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D mentions that depressed individuals view the world in three stages: separation anxiety, development of an external locus of control, and failure to achieve. This sounds more like a developmental or psychological progression, perhaps drawing from attachment theory or other frameworks, but it's not directly aligned with Beck's negative triad concept.\n\nGiven these options, it seems that option C is the most accurate summary of Aaron Beck's negative triad theory. It directly refers to the negative views depressed individuals have about themselves, the world, and their futures, which is the core of his theory.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Beck's negative triad is indeed composed of three components:\n\n1. Negative view of self: Depressed individuals see themselves as inadequate, worthless, or flawed.\n\n2. Negative view of the world: They perceive the world as a harsh, unfriendly, or malevolent place.\n\n3. Negative view of the future: They expect the future to be bleak, hopeless, or filled with failure.\n\nOption C captures all three of these elements, so I'm confident that it's the correct summary of Beck's negative triad theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
