                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this objection to care ethics. The objection says that care ethics seems to imply we're responsible for our attitudes, like our caring feelings or attitudes towards others, but these attitudes don't feel like they're under our voluntary control. So, it's like saying that care ethics is holding us responsible for things we can't really choose or control directly.\n\nNow, Collins is responding to this objection. I need to figure out how Collins is responding based on the options given.\n\nOption A says that caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all. Hmm, that seems a bit extreme. If care ethics is all about caring relationships and responsibilities, then saying caring attitudes aren't moral seems to go against the whole point of care ethics. So, I doubt Collins would take that position.\n\nOption B says that we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly. This interests me. It suggests that even if we can't directly control our attitudes, maybe there are ways to influence them indirectly. For example, maybe by changing our behavior or putting ourselves in certain situations, we can foster caring attitudes. This seems plausible and aligns with how we often try to cultivate virtues or emotions.\n\nOption C says that when we fail to have attitudes of care, it means that no caring attitudes were required of us towards some person. This seems like a way of saying that if you don't feel caring towards someone, then maybe you weren't obligated to feel that way in the first place. But this feels a bit circular. It's almost like saying, \"If you don't care, then you didn't need to care.\" That doesn't really address the objection about responsibility and control.\n\nOption D says that Collins agrees with the objection. Well, if Collins agrees with the objection, that would mean that Collins thinks care ethics does imply we're responsible for our attitudes, which are not under our voluntary control, and perhaps sees that as a problem.\n\nBut I think Collins is responding to the objection, not necessarily agreeing with it. So, maybe Collins is trying to defend care ethics against this objection.\n\nLet me think again. The objection is that care ethics holds us responsible for attitudes that we can't control voluntarily. Collins is responding by saying that...\n\nWait, maybe Collins is arguing that while it's true we can't directly control our attitudes, we can influence them indirectly through our actions or choices, which aligns with option B.\n\nSo, if we can bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly, then perhaps we can be held responsible for creating the conditions that lead to those attitudes.\n\nFor example, if I choose to spend time with someone, listen to their problems, and try to understand their perspective, that might foster a sense of care towards them. Even if the actual feeling of care isn't something I can turn on and off at will, I can still be responsible for making efforts that are likely to cultivate that care.\n\nThis makes sense to me. It's similar to how we can't directly choose to like someone, but we can choose to get to know them better, which might lead to liking them.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think Collins is responding with option B: we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption A: caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all. This seems contrary to the foundation of care ethics, which emphasizes caring relationships and responsibilities as central to morality. So, it's unlikely that Collins would take this position.\n\nOption C: when we fail to have attitudes of care, this means that no caring attitudes were required of us towards some person. This seems like an ad hoc way to avoid the responsibility issue, but it doesn't address the core of the objection. It's more of a cop-out than a response.\n\nOption D: Collins agrees with the objection. If Collins agrees with the objection, then perhaps Collins is critiquing care ethics on this point. But given that care ethics is known for emphasizing care and relationships, it's more likely that Collins is defending it rather than agreeing with the objection.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that Collins responds by arguing that we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
