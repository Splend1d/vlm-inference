                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to figure out if the normal force from the floor of an elevator does work on a man standing in it when the elevator starts to ascend. The options are yes with positive work, yes with negative work, yes but the sign can't be determined, or no.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what work is in physics. Work is done when a force causes an object to move in the direction of the force. The formula for work is W = F * d * cos\u03b8, where F is the force, d is the displacement, and \u03b8 is the angle between the force and the displacement.\n\nIn this scenario, the man is standing in an elevator that starts to ascend. So, the elevator is moving upward, which means the man is also moving upward relative to the floor.\n\nThe normal force is the force exerted by the floor on the man, perpendicular to the floor, pushing up. Normally, when the elevator is at rest, the normal force balances the weight of the man, so F_n = m*g.\n\nBut when the elevator starts to ascend, there's an acceleration upward. According to Newton's second law, F = m*a, where a is the acceleration. So, if the elevator is accelerating upward, the net force on the man must be upward.\n\nThat means the normal force must be greater than the weight of the man to produce an upward acceleration. So, F_n > m*g, and the excess force F_n - m*g equals m*a.\n\nNow, since the normal force is upward and the man is moving upward, the force and the displacement are in the same direction. So, \u03b8 = 0 degrees, and cos\u03b8 = 1. Therefore, W = F_n * d * 1 = F_n * d.\n\nSince both F_n and d are positive (assuming upward is positive), the work done by the normal force should be positive.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the elevator was descending? If the elevator was accelerating downward, the normal force would be less than the weight, and the net force would be downward, causing the acceleration downward. But in this problem, it's ascending.\n\nLet me make sure about the direction of motion. The problem says the elevator begins to ascend, meaning it starts moving upward. So, the man experiences an upward acceleration initially as the elevator gains speed.\n\nTherefore, the normal force is greater than the weight, and the work done by the normal force is positive.\n\nBut let's consider if the elevator was moving at a constant speed. In that case, the normal force would equal the weight, and there would be no net force, hence no acceleration. But in this scenario, it's starting to ascend, which implies acceleration.\n\nSo, in this case, since both the force and displacement are upward, the work done should be positive.\n\nWait, but could there be a scenario where the work done by the normal force is negative? Maybe if the elevator was moving downward, and the normal force was still upward but less than the weight, causing the man to accelerate downward relative to the elevator. But in this problem, it's ascending.\n\nI think in the case of ascending, the normal force is greater than the weight, and the work done is positive.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that work is done by the normal force to lift the man against gravity. Since the man is moving upward, the normal force is doing positive work.\n\nAlternatively, if the elevator was moving downward, and the normal force was less than the weight, the man would be accelerating downward relative to the elevator, and the work done by the normal force would still be positive because the force is upward and the displacement is upward (relative to the elevator floor, which is moving downward, but I'm getting confused here).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the reference frame.\n\nLet's consider the reference frame of the elevator. If the elevator is accelerating upward, and the man is standing still relative to the elevator floor, then the normal force is greater than the weight, and the work done by the normal force is positive relative to the elevator floor.\n\nIf I consider the inertial reference frame of the ground, the elevator is moving upward with some acceleration, and the man is moving upward with the same acceleration. The normal force is greater than the weight, and the work done is still positive.\n\nI don't think the reference frame changes the fact that work is positive as long as the force and displacement are in the same direction.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. Yes, and the work done will be positive.\n\nB. Yes, and the work done will be negative.\n\nC. Yes, but the sign can\u2019t be determined.\n\nD. No.\n\nBased on my reasoning, A seems correct. The normal force does positive work on the man when the elevator begins to ascend.\n\nBut let's consider if the elevator was moving downward. If the elevator is accelerating downward, the normal force is less than the weight, and the net force is downward. In that case, the work done by the normal force would still be positive because the normal force is upward, and the displacement is upward (since the elevator is moving downward, but the man is being pushed upward by the floor).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to stick to the initial scenario.\n\nIn summary, when the elevator begins to ascend, the normal force is greater than the weight, and it does positive work on the man because both the force and displacement are upward.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Yes, and the work done will be positive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
