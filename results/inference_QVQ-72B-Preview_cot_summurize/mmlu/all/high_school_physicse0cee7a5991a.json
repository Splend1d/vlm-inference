                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about gravity. It says that if I have two small objects, and I double the mass of each one, and also double the distance between their centers, what happens to the force of gravitational attraction between them? The options are: it's doubled, it's quadrupled, it's halved, or it remains the same.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall the law of universal gravitation. I think it was Sir Isaac Newton who came up with this. The formula is F equals G times m1 times m2 over r squared. Right? So, F = G * m1 * m2 / r^2. Where F is the force of gravity between two masses, m1 and m2, G is the gravitational constant, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nNow, the problem says that both masses are doubled, so m1 becomes 2m1 and m2 becomes 2m2, and the distance r is also doubled, so r becomes 2r. I need to plug these into the formula and see what happens to F.\n\nLet's do that. So, the new force, let's call it F_new, would be G * (2m1) * (2m2) / (2r)^2. Hmm, let's simplify that step by step.\n\nFirst, G is a constant, so it stays the same. Then, 2m1 times 2m2 is 4 times m1 m2. And the denominator is (2r)^2, which is 4r^2. So, F_new = G * 4 * m1 * m2 / 4 * r^2.\n\nNow, I can see that the 4 in the numerator and the 4 in the denominator cancel each other out. So, F_new = G * m1 * m2 / r^2. Wait a minute, that's exactly the same as the original force F. So, does that mean the force remains the same?\n\nBut let's double-check this. Maybe I missed something. The original force F is G * m1 * m2 / r^2. When I double the masses and the distance, I get G * 2m1 * 2m2 / (2r)^2. That's G * 4m1 m2 / 4r^2. And yes, that simplifies to G * m1 * m2 / r^2, which is F. So, F_new equals F.\n\nTherefore, the force of gravitational attraction remains the same when you double the masses of both objects and double the distance between them.\n\nWait, but let's see why this is happening. The gravitational force depends on the product of the masses and inversely on the square of the distance. So, if you double both masses, that would make the numerator 4 times larger, but then you square the distance, which makes the denominator 4 times larger as well. So, the 4 in the numerator cancels with the 4 in the denominator, and you end up with the original force.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using proportions or something, but I think the math is pretty straightforward here.\n\nLet me consider if there's any unit analysis I can do. The units in the formula should cancel appropriately. G has units of N m^2 / kg^2, which is (kg m / s^2) m^2 / kg^2 = kg m^3 / s^2 kg^2. But maybe that's not necessary for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the relationship between the changes in mass and distance. The force is proportional to m1 m2 and inversely proportional to r squared. So, F \u221d m1 m2 / r^2.\n\nIf I let m1' = 2m1, m2' = 2m2, and r' = 2r, then F' = m1' * m2' / r'^2 = 2m1 * 2m2 / (2r)^2 = 4m1 m2 / 4r^2 = m1 m2 / r^2 = F. Again, F' = F, so the force remains the same.\n\nI think this is consistent. Therefore, the correct answer is D. It remains the same.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if only one mass is doubled while the distance remains the same. Then, F_new = G * 2m1 * m2 / r^2 = 2 * G * m1 * m2 / r^2, so it would double the force. Similarly, if both masses are doubled but the distance remains the same, F_new = G * 2m1 * 2m2 / r^2 = 4 * G * m1 * m2 / r^2, quadrupling the force. But in our case, since the distance is also doubled, it balances out the effects of doubling the masses.\n\nAlternatively, if only the distance is doubled, F_new = G * m1 * m2 / (2r)^2 = G * m1 * m2 / 4r^2 = 1/4 * F, so the force is reduced to one-fourth. But again, in our scenario, both masses and distance are doubled, leading to the force remaining the same.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. It remains the same.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
