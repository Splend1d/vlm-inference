                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand cartels and how they work. A cartel is like a group of companies that get together to control the market, right? They might agree to set prices, limit production, or divide up the market among themselves. The goal is to make more money than they would if they were competing against each other normally.\n\nOption A says that all cartel firms will make normal profits. But I think cartels are formed to make super-normal profits, like monopoly profits, by reducing competition. So, normal profits don't sound right. Maybe not A.\n\nOption B says there's an incentive for cartel firms to cheat on the cartel agreement. That makes sense because each firm might think it can make more money if it breaks the agreement\u2014like producing more than agreed or selling at lower prices to gain market share. It's kind of like the prisoner's dilemma in economics. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that individual firms in the cartel maximize their own profits. Well, in theory, cartels are supposed to act like a single monopoly to maximize total cartel profits, but individual firms might try to maximize their own profits at the expense of the cartel. So, this could be true, but it seems similar to B.\n\nOption D mentions allocative efficiency. I remember that allocative efficiency happens when resources are allocated in a way that maximizes social welfare, which is when the price equals the marginal cost. Cartels, by restricting output to raise prices, actually decrease allocative efficiency. So, definitely not D.\n\nBetween B and C, I need to think which one best describes what happens in a cartel. If firms are incentivized to cheat on the cartel agreement, that's more about the stability of the cartel itself. Individual profit maximization might lead to cheating, which could ultimately cause the cartel to break down.\n\nI think the key point is that in a cartel, there's a tension between the collective interest of the cartel to restrict output and keep prices high, and the individual interest of each firm to increase its own output and possibly undercut the cartel's prices to gain more sales.\n\nSo, the expectation is that there will be an incentive for cartel firms to cheat on the cartel agreement because by doing so, they can increase their own profits in the short term, even if it harms the cartel in the long term.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nWait, but option C says profit maximization by individual firms in the cartel. That's kind of the reason why they might cheat. But the question is about what we can expect if a market is organized by a cartel. So, is it that individual firms maximize their profits, or is it that there's an incentive to cheat?\n\nI think both are related, but the incentive to cheat is a direct consequence of individual profit maximization in a cartel setting. So, perhaps B is more specific to the cartel context.\n\nLet me see if I can find some reference or recall any examples.\n\nFor instance, in the OPEC cartel, which is an oil-producing countries cartel, there have been instances where member countries secretly increase their production beyond the quotas agreed upon by the cartel. This is cheating because they're producing more than they're supposed to, which can lead to lower oil prices and affect the cartel's overall profit.\n\nSo, this supports the idea that there's an incentive to cheat on the cartel agreement.\n\nAlso, in theory, cartels are unstable because of this incentive to cheat. Each firm has a temptation to produce more or sell cheaper to gain more market share, which can lead to the breakdown of the cartel over time.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate expectation when a market is organized by a cartel is that there's an incentive for cartel firms to cheat on the cartel agreement.\n\nSo, my answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
