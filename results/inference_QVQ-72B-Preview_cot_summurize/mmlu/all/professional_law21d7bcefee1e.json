                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about adverse possession, and I need to figure out who would win in court if the farmer tries to eject the man who's been living on the land. Let me try to understand all the details first.\n\nSo, the farmer originally owned the land fee simple, which means he had full ownership rights. He moved to the city in 1986, and in 1987, someone else started living on the land, claiming to be an adverse possessor. This man stayed there from 1987 to 1997, then left for a year to take care of his sick mother, and came back in 1999. The statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wants to move back, finds this man still there, and decides to sue for ejectment.\n\nOkay, so the key here is understanding adverse possession and whether the man has met the requirements to claim ownership through adverse possession.\n\nFirst, what does adverse possession require? Generally, it needs to be open, hostile, actual, exclusive, and continuous for the statutory period. In this case, the statutory period is 20 years.\n\nThe man started possessing the land in 1987 and stayed until 1997, which is 10 years. Then he left for a year in 1998 to take care of his mother and came back in 1999. So from 1999 to 2010, that's another 11 years. Adding that to the initial 10 years, that makes 21 years in total. But wait, there was that one year in 1998 when he wasn't on the property.\n\nNow, the question is whether that one-year break in 1998 interrupts the continuity of his possession. Because adverse possession requires continuous possession for the entire statutory period.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The farmer would lose because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.\n\nB. The farmer would lose because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.\n\nC. The farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous.\n\nD. The farmer would win because he is the titleholder of record.\n\nFrom what I understand, the man was in possession for a total of 21 years, but there was a one-year break in 1998. The statutory period is 20 years, but the possession needs to be continuous.\n\nI think that the one-year absence might interrupt the continuity, meaning that the clock resets during that break. So, if he was possesssing from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), then left for a year, then came back in 1999 and stayed until 2010 (11 years), that would be two separate periods of possession.\n\nBut does the total add up to 21 years, or does the break interrupt it? I think it interrupts it, so he doesn't get to add those periods together for the purpose of adverse possession.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, possession needs to be continuous and uninterrupted for the entire statutory period. Any significant break could reset the period.\n\nSo, if the man was absent for a year in 1998, that might have interrupted his continuous possession. Therefore, his possession from 1987 to 1997 is one period of 10 years, and from 1999 to 2010 is another period of 11 years. Neither of these periods alone meets the 20-year requirement.\n\nWait, but the total is 21 years, which is more than 20 years. But because there was a break, it might not count as continuous.\n\nHowever, maybe the court would consider the entire period from 1987 to 2010 as continuous, given that the absence was only one year.\n\nBut I think that in most adverse possession laws, any significant break in possession can interrupt the continuity.\n\nI need to think about what constitutes a \"break\" in possession. If someone leaves the property for a certain period, is that considered a break that resets the clock?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, possession can be continuous as long as the possessor shows an intent to return and continues to maintain some connection to the property during absence.\n\nBut in this case, the man left the property in 1997 to take care of his sick mother for one year and returned in 1999.\n\nSo, his absence was only one year, and he did return afterward.\n\nMaybe the court would consider that a temporary absence and allow the possession to be continuous.\n\nBut the statutory period is 20 years, and he was in possession for 21 years, but there was a one-year break in the middle.\n\nWait, from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years, then 1998 he was absent, then 1999 to 2010 is another 11 years. So, total possession is 21 years, but with a one-year break.\n\nI think the continuity requirement is strict, and any significant break could interrupt the period.\n\nBut perhaps the one-year absence is not considered a significant break, especially since he returned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the law allows for short absences as long as the possessor shows an intent to return.\n\nIf that's the case, then his possession could be considered continuous.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the specific laws in this state.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose the man was maintaining the property even during his absence in 1998, perhaps paying taxes or making improvements, that might show his continued intent to possess.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify what he did during that year.\n\nIt just says he left the property to care for his sick mother for one year and then returned.\n\nSo, if he was genuinely absent from the property for one year, does that interrupt his adverse possession claim?\n\nIn many states, adverse possession requires uninterrupted and continuous possession for the full statutory period.\n\nAny interruption, like a one-year absence, would reset the clock.\n\nSo, if he was possessing from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), left for one year, then came back and possessed from 1999 to 2010 (11 years), that would be two separate periods of 10 and 11 years, neither of which meets the 20-year requirement.\n\nTherefore, he hasn't satisfied the continuous possession requirement for 20 years.\n\nHence, the farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous for the required 20 years.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the man was in possession for a total of 21 years, with only a one-year break. Maybe the court would consider that substantial enough and allow the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the one-year absence is excused due to the man's need to care for his sick mother.\n\nBut again, adverse possession laws are typically strict about continuity.\n\nI think the most probable judicial determination would be that the farmer wins because the man's possession was not continuous for the required 20 years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A says the farmer would lose because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.\n\nBut the question is about whether it was continuous for the required 20 years, and there was a break.\n\nOption B says the farmer would lose because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period.\n\nBut if the possession wasn't continuous, he hasn't fulfilled the requirement.\n\nOption D says the farmer would win because he is the titleholder of record.\n\nThat's true, but the adverse possessor is trying to claim the title through continuous possession.\n\nSo, if the adverse possessor had met the requirements, the title would transfer.\n\nBut since there was a break in possession, the farmer retains the title.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most accurate.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
