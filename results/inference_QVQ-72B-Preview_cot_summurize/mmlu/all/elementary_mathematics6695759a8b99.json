                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem: \"Which of the following is NOT equivalent to 3 and 3 over 4 gal?\" And the options are A. 60 c, B. 15 qt, C. 30 pt, D. 13 qt. Okay, so I need to figure out which of these measurements doesn't equal 3 and 3/4 gallons.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert 3 and 3/4 gallons into other units to see which one doesn't match. I know that there are 4 quarts in a gallon, 2 pints in a quart, and 2 cups in a pint. Wait, actually, no, there are 8 cups in a gallon because 4 quarts per gallon times 2 cups per quart is 8 cups per gallon. Hmm, but the options are in cups, quarts, pints, and maybe ounces? Wait, no, 'c' usually stands for cups.\n\nLet me clarify the units:\n\n- c: cups\n\n- qt: quarts\n\n- pt: pints\n\n- gal: gallons\n\nSo, I need to convert 3 and 3/4 gallons to cups, quarts, and pints to compare with the options.\n\nFirst, let's convert 3 and 3/4 gallons to quarts. Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, I can multiply 3.75 gallons by 4 quarts per gallon.\n\n3.75 gal \u00d7 4 qt/gal = 15 qt\n\nOh, so 3 and 3/4 gallons is equal to 15 quarts. So, option B. 15 qt seems to be equivalent.\n\nNext, let's convert to pints. There are 2 pints in a quart, so I can multiply 15 quarts by 2 pints per quart.\n\n15 qt \u00d7 2 pt/qt = 30 pt\n\nOkay, so 3 and 3/4 gallons is also equal to 30 pints. So, option C. 30 pt is equivalent.\n\nNow, let's convert to cups. There are 4 cups in a quart, since there are 2 cups in a pint and 2 pints in a quart. So, 4 cups per quart.\n\nWait, but actually, 1 quart is equal to 4 cups? Let me make sure. Yes, because 1 pint is 2 cups, and there are 2 pints in a quart, so yes, 1 quart = 4 cups.\n\nSo, since we have 15 quarts, I can multiply by 4 cups per quart.\n\n15 qt \u00d7 4 c/qt = 60 c\n\nTherefore, 3 and 3/4 gallons is equal to 60 cups. So, option A. 60 c is equivalent.\n\nNow, option D is 13 qt. We already calculated that 3 and 3/4 gallons is equal to 15 quarts. So, 13 quarts is not equal to 3 and 3/4 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 13 qt.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. We have:\n\n- 3 and 3/4 gallons = 15 quarts\n\n- 3 and 3/4 gallons = 30 pints\n\n- 3 and 3/4 gallons = 60 cups\n\nAnd 13 quarts is less than 15 quarts, so it can't be equivalent to 3 and 3/4 gallons.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should check the conversion again. Let's see, 1 gallon = 4 quarts, so 3 gallons = 12 quarts. Then, 3/4 gallon = 3 quarts. So, total quarts = 12 + 3 = 15 quarts. Yes, that matches.\n\nSimilarly, for pints, 15 quarts \u00d7 2 pints/quart = 30 pints.\n\nAnd for cups, 15 quarts \u00d7 4 cups/quart = 60 cups.\n\nSo, indeed, 13 quarts does not equal 15 quarts, making option D incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 13 qt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
