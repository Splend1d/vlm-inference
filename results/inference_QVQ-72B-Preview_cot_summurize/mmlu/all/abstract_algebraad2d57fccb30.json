                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements, and I need to determine whether each is true or false. Let's tackle them one at a time.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what HK means in group theory. I believe HK denotes the set of all products hk where h is in H and k is in K. Now, the question is whether this set HK forms a subgroup of G under the group operation, provided that one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what a normal subgroup is. A subgroup N of G is normal if and only if for every g in G and n in N, the conjugate gng\u207b\u00b9 is also in N. Alternatively, N is normal if and only if it is the kernel of some group homomorphism or if it's the stabilizer of some set under the action of G.\n\nSo, in this statement, either H or K is normal. Without loss of generality, let's assume that H is normal in G. That is, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, I need to show that HK is a subgroup of G. To do that, I should verify the subgroup criteria:\n\n1. Closure: For any two elements in HK, their product should also be in HK.\n\n2. Identity: The identity element of G should be in HK.\n\n3. Inverses: For every element in HK, its inverse should also be in HK.\n\nLet's start with closure. Take two elements hk and h'k' in HK, where h, h' are in H and k, k' are in K. Their product is hkk'h'. I need to show that this product is also in HK.\n\nSince H is normal in G, I can use properties of normal subgroups. Specifically, because H is normal, for any k in K, the conjugate k\u207b\u00b9hk is in H. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write hkk'h' in the form of another product in HK. Maybe rearrange it as (hh'')(kk''), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Since H is normal, HK equals KH, and HK is a subgroup if and only if HK = KH, which is already satisfied because H is normal. But I think I need to be more rigorous.\n\nLet me look up the condition for HK to be a subgroup when one of H or K is normal.\n\nUpon checking, I find that if H and K are subgroups of G, and one of them is normal, say H is normal in G, then HK is indeed a subgroup of G. The proof usually goes as follows:\n\n- Closure: For h1, h2 in H and k1, k2 in K, (h1k1)(h2k2) = h1(k1h2)k2. Since H is normal, k1h2k1\u207b\u00b9 is in H, so there exists h3 in H such that k1h2k1\u207b\u00b9 = h3. Thus, h1(k1h2)k2 = h1h3k1k2. But h1h3 is in H, so this is in HK.\n\n- Identity: The identity e of G is in both H and K, so e = ee is in HK.\n\n- Inverses: For hk in HK, its inverse is k\u207b\u00b9h\u207b\u00b9. Since H is normal, h\u207b\u00b9 is in H, and k\u207b\u00b9 is in K. Again, because H is normal, k\u207b\u00b9h\u207b\u00b9k is in H, so there exists h' in H such that k\u207b\u00b9h\u207b\u00b9k = h'. Thus, k\u207b\u00b9h\u207b\u00b9 = h'k\u207b\u00b9, which is in HK.\n\nTherefore, HK is a subgroup of G when one of H or K is normal.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"one of H or K is normal,\" and in my above reasoning, I assumed H is normal. Does it matter if K is normal instead?\n\nLet's consider that case. Suppose K is normal in G. Then, similar reasoning applies:\n\n- Closure: (h1k1)(h2k2) = h1(k1h2)k2. Since K is normal, h2k2h2\u207b\u00b9 is in K, but that's not directly helpful. Wait, perhaps I should rearrange it differently.\n\nActually, since K is normal, for any h in H, hK = Kh. So, hK = Kh implies that for any k in K, there exists k' in K such that h k = k' h. Maybe I can use this.\n\nLet me try again: (h1k1)(h2k2) = h1(k1h2)k2. Since K is normal, k1h2 = h3 k3 for some h3 in H and k3 in K. Then, h1(k1h2)k2 = h1 h3 k3 k2. Since H is a subgroup, h1 h3 is in H, so this is in HK.\n\nSimilarly, for the identity and inverses, the arguments should hold similarly.\n\nTherefore, whether H or K is normal, HK is a subgroup of G.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"All groups of order p\u00b2 where p is prime are Abelian.\"\n\nI recall that there are theorems about the structure of groups of certain orders, especially when the order is a square of a prime.\n\nFirst, let's recall that if G is a group of order p\u00b2, where p is a prime number, then |G| = p\u00b2.\n\nI know that by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1, p, and p\u00b2.\n\nAlso, since p\u00b2 is square of a prime, I think there's a theorem that says that any group of order p\u00b2 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nLet me think about the cyclic case. If G is cyclic, then it's Abelian, since any cyclic group is Abelian.\n\nNow, if G is not cyclic, then it must have elements of order p, but no elements of order p\u00b2.\n\nI think there's a theorem that states that any group of order p\u00b2 is Abelian. Let me try to recall or derive it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the class equation or Sylow theorems, but that might be overkill for this case.\n\nWait, another approach: Since |G| = p\u00b2, the center of G, Z(G), is nontrivial. I believe that in a p-group (a group where the order is a power of a prime), the center is nontrivial. Specifically, for a group of order p\u00b2, Z(G) cannot be trivial.\n\nIf Z(G) is nontrivial and has order p, then the quotient group G/Z(G) has order p, which is prime, so G/Z(G) is cyclic. And if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is Abelian.\n\nWait, is that right? If G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is Abelian.\n\nYes, that's a standard result. So, if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is Abelian.\n\nIn this case, since |G| = p\u00b2 and Z(G) has order p, G/Z(G) has order p, which is cyclic. Therefore, G is Abelian.\n\nAlternatively, if Z(G) has order p\u00b2, then G = Z(G), meaning G is Abelian.\n\nSo, in either case, G is Abelian.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, both statements are true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be A. True, True.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
