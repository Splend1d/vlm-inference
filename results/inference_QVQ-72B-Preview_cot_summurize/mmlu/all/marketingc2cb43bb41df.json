I'm not entirely sure what hedonic consumption means, but I think it has something to do with enjoying products beyond just their functional use. Like, maybe it's about the pleasure or experience you get from using something, not just what it can do for you practically.\n\nLet me look up the definition of hedonic consumption to make sure I understand. Okay, according to what I found, hedonic consumption refers to the idea that consumers derive pleasure or enjoyment from the process of consuming a product or service, beyond just the utilitarian benefits it provides. So, it's about the emotional and sensory experiences associated with using or owning a product.\n\nAlright, with that in mind, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Social interaction perspective.\n\nThis seems to be about how products are used in social settings or how they facilitate interactions between people. While there might be some pleasure derived from social interactions involving products, I don't think this directly relates to the experiential aspect of hedonic consumption. Maybe I need to think more about this.\n\nB. Functional utilization perspective.\n\nThis sounds like it's focusing on the practical, utilitarian aspects of products\u2014what they can do, their features, and how they serve a particular function. That seems more aligned with rational, functional benefits rather than the emotional or pleasurable experiences that hedonic consumption entails.\n\nC. Experiential consumption.\n\nThis one appears to be a perfect match for the definition of hedonic consumption. Experiential consumption emphasizes the experience and feelings that a product evokes in consumers. It's about the intangible aspects of consumption, such as joy, excitement, or even nostalgia, which go beyond the product's basic functionality.\n\nD. Brand management perspective.\n\nThis option seems to be about how brands are managed and positioned in the market. While brand management can influence consumer perceptions and experiences, it's not directly synonymous with hedonic consumption. It's more about the strategic marketing and positioning of the brand.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C, experiential consumption, seems to be the most accurate answer. It directly refers to the experience and emotions associated with consuming products, which aligns perfectly with the concept of hedonic consumption.\n\nJust to double-check, let me consider if any of the other options could also be considered forms of hedonic consumption.\n\nOption A, social interaction perspective, might involve some elements of hedonic consumption if using a product in social settings provides pleasure or enjoyment. However, it's more of an indirect association rather than a direct focus on the experiential aspects of consumption.\n\nOption B, functional utilization perspective, is clearly more aligned with utilitarian consumption, focusing on the practical uses and benefits of products.\n\nOption D, brand management perspective, is more about the marketing and strategic aspects of managing a brand, which isn't directly related to the consumer's experiential enjoyment of the product.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Experiential consumption.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
