He saw two police officers walking toward him. The officers were checking on a 911 call from a resident who observed a man in jeans and a jacket apparently selling drugs to people on the street. When the police first saw him, he was walking alone, in the area that the woman identified. As they approached, he suddenly crossed the street by jaywalking. They followed, and approaching from behind, asked him to stop. He started walking faster, away from them. The officers saw what appeared to be a heavy object bulging in his pocket as he moved. The officers, with over 10 years of foot patrol experience, stepped up and stopped him. They patted him down and found a concealed, unlicensed handgun in the jacket pocket. They then made a full search and found 50 packets of heroin. He filed a motion to suppress the gun and drug evidence. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?\n\nA. No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.\nB. No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.\nC. Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.\nD. Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about a police stop and search, and there's a motion to suppress evidence found during that stop. I need to figure out whether the court is likely to suppress that evidence or not. The options are pretty clear, but I need to understand the legal principles at play here.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures. That means police can't just stop and search anyone they want; there have to be specific reasons based on the circumstances.\n\nIn this case, there are two main parts to consider: the stop and the frisk (pat-down). The stop happened because the police saw the man jaywalking and then walking away from them when they approached. The frisk happened because they saw a bulge in his pocket that looked like a heavy object, which could be a weapon.\n\nLet me think about the stop first. The police were responding to a 911 call from a resident who reported seeing a man in jeans and a jacket selling drugs on the street. The area is known for high crime, specifically drug trafficking and gun violence. When the police saw the man, he matched the description and was in the area where the activity was reported.\n\nHe jaywalked when he saw the police approaching, and then walked faster when they followed him from behind. The police, who have over 10 years of foot patrol experience, decided to stop him based on these observations.\n\nNow, the question is whether the police had reasonable suspicion to stop him. Reasonable suspicion is less than probable cause but more than a hunch. It requires specific and articulable facts that, taken together with rational inferences, suggest that criminal activity may be afoot.\n\nLet's list out the factors here:\n\n1. The man matches the description of the suspect provided in the 911 call.\n\n2. He is in the exact area where the suspicious activity was reported.\n\n3. The area is known for high crime, specifically drug trafficking and gun violence.\n\n4. He jaywalks when he sees the police approaching.\n\n5. He walks faster when the police follow him from behind.\n\n6. The police officers have over 10 years of foot patrol experience, which might lend weight to their observations and decisions.\n\nI recall that in Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court established that police officers may conduct a brief investigative stop and a pat-down for weapons if they have reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in criminal activity and may be armed and dangerous.\n\nSo, combining these factors, does it add up to reasonable suspicion?\n\nOption A says \"No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.\"\n\nThis seems to align with what I'm thinking. The man matching the description, being in the reported area, the high-crime context, his evasive behavior, and the officers' experience all contribute to a reasonable suspicion that he might be involved in criminal activity and possibly armed.\n\nOption B says \"No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.\"\n\nProbable cause is a higher standard than reasonable suspicion. It requires more concrete evidence that a crime has been or is being committed. In this case, the man's behavior\u2014jaywalking and walking faster when approached by police\u2014might not rise to the level of probable cause for an arrest. Jaywalking is a minor offense, and walking faster away from police, while suspicious, isn't necessarily indicative of a crime. So, I'm not sure if probable cause exists here.\n\nOption C says \"Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.\"\n\nHmm, there are a few points here. First, the police didn't know if this was the same man as the one reported, but he matched the description and was in the exact area where the activity was reported. That seems like a reasonable connection.\n\nSecond, jaywalking is a minor traffic violation, but it's still against the law. However, it's not typically a basis for a stop if that's the only reason, especially since jaywalking can be common in urban areas without necessarily indicating criminal activity.\n\nThird, the man had a right to avoid the police, but his evasive behavior could be seen as indicative of guilt or an attempt to avoid being stopped for suspected criminal activity.\n\nSo, this option is arguing that the stop was unlawful because the police didn't have enough to connect him definitively to the reported activity and because jaywalking isn't a sufficient reason for a stop.\n\nOption D says \"Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.\"\n\nThis is similar to Option C, emphasizing that jaywalking and walking faster aren't enough to establish reasonable suspicion for a stop.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these options against the facts presented.\n\nI think the key here is whether the combination of factors amounts to reasonable suspicion. The man matching the description, being in the reported area, the high-crime context, his evasive behavior\u2014all these can be considered together to form reasonable suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, the officers' experience might give their observations more weight, as they are trained to recognize signs of criminal activity.\n\nSo, in this case, I lean towards Option A, which states that the accumulation of factors adds up to reasonable suspicion for the stop and articulable suspicion for the frisk.\n\nBut let's consider it more carefully.\n\nIf the police had reasonable suspicion to stop him, then the frisk was also justified if they had reasonable suspicion to believe he might be armed and dangerous. Seeing a heavy object bulging in his pocket would likely provide that suspicion.\n\nOnce they found the gun, that gave them probable cause to arrest him, and the search incident to arrest would allow them to find the heroin.\n\nIf the initial stop was lawful, then the subsequent frisk and search are also lawful.\n\nHowever, if the stop was unlawful, then everything that followed would be considered fruit of the poisonous tree and suppressed.\n\nGiven that, I need to ensure that the stop was indeed based on reasonable suspicion.\n\nLet me think about similar cases.\n\nIn Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court held that a police officer may stop a person based on reasonable suspicion and conduct a pat-down for weapons if there is reason to believe the person is armed and dangerous.\n\nIn this scenario, the police had a 911 call reporting a man selling drugs, a description that matches the man they saw, in the exact area reported, in a high-crime area known for drugs and guns, and he exhibited evasive behavior when approached.\n\nCourts often consider the totality of the circumstances, and in high-crime areas, such factors can be given more weight.\n\nMoreover, the officers' experience might be relevant in interpreting the man's behavior as indicative of criminal activity.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop him and frisk him.\n\nThus, the evidence should not be suppressed, which corresponds to Option A.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose that the man's behavior\u2014jaywalking and walking faster when approached by police\u2014could be interpreted as innocent behavior. Maybe he was just trying to get home quickly or didn't want to talk to the police for personal reasons.\n\nHowever, in the context of the 911 call and the matching description, it's harder to dismiss his behavior as entirely innocent.\n\nAdditionally, the bulge in his pocket that appeared to be a heavy object could reasonably be suspected as a weapon, especially in an area known for gun violence.\n\nTherefore, the frisk was justified under Terry.\n\nGiven all this, I think the court is unlikely to suppress the evidence.\n\nSo, the answer is A. No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk."
