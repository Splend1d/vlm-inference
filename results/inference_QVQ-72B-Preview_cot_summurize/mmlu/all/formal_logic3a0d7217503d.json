                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, the sentence we need to symbolize is:\n\n\"A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify the variables and what they represent. From the options, it seems like:\n\n- L: The person lived with you for all of the present year.\n\n- B: The person was born in the present year.\n\n- D: The person died in the present year.\n\n- H: Your home was the person's home for the entire time they were alive.\n\nThe sentence says that a person is considered to have lived with you for the entire year under certain conditions. So, it's saying that L is true if certain other things are true.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L\n\nB. [L \u2283 (B \u2228 D)] \u2022 H\n\nC. L \u2283 [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H]\n\nD. (B \u2228 D \u2022 H) \u2283 L\n\nI need to find which of these correctly represents the given sentence.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n\"A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive.\"\n\nSo, it's saying that L is true if B or D is true, and H is true.\n\nIn logical terms, that would be:\n\nL if (B \u2228 D) and H.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H \u2283 L\n\nWait, but in logic, \"if P and Q, then R\" is (P \u2022 Q) \u2283 R.\n\nSo, in this case, it's (B \u2228 D) and H, which is (B \u2228 D) \u2022 H, implying L.\n\nSo, (B \u2228 D) \u2022 H \u2283 L.\n\nThat matches option A: [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L\n\nOption C is L \u2283 [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H], which is the converse, saying that if L is true, then (B \u2228 D) and H are true. But that's not what the original sentence is saying.\n\nOption B is [L \u2283 (B \u2228 D)] \u2022 H, which says that if L then B or D, and also H is true. This doesn't match the original meaning.\n\nOption D is (B \u2228 D \u2022 H) \u2283 L. This seems similar to option A, but the placement of the dot is important in logic notation. In some systems, a dot can represent conjunction, but it's crucial to see the grouping.\n\nWait, in the standard logical notation, a dot is used to represent conjunction, but the precedence might vary. To avoid ambiguity, it's best to use parentheses to group the conjunctions properly.\n\nGiven that, option A is [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L, which seems correct.\n\nOption D is (B \u2228 D \u2022 H) \u2283 L, which might be interpreted as B \u2228 (D \u2022 H) \u2283 L, which is different from option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be option A: [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOriginal sentence: L if (B or D) and H.\n\nSo, (B \u2228 D) \u2022 H \u2283 L.\n\nOption A is [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L, which matches this.\n\nOption D, if interpreted as B \u2228 (D \u2022 H), would mean that either B is true, or both D and H are true, implying L. That's different from the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct symbolization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
