                    "text": "Let's see. So, the question is about what would happen to the Moon if the force of gravity between it and the Earth suddenly stopped. I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that gravity is what keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth. It's like the Moon is constantly falling towards the Earth, but its forward motion carries it around in a circle instead of crashing into us. So, without gravity, that pulling force would be gone.\n\nLet me recall Newton's first law of motion. It says that an object will either remain at rest or continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force. So, if gravity suddenly stops, there's no longer a force pulling the Moon towards the Earth.\n\nSo, the Moon would no longer be in orbit around the Earth. Instead, it would continue moving in a straight line at its current speed and direction. That means it would leave its orbit and drift away into space.\n\nNow, about its rotation. The Moon rotates on its axis, which is different from its revolution around the Earth. Gravity affects the Moon's orbit around the Earth, but does it affect the Moon's rotation on its axis?\n\nI think that gravity does influence the Moon's rotation, but mostly in terms of tidal locking, which is why we always see the same side of the Moon from Earth. Without gravity, I'm not sure if the Moon would continue rotating on its axis or not.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose gravity stops instantly. The Moon is currently rotating at a certain rate, and it's also orbiting the Earth. If gravity stops, the orbital motion would cease, and the Moon would fly off in a straight line.\n\nBut what about its rotation? Would that stop as well? I don't think so. Rotation on its axis is a separate motion from its orbit. So, unless there's something coupling the two, I would guess that the Moon would continue rotating on its axis even if gravity stopped.\n\nWait a minute, but without gravity, would there be any torque or other forces that could affect the rotation? Actually, torque is what changes rotational motion, and torque is often related to forces acting at a distance. So, if gravity stops, maybe there's less torque acting on the Moon, and thus its rotation would continue unchanged.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure here. Maybe I should look into the equations of rotational motion. Angular momentum is conserved in the absence of external torques. So, if gravity stops, and there are no other torques acting on the Moon, then its angular momentum should be conserved, meaning it would continue rotating at the same rate.\n\nOn the other hand, if gravity is what's maintaining the tidal locking, then without it, maybe the rotation would change. But I think that tidal locking is a result of gravitational interactions over time, not something that would instantly change if gravity stopped.\n\nSo, putting it all together, without gravity, the Moon would stop orbiting the Earth and fly off in a straight line. But it would continue rotating on its axis at the same rate it was before, since rotation is a separate motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement would be B: It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth.\n\nLet me just double-check. Option A says it would continue rotating and revolving as usual, but that can't be right because without gravity, the revolving should stop.\n\nOption C says it would stop rotating but continue revolving, which also doesn't make sense because I think it would stop revolving but continue rotating.\n\nOption D says it would stop both rotating and revolving, which might seem plausible, but based on my reasoning, it should continue rotating even if it stops revolving.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
