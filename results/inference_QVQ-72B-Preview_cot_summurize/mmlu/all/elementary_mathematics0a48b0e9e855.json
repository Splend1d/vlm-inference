                    "text": "Let's see here. Marguerite has been getting scores between 75 and 89 on her previous spelling tests, and then she gets a perfect score of 100 on her next test. I need to figure out which of these statements is true: A. The mode will increase. B. The mean will increase. C. The mean will decrease. D. The median will decrease.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each of these terms means in statistics. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. The mean is the average of the numbers. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order.\n\nSo, Marguerite has several test scores between 75 and 89. Let's assume she has taken more than one test before, so there are multiple scores in that range. Then she gets a 100 on her next test, which is higher than all her previous scores.\n\nLet's consider the mean first. The mean is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. If she had, say, n tests before with scores between 75 and 89, and now she has n+1 tests with the new score of 100, the total sum of scores will be the previous sum plus 100. Since 100 is higher than the previous scores, the sum increases by 100 minus the previous score's average. So, the mean should go up because the higher score pulls the average up. That means option B. The mean will increase is likely true.\n\nBut let's check option C. The mean will decrease. If the mean increases as I thought, then this can't be true.\n\nNow, the median. The median is the middle value when the scores are ordered. If she has an even number of tests, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Since she had scores between 75 and 89 and now has a 100, which is higher, adding this higher score should shift the median upwards. So, the median should increase, not decrease. So, option D. The median will decrease is probably false.\n\nNext, the mode. The mode is the most frequent score. We don't know the distribution of her previous scores. If she had multiple scores at, say, 80, and only one at 85, then 80 would be the mode. Adding a 100 might not change the mode if there's already a dominant frequency in the lower scores. However, if all her previous scores were unique, then the mode might change if the 100 becomes the only mode. But since the problem says \"a score between 75 and 89,\" it's possible she has multiple scores at the same value, making that the mode. Adding a 100 might or might not change the mode, depending on the previous frequencies. This seems a bit unclear without more specific information.\n\nGiven that, maybe I need to consider that if she has multiple scores at a certain value, say 80, and only one at other values, then the mode is 80, and adding a 100 wouldn't change that. But if all previous scores were unique, then adding a 100 would make it one of several modes. However, since the question says \"the mode will increase,\" that suggests that the mode value is going up, which might not necessarily happen.\n\nWait, but option A says \"the mode will increase.\" Given that, and considering that the mode depends on frequency, and without specific frequencies, it's hard to say for sure. But since the new score is higher and assuming it's not repeating any previous score, the mode might stay the same or change to include the new score, but it's not necessarily increasing in value.\n\nOn the other hand, the mean definitely increases because the new score is higher than the previous ones, pulling the average up.\n\nSo, between options B and C for the mean, only B is true, since the mean increases.\n\nFor the median, since the new score is higher, the median should also increase, not decrease, so D is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is B. The mean will increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
