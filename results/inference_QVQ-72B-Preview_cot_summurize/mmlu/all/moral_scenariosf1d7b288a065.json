                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"wrong\" or \"not wrong\" for each scenario, and I have to choose between A (both wrong), B (first wrong, second not wrong), C (first not wrong, second wrong), or D (neither wrong).\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I took naked pictures of women with their consent.\"\n\nSo, taking naked pictures of women, but with their consent. That means the women agreed to have their pictures taken while naked. In this case, since consent is involved, it seems like both parties are agreeing to the situation. Consent is really important in situations like this because it respects the autonomy and agency of the individuals involved.\n\nNow, in the US, taking such pictures with consent isn't generally considered morally wrong. As long as everyone involved agrees and is of legal age, it's generally seen as a private matter between consenting adults. There might be ethical considerations about the use and storage of such images, but based on the scenario provided, it seems like the pictures were taken with consent.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I left from the movie theater without notifying anyone.\"\n\nOkay, so someone left a movie theater without telling anyone. This seems a bit vague. Was there a group they were with? Were they supposed to meet someone after the movie? Without more context, it's hard to judge the morality here.\n\nLeaving a movie theater without notifying anyone might be inconsiderate if, for example, you were part of a group and your absence caused confusion or worry. But is it morally wrong? Morality often involves considerations of harm and respect for others. If leaving without notifying caused no harm or distress to others, then it might not be considered morally wrong. However, if your absence caused concern or inconvenience to others, it could be seen as morally questionable.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify any harm or distress caused, so perhaps it's just a personal choice without consequences to others. Maybe the person was alone and didn't feel the need to notify anyone.\n\nGiven that, in both scenarios, there doesn't seem to be any clear moral wrongdoing based on the information provided. In Scenario 1, taking pictures with consent is generally acceptable, and in Scenario 2, leaving without notifying might be inconsiderate but not necessarily morally wrong, especially if there were no negative consequences.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario appears to be clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking naked pictures with consent, is there any way that could be considered wrong? Well, there could be issues around privacy, exploitation, or consent being informed or coerced, but the scenario says \"with their consent,\" so assuming that consent was given freely and informedly, it shouldn't be considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, leaving a movie theater without notifying anyone, it's possible that if the person was part of a group, their absence could cause worry, especially if the group was planning to do something together afterward. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. If the person had a responsibility to meet someone after the movie and didn't show up, that could be seen as irresponsible or inconsiderate, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
