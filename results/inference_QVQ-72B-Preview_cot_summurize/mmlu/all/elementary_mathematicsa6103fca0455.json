                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here: if 3 cans of pears cost $2.37, how many cans of pears can I buy for $9.48? Okay, so I need to find out how many cans I can get for that amount of money.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the price per can. So, if 3 cans cost $2.37, then one can would cost less than that, right? Let me divide $2.37 by 3 to find the price per can. So, $2.37 divided by 3 is... let's see, 2.37 divided by 3. Well, 3 times 0.79 is 2.37. So, $0.79 per can.\n\nNow, if I have $9.48 to spend, and each can costs $0.79, then the number of cans I can buy is $9.48 divided by $0.79 per can. That should give me the total number of cans I can purchase.\n\nLet me do that division. $9.48 divided by $0.79. Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can make it easier by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals. So, 948 cents divided by 79 cents per can. That should be the same thing.\n\nNow, 948 divided by 79. Let me try to do this division. 79 times 12 is 948, because 70 times 12 is 840, and 9 times 12 is 108, so 840 plus 108 is 948. So, 79 times 12 equals 948.\n\nTherefore, $9.48 divided by $0.79 per can equals 12 cans.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can use another method to confirm. If 3 cans cost $2.37, then how much would 12 cans cost? Well, 12 divided by 3 is 4, so 4 times $2.37 should be $9.48. Let me calculate that: 4 times 2 is 8, 4 times 0.3 is 1.2, and 4 times 0.07 is 0.28. So, 8 plus 1.2 is 9.2, plus 0.28 is $9.48. Perfect, that matches the amount I have.\n\nSo, for $9.48, I can buy 12 cans of pears.\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another way to look at this. Maybe using fractions or something. If 3 cans are $2.37, then per can it's $0.79, as I said. Then, $9.48 divided by $0.79 is indeed 12. Alternatively, since 3 cans cost $2.37, then for $9.48, which is 9.48 divided by 2.37 times 3 cans. Let's compute that: 9.48 divided by 2.37 is 4, because 2.37 times 4 is 9.48. So, 4 times 3 cans is 12 cans. Same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The correct answer should be 12 cans.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3 cans\n\nB. 12 cans\n\nC. 36 cans\n\nD. 13 cans\n\nSo, option B. 12 cans.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's eliminate the other options:\n\nA. 3 cans: That's the original quantity for $2.37, but we have more money, so fewer cans isn't right.\n\nC. 36 cans: That seems too many. 3 cans for $2.37, so 36 cans would cost 12 times that, which is $28.44, I think. Wait, let's check: 36 divided by 3 is 12, so 12 times $2.37 is $28.44, which is more than $9.48. So, that's not correct.\n\nD. 13 cans: Let's see, if 12 cans cost exactly $9.48, then 13 cans would cost more, which would be $9.48 plus another $0.79, totaling $10.27, which is more than $9.48. So, with only $9.48, I can't buy 13 cans.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed 12 cans, option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12\\ \\text{cans}} \\]"
