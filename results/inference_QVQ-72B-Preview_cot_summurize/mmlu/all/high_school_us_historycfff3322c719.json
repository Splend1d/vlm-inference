I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves. But again, I stand on my statement that I think that libertarianism and conservatism are traveling the same path.\"\nRonald Reagan, Interview published in Reason magazine, 1975\nWhich of the following groups would be most opposed to the sentiments expressed in the excerpt above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this excerpt from an interview with Ronald Reagan in 1975, and it's about his views on conservatism and libertarianism. He says that at the core, conservatism is really libertarianism. He also talks about how today's conservatives would have been liberals during the American Revolution, and today's liberals would have been Tories. That's interesting.\n\nReagan defines conservatism as a desire for less government interference, less centralized authority, and more individual freedom. He says this is similar to what libertarianism is. However, he mentions that there are libertarians who might want almost no government at all, bordering on anarchy, which he doesn't agree with. He believes there are legitimate government functions necessary to maintain freedom and prevent tyranny by individuals or the strongest people taking over.\n\nHe concludes by saying that, despite some differences, libertarianism and conservatism are aligned in their path.\n\nNow, the question is asking which group would be most opposed to the sentiments expressed in this excerpt. The options are:\n\nA. Neoconservatives\n\nB. Reagan Democrats\n\nC. Progressive Liberals\n\nD. Populists\n\nI need to think about each of these groups and see which one would most likely disagree with Reagan's views here.\n\nFirst, let's consider Neoconservatives. Neoconservatism is a political ideology that combines conservative values with hawkish foreign policy views. They generally support strong military intervention to promote democracy and American interests abroad. Now, Reagan was known for his strong anti-communist foreign policy, which might align with neoconservative views. However, neoconservatives might disagree with Reagan's emphasis on limited government and libertarian principles, especially if they believe in a strong central government to carry out their foreign policy agenda. But I'm not entirely sure if they would be the most opposed.\n\nNext, Reagan Democrats. This term refers to Democrats who crossed party lines to support Reagan, particularly in the 1980s. These were often conservative or moderate Democrats, especially in the South, who agreed with Reagan's policies on issues like taxes, regulation, and national defense. Since they supported Reagan, they probably agreed with his views on conservatism and libertarianism. So, they wouldn't be opposed to his sentiments in this excerpt.\n\nProgressive Liberals. Progressives are generally associated with the left side of the political spectrum, advocating for social justice, equality, and often more government intervention to achieve these goals. Liberals typically support individual liberties but also believe in a significant role for government in regulating the economy and providing social services. Given that, their views would likely conflict with Reagan's emphasis on limited government and free markets. Progressives would probably disagree with Reagan's equation of conservatism and libertarianism, especially if they see libertarianism as too focused on individual freedom at the expense of collective well-being.\n\nPopulists. Populism can be a bit tricky because it can manifest on both the left and the right. Generally, populists believe that the common people are exploited by elite forces, whether in government, business, or media. They often support policies that they believe will benefit the \"ordinary\" person, sometimes at the expense of established institutions. Populists can be found in both conservative and liberal camps. Some populists might agree with Reagan's critique of big government, while others might disagree with his emphasis on individual freedom over collective action.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that Progressive Liberals would be most opposed to Reagan's sentiments in this excerpt. Their ideological stance generally opposes the limited government and free-market emphasis of conservatism and libertarianism. They are more likely to advocate for government intervention to address social and economic inequalities, which contradicts Reagan's desire for less government interference.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Progressive Liberals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
