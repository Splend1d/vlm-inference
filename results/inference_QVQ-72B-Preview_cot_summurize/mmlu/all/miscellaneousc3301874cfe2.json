Freddie Mac, D. Fannie Mae. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the correct nickname for the Federal National Mortgage Association.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Federal National Mortgage Association is a government-sponsored enterprise in the United States. It's involved in the mortgage finance industry, right? But what's its nickname?\n\nLet me think about this. I've heard of Fannie Mae before. Is that related to the Federal National Mortgage Association? Wait, yes, I think Fannie Mae is a nickname for it. Let me double-check that.\n\nOption D is Fannie Mae. So, if Fannie Mae is the nickname for the Federal National Mortgage Association, then that would be the answer. But just to be sure, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is Morty. That sounds like a made-up name or maybe a character from a movie, but not something I recall being associated with the Federal National Mortgage Association. So, probably not that one.\n\nOption B is FEMA. I know FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is a different organization altogether. They deal with disasters and emergencies, not mortgages. So, that can't be it.\n\nOption C is Freddie Mac. I've heard of Freddie Mac too. Wait, is that another nickname for the same organization, or is Freddie Mac a different entity?\n\nLet me recall: Freddie Mac is actually the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, which is another government-sponsored enterprise, but separate from the Federal National Mortgage Association. So, Freddie Mac is not the nickname for the Federal National Mortgage Association; it's a different organization.\n\nTherefore, Freddie Mac is out of the question.\n\nSo, between the options given, Fannie Mae seems to be the correct nickname for the Federal National Mortgage Association.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try to recall if there's any other common nickname for the Federal National Mortgage Association. I don't think so. Fannie Mae is the one that sticks out in my mind.\n\nMoreover, I remember that Fannie Mae was established to help expand homeownership by making mortgage loans more accessible. It's a significant player in the secondary mortgage market, buying mortgages from lenders and pooling them into mortgage-backed securities.\n\nGiven all that, I'm fairly confident that Fannie Mae is the correct nickname for the Federal National Mortgage Association.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Fannie Mae.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
