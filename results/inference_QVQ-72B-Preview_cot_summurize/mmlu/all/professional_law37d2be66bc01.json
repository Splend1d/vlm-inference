The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following \"modified\" comparative negligence statute:\"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. \"Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of\n\nA. $100,000. 00\nB. $55,000. 00\nC. $45,000. 00\nD. nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a car accident, and there's a question about how much the court should award in damages based on the jury's findings. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two main parties involved in the accident: the fan who was driving and his friend who was a passenger. The fan was speeding, going 50 mph in a 25 mph zone, and he crossed an intersection while the light was changing from amber to red. At the same time, another car entered the intersection on a red light and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend got injured and is now suing the driver who ran the red light for damages.\n\nNow, the jurisdiction has a \"modified\" comparative negligence statute. It says that a negligent plaintiff can recover damages as long as their negligence isn't equal to or greater than the defendant's negligence. Otherwise, they can't recover anything.\n\nIn this case, the jury has made some findings:\n\n1. The fan was 55% negligent for speeding.\n\n2. The driver was 45% negligent for driving through a red light.\n\n3. The friend suffered $100,000 in damages.\n\nWait a minute, the friend is the plaintiff here, right? He's suing the driver who ran the red light. So, the driver is the defendant.\n\nBut the jury has attributed 55% negligence to the fan, who was driving, and 45% to the driver who ran the red light.\n\nHmm, but the friend was a passenger in the fan's car. Passengers generally aren't considered negligent unless they were distracting the driver or something like that, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, in this situation, the friend didn't contribute to the accident, right? He was just along for the ride.\n\nBut the statute talks about the plaintiff's negligence. Since the friend didn't contribute to the accident, does that mean his negligence is zero?\n\nWait, but the jury found that the fan was 55% negligent. Does that mean the fan's negligence affects the friend's ability to recover damages?\n\nI think I need to understand the relationship between the fan's negligence and the friend's claim against the driver.\n\nLet me see. The friend is suing the driver who ran the red light. The driver is the one being sued, so the friend is the plaintiff, and the driver is the defendant.\n\nThe jury has apportioned fault between the fan and the driver, but the friend wasn't negligent. So, according to the modified comparative negligence rule, since the plaintiff (the friend) wasn't negligent, his recovery shouldn't be reduced based on his own negligence.\n\nBut the statute says that \"a negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted.\"\n\nIn this case, the friend is the plaintiff, and he wasn't negligent. So, his recovery shouldn't be reduced based on his own negligence because he wasn't negligent.\n\nBut the jury has found that the fan was 55% negligent, and the driver was 45% negligent.\n\nI think this is where it gets a bit tricky. In some jurisdictions, if there are multiple parties involved, their negligence might be compared in different ways.\n\nBut in this specific case, since the friend wasn't negligent, his recovery shouldn't be reduced based on his own negligence.\n\nHowever, maybe the fan's negligence affects the driver's liability to the friend.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the driver is 45% at fault, and the fan is 55% at fault. If the friend is suing the driver, the driver might argue that the fan's negligence should reduce the friend's recovery.\n\nBut according to the statute, it's the plaintiff's negligence that matters. Since the friend wasn't negligent, his recovery shouldn't be reduced.\n\nSo, in this case, the friend should be able to recover the full amount of his damages from the driver, which is $100,000.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because the fan was mostly at fault for speeding.\n\nHowever, the friend wasn't negligent; he was just a passenger. So, he shouldn't be penalized for the fan's negligence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's some doctrine that holds the driver responsible for the full amount of the friend's damages, regardless of the fan's negligence.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the driver can seek contribution from the fan later, but that's between the driver and the fan.\n\nIn terms of the friend's claim against the driver, since the friend wasn't negligent, he should be able to recover the full amount of his damages.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. $100,000.00.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nThe jury found that the driver was 45% negligent, and the fan was 55% negligent. The friend was 0% negligent.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if multiple parties are at fault, the plaintiff can recover from any of them, but the defendants can seek contribution from each other.\n\nBut again, since the friend wasn't negligent, his recovery shouldn't be reduced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would reduce the damages by the percentage of the fan's negligence.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because the friend wasn't negligent.\n\nWait, maybe the fan's negligence is considered in apportioning the fault among the parties, but since the friend wasn't negligent, his recovery shouldn't be reduced.\n\nI think the correct answer is A. $100,000.00.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the options:\n\nA. $100,000.00 \u2013 full recovery since plaintiff was not negligent.\n\nB. $55,000.00 \u2013 this might suggest reducing the damages by the fan's negligence, but that doesn't make sense because the friend wasn't negligent.\n\nC. $45,000.00 \u2013 reducing damages by the driver's negligence, but again, since the friend wasn't negligent, his recovery shouldn't be reduced based on his own negligence, which he doesn't have.\n\nD. Nothing, because the fan was more negligent than the driver \u2013 but the friend wasn't negligent, so his recovery shouldn't be barred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $100,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
