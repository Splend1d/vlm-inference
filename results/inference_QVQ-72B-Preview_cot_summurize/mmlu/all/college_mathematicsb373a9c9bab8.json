                    "text": "So I've got this ladder problem here. There's a ladder that's 9 meters long, leaning against a vertical wall on level ground. The bottom of the ladder is being moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, and as a result, the top of the ladder slides downward along the wall. I need to find out how fast the top end of the ladder is sliding downward when the top end is 3 meters above the ground.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to visualize this scenario. There's a wall that's vertical, and the ground is level, so it's horizontal. The ladder is leaning against the wall, forming a right triangle with the wall and the ground. The ladder is the hypotenuse of this triangle, and its length is fixed at 9 meters.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\(x\\) as the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall.\n\n- \\(y\\) as the height from the top of the ladder to the ground.\n\nSince the ladder, wall, and ground form a right triangle, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 = 81\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 81\\]\n\nNow, the bottom of the ladder is being moved away from the wall at a rate of 2 meters per second. That means \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\) m/s.\n\nI need to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding downward, which is \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\), when \\(y = 3\\) meters.\n\nThis sounds like a related rates problem, where I need to find the rate of change of one variable with respect to time, given the rate of change of another variable.\n\nTo find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\), I can use implicit differentiation on the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 81\\).\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to time \\(t\\), I get:\n\n\\[2x \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nWait, why is it equal to zero? Because the ladder's length is constant, so the rate of change of \\(x^2 + y^2\\) with respect to time is zero.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[2x \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\[x \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt} + y \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) when \\(y = 3\\) meters.\n\nFirst, I should find the value of \\(x\\) when \\(y = 3\\).\n\nPlugging \\(y = 3\\) into the Pythagorean equation:\n\n\\[x^2 + 3^2 = 81\\]\\[x^2 + 9 = 81\\]\\[x^2 = 81 - 9 = 72\\]\\[x = \\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{36 \\cdot 2} = 6\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSo, when \\(y = 3\\), \\(x = 6\\sqrt{2}\\) meters.\n\nNow, plug \\(x = 6\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(y = 3\\), and \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\) m/s into the differentiated equation:\n\n\\[(6\\sqrt{2})(2) + (3)\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\\[12\\sqrt{2} + 3\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\):\n\n\\[3\\frac{dy}{dt} = -12\\sqrt{2}\\]\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{3} = -4\\sqrt{2}\\] meters per second.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that \\(y\\) is decreasing, which makes sense because the top of the ladder is sliding downward.\n\nSo, the top end of the ladder is sliding downward at a rate of \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\) meters per second.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12*sqrt(2)\n\nB. 6*sqrt(2)\n\nC. 4*sqrt(2)\n\nD. 1/(2*sqrt(2))\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 4*sqrt(2)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
