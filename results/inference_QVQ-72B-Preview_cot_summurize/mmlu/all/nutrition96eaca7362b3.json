                    "text": "So I've got this question about the oral phase of digestion, and I need to pick which statement is incorrect. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that about 2% of the energy content of food is expended during the action of chewing and swallowing it. That sounds plausible. I remember learning that digestion starts in the mouth with mechanical breakdown by chewing and chemical breakdown by salivary enzymes. It makes sense that some energy is used in this process, and 2% seems like a reasonable estimate, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look this up later for accuracy, but for now, I'll consider it correct.\n\nOption B states that swallowing involves contraction and relaxation of at least 14 groups of muscles in about 10 seconds in healthy subjects. I know that swallowing is a complex process involving both voluntary and involuntary actions. It's coordinated by neural mechanisms in the brainstem and involves multiple muscle groups. The fact that it happens so quickly\u2014around 10 seconds\u2014is impressive when you think about all that's involved. So, this seems correct too.\n\nOption C mentions that the biofilm covering tooth enamel contains several salivary and bacterial enzymes. Biofilms on teeth are mostly composed of bacteria, forming plaque, which is a mixture of bacteria, their byproducts, and salivary components. Salivary enzymes like amylase are present in saliva and can be part of this biofilm. Bacterial enzymes are also likely present since bacteria produce various enzymes for their metabolism and interaction with the host. So, this seems accurate.\n\nOption D says that salivary amylase digests the dextran film on tooth enamel formed from dietary sucrose. Hmm, I need to be careful here. Salivary amylase is indeed present in saliva and helps break down starches into smaller sugars like maltose. However, dextran is a type of polysaccharide produced by some bacteria, particularly Streptococcus mutans, from sucrose. This dextran forms part of the extracellular matrix of dental plaque and can contribute to tooth decay.\n\nNow, salivary amylase primarily targets alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds in starches, whereas dextran can have both alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,4 bonds, depending on the type. I recall that salivary amylase isn't very effective at breaking down dextran because of its structure, especially the alpha-1,3 bonds. So, this statement might be incorrect.\n\nTo double-check, I should recall that dextran is mainly composed of alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,4 linked glucose units, whereas salivary amylase primarily hydrolyzes alpha-1,4 bonds in starch. Therefore, salivary amylase would not effectively digest dextran, especially the alpha-1,3 bonds, which are more resistant to amylase digestion. So, it's likely that salivary amylase does not digest the dextran film on tooth enamel.\n\nTherefore, option D is the incorrect statement.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Option A: Seems correct; chewing and swallowing use some energy, and 2% is a reasonable estimate.\n\n- Option B: Also correct; swallowing is a complex process involving many muscle groups and happens quickly.\n\n- Option C: Correct; biofilms on teeth contain both salivary and bacterial enzymes.\n\n- Option D: Incorrect because salivary amylase primarily digests starches with alpha-1,4 bonds, not dextran, which has both alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,4 bonds.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
