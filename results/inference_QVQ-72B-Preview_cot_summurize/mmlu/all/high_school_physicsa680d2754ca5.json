                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a textbook weighs 30 N at sea level, and Earth's radius is 6,400 km. I need to find the best estimate of the textbook's weight on a mountain peak that's 6,000 m above sea level. The options are 60 N, 15 N, 30 N, and 7.5 N.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how weight changes with altitude. I know that weight is basically the force due to gravity, and it's given by the formula:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{gm}{r^2}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the object,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nBut wait, that looks like the universal law of gravitation, where:\n\n\\[f = \\frac{gm_1m_2}{r^2}\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(w = mg\\), and \\(g = \\frac{gm_e}{r^2}\\), where \\(m_e\\) is the mass of the Earth and \\(g\\) is the gravitational constant.\n\nSo, the weight \\(w\\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[w = m \\cdot \\frac{gm_e}{r^2}\\]\n\nBut since mass \\(m\\) is constant, the weight is inversely proportional to the square of the distance \\(r\\).\n\nSo, if the distance \\(r\\) increases, the weight decreases, and vice versa.\n\nNow, at sea level, the distance \\(r\\) is approximately equal to the Earth's radius, which is 6,400 km, or 6,400,000 m.\n\nOn the mountain peak, the distance \\(r\\) is 6,400,000 m + 6,000 m = 6,406,000 m.\n\nI need to find the weight at this new distance.\n\nSince weight is inversely proportional to \\(r^2\\), the ratio of weights should be equal to the inverse square of the distances.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\\frac{w_{\\text{new}}}{w_{\\text{sea level}}} = \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{sea level}}}{r_{\\text{new}}} \\right)^2\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\\frac{w_{\\text{new}}}{30 \\text{ N}} = \\left( \\frac{6,400,000 \\text{ m}}{6,406,000 \\text{ m}} \\right)^2\\]\n\nLet me calculate that fraction first:\n\n\\[\\frac{6,400,000}{6,406,000} = \\frac{6,400}{6,406} = \\frac{6,400}{6,406}\\]\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[\\frac{6,400 \\div 2}{6,406 \\div 2} = \\frac{3,200}{3,203}\\]\n\nNow, squaring this fraction:\n\n\\[\\left( \\frac{3,200}{3,203} \\right)^2 = \\frac{3,200^2}{3,203^2}\\]\n\nCalculating \\(3,200^2\\):\n\n\\[3,200 \\times 3,200 = 10,240,000\\]\n\nAnd \\(3,203^2\\):\n\n\\[3,203 \\times 3,203\\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFirst, \\(3,200 \\times 3,200 = 10,240,000\\)\n\nThen, \\(3,200 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 19,200\\)\n\nAnd \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n\nSo, \\(3,203^2 = 10,240,000 + 19,200 + 9 = 10,259,209\\)\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\n\\[\\frac{10,240,000}{10,259,209}\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this fraction:\n\n\\[10,240,000 \\div 10,259,209 \\approx 0.998\\]\n\nSo, \\(w_{\\text{new}} = 30 \\text{ N} \\times 0.998 \\approx 29.94 \\text{ N}\\)\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 60 N\n\nB. 15 N\n\nC. 30 N\n\nD. 7.5 N\n\n29.94 N is closest to 30 N.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any other factor I'm missing. For example, does the weight change significantly at such a small altitude increase?\n\nWell, 6,000 m is 6 kilometers, which is not that much compared to the Earth's radius of 6,400 kilometers. So, the change in distance is relatively small, meaning the weight shouldn't change much.\n\nTherefore, the weight remains approximately 30 N, so the answer should be C. 30 N.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculation to be sure.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[w_{\\text{new}} = w_{\\text{sea level}} \\times \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{sea level}}}{r_{\\text{new}}} \\right)^2\\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[w_{\\text{new}} = 30 \\times \\left( \\frac{6,400,000}{6,406,000} \\right)^2\\]\n\nWe already calculated that \\(\\left( \\frac{6,400,000}{6,406,000} \\right)^2 \\approx 0.998\\)\n\nSo, \\(w_{\\text{new}} = 30 \\times 0.998 = 29.94 \\text{ N}\\), which rounds to 30 N.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate is 30 N, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
