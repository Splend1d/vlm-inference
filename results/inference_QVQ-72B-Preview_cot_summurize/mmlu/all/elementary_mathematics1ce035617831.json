                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are 6 rows of chairs set up for a meeting, and each row has 8 chairs. I need to find out the total number of chairs. Let me see... I think this is a multiplication problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are 6 rows, and each row has 8 chairs. So, if I multiply the number of rows by the number of chairs in each row, that should give me the total number of chairs.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal chairs = number of rows \u00d7 number of chairs per row\n\nSo, total chairs = 6 \u00d7 8\n\nHmm, 6 times 8. I know that 6 times 8 is 48.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can count them to be sure. Let's see, if I have six rows and each row has eight chairs:\n\nRow 1: 8 chairs\n\nRow 2: 8 chairs\n\nRow 3: 8 chairs\n\nRow 4: 8 chairs\n\nRow 5: 8 chairs\n\nRow 6: 8 chairs\n\nNow, if I add them all up: 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8, that's 6 eights, which is 48.\n\nOkay, that seems right. So, the total number of chairs is 48.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 14\n\nB. 36\n\nC. 48\n\nD. 64\n\nSo, 48 is option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps I can think about multiplication tables. The multiplication table of 6 and 8 is something I should know.\n\nLet me recall: 6 times 8 is 48. Yeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 8 times 6. Since multiplication is commutative, 8 times 6 is also 48.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can break it down further to confirm. Let's see, 6 times 10 is 60, but that's too high. But maybe I can think of 6 times 8 as 6 times 7 plus 6 times 1.\n\nSix times 7 is 42, and six times 1 is 6. So, 42 plus 6 is 48. That matches again.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 8 times 6. Eight times 5 is 40, and eight times 1 is 8. So, 40 plus 8 is 48.\n\nAll these methods point to 48 being the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider if there could be any other factor to consider in the problem. The problem says there were 6 rows of chairs set up for a meeting, and each row had 8 chairs. It doesn't mention any additional chairs or any chairs being removed, so I think the total is simply 6 times 8.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can visualize it. If I draw six rows, and each row has eight chairs, I can try to count them. Let me sketch this out.\n\nRow 1: chairs 1 through 8\n\nRow 2: chairs 9 through 16\n\nRow 3: chairs 17 through 24\n\nRow 4: chairs 25 through 32\n\nRow 5: chairs 33 through 40\n\nRow 6: chairs 41 through 48\n\nYes, that's 48 chairs in total.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to confirm that the total number of chairs is 48. So, the answer should be C. 48.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look back at the options quickly:\n\nA. 14\n\nB. 36\n\nC. 48\n\nD. 64\n\nYes, 48 is clearly the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
