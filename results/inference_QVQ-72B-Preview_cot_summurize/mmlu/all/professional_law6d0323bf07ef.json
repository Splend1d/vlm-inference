                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out if this student will be found guilty of violating an attempt statute. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's this anti-noise statute in the city that prohibits amplification devices in public places that emit loud and raucous noises. The city passed this law to keep things quiet and to avoid distractions to traffic. Makes sense.\n\nThen, there's a high school student who was driving around with a pretty powerful car stereo system, including 12-inch subwoofers in the back. He was listening to punk music, which is known for being loud, and he turned the volume all the way up as he drove past the high school. A police car heard the music and arrested him for violating the anti-noise statute.\n\nBut then, before his trial, the highest court in the state ruled that the anti-noise statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad. So, the charges against the student were dropped, and his case was dismissed.\n\nAfter that, the district attorney's office decided to prosecute the student under a state attempt statute. This attempt statute said that legal impossibility was no defense. So, they charged the student with attempting to violate the anti-noise statute.\n\nNow, at trial, the student testified that he intentionally turned up the stereo to its highest level because his favorite song was playing. So, he admits to having the intent to play the music loudly, but the law he was originally charged with violating has been declared unconstitutional.\n\nThe question is, will the student be found guilty of violating the attempt statute?\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nOption A says yes, because he possessed the requisite intent. Hmm, but just having the intent isn't enough if the law he was trying to violate is unconstitutional, right? I mean, if the law doesn't exist, how can he be guilty of attempting to violate it?\n\nOption B says yes, because dismissal of the initial charge was not a final judgment, and therefore double jeopardy doesn't attach. Okay, so double jeopardy prevents being tried twice for the same offense. If the initial charge was dismissed because the law was unconstitutional, is that considered a final judgment? I think a final judgment is usually a conviction or an acquittal, not a dismissal based on the law being invalid.\n\nOption C says no, because double jeopardy precludes prosecution for attempt after the initial prosecution was dismissed. But wait, if the dismissal was based on the law being invalid, is that the same as a acquittal? I don't think so. An acquittal is when the person is found not guilty based on the facts of the case, not because the law itself is invalid.\n\nOption D says no, because a defendant cannot be retried for attempted commission of a crime that has been ruled unconstitutional by a state's highest court. This seems similar to option C, but more specific. It's saying that since the law is invalid, you can't be tried for attempting to violate it.\n\nI need to think more carefully.\n\nFirst, double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense. But in this case, the initial prosecution was based on the anti-noise statute, which was ruled unconstitutional. So, the charges were dismissed not because the student was found not guilty, but because the law itself was invalid.\n\nNow, the student is being prosecuted under a different law\u2014the attempt statute. So, is this considered being tried for the same offense? I don't think so. It's a different law with different elements.\n\nBut, the attempt statute says that legal impossibility is no defense. So, even if the anti-noise statute was unconstitutional, the student still had the intent to violate it, which is what the attempt statute is targeting.\n\nWait a minute, but can you be guilty of attempting to violate a law that doesn't exist? That seems problematic.\n\nI recall that for an attempt to be successful, there needs to be both the intent and some act towards committing the crime. But here, the crime itself doesn't exist because the statute is unconstitutional.\n\nI think the key is that the anti-noise statute was ruled unconstitutional, meaning it's invalid and cannot be enforced. So, there's no valid law that the student could have attempted to violate.\n\nTherefore, it's legally impossible for him to have committed the attempted violation of the anti-noise statute because the statute itself is invalid.\n\nBut the attempt statute says that legal impossibility is no defense. So, even if the anti-noise statute is invalid, the student still had the intent to violate it, and that's enough for an attempt charge.\n\nHowever, I'm still a bit confused. If the law doesn't exist, can you really be guilty of attempting to violate it? It seems like charging someone for trying to do something that's not a crime.\n\nMaybe I need to look at it differently. Perhaps the attempt statute is being used to capture the student's intent to cause a public disturbance or something similar, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The attempt is specifically for violating the anti-noise statute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the district attorney is using the attempt statute as a way to circumvent the unconstitutionality of the anti-noise statute.\n\nI think the answer is A: yes, because he possessed the requisite intent.\n\nHere's why: the student had the intent to violate the anti-noise statute by playing his music loudly. The attempt statute criminalizes the intent to violate the statute, regardless of whether the statute is actually violated or not. Since the statute was unconstitutional, it's legally impossible to violate it, but the attempt statute specifically states that legal impossibility is no defense.\n\nTherefore, the student can still be found guilty of attempting to violate the anti-noise statute based on his intent.\n\nOption B suggests that double jeopardy doesn't apply because the initial charge was dismissed, not based on a finding of fact. But as I thought earlier, the new charge is for attempt, which is a different offense, so double jeopardy wouldn't apply anyway.\n\nOption C says no, because double jeopardy precludes prosecution for attempt after the initial prosecution was dismissed. But again, since it's a different offense, double jeopardy shouldn't apply.\n\nOption D says no, because a defendant cannot be retried for attempted commission of a crime that has been ruled unconstitutional. But I think that's not accurate because the attempt is based on intent, and the statute specifically says that legal impossibility is no defense.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is A: yes, because he possessed the requisite intent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
