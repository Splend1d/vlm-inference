                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the filing status for a surviving spouse in a specific scenario. Here's what happened: A spouse died on December 31 of year 1, and the couple had no dependents. Now, I need to determine what the filing status should be for the surviving spouse in year 2. The options are:\n\nA. Single.\n\nB. Married filing jointly.\n\nC. Qualifying widow(er).\n\nD. Head of household.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules about filing statuses, especially for someone who has lost their spouse.\n\nI know that when someone's spouse dies, there are special considerations for tax purposes. For instance, in the year of the spouse's death, the surviving spouse can still file as married filing jointly, but only for that tax year.\n\nSo, in year 1, since the spouse died on December 31, the surviving spouse could choose to file as married filing jointly for that year. But that's year 1; we're being asked about year 2.\n\nNow, in year 2, the surviving spouse is, obviously, no longer married because their spouse has passed away. So, they are now a widow or widower, depending on the situation.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Single.\n\nWell, they are single in a marital status sense, but I think there might be a specific filing status for widows and widowers.\n\nB. Married filing jointly.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right because their spouse is deceased. They can't file jointly after the spouse has died, except possibly in very specific circumstances, which I don't think apply here.\n\nC. Qualifying widow(er).\n\nThis sounds promising. I remember there's a filing status called qualifying widow(er) that allows a surviving spouse to continue filing as if they were married for a certain period after their spouse's death, provided they meet certain conditions.\n\nD. Head of household.\n\nThis is typically for unmarried people who pay more than half the cost of keeping up a home for themselves and their qualifying person, like a dependent child or another relative. But in this case, the couple had no dependents, so this might not apply.\n\nSo, between options A and C, C seems more appropriate.\n\nLet me look up the rules for qualifying widow(er) to make sure.\n\nOkay, from what I recall, the qualifying widow(er) status allows a surviving spouse to file as if they were still married for two years following the year of their spouse's death, provided they have a dependent child and meet other requirements.\n\nWait a minute, that might not apply here because the couple had no dependents. So, if they don't have any dependent children, they might not qualify for the qualifying widow(er) status.\n\nIs that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, according to the IRS, to qualify for the qualifying widow(er) status, you must have a dependent child for whom you can claim an exemption. But in this scenario, the couple had no dependents, so that disqualifies them from using that filing status.\n\nTherefore, the surviving spouse cannot file as a qualifying widow(er) in year 2 because there are no dependent children.\n\nSo, what are the other options?\n\nThey are now single, so they could file as single. But is there any other status that might be more beneficial?\n\nHead of household requires maintaining a home for a qualifying dependent, which again, they don't have any. So, that's not applicable.\n\nMarried filing jointly is out of the question since the spouse is deceased.\n\nTherefore, the only applicable filing status for the surviving spouse in year 2 is single.\n\nWait a second, but I thought there was something about filing as married filing jointly in the year of death and then having different options afterward. But in this case, since there are no dependents, those options are limited.\n\nLet me see if there's any exception or special rule that might apply here.\n\nI don't think so. The qualifying widow(er) status is specifically for those who have dependent children, which this couple does not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Single.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other consideration that might allow for a different filing status.\n\nFor example, if the surviving spouse had another qualifying person for head of household, like an elderly parent or another relative who lived with them, but the problem states that the couple had no dependents, so that likely includes no other qualifying persons.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is A. Single.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
