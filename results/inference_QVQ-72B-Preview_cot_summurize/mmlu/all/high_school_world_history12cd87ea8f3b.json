Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny\u2026We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\"\nSim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819\nThe author of this text expresses a belief in which of the following as requirements for a properly functioning legal system?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this passage by Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar from his Message to the Congress of Angostura in 1819. It's pretty dense, but I'll break it down step by step to figure out what he's saying and what he believes are necessary for a legal system to function properly.\n\nFirst, he talks about how people in his region are not Europeans or Indians but a mix of natives and Spaniards. They're Americans by birth but Europeans by law, which seems to indicate a colonial situation where the laws imposed on them are from another culture. He mentions they're fighting two battles: one with the natives over land titles and another to maintain their place in the country against invaders. This sets a complex political and social backdrop.\n\nHe then says their position is \"most extraordinary and complicated.\" Their political role has been passive, and their existence politically is nothing. This lack of agency and political voice seems to have made their quest for liberty harder. They've been oppressed not just by force but by being denied the right to have any say in their own governance.\n\nBol\u00edvar mentions that they've been ruled more by deceit than by force and degraded more by vice than by superstition. This suggests that the oppression isn't just physical but also mental and moral. Slavery, according to him, is the daughter of darkness, and an ignorant people can destroy themselves. So, education and enlightenment are important here.\n\nHe criticizes that ambition and intrigue take advantage of people's lack of political, economic, and civic knowledge. People mistake illusion for reality, license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. This shows a deep-seated problem in how people perceive and act on their political rights and freedoms.\n\nBol\u00edvar then says that even if such a people achieve liberty, they might lose it because their training has perverted them. He believes that happiness comes from practicing virtue, that laws are more powerful than tyrants because they are inflexible and everyone must submit to them, and that proper morals are the foundation of law. Finally, practicing justice is practicing liberty.\n\nFrom this, I need to choose which of the options\u2014truth and religion, freedom and democracy, intelligence and order, or morality and justice\u2014he believes are requirements for a properly functioning legal system.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Truth and religion: While religion might have been an important aspect in his time, the passage doesn't specifically emphasize religion. It talks about superstition but more in the context of vice and ignorance.\n\nB. Freedom and democracy: He does mention liberty and the quest for liberty, but the passage seems to suggest that without certain foundations, liberty can be lost. He also talks about the need for laws and morals, which might not directly equate to democracy.\n\nC. Intelligence and order: He does mention the importance of knowledge and education to prevent people from being misled. Also, he mentions the rule of law, which implies order. However, the passage seems to delve deeper into moral and ethical foundations.\n\nD. Morality and justice: This seems to align closely with what he's saying. He emphasizes the importance of virtue, morals, and justice in maintaining liberty and a proper legal system.\n\nGiven that he specifically mentions that proper morals are the bases of law and that practicing justice is practicing liberty, it seems that morality and justice are central to his vision of a properly functioning legal system.\n\nBut let me double-check. He says, \"proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.\" So, morals are the foundation of law, and justice is essential for liberty.\n\nHe also talks about the need for political, economic, and civic knowledge, which might relate to intelligence and order, but again, the emphasis seems to be on moral and ethical understanding.\n\nFreedom and democracy are certainly themes, but he seems to suggest that without the right moral and ethical foundations, freedom can be lost and democracy might not function properly.\n\nTruth and religion don't seem to be the main focus here, although truth could be related to his call for enlightenment and education.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. Morality and justice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
