                    "text": "So I need to figure out which option is the best buy for bars of soap. There are four different options, each offering a different number of bars at different prices. I need to find out which one gives me the lowest price per bar. That way, I'll know which option is the most cost-effective.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the price per bar for each option. To do that, I'll divide the total price by the number of bars in each option. Let's start with option A.\n\nOption A: 10 bars for $23.20\n\nPrice per bar in option A is $23.20 divided by 10 bars. Let's calculate that.\n\n$23.20 \u00f7 10 = $2.32 per bar\n\nSo, option A costs $2.32 per bar.\n\nNext, option B: 16 bars for $36.48\n\nPrice per bar in option B is $36.48 divided by 16 bars.\n\n$36.48 \u00f7 16 = $2.28 per bar\n\nOption B costs $2.28 per bar.\n\nHmm, that's cheaper than option A.\n\nNow, option C: 13 bars for $29.51\n\nPrice per bar in option C is $29.51 divided by 13 bars.\n\n$29.51 \u00f7 13 \u2248 $2.27 per bar\n\nOption C costs approximately $2.27 per bar.\n\nThat's even cheaper than option B.\n\nLastly, option D: 12 bars for $27.60\n\nPrice per bar in option D is $27.60 divided by 12 bars.\n\n$27.60 \u00f7 12 = $2.30 per bar\n\nOption D costs $2.30 per bar.\n\nNow, let's compare all the prices per bar:\n\n- Option A: $2.32\n\n- Option B: $2.28\n\n- Option C: $2.27\n\n- Option D: $2.30\n\nThe lowest price per bar is in option C, which is approximately $2.27 per bar.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe I should consider the total number of bars and the total price, but I think calculating the price per bar is the right way to go for determining the best buy.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that all options are for the same quality and size of soap bars. But since the question doesn't provide any information about differences in quality or size, I'll assume that all bars are equivalent in those aspects.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is the total savings. For example, if I buy more bars, maybe there's a bulk discount that makes the price per bar lower. But again, based on the calculations, option C has the lowest price per bar.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nOption A: 10 bars for $23.20\n\n$23.20 \u00f7 10 = $2.32 per bar. That seems correct.\n\nOption B: 16 bars for $36.48\n\n$36.48 \u00f7 16 = $2.28 per bar. Correct.\n\nOption C: 13 bars for $29.51\n\n$29.51 \u00f7 13. Let me calculate that again to be sure.\n\n13 times 2 is 26\n\nSubtract 26 from 29.51: remainder is 3.51\n\n13 times 0.2 is 2.60\n\nSubtract 2.60 from 3.51: remainder is 0.91\n\n13 times 0.07 is 0.91\n\nSo, total is 2.27 per bar. Correct.\n\nOption D: 12 bars for $27.60\n\n$27.60 \u00f7 12 = $2.30 per bar. Correct.\n\nSo, option C has the lowest price per bar.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any tax or other fees, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So, I think option C is indeed the best buy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different unit I should consider, like per ounce or something, but again, the problem assumes all bars are the same.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
