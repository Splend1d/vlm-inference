                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about Mill CPA being engaged by a group of royalty recipients to apply agreed-upon procedures to financial data provided by Modern Co. regarding their compliance with contractual requirements to pay royalties. Now, I need to figure out what Mill's report on these agreed-upon procedures should contain. The options are:\n\nA. A disclaimer of opinion about the fair presentation of Modern's financial statements.\n\nB. A list of the procedures performed (or reference thereto) and Mill's findings.\n\nC. An opinion about the effectiveness of Modern's internal control activities concerning royalty payments.\n\nD. An acknowledgment that the sufficiency of the procedures is solely Mill's responsibility.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what an agreed-upon procedures engagement entails. From what I recall, in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the CPA firm performs specific procedures that have been agreed upon by the client and any other parties involved. The goal is to gather and report factual findings based on those procedures, without providing an opinion or assurance on the overall financial statements or internal controls.\n\nSo, in this case, Mill CPA is not being asked to audit Modern Co.'s financial statements or to provide an opinion on the fairness of their presentation. Instead, they're specifically looking at the royalty payments and whether Modern Co. is complying with the contractual requirements to pay those royalties.\n\nGiven that, option A seems somewhat relevant because it mentions a disclaimer of opinion about the fair presentation of financial statements. But since the engagement is focused on specific procedures related to royalty payments, not the entire set of financial statements, I'm not sure if that's the most accurate choice.\n\nOption B suggests including a list of the procedures performed and Mill's findings. This seems very pertinent because in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the CPA is supposed to detail exactly what procedures were carried out and what the results of those procedures were. This would help the users of the report understand what was checked and what was found.\n\nOption C proposes including an opinion about the effectiveness of Modern's internal control activities concerning royalty payments. Hmm, but in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the CPA doesn't typically express an opinion on internal control effectiveness. That's more in line with an audit or a review engagement. So, I think this might not be appropriate for this type of engagement.\n\nOption D mentions acknowledging that the sufficiency of the procedures is solely Mill's responsibility. While it's true that the CPA firm is responsible for performing the procedures adequately, in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the procedures themselves are agreed upon by the parties involved. So, it's not just the CPA deciding what's sufficient; it's a mutual agreement. Therefore, this seems a bit off.\n\nLet me think about this again. The engagement is for agreed-upon procedures, which means that specific procedures are performed as agreed upon by the parties involved, and the CPA reports on the findings from those procedures. So, the report should clearly state the procedures that were performed and the results obtained.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B seems to align best with this description. It says the report should contain a list of the procedures performed (or a reference to them) and Mill's findings. That sounds exactly like what's needed in an agreed-upon procedures engagement.\n\nOption A is more related to a disclaimer of opinion, which might be seen in a compilation engagement or in some review reports, but not specifically in an agreed-upon procedures engagement. Moreover, it refers to the fair presentation of financial statements, which is broader than the specific focus on royalty payments.\n\nOption C is suggesting an opinion on internal control effectiveness, which isn't typically part of an agreed-upon procedures engagement. These engagements are more about reporting factual findings without providing an opinion on internal controls.\n\nOption D seems to place the entire responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures on the CPA firm, but in reality, the procedures are agreed upon by all parties involved, so it's a shared responsibility in terms of what procedures are deemed necessary to achieve the engagement's objectives.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, option B is the most appropriate choice. The report should contain a list of the procedures performed and Mill's findings, as that's the core purpose of an agreed-upon procedures engagement.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that in agreed-upon procedures engagements, the CPA's report should include:\n\n1. A title that indicates the nature of the engagement.\n\n2. A statement that specifies the procedures performed.\n\n3. A description of the procedures and the related findings.\n\n4. A statement that the engagement was performed in accordance with the relevant standards for agreed-upon procedures engagements.\n\nSo, option B aligns perfectly with points 2 and 3 above.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here, but perhaps I should consider if there's any other aspect that should be included in the report. For example, might there be a need to include a reference to the agreement that outlines the procedures? Well, option B mentions \"a list of the procedures performed (or reference thereto),\" which could imply that either the procedures are listed in the report or referenced from another document where they are detailed.\n\nIn practice, sometimes the procedures are detailed in a separate agreement signed by all parties, and the CPA's report refers to that agreement for the specifics of the procedures. So, option B covers both possibilities: listing the procedures directly in the report or referencing another document where they are listed.\n\nAdditionally, the report should state that the engagement was performed in accordance with the applicable standards for agreed-upon procedures engagements, such as Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) or International Standard on Related Services (ISRS).\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them mention this standard compliance statement directly. However, option B is still the closest to what is typically included in such a report.\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice here. The correct answer should be option B: a list of the procedures performed (or reference thereto) and Mill's findings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
