                    "text": " So I'm reading this article by Lukianoff and Haidt, and they're discussing trigger warnings in academia. I have to admit, I'm not entirely sure what trigger warnings are all about. From what I can gather, they're like alerts that professors give to students before assigning reading material or discussing topics that might be upsetting or traumatic for some people. Like, if a text deals with violence, sexual assault, or something else that could be triggering for someone who's experienced something similar.\n\nNow, Lukianoff and Haidt seem to have some concerns about this practice. They argue that it's part of a larger trend in universities where students are being treated more like children who need protection from uncomfortable ideas and experiences, rather than young adults who can handle and learn from a wide range of perspectives and content.\n\nOne of the points they make is that trigger warnings can contribute to a kind of pathological thinking. They use terms like \"fortune-telling,\" \"blaming,\" \"dichotomous thinking,\" and \"resentment\" as options, and I need to figure out which one they associate with trigger warnings.\n\nLet me think about this. First off, what is pathological thinking? Pathological thinking refers to irrational or dysfunctional thought patterns that can lead to emotional distress or unhealthy behaviors. So, they're suggesting that trigger warnings might promote such thinking in students.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Fortune-telling: This sounds like predicting the future, but in a negative way, maybe assuming the worst will happen. Does triggering warnings encourage students to assume they'll be traumatized by certain content before even engaging with it? Maybe.\n\nB. Blaming: Assigning fault to others for one's problems or feelings. How does this relate to trigger warnings? Maybe if students are encouraged to blame authors or professors for their emotional reactions rather than learning to manage their own responses.\n\nC. Dichotomous thinking: This is seeing things in black and white, all-or-nothing terms. Perhaps trigger warnings reinforce a binary view of content\u2014either it's completely safe or completely dangerous, without considering nuances or individual differences in what might be triggering.\n\nD. Resentment: Feeling bitter or angry about perceived wrongs. Maybe trigger warnings foster a sense of victimhood or encourage students to hold grudges against certain ideas or people who present challenging material.\n\nHmm, all of these could be potentially related in some way, but I need to pick the one that best fits Lukianoff and Haidt's argument.\n\nLooking back at the article, they discuss the concept of \"safetyism,\" which is this idea that universities are becoming overly focused on protecting students from any kind of discomfort, including intellectual discomfort. They argue that this can be harmful because it doesn't prepare students for the real world, where they'll encounter all sorts of challenging and upsetting ideas.\n\nIn this context, trigger warnings might be seen as part of this safetyist culture, encouraging students to avoid anything that might make them feel uncomfortable or triggered, rather than learning how to cope with difficult emotions and engage with difficult material.\n\nSo, relating this back to pathological thinking, I think dichotomous thinking (option C) is the most directly associated with their argument. Trigger warnings might lead students to categorize content in an all-or-nothing way: either it's safe and can be engaged with openly, or it's dangerous and should be avoided. This kind of thinking doesn't allow for the gray areas or the complex realities that often exist in academic discourse.\n\nMoreover, dichotomous thinking can prevent students from developing the resilience and critical thinking skills needed to navigate complex and sometimes uncomfortable topics. It might also contribute to a culture where certain ideas are deemed off-limits, which could stifle open debate and learning.\n\nWhile the other options\u2014fortune-telling, blaming, and resentment\u2014might be indirectly related to the use of trigger warnings, dichotomous thinking seems to be the primary type of pathological thinking that Lukianoff and Haidt are highlighting in their critique.\n\nSo, my answer is C. dichotomous thinking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
