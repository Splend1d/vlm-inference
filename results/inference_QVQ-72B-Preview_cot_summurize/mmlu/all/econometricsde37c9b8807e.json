The explanatory variable is partly random\n\nB. The explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples\n\nC. The explanatory variable is correlated with the errors\n\nD. The explanatory variable always has a value of one\n\nAnd I need to pick the one that's equivalent to saying the explanatory variable is \"non-stochastic.\"\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"non-stochastic\" means. Stochastic means random, so non-stochastic should mean not random, or deterministic, or fixed. So, looking at the options, option A says partly random, which would still involve some randomness, so that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says the explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples. This sounds like it's not random; it's the same every time you take a sample. That seems consistent with non-stochastic.\n\nOption C says the explanatory variable is correlated with the errors. In regression analysis, having an explanatory variable correlated with the errors is a problem because it violates the assumption of no correlation between predictors and errors. But this doesn't directly relate to whether the variable is stochastic or not.\n\nOption D says the explanatory variable always has a value of one. Well, that's just a specific case where the variable is constant, but not all non-stochastic variables are constant at one. They can take different values, as long as those values are fixed and not random.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, I think option B is the best answer. The explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples, which aligns with being non-stochastic.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. In econometrics and statistics, when we assume that the explanatory variables are non-stochastic, we're assuming they are fixed and not random variables. This is important because it simplifies the analysis by treating the predictors as constants.\n\nIf the explanatory variables were stochastic, meaning they have some randomness, it could complicate the estimation of the model parameters. However, in many introductory regression models, we assume they are non-stochastic to derive the properties of the estimators more easily.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA. Partly random \u2013 this suggests some randomness, which contradicts being non-stochastic.\n\nB. Fixed in repeated samples \u2013 this matches the definition of non-stochastic.\n\nC. Correlated with the errors \u2013 this is a separate issue related to the assumptions of the regression model and doesn't directly relate to whether the variable is stochastic or not.\n\nD. Always has a value of one \u2013 this is too specific. While a constant variable is non-stochastic, not all non-stochastic variables are constants equal to one.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. The explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
