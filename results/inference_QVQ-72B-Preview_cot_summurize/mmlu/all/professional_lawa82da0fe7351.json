                    "text": "So I have this question about federal subpoenas and what they can require someone to do. The options are:\n\nA. Submit to a physical or mental examination.\n\nB. Attend and testify as to persons and/or events related to a cause of action.\n\nC. Produce designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person's possession, custody, or control.\n\nD. Permit the inspection of premises.\n\nAnd the question is, which one of these is not within the power of a federal subpoena to command a person to do at a specified time and place?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a federal subpoena is and what it can do. A subpoena is a legal document that orders someone to do something, like appear in court or provide certain documents. There are different types of subpoenas, but in this case, it's a federal subpoena, so it's issued by a federal court.\n\nNow, options B and C seem pretty standard for subpoenas. Option B is about attending and testifying about people or events related to a cause of action. That sounds like a subpoena duces tecum, which is a subpoena that commands a person to produce documents or other tangible items. Wait, no, a subpoena duces tecum is for producing documents, but option B mentions testifying, which is more like a subpoena ad testificandum, which orders someone to appear and testify.\n\nOption C is about producing documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in their possession, custody, or control. That sounds a lot like a subpoena duces tecum.\n\nOption D is about permitting the inspection of premises. Hmm, that sounds like it might be related to a search warrant or something similar, but search warrants are typically handled differently than subpoenas. Subpoenas are more about compelling someone to come to court or to produce documents, whereas search warrants allow law enforcement to search a place for evidence.\n\nOption A is about submitting to a physical or mental examination. That seems more related to discovery in a lawsuit, maybe in a personal injury case or something where the person's physical or mental condition is at issue.\n\nSo, I need to figure out which of these is not something that a federal subpoena can command a person to do.\n\nLet me look up what a federal subpoena can do. According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, which governs subpoenas in federal civil actions, a subpoena can require a person to:\n\n1. Testify at a deposition or trial.\n\n2. Produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things for inspection.\n\n3. Permit inspection of premises.\n\nWait, option D is about permitting the inspection of premises, and according to FRCP 45, a subpoena can require that.\n\nSo, that leaves option A, submitting to a physical or mental examination.\n\nDoes a federal subpoena have the power to command someone to submit to a physical or mental examination?\n\nI recall that in personal injury cases, there might be orders for physical examinations, but I think those are usually ordered by the court, not through a subpoena.\n\nLet me check the rules again. FRCP 35 allows for a mental examination of a party, but it's upon motion of any party and with the court's permission. It doesn't mention subpoenas for such examinations.\n\nSimilarly, FRCP 26 allows for discovery regarding physical and mental conditions, but again, it's between the parties, not through a subpoena to a third party.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is not within the power of a federal subpoena.\n\nBut wait, maybe in some contexts, a subpoena could be used to compel someone to undergo an examination. For example, if a witness's mental state is relevant to their testimony, maybe they could be subpoenaed to undergo an examination.\n\nHowever, I think that's unlikely. Generally, subpoenas are used to compel testimony or the production of documents, not to compel someone to undergo an examination.\n\nMoreover, compelling someone to undergo a physical or mental examination raises significant privacy concerns and would probably require a court order beyond just a subpoena.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option A is not within the power of a federal subpoena to command.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Submit to a physical or mental examination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
