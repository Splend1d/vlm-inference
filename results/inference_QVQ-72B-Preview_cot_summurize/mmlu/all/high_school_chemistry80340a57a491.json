                    "text": "Let's see what happens when liquid NH3, which is ammonia, boils. I need to figure out which statement is correct among the options provided.\n\nFirst, I should recall what boiling is. Boiling is a phase change from liquid to gas, right? So, when ammonia is heated to its boiling point, it turns into ammonia gas. During this process, certain bonds or interactions between the molecules are being overcome.\n\nOption A says that the N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules break apart. Hmm, I think that in boiling, the bonds within the molecules themselves generally don't break. Boiling is more about overcoming the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together, not the intramolecular bonds like the N-H bonds. So, probably, this isn't what happens during boiling.\n\nOption B says that the overall temperature of the solution rises as the NH3 molecules speed up. But I remember that during boiling, the temperature remains constant as long as the phase change is occurring. The heat is used to overcome the intermolecular forces rather than increasing the temperature. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C states that the amount of energy within the system remains constant. Well, during boiling, you're adding heat to the system to cause the liquid to turn into gas. So, energy is being added, meaning the total energy of the system increases. Therefore, this can't be right.\n\nOption D suggests that the hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart. Ammonia molecules are known to form hydrogen bonds with each other because of the hydrogen bonded to nitrogen. These hydrogen bonds are intermolecular forces that hold the liquid together. When ammonia boils, I think these hydrogen bonds are being overcome, allowing the molecules to escape into the gas phase.\n\nPutting all this together, it seems like option D is the correct choice. Boiling involves breaking the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between NH3 molecules, not the N-H bonds within the molecules themselves, and during this process, energy is absorbed to overcome these intermolecular forces, while the temperature remains constant during the phase change.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
