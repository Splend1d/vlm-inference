                    "text": "So I have this question about autozygosity mapping. It's asking what pattern of inheritance disorders mapped using this technique show. The options are autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, or X-linked recessive. Hmm, I need to recall what autozygosity mapping is and how it relates to these different inheritance patterns.\n\nFirst off, I know that autozygosity mapping is a genetic mapping method used to identify the location of genes associated with particular traits or disorders. It's especially useful for finding genes that cause rare genetic diseases. But what's the key feature that makes it suited for certain inheritance patterns?\n\nLet me think about autozygosity. Autozygous refers to a genotype where both alleles at a particular locus are identical by descent. That means both alleles come from a common ancestor. This is often seen in consanguineous families, where parents are related to each other.\n\nGiven that, autozygosity mapping is likely to be more effective for mapping disorders that are caused by homozygous recessive alleles. Let me verify that.\n\nIn autosomal dominant disorders, only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disease. So, you don't necessarily have two identical alleles at that locus. In contrast, autosomal recessive disorders require two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to manifest the disease. So, in autosomal recessive inheritance, the affected individual is homozygous for the disease-causing allele.\n\nGiven that, autozygosity mapping should be more applicable to autosomal recessive disorders because it focuses on regions where both alleles are identical by descent.\n\nBut let's consider X-linked disorders as well. X-linked dominant disorders are quite rare, and they can affect males and females, but males are often more severely affected. Females can be carriers or show milder symptoms. In X-linked recessive disorders, males are typically affected because they have only one X chromosome, so a single recessive allele causes the disease. Females can be carriers if they have one copy of the mutated gene.\n\nIn the context of autozygosity mapping, since it involves identifying regions where both alleles are identical by descent, it might not be as directly applicable to X-linked disorders, especially in males, because males have only one X chromosome and don't have a second allele to compare.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether autozygosity mapping can still be used in some way for X-linked disorders, perhaps in females who are homozygous for the X chromosome in certain regions due to consanguinity.\n\nLet me do a quick search to confirm my understanding.\n\nUpon checking, autozygosity mapping is indeed primarily used for autosomal recessive disorders. It's based on the principle that in consanguineous families, regions of the genome where both parents share a common ancestor are more likely to be identical by descent. If a recessive disorder is present, it's likely to be located in these regions of autozygosity.\n\nFor X-linked recessive disorders, while autozygosity mapping might still identify regions on the X chromosome that are homozygous in females, it's not as straightforward as in autosomal recessive disorders. Males, being hemizygous for the X chromosome, don't have a second allele to compare, so autozygosity mapping wouldn't be applicable in the same way for X-linked recessive disorders in males.\n\nSimilarly, for autosomal dominant disorders, since only one mutated allele is sufficient to cause the disease, there's no need to look for regions where both alleles are identical by descent.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be autosomal recessive.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"disorders that show which pattern of inheritance?\" and the options include X-linked dominant and recessive. Given that autozygosity mapping is primarily used for autosomal recessive disorders, it shouldn't be used for X-linked disorders, as they have a different inheritance pattern.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether autozygosity mapping can be adapted for X-linked disorders in some cases, like in females who are homozygous for certain regions on the X chromosome.\n\nUpon further research, I find that autozygosity mapping can indeed be applied to X-linked recessive disorders in females, as they can be homozygous for the disease-causing allele. However, it's not typically used for X-linked dominant disorders, as dominance implies that even heterozygous individuals are affected.\n\nGiven that, the best answer is still autosomal recessive, as autozygosity mapping is specifically designed to map recessive disorders by identifying regions of homozygosity in affected individuals.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Autosomal recessive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
