                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about how different fields behave at large distances from the objects that produce them. The question is asking which of these quantities decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields. The options are:\n\nA. the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod\n\nB. the electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder\n\nC. the electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge\n\nD. the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall how each of these fields behaves at large distances.\n\nStarting with option A: the electric field from a finite-length charged rod. I know that for a finite rod with uniform charge density, the electric field at a point along the axis of the rod depends on the distance from the point to the rod. At large distances, I think the field should decrease as 1 over distance squared, similar to Coulomb's law for point charges. But wait, a finite rod isn't a point charge, so maybe it's different.\n\nOption B: electric field from an infinitely long charged cylinder. I recall that for an infinite cylinder, the electric field depends only on the radial distance from the cylinder's axis. Using Gauss's law, the electric field is sigma over 2 epsilon-naught times the natural log of r over r_o, or something like that. Wait, no, actually, for an infinitely long charged cylinder, the electric field is sigma over 2 epsilon-naught times the reciprocal of r, where r is the distance from the axis. So, that's a 1 over r dependence, not 1 over r squared.\n\nOption C: electric field from an infinite plane of charge. Again, using Gauss's law, the electric field from an infinite plane is sigma over 2 epsilon-naught, and it's constant, meaning it doesn't depend on the distance from the plane. So, it doesn't decrease with distance at all.\n\nOption D: magnetic field from an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire. I remember that the magnetic field due to a long straight wire is given by B = mu-naught I over 2 pi r, where r is the distance from the wire. So, that's a 1 over r dependence, similar to option B for the electric field of an infinite cylinder.\n\nAlright, so from this recall, it seems like option A might be the one that decreases as 1 over r squared. But I need to double-check that.\n\nLet me look up the expression for the electric field due to a finite charged rod. I found that the electric field at a point along the axis of a uniformly charged rod of length L with total charge Q at a distance d from the center is given by:\n\nE = (k Q / d^2) / (1 + (d / (L/2)))^2\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Actually, I think the correct expression is:\n\nE = (2 k Q d) / (d^2 + (L/2)^2)^{3/2}\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe I should consider the far-field approximation, where d is much larger than L. In that case, the rod can be approximated as a point charge, and the electric field should follow Coulomb's law: E ~ 1 / d^2.\n\nSimilarly, for option D, the magnetic field from a long straight wire is B ~ 1 / r, as I recalled earlier.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to follow the inverse square law at large distances, while the others do not.\n\nBut wait, let's think about option C again. It's an infinite plane of charge. The electric field is constant with distance, which means it doesn't decrease as 1 / r^2 or even 1 / r; it's just constant. So, definitely not inverse square.\n\nOption B is an infinite cylinder, which has a 1 / r dependence, not 1 / r^2.\n\nOption D is a long straight wire with a magnetic field that decreases as 1 / r.\n\nSo, the only one that decreases as 1 / r^2 is option A, the electric field from a finite charged rod, provided that we are at large distances compared to the rod's length.\n\nBut I should confirm if treating the finite rod as a point charge at large distances is valid. In classical electromagnetism, only spherically symmetric charge distributions behave like point charges at large distances. A finite rod, even if it's finite, still has some extent, so its field won't exactly follow 1 / r^2 at all distances. However, in the limit where the distance is much larger than the rod's length, the rod can be approximated as a point charge, and the field should indeed follow 1 / r^2.\n\nLet me check this with a Taylor expansion or something. Suppose the rod has length L and total charge Q. At a distance d >> L, the electric field should approach that of a point charge Q at distance d, so E ~ Q / d^2.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"for distances far from the objects producing the fields.\" So, in the case of the finite rod, at distances much larger than the rod's length, its electric field should indeed follow the inverse square law.\n\nIn contrast, the infinite cylinder and the infinite plane have fields that don't follow this law, and the magnetic field from the infinite wire also doesn't follow it.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A: the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
