                    "text": "So I have this question here about iron atoms. It says that the nucleus of an electrically neutral iron atom contains 26 protons, and it's asking how many electrons this iron atom has. The options are 52, 26, 24, or none.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic atomic structure. I know that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged, and neutrons are neutral. In a neutral atom, the total positive charge from the protons is balanced by the total negative charge from the electrons.\n\nSo, if the nucleus has 26 protons, each proton has a charge of +1, so the total positive charge is +26. Since the atom is electrically neutral, the negative charge from the electrons should balance this out. That means the number of electrons should be equal to the number of protons, which is 26, to make the net charge zero.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. In chemistry class, we learned that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus, and also equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom. For iron, I believe its atomic number is 26, which matches the number of protons given here.\n\nSo, according to this, the number of electrons should be 26. But let's see if there's any trick here. Maybe it's trying to test my understanding of isotopes or something like that. Isotopes have different numbers of neutrons but the same number of protons and electrons in their neutral form.\n\nNo, the question isn't about isotopes; it's about the number of electrons in a neutral iron atom. So, I think the answer is straightforward: 26 electrons.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the options:\n\nA. 52\n\nB. 26\n\nC. 24\n\nD. None.\n\nIf I choose 52, that would be double the number of protons, which doesn't make sense for a neutral atom. That might be relevant if we're talking about ions or something else, but not here.\n\nOption C is 24. Why would it be 24? Well, maybe someone might think that iron has 24 electrons, but that's not correct. Iron's atomic number is 26, so it should have 26 electrons in its neutral state.\n\nOption D is \"none,\" which doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 26.\n\nWait, but just to be extra sure, maybe I should think about the electronic configuration of iron. Iron is a transition metal, and its electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2. That adds up to 26 electrons: 2 in the K shell, 8 in the L shell, 14 in the M shell, and 2 in the N shell. So, yes, 26 electrons in total.\n\nAlternatively, if the atom were ionized, like losing or gaining electrons, the number would change, but the problem specifies a neutral atom.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The number of electrons in a neutral iron atom is 26.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
