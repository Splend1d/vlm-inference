                    "text": "So I have this problem about radioactive decay. It says that a certain radioactive material has a half-life of 36 minutes. Starting with 10.00 grams, I need to find out how many grams will be left after 2 hours. The options are A. 1.00 grams, B. 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 grams, C. 3.33 grams, and D. 0.25 gram.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what half-life means. Half-life is the time it takes for half of the material to decay. So, every 36 minutes, the amount of the material is halved.\n\nNow, the starting amount is 10.00 grams, and I need to find out how much is left after 2 hours. I should convert the time to minutes to match the half-life time unit. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is 120 minutes.\n\nSo, time t = 120 minutes.\n\nHalf-life (T\u00bd) = 36 minutes.\n\nI recall that the formula for radioactive decay is:\n\nN(t) = N\u2080 * (1/2)^(t/T\u00bd)\n\nWhere:\n\n- N(t) is the amount of material at time t.\n\n- N\u2080 is the initial amount.\n\n- t is the elapsed time.\n\n- T\u00bd is the half-life.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nN(t) = 10.00 * (1/2)^(120/36)\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n\n120 / 36 = 3.333...\n\nSo, N(t) = 10.00 * (1/2)^3.333...\n\nBut (1/2)^3.333... is the same as (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^0.333...\n\nWhich is (1/8) * (1/2)^1/3\n\nWait, maybe that's not the best way to calculate it. Let's think differently.\n\nI know that (1/2)^3 = 1/8, and then (1/2)^0.333... is approximately 0.5.\n\nBut actually, 0.333... is 1/3, so (1/2)^(1/3) is the cube root of 1/2, which is about 0.7937.\n\nSo, N(t) \u2248 10.00 * (1/8) * 0.7937\n\nFirst, 10.00 * (1/8) = 1.25 grams.\n\nThen, 1.25 * 0.7937 \u2248 0.992 grams.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 1.00 grams, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way to calculate this without breaking down the exponent.\n\nLet me use a calculator for this.\n\nFirst, calculate 120 divided by 36, which is exactly 10/3 or approximately 3.333...\n\nThen, (1/2)^(10/3) = (1/2^(10/3)) = (2^(-10/3)).\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate 2^(-10/3).\n\n2^(10/3) is 2^(3.333...) = 8 * 2^(0.333...) \u2248 8 * (1.1487) \u2248 9.19\n\nSo, 2^(-10/3) = 1 / 2^(10/3) \u2248 1 / 9.19 \u2248 0.109\n\nThen, N(t) = 10.00 * 0.109 \u2248 1.09 grams, which rounds to 1.00 grams.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nN(t) = N\u2080 * e^(-\u03bbt)\n\nWhere \u03bb is the decay constant.\n\nI know that \u03bb = ln(2) / T\u00bd\n\nSo, \u03bb = ln(2) / 36 \u2248 0.6931 / 36 \u2248 0.01925 per minute.\n\nThen, N(t) = 10.00 * e^(-0.01925 * 120)\n\nCalculate e^(-0.01925 * 120) = e^(-2.31)\n\ne^(-2.31) \u2248 0.100\n\nSo, N(t) \u2248 10.00 * 0.100 = 1.00 grams.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the answer is approximately 1.00 grams.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is 1.00 grams, option B is 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 grams, which is 0.00015 grams, option C is 3.33 grams, and option D is 0.25 grams.\n\nGiven that both methods give me approximately 1.00 grams, I would choose option A.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any possibility of a miscalculation.\n\nLet me try calculating (1/2)^(10/3) more accurately.\n\n(1/2)^(10/3) = 2^(-10/3) = 2^(-3) * 2^(-1/3) = 1/8 * 2^(-1/3)\n\n2^(-1/3) is the cube root of 1/2, which is approximately 0.7937.\n\nSo, 1/8 * 0.7937 = 0.125 * 0.7937 \u2248 0.0992, which is approximately 0.100.\n\nThen, N(t) = 10.00 * 0.0992 \u2248 0.992 grams, which rounds to 1.00 grams.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 1.00 grams.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1.00\\ \\text{grams}} \\]"
