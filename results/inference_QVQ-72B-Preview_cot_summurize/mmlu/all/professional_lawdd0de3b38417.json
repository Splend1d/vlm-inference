                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a woman who needs her microwave repaired. She hires a handyman for $100, and he promises to fix it in two weeks. A week later, the handyman realizes he's too busy and takes the microwave to a repair store for $80, promising one week for the repair. Now, the question is about who the woman can take legal action against if the repair store fails to repair the microwave.\n\nFirst, let's understand the relationships here. The woman has a contract with the handyman. He agreed to repair her microwave for $100 within two weeks. Then, the handyman subcontracts the work to a repair store for $80 within one week. The repair store doesn't know that the woman owns the microwave; they're dealing with the handyman.\n\nSo, there are three parties involved:\n\n1. The woman (the owner of the microwave).\n\n2. The handyman (hired by the woman to repair the microwave).\n\n3. The repair store (hired by the handyman to repair the microwave).\n\nNow, if the repair store fails to repair the microwave, who can the woman sue?\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.\n\nB. The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\n\nC. The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.\n\nD. The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.\n\nFirst, let's think about the direct contracts here.\n\nThe woman has a contract with the handyman. He is the one she hired, and he promised to repair the microwave. The handyman, in turn, hired the repair store to do the actual repair. However, the repair store doesn't know that the woman is the owner of the microwave; they're dealing directly with the handyman.\n\nSo, the repair store has a contract with the handyman, not with the woman. Therefore, if the repair store fails to repair the microwave, the handyman would be the one who has a cause of action against them, not the woman.\n\nBut the woman only has a contract with the handyman. So, if the microwave isn't repaired, the woman can go after the handyman because he breached their contract by not delivering the repaired microwave on time or at all.\n\nThe repair store, since they don't have a direct contract with the woman, she likely doesn't have a direct cause of action against them.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems plausible: the woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Is there any way the woman could have a cause of action against the repair store?\n\nWell, perhaps if the repair store was negligent in their repair work, and that negligence caused damage to the microwave, the woman might have a tort claim for negligence against the repair store, even without a direct contract.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the repair store fails to repair the microwave, but it doesn't specify any damage caused by negligence. It's just that they failed to repair it.\n\nIn that case, since there's no direct contract between the woman and the repair store, and no apparent tortious act beyond failing to repair, which is a contractual failure between the handyman and the repair store, the woman probably doesn't have a direct cause of action against the repair store.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
