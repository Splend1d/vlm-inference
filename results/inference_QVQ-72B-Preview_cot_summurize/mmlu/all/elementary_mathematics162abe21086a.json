                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. Ms. Fisher has this expression (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12 to find the total number of markers needed for her students' art project. And I need to find which other expression is equal to this one. The options are:\n\nA. 6 + (8 + 12)\n\nB. 6 + (8 \u00d7 12)\n\nC. 6 \u00d7 (8 + 12)\n\nD. 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12)\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each of these expressions and see which one equals (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12.\n\nFirst, let's compute (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12.\n\n6 \u00d7 8 is 48, and then 48 \u00d7 12 is... let's see, 48 times 10 is 480, and 48 times 2 is 96, so 480 + 96 = 576. So, (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12 equals 576.\n\nNow, I need to check each option to see which one also equals 576.\n\nOption A: 6 + (8 + 12)\n\nFirst, 8 + 12 is 20, then 6 + 20 is 26. That's not 576.\n\nOption B: 6 + (8 \u00d7 12)\n\n8 \u00d7 12 is 96, then 6 + 96 is 102. Not equal to 576.\n\nOption C: 6 \u00d7 (8 + 12)\n\nFirst, 8 + 12 is 20, then 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. Still not 576.\n\nOption D: 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12)\n\nFirst, 8 \u00d7 12 is 96, then 6 \u00d7 96 is 576.\n\nWait a minute, that matches the original expression's value of 576.\n\nSo, it seems like option D is equal to the original expression.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check all the options.\n\nOriginal expression: (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12 = 576.\n\nOption A: 6 + (8 + 12) = 6 + 20 = 26 \u2260 576.\n\nOption B: 6 + (8 \u00d7 12) = 6 + 96 = 102 \u2260 576.\n\nOption C: 6 \u00d7 (8 + 12) = 6 \u00d7 20 = 120 \u2260 576.\n\nOption D: 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12) = 6 \u00d7 96 = 576, which matches the original expression.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\nWait, but is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using algebraic properties or something, instead of just computing the values.\n\nLet's think about it in terms of associative and distributive properties.\n\nThe original expression is (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12.\n\nThis is using the associative property of multiplication, which states that (a \u00d7 b) \u00d7 c = a \u00d7 (b \u00d7 c).\n\nSo, (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12 should be equal to 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12).\n\nWhich is exactly option D.\n\nOption C is 6 \u00d7 (8 + 12), which is using the distributive property, but that would equal 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, which is not equal to the original.\n\nOption B is 6 + (8 \u00d7 12), which is adding 6 to the product of 8 and 12, resulting in 6 + 96 = 102, not equal.\n\nOption A is 6 + (8 + 12), which is just adding 6, 8, and 12 together to get 26.\n\nSo, really, the only one that matches is option D, which is exactly the associative property in action.\n\nMaybe I should also consider if there are any other properties being tested here, but based on the options, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that all these operations are just multiplication and addition without considering the order of operations.\n\nBut no, the problem clearly indicates parentheses, so the order is well-defined.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion remains that option D is equal to the original expression used by Ms. Fisher.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
