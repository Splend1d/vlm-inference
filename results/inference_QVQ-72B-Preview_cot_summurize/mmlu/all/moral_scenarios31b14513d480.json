                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 are wrong.\n\nB. Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nC. Scenario 1 is not wrong, Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nD. Neither Scenario 1 nor Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nScenario 1: \"As an attorney, I don't care if my clients are wealthy or not.\"\n\nSo, the person is saying they don't differentiate between clients based on their wealth. They seem to treat all clients equally, regardless of their financial status.\n\nScenario 2: \"I made sure to take some hotel robes and towels as a souvenir.\"\n\nHere, the person is admitting to taking hotel robes and towels with them when they left the hotel, probably without paying for them.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1:\n\nAs an attorney, not caring whether clients are wealthy or not seems like a neutral or even positive thing. It suggests that the attorney treats all clients equally, without favoritism towards wealthy clients or perhaps without turning away less wealthy clients. In many professions, including law, there's an ethical duty to provide equal representation and service to all clients, regardless of their background. So, in this case, the attorney is prioritizing equality in their practice.\n\nBut, is there any moral wrong here? Well, if the attorney is indifferent to the client's wealth because they plan to treat them all the same, that seems fair. However, if indifference means they're not considering the client's ability to pay for services, that might be an issue. But, assuming they're charging fair fees and not overcharging anyone, it seems okay.\n\nWait, but attorneys have to follow certain ethical rules regarding fees. They can't charge unreasonable fees, and they have to provide services regardless of a client's ability to pay, within certain limits. So, if the attorney is indifferent to wealth but still charges reasonable fees and provides quality representation, that seems morally acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, if the indifference extends to not caring about the client's best interests or not providing the same level of service based on wealth, that could be a problem. But the statement only mentions not caring about wealth, not about the quality of service provided.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems like Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2:\n\nTaking hotel robes and towels as a souvenir. This is a common practice, but is it morally wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether taking these items is stealing or not.\n\nHotels typically provide robes and towels for guests to use during their stay, but they're not meant to be taken home unless purchased. In many hotels, there are signs indicating that robes and towels are for in-room use only or that there's a fee for taking them.\n\nIf the person took the robes and towels without paying for them and against hotel policy, then it could be considered stealing, which is morally wrong.\n\nHowever, in some hotels, especially upscale ones, robes might be complimentary or included in the room rate. In those cases, taking them might not be stealing.\n\nBut, assuming there was no indication that the robes and towels were complimentary, and no payment was made for them, taking them would be wrong.\n\nAdditionally, some people might argue that taking small items like pens or notepads from hotels is acceptable, but robes and towels are more substantial and likely have a higher cost to the hotel.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if something isn't explicitly offered for free, taking it without permission is generally considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 2, the action seems morally wrong.\n\nSo, combining these evaluations:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThe correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, treating all clients equally regardless of wealth seems ethical and in line with professional standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking hotel property without permission is akin to stealing, which is against moral standards.\n\nHence, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
