                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Rune Co. has a checkbook balance on December 31 of $10,000. But there are some other items that affect the actual cash position, and I need to figure out what amount they should report as cash in their December 31 balance sheet.\n\nFirst, there's a $4,000 check that's postdated January 3. That means it's not valid until January 3, so it shouldn't be included in the December 31 cash balance. The problem says it's not included in the December 31 checkbook balance, which makes sense. So, I don't think I should add this to the checkbook balance yet.\n\nNext, there's a $1,000 check payable to Rune that was deposited on December 15 and was included in the December 31 checkbook balance. But it was returned by the bank on December 30 with \"NSF\" stamped on it, which stands for \"non-sufficient funds,\" meaning the person who wrote the check didn't have enough money in their account to cover it. Rune redeposited the check on January 2, and it cleared on January 9.\n\nSince this check was included in the December 31 checkbook balance but was returned NSF, that means Rune didn't actually receive the funds in December. So, I think I need to subtract this $1,000 from the checkbook balance because it wasn't a valid deposit.\n\nLet me see: starting with $10,000, subtracting $1,000 for the NSF check gives me $9,000. But wait, there's more to consider.\n\nThe problem also mentions that Rune held these items in their safe. So, the $4,000 postdated check is being held, and the $1,000 NSF check was also held after it was returned by the bank.\n\nBut for the purpose of reporting cash on December 31, I need to consider what actual cash Rune has on hand or in the bank on that date.\n\nThe $4,000 check isn't yet a part of the cash balance because it's postdated and not yet deposited. The $1,000 check was deposited but was returned, so it shouldn't be counted as cash on December 31.\n\nSo, taking the checkbook balance of $10,000 and subtracting the $1,000 NSF check seems right, leading to $9,000.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the cash balance on December 31? The problem only mentions these two items, so I think those are the only adjustments needed.\n\nLet me consider if there's any addition I should make. The $4,000 check is postdated and not yet deposited, so it shouldn't be added. The $1,000 check was deposited but bounced, so it should be subtracted.\n\nTherefore, the correct amount to report as cash in the December 31 balance sheet is $9,000.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $9,000\n\nB. $10,000\n\nC. $13,000\n\nD. $14,000\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other items that might affect the cash balance. For example, are there any outstanding checks or anything like that? But the problem doesn't mention any other items, so I think it's safe to assume that the only relevant items are the checkbook balance and these two checks.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the necessary points here. The answer should be $9,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 9000} \\]"
