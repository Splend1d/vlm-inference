                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the anti-Han rebel group known as the Celestial Masters. I need to figure out which tradition they belong to, and the options are Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, or Shamanism. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand who the Celestial Masters are and what they represent. I recall that in Chinese history, there were various rebel groups and movements that rose up against different dynasties. The Han Dynasty was one of the major dynasties in Chinese history, and it's known for many advancements and expansions. But like any dynasty, it had its share of uprisings and rebellions.\n\nNow, the Celestial Masters is a name that sounds familiar. I think it's related to a religious movement in China, but I'm not sure which one exactly. Let me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Buddhism: that's a major world religion that originated in ancient India and spread to China during the Han Dynasty. It's possible that a rebel group could have been influenced by Buddhism, but I don't recall any specific connection between the Celestial Masters and Buddhism. Maybe I should look into that.\n\nNext is Daoism. This is another major Chinese philosophy and religion, emphasizing living in harmony with the Dao, or the Way. Daoism has a rich history in China and has been associated with various movements and uprisings. Could the Celestial Masters be related to Daoism? I seem to remember that Daoism had different sects and schools, some of which might have been involved in political or social movements.\n\nThen there's Confucianism, which is more of a philosophical and ethical system rather than a religion. Confucianism was the official ideology of many Chinese dynasties, including the Han, and it emphasized social hierarchy, filial piety, and moral conduct. It's hard to imagine a rebel group against the Han Dynasty being directly associated with Confucianism, since Confucianism was largely supportive of the existing order. Maybe not this one.\n\nLastly, there's Shamanism. Shamanism is a broad term for indigenous spiritual practices that involve communication with spirits through a shaman, who is a mediator between the human world and the spirit world. While Shamanism has a presence in various parts of China, especially among minority groups, I don't recall it being directly linked to any major rebel groups against the Han Dynasty.\n\nSo, considering these options, I need to think more carefully about the Celestial Masters. Let me try to recall more about them. I think they were a Daoist sect that arose during the late Han Dynasty and were involved in a significant uprising.\n\nAh, yes! Now I remember: the Celestial Masters, also known as the Way of the Celestial Masters or Tianzhi Dao in Chinese, was a Daoist movement that began in the 2nd century CE. It was founded by Zhang Daoling, who claimed to have received a revelation from the Taoist figure Laozi. This movement combined elements of Daoism with organized religious practices and community service.\n\nI think they were involved in a rebellion against the Han Dynasty, known as the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which was a major event that contributed to the eventual fall of the Han Dynasty. Wait, no, the Yellow Turban Rebellion was another uprising around the same time, but I believe the Celestial Masters were involved in their own rebellion, sometimes called the Five Douglas Rebellion or something like that. I might be mixing up the names.\n\nRegardless of the specific name, it's clear that the Celestial Masters were a Daoist sect that challenged the Han Dynasty's rule. So, based on this, it seems that they belong to the Daoist tradition.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. If I recall correctly, Daoism had several sects and movements during the Han Dynasty, some of which were involved in social and political activism. The Celestial Masters were one of the most prominent of these sects, and their teachings emphasized spiritual practices, community welfare, and, in some cases, opposition to the existing government.\n\nIn contrast, Buddhism during this period was still relatively new in China and wasn't yet deeply involved in political movements. Confucianism, as I mentioned earlier, was the established ideology of the Han Dynasty, so it's unlikely that a rebel group would align itself with Confucianism. Shamanism, while present, was more of a local practice and didn't have a widespread organized movement like the Celestial Masters.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is B. Daoism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
