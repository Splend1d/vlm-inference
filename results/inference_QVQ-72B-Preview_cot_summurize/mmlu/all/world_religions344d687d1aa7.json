                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"To whom is the Yoga Sutras attributed?\" and the options are A. Madhva, B. Patanjali, C. Ramanuja, D. Aryabhatta. Hmm, I need to recall which one of these figures is associated with the Yoga Sutras.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Yoga Sutras are a fundamental text in yoga philosophy, so it's important to get this right. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Madhva. I remember that Madhva was a prominent figure in Vaishnavism, particularly known for his contributions to Dvaita, or dualistic, philosophy. He emphasized the distinctness of the individual soul and God. But I don't recall him being directly associated with the Yoga Sutras. Maybe he wrote commentaries on other texts, but not this one.\n\nNext is B. Patanjali. This name rings a bell in relation to yoga. I think Patanjali is often credited with compiling the Yoga Sutras, which outline the eight limbs of yoga. These include practices like yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. It seems very likely that Patanjali is the one attributed to the Yoga Sutras.\n\nThen there's C. Ramanuja. He was another significant philosopher in Vaishnavism, known for his Vishishtadvaita, or qualified non-dualism. Ramanuja's ideas were influential in the development of Bhakti yoga, which focuses on devotion to a personal god. However, again, I don't think he's the one who wrote the Yoga Sutras.\n\nLastly, D. Aryabhatta. I know Aryabhatta as an ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer. He made important contributions to mathematics and astronomy, including the concept of zero and calculations related to pi. But he wasn't involved with yoga texts like the Yoga Sutras.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Patanjali is the one attributed to the Yoga Sutras. Let me just double-check if there's any possibility that another name could also be associated with it.\n\nWait a minute, I've heard of Patanjali in the context of yoga, but is there any chance that another Patanjali wrote something else? No, I think the Patanjali we're referring to here is specifically Patanjali, the author of the Yoga Sutras.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are multiple authors or if there's any confusion between different texts. For example, there's the Mahabhasya by Patanjali, which is about grammar, but that's a different Patanjali. So, to avoid confusion, I should ensure that I'm thinking about the right Patanjali.\n\nGiven that, I'm pretty confident that Patanjali is the one attributed to the Yoga Sutras. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Patanjali.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Madhva: He was a philosopher in Vaishnavism known for Dvaita philosophy, but not related to the Yoga Sutras.\n\nC. Ramanuja: He developed Vishishtadvaita and contributed to Bhakti yoga, but didn't write the Yoga Sutras.\n\nD. Aryabhatta: He was a mathematician and astronomer, not associated with yoga texts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Patanjali.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Patanjali}} \\]"
