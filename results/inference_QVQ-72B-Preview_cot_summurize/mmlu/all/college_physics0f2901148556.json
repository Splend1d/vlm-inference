                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It's about using the energy from electromagnetic waves in a cavity to melt ice. The scenario is that the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, and I need to figure out by what factor the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time increases. The options are 2, 4, 8, or 16.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles. Electromagnetic waves in a cavity are in thermal equilibrium, which means their energy density is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law or perhaps the Planck's law of blackbody radiation. Since we're dealing with temperature changes, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes to mind, which relates the energy emitted per unit area and time to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.\n\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law is:\n\n$$\n\nj = \\sigma T^4\n\n$$\n\nWhere \\( j \\) is the energy flux (energy per unit area per unit time), \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this problem, the energy from these electromagnetic waves is being used to melt ice. So, the energy that's available to melt ice should be proportional to \\( T^4 \\), assuming the cavity is emitting like a blackbody.\n\nBut wait, we need to consider the energy density inside the cavity, not just the energy flux per unit area. The energy density \\( u \\) of electromagnetic radiation in a cavity is given by Planck's law integrated over all frequencies, which results in:\n\n$$\n\nu = \\frac{4 \\sigma T^4}{c}\n\n$$\n\nWhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nHowever, perhaps a better formula for the energy density is given by the ultraviolet catastrophe argument, which leads to:\n\n$$\n\nu = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_{\\mathrm{B}}^4 T^4}{15 c^3 h^3}\n\n$$\n\nBut this seems too complicated for this problem. Maybe I should stick with the Stefan-Boltzmann law for simplicity, especially since we're dealing with energy transfer rates.\n\nLet's consider that the cavity is emitting radiation, and this radiation is being used to melt ice. The rate at which energy is being supplied to melt ice would be proportional to the energy emitted by the cavity, which is proportional to \\( T^4 \\).\n\nIf the temperature is increased by a factor of two, then \\( T \\) becomes \\( 2T \\), and the energy emission rate becomes \\( \\sigma (2T)^4 = \\sigma \\times 16 T^4 \\). So, the energy available to melt ice increases by a factor of 16.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time increases by a factor of... and the options are 2, 4, 8, or 16.\n\nSo, if the energy available increases by a factor of 16, and the energy required to melt a certain mass of ice is proportional to that mass, then it seems like the mass that can be melted should increase by a factor of 16.\n\nHowever, I should think about the latent heat of fusion for ice. The energy required to melt a mass \\( m \\) of ice is:\n\n$$\n\nQ = m L_{\\text{fusion}}\n\n$$\n\nWhere \\( L_{\\text{fusion}} \\) is the latent heat of fusion for ice, approximately 334 J/g.\n\nSo, if the energy available increases by a factor of 16, and the energy required per gram is constant, then the mass that can be melted should increase by a factor of 16.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the efficiency of melting or some other factor could influence this.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the cavity is emitting radiation at a certain rate, and this radiation is absorbed by the ice, melting it. If the temperature of the cavity doubles, the emission rate increases by a factor of 16, as per the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nAssuming all this extra energy is used efficiently to melt ice, without any losses, then the mass of ice that can be melted should increase by a factor of 16.\n\nHowever, maybe there are other factors at play, such as changes in the properties of ice at different temperatures, but the problem specifies that the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, not the temperature of the ice.\n\nAlso, the ice is presumably at 0\u00b0C, and we're melting it to 0\u00b0C water, so the temperature of the ice isn't changing; only the energy input rate is changing.\n\nTherefore, the mass of ice that can be melted should increase by the same factor as the energy input rate, which is 16.\n\nBut let's check the other options to see if any of them make sense.\n\nOption A is 2, which seems too low.\n\nOption B is 4, which might be tempting if I mistakenly thought of \\( T^2 \\), but since the energy scales with \\( T^4 \\), 16 makes more sense.\n\nOption C is 8, which might come from considering \\( T^3 \\), but again, the Stefan-Boltzmann law suggests \\( T^4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 16.\n\nI think the answer is D. 16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}"
