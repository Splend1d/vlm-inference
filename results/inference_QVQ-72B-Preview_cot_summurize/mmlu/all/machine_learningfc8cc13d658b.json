                    "text": "Alright, I've got two statements here about neural networks, and I need to figure out which ones are true and which ones are false. Let's take them one at a time.\n\nFirst statement: \"RELUs are not monotonic, but sigmoids are monotonic.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to understand what RELUs and sigmoids are, and whether they are monotonic or not.\n\nI know that in neural networks, activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the model. Two common types are RELUs (Rectified Linear Units) and sigmoids.\n\nLet me recall the definitions:\n\nA RELU function is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). So, it outputs 0 if x is less than 0, and just x otherwise.\n\nA sigmoid function is something like f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)), which squashes the input into a range between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, monotonicity refers to whether a function is always increasing or always decreasing over its entire domain. So, a monotonic function doesn't have any \"peaks\" or \"valleys\"; it's either going up or down consistently.\n\nLooking at RELU: f(x) = max(0, x). If x is negative, it's flat at 0; if x is positive, it increases linearly. So, overall, it's non-decreasing, but it's not strictly increasing because it's flat for x < 0. Wait, but is it monotonic?\n\nActually, RELU is monotonic because it doesn't decrease; it's either staying the same or increasing. So, the statement says \"RELUs are not monotonic,\" but I think that's incorrect. RELUs are monotonic.\n\nNow, sigmoids: f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)). Let's think about its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n\nThe derivative of sigmoid is f'(x) = f(x)(1 - f(x)), which is always positive because f(x) is between 0 and 1. So, the sigmoid function is strictly increasing everywhere. Therefore, it is monotonic.\n\nSo, the first part of the statement is false because RELUs are monotonic, and the second part is true because sigmoids are monotonic.\n\nMoving on to the second statement: \"Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum.\"\n\nOkay, this is about optimization in neural networks. Gradient descent is a common optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in neural networks.\n\nI know that neural networks can have very complex loss landscapes with many local minima and saddle points. Gradient descent, being a first-order optimization method, is known to converge to critical points, but these could be local minima, saddle points, or even global minima.\n\nThe statement claims that with high probability, gradient descent converges to the global optimum. Is that accurate?\n\nFrom my understanding, in non-convex optimization problems like those encountered in deep learning, gradient descent does not guarantee convergence to the global minimum. In fact, it can get stuck in local minima or saddle points.\n\nHowever, recent research suggests that in overparameterized neural networks, local minima are often close to the global minimum in terms of the loss value, and saddle points are usually not an issue because the loss landscape is relatively flat.\n\nBut does that mean it converges to the global optimum with high probability? I'm not so sure. It's more accurate to say that it converges to a critical point, which may or may not be the global minimum.\n\nMoreover, the learning rate and other hyperparameters of gradient descent can affect convergence. If the learning rate is too high, it might overshoot the minima, and if it's too low, convergence can be very slow.\n\nTherefore, I think the statement is overly optimistic. Convergence to the global optimum is not guaranteed with gradient descent, especially in deep learning settings where the loss functions are highly non-convex.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Statement 1: False, because RELUs are monotonic.\n\n- Statement 2: False, because gradient descent does not necessarily converge to the global optimum with high probability.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. False, False.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Maybe there's some nuance I'm missing.\n\nFor statement 1, is RELU really monotonic? Let's think about it again.\n\nRELU is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). So, for x < 0, f(x) = 0; for x >= 0, f(x) = x.\n\nIs it monotonic increasing? Yes, because as x increases, f(x) never decreases. It stays flat for x < 0 and increases linearly for x >= 0. So, it's non-decreasing, which is a type of monotonic function.\n\nSigmoids are strictly increasing, as we saw earlier.\n\nTherefore, the first statement is false.\n\nFor statement 2, is it true that gradient descent converges to the global optimum with high probability in neural networks?\n\nI think the answer is no, because of the non-convex nature of the loss function. While it's true that in practice, gradient descent often finds good solutions in deep learning, these are not necessarily the global optima.\n\nMoreover, in theory, there's no guarantee that gradient descent will find the global optimum unless certain conditions are met, which are often not satisfied in practice.\n\nTherefore, both statements are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
