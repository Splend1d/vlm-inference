                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this expression: 4(3 + 2), and I need to restate it using the Distributive Property without simplifying. Okay, so the Distributive Property is about distributing a number outside the parentheses to each term inside the parentheses. Right?\n\nSo, in this case, the number outside is 4, and inside the parentheses, we have 3 + 2. According to the Distributive Property, I should multiply 4 by 3 and then 4 by 2, and add those together. So, it should be 4 times 3 plus 4 times 2. Let me check the options.\n\nOption A is 4(3) + 2. Hmm, that seems off because it's only multiplying 4 by 3 and then just adding 2, but according to the Distributive Property, the 4 should be multiplied by both 3 and 2.\n\nOption B is 4(3) + 4(2). That sounds exactly like what I just thought. It's multiplying 4 by 3 and 4 by 2, and then adding them together. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C is 20. Well, that's just the simplified version, but the problem says not to simplify, so this can't be it.\n\nOption D is 3 + 4(2). This seems like it's only distributing the 4 to 2 and leaving the 3 as it is, which doesn't follow the Distributive Property correctly.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct choice. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe Distributive Property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. Applying this to 4(3 + 2), it should be 4*3 + 4*2. So, yes, that matches option B.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer. Maybe just to be extra sure, I can think about another example. Like, if I have 2(4 + 5), according to the Distributive Property, it should be 2*4 + 2*5, which is 8 + 10, and that makes sense.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to 4(3 + 2), it should indeed be 4(3) + 4(2). Therefore, the correct choice is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
