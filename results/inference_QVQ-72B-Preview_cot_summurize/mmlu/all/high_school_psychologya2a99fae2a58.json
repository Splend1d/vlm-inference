                    "text": "So I have this question here about child development, specifically about how a six-month-old child might react when an attachment figure, like a parent, leaves. The options are attachment anxiety, reactive attachment disorder, object permanence, and separation anxiety. I need to pick the one that best describes the situation where the child shows distress when the attachment figure leaves.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with \"attachment anxiety,\" I think this has to do with worries or fears related to attachments. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right fit for this scenario. Maybe it's more general than what's being described here.\n\n\"Reactive attachment disorder\" sounds like a more serious condition. I believe it's a mental health disorder where children have problems forming healthy emotional attachments because of their early experiences, maybe due to neglect or abuse. That seems pretty intense and probably not the best fit for a six-month-old showing distress when a parent leaves. It seems like something more typical or developmental for the age.\n\n\"Object permanence\" is a concept from Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development. It's when a child understands that objects continue to exist even when they can't see them. I think this develops around eight to twelve months of age. So, for a six-month-old, it might be starting to develop, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to showing distress when a parent leaves. Maybe indirectly, but I need to think about it more.\n\n\"Separation anxiety\" is something I've heard of before, especially in babies and toddlers. It's when a child gets upset or distressed when separated from a primary caregiver, usually a parent. This often happens when the child starts to understand that the parent can leave or be out of sight. I think it's a normal part of development for young children.\n\nGiven that, it seems like \"separation anxiety\" is the most fitting answer here. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me think about it again. The question is about a six-month-old child who shows distress when an attachment figure leaves. An attachment figure is typically a primary caregiver, like a parent, who the child has formed a bond with.\n\nAttachment theory, proposed by John Bowlby, suggests that infants form strong emotional bonds with their caregivers, and separation from them can cause distress. This is seen as a normal adaptive response because it helps keep the child close to the caregiver for safety.\n\nSo, in that context, \"attachment anxiety\" might refer to the anxiety felt in relation to the attachment relationship, but I think that's more of a general term and not specifically about the distress caused by separation.\n\n\"Reactive attachment disorder\" is indeed a serious condition that involves difficulties in forming attached relationships, often due to early adverse experiences. It's not something that would typically be diagnosed or observed in a six-month-old, as it usually manifests later and under specific circumstances.\n\n\"Object permanence\" is about understanding that objects continue to exist even when not in view. While this is a cognitive milestone, it's not directly about emotional responses to separation.\n\nTherefore, \"separation anxiety\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. It directly describes the phenomenon where a child experiences distress upon separation from an attached figure, which is common in infants around six months of age.\n\nTo confirm, I did a quick search in my notes from a developmental psychology class. It mentions that separation anxiety typically begins around six to eight months of age and peaks around fourteen months. So, a six-month-old starting to show distress when a parent leaves fits perfectly with this timeline.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that this is linked to the child's growing understanding that people and objects can exist independently of their presence, which aligns with the development of object permanence. However, while object permanence is a cognitive development, separation anxiety is more about the emotional response to separation, making it a better fit for the description provided.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my understanding of child development and the options provided, I believe the correct answer is \"separation anxiety.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. separation anxiety}} \\]"
