                    "text": "So I have this question about price elasticity of demand. It says that when the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, demand is:\n\nA. perfectly inelastic.\n\nB. elastic.\n\nC. inelastic.\n\nD. unit elastic.\n\nHmm, I need to remember what price elasticity of demand means. I know that price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's usually expressed as a percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nSo, if the elasticity is greater than 1, that means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is larger than the percentage change in price. That sounds like demand is pretty responsive to price changes. Let me see which option matches that description.\n\nOption A is \"perfectly inelastic.\" I think perfectly inelastic demand means that quantity demanded doesn't change at all when price changes. The elasticity would be zero in that case, which is not greater than 1. So, this can't be the right answer.\n\nOption B is \"elastic.\" I recall that elastic demand refers to when the elasticity is greater than 1, meaning quantity demanded is very responsive to price changes. This seems like it matches what the question is asking.\n\nOption C is \"inelastic.\" Inelastic demand is when the elasticity is less than 1, meaning quantity demanded doesn't change much when price changes. Again, this doesn't match the scenario where elasticity is greater than 1.\n\nOption D is \"unit elastic.\" Unit elastic demand is when the elasticity is exactly 1, meaning the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price. But the question specifies that elasticity is greater than 1, so this isn't the right choice.\n\nBased on this, it seems like the correct answer should be B. elastic.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me recall the different types of price elasticity:\n\n1. Elastic: when the absolute value of elasticity is greater than 1.\n\n2. Inelastic: when the absolute value of elasticity is less than 1.\n\n3. Unit elastic: when the absolute value of elasticity is exactly 1.\n\n4. Perfectly inelastic: when elasticity is zero, meaning quantity demanded doesn't change at all with price.\n\n5. Perfectly elastic: when elasticity is infinite, meaning quantity demanded changes infinitely with even a small change in price.\n\nSo, in the case where elasticity is greater than 1, it falls into the elastic category. Therefore, option B. elastic is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider an example. Suppose the price elasticity of demand for a product is 2, which is greater than 1. This means that if the price increases by 1%, the quantity demanded decreases by 2%. This shows that consumers are sensitive to price changes, and demand is elastic.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when elasticity is greater than 1, the revenue impact of a price change is such that increasing price would lead to a decrease in total revenue because the percentage drop in quantity demanded is larger than the percentage increase in price.\n\nSo, in conclusion, when the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, demand is considered elastic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
