                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. So, Andrew wrote the number 186,425 on the board. I need to find which one of these options has a digit 6 whose value is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in Andrew's number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the value of the digit 6 is in Andrew's number, 186,425. The digit 6 is in the thousands place because it's the third digit from the right. So, the place value of 6 in this number is 6 times 1,000, which is 6,000.\n\nNow, I need to find a number where the value of the digit 6 is exactly 10 times that. So, 10 times 6,000 is 60,000. That means I'm looking for a number where the digit 6 is in the ten-thousands place because that would make its value 60,000.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 681,452\n\nHere, the digit 6 is in the millions place, so its value is 6,000,000. That's not 60,000.\n\nOption B: 462,017\n\nIn this number, the digit 6 is in the ten-thousands place. So, its value is 60,000. That matches what I'm looking for.\n\nOption C: 246,412\n\nThe digit 6 is in the thousands place, so its value is 6,000. That's not 60,000.\n\nOption D: 125,655\n\nHere, the digit 6 is in the hundreds place, so its value is 600. That's not 60,000.\n\nSo, only option B has the digit 6 in the ten-thousands place, which makes its value 60,000, which is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in Andrew's number, 186,425.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIn Andrew's number, 186,425, the digit 6 is in the thousands place, so its value is 6,000.\n\nTen times that would be 60,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 681,452 \u2013 6 is in the millions place, which is 6,000,000.\n\nB. 462,017 \u2013 6 is in the ten-thousands place, which is 60,000.\n\nC. 246,412 \u2013 6 is in the thousands place, which is 6,000.\n\nD. 125,655 \u2013 6 is in the hundreds place, which is 600.\n\nYes, option B is the correct choice.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any other way to interpret the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
