The brother-in-law was an eyewitness to the accident where the shopper allegedly got injured by the supermarket's automatic doors. But he wasn't called to testify, and he moved out of state after the accident. The shopper's lawyer also didn't depose him.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's going on here. The shopper is suing the supermarket for injuries caused by the automatic doors swinging outward instead of inward, which supposedly hurt him when he was trying to enter the store. His brother-in-law saw it happen but wasn't called to testify, and now he's out of state.\n\nNow, the question is about what the court should do in response to the shopper's failure to offer the brother-in-law's testimony. The options are:\n\nA. Instruct the jury that it raises the presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\n\nB. Instruct the jury that it constitutes an adoptive admission that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\n\nC. Permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\n\nD. Neither instruct the jury on the matter nor permit the supermarket's attorney to argue the matter.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about witness testimony and the rules around it, especially when a party doesn't call a witness who might have relevant information.\n\nI recall that there's a doctrine called the \"adverse inference\" or \"adverse presumption\" that can apply when a party fails to call a witness who has relevant information and is within their control or influence. The idea is that if a party doesn't call a witness who could offer important evidence, the jury can infer that the testimony would have been unfavorable to that party.\n\nSo, in this case, the brother-in-law is an eyewitness, and he's related to the shopper, so presumably, the shopper has some influence over whether he testifies or not. But he wasn't called to testify, and now he's out of state.\n\nWait, but the shopper's attorney also failed to depose him. A deposition is a way to take a witness's testimony before trial, usually for discovery purposes or to preserve their testimony if they might not be available at trial.\n\nSo, the shopper's lawyer could have taken the brother-in-law's deposition before he moved out of state, but they didn't.\n\nNow, the supermarket's attorney is requesting that the court take some action regarding this failure to present the brother-in-law's testimony.\n\nOption A suggests that the court should instruct the jury that the failure to call the witness raises a presumption that the testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\n\nOption B says it constitutes an adoptive admission that the testimony would have been unfavorable.\n\nOption C allows the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption of unfavorable testimony.\n\nOption D says the court shouldn't do anything about it; no instruction to the jury and no argument allowed from the supermarket's attorney.\n\nI need to figure out which one is appropriate.\n\nFirst, let's think about the concept of a presumption. A presumption is a assumption that the law allows the factfinder (the jury) to make unless the opposing party presents evidence to rebut it.\n\nSo, if the court instructs the jury that there's a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper, that means the jury can assume that's the case unless the shopper presents evidence to the contrary.\n\nBut is that the right approach here?\n\nI think there's a doctrine called the \"missing witness\" doctrine, which allows the jury to draw an adverse inference when a party fails to call a witness who is within their control and whose testimony would be relevant to the issues in the case.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the court doesn't automatically instruct the jury with a presumption; instead, it allows the opposing party to argue that the jury can draw an inference about why the witness wasn't called.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is more accurate, which permits the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption of unfavorable testimony.\n\nWait, but \"presumption\" might be too strong. Maybe it's more accurate to say that the supermarket's attorney can argue that the jury may infer that the testimony would have been unfavorable.\n\nI need to check what the standard practice is regarding instructions to the jury in such situations.\n\nIn federal courts and many state courts, the judge generally doesn't instruct the jury on the adverse inference automatically. Instead, the party seeking to have the inference drawn (in this case, the supermarket's attorney) might request permission to argue that the jury can draw such an inference.\n\nMoreover, the shopper's attorney can object to such an argument, and the court would consider whether the inference is appropriate based on the circumstances.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is the closest, as it allows the supermarket's attorney to make the argument, but it's phrased as \"raises a presumption,\" which might be too strong.\n\nMaybe the better approach is that the court should permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that the jury may infer that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper, but not that it raises a presumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court should neither instruct the jury nor allow the argument, as per option D.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, because the failure to call a material witness who is within the control of the opposing party is generally something that can be highlighted by the other side.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose I'm the supermarket's attorney, and I want to argue that the shopper didn't call his brother-in-law to testify, even though he was an eyewitness and presumably would have testified in favor of the shopper if his testimony was helpful. Since he wasn't called, and considering he's related to the shopper, perhaps his testimony wouldn't have been as favorable as the shopper claims.\n\nSo, I would argue that the jury can infer that the brother-in-law's testimony would have hurt the shopper's case, which is why he wasn't called.\n\nBut does that rise to the level of a presumption? Probably not. It's more of an inference that the jury is permitted to draw, not a mandatory presumption.\n\nTherefore, option A, which talks about raising a presumption, might be too strong.\n\nOption B mentions \"adoptive admission,\" which I'm not entirely sure about in this context. An adoptive admission is usually when a party adopts statements made by someone else, often by failing to deny them or by remaining silent when they should have spoken up.\n\nI don't see how that directly applies here, where the issue is failing to call a witness.\n\nOption C allows the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption, which again seems too strong.\n\nOption D says neither instruct the jury nor permit the argument, which seems inappropriate because the supermarket should be able to point out the shopper's failure to call a key witness.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up the specific rule or doctrine that applies here.\n\nI recall that there's a rule in evidence law that allows for the drawing of adverse inferences when a party fails to produce a witness who is under their control or influence.\n\nIn federal courts, this is sometimes referred to as the \"missing witness\" rule or the \"doctrine of missing witnesses.\"\n\nThe general principle is that if a party fails to call a witness who is available and whose testimony would be relevant and presumably favorable to that party, the jury may infer that the testimony would have been unfavorable.\n\nHowever, this is usually presented as a permissible inference, not a mandatory presumption.\n\nSo, perhaps the court shouldn't instruct the jury with a presumption, but it should allow the supermarket's attorney to argue that the jury may draw such an inference.\n\nGiven that, option C seems closest, but it says \"raises a presumption,\" which might be too strong.\n\nMaybe none of the options perfectly capture the appropriate action, but among them, option C is the most fitting because it allows the supermarket's attorney to argue the point.\n\nOption A is similar but frames it as an instruction to the jury, which might not be necessary or appropriate.\n\nOption B's reference to \"adoptive admission\" doesn't seem directly applicable here.\n\nOption D is too restrictive, as it would prevent the supermarket's attorney from making any argument about the shopper's failure to call the witness.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option C: permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\n\nEven though \"presumption\" might be a bit strong, it's the closest among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
