Have information that will be worth our effort to collect\n\nB. Are going to be honest and forthright\n\nC. Are informed about our study and give their consent to participate\n\nD. Have been granted permission to participate by the IRB\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, when we're conducting research involving human participants, there are ethical guidelines and regulations that we need to follow to protect the rights and welfare of those participants. One of the key aspects is obtaining informed consent.\n\nSo, informed consent means that the participants should understand what the study involves, what is expected of them, and agree to take part voluntarily. They should be aware of any potential risks or benefits, and they should have the freedom to withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Have information that will be worth our effort to collect\n\nThis seems more focused on the value of the data we're going to get rather than ensuring the well-being and rights of the participants. While it's important for researchers to consider the value of the data, this isn't the primary concern before collecting data from humans.\n\nB. Are going to be honest and forthright\n\nHonesty of participants is certainly important for the validity of the research, but ensuring that participants are honest is more about research design and possibly screening mechanisms rather than the ethical considerations before data collection.\n\nC. Are informed about our study and give their consent to participate\n\nThis aligns closely with the concept of informed consent. It emphasizes that participants should be provided with information about the study and that their agreement to participate is voluntary and based on understanding.\n\nD. Have been granted permission to participate by the IRB\n\nAn IRB, or Institutional Review Board, is a committee that reviews research proposals involving human subjects to ensure they meet ethical standards. While it's true that research involving human participants typically needs IRB approval before proceeding, the focus here is on the participants being granted permission by the IRB. However, it's actually the research project that needs IRB approval, not the participants individually.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to be the most accurate answer. Ensuring that participants are informed about the study and give their consent to participate is a fundamental ethical requirement in research involving human subjects.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be considered important before data collection.\n\nOption A: Having information that will be worth our effort to collect\u2014is more related to the research design and expected outcomes rather than ethical considerations towards the participants.\n\nOption B: Being honest and forthright\u2014is important for data integrity, but again, this is more about ensuring the quality of the data rather than protecting the participants.\n\nOption D: Being granted permission to participate by the IRB\u2014IRB approval is for the research project, not for individual participants. While the IRB may have criteria for participant eligibility, it's the research team's responsibility to screen and recruit participants according to those criteria.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is Option C: Are informed about our study and give their consent to participate.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that in most research ethics guidelines, informed consent is a cornerstone principle. It involves providing potential participants with sufficient information about the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, and their rights, including the right to withdraw at any time.\n\nSo, yes, before collecting data from human beings, it's essential to ensure that they are informed about the study and give their consent to participate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
