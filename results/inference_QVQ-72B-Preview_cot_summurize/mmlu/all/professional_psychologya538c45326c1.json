                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what the essential feature of Conduct Disorder is. I have these options: lack of appropriate guilt or remorse, major rule or norm violations, aggression, and impulsivity. I need to pick the one that's the essential feature. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that Conduct Disorder is a type of behavioral and emotional problem in children and adolescents where they have a pattern of behaving in ways that break the rules or laws, and often harm others or their own well-being. So, it's about behaving inappropriately, breaking rules, and not feeling bad about it.\n\nOption A is lack of appropriate guilt or remorse. That sounds important because if someone doesn't feel bad about doing something wrong, they might keep doing it. But is that the most essential feature?\n\nOption B is major rule or norm violations. This seems directly related to the definition I have in mind. People with Conduct Disorder often violate rules and social norms, like stealing, lying, or being physically aggressive.\n\nOption C is aggression. While aggression is a common symptom, especially physical fights or harming animals, I think it's one aspect but maybe not the essential feature.\n\nOption D is impulsivity. Being impulsive can lead to rule-breaking behavior, but again, I think it's a contributing factor rather than the essential feature.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up the official definition or diagnostic criteria for Conduct Disorder. That might help me decide.\n\nI recall that in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Conduct Disorder is defined by a recurring pattern of behavior where the rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated. So, that sounds a lot like option B: major rule or norm violations.\n\nBut, I also remember that lack of remorse is a part of it. For example, not feeling bad after hurting someone or lying. So, option A is also relevant.\n\nMaybe the essential feature is both: violating rules and not feeling bad about it. But I have to choose one.\n\nLet me consider this differently. In Conduct Disorder, the individual shows a pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others or societal norms, and this pattern is persistent and occurs across multiple settings and over time. The lack of remorse might be a part of it, but perhaps it's more about the actions themselves\u2014the rule-breaking and norm violations.\n\nMoreover, aggression and impulsivity can be symptoms or traits associated with Conduct Disorder, but they might not be present in every case. For example, some individuals with Conduct Disorder might be primarily deceitful or manipulative without being physically aggressive.\n\nGiven that, I think the essential feature is the major rule or norm violations. That seems to be the core aspect of the disorder, and it's directly aligned with the definition.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me think about an example. Suppose there's a teenager who repeatedly skips school, lies to parents, steals from stores, and engages in fights. All of these are rule violations, and they might not necessarily show remorse for their actions. So, both options A and B are relevant, but again, I have to pick one.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that lack of remorse is a characteristic of Conduct Disorder, but it's not unique to it. Some other conditions might also involve lack of remorse, but not necessarily rule violations.\n\nOn the other hand, rule violations are specifically part of Conduct Disorder's definition. So, maybe that's the essential feature.\n\nAnother angle: in psychology, Conduct Disorder is considered a type of externalizing disorder, where behaviors are directed outward in a disruptive manner. Rule-breaking and aggressive behaviors are key components here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the DSM criteria more closely. I think there are specific criteria for Conduct Disorder, like aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violation of rules.\n\nSo, rule violations are explicitly mentioned as one of the criteria. Similarly, aggression is another criterion, but it's not the only one.\n\nImpulsivity might be a trait that underlies some of these behaviors, but it's not a criterion by itself.\n\nTherefore, the essential feature seems to be the pattern of rule violations.\n\nJust to cross-verify, I'll consider another source. Maybe I'll look up some textbooks on child psychology or abnormal psychology.\n\nIn my child psychology class, I learned that Conduct Disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of rule-breaking and aggressive behaviors that violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules.\n\nAgain, that points towards option B: major rule or norm violations.\n\nOption A, lack of appropriate guilt or remorse, might be a related feature but isn't necessarily the defining characteristic. Some individuals with Conduct Disorder might show remorse, but it's not a consistent feature.\n\nOption C, aggression, is a part of the disorder, but not all cases involve physical aggression. There can be verbal aggression or other forms of harm-doing.\n\nOption D, impulsivity, is a trait that can contribute to rule-breaking behavior, but it's not specific to Conduct Disorder and can be seen in other conditions like Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I believe that the essential feature of Conduct Disorder is major rule or norm violations.\n\nI think the answer is B. Major rule or norm violations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
