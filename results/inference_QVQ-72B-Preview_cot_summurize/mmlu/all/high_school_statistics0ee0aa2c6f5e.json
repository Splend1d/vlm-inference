                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about comparing the heights of a man and a woman to see who is more unusually tall within their respective groups. The mean height for adult men is 70 inches with a standard deviation of 4 inches, and for adult women, it's 66 inches with a standard deviation of 3 inches. Specifically, we're looking at a man who is 74 inches tall and a woman who is 70 inches tall. The question is, which one is more unusually tall?\n\nAlright, so first, I need to understand what \"more unusually tall\" means in this context. I think it's about how far their heights deviate from the average height of their group. So, for the man, how much taller is he compared to other men, and for the woman, how much taller is she compared to other women.\n\nI recall that in statistics, we can measure how far a data point is from the mean using standard deviations. This is called the z-score. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular value is. A higher z-score means the value is more unusual or further from the average.\n\nSo, maybe I should calculate the z-scores for both the man and the woman and compare them.\n\nLet's recall the formula for the z-score: z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where x is the data point, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the z-score for the man:\n\nx_m = 74 inches (his height)\n\n\u03bc_m = 70 inches (mean height for men)\n\n\u03c3_m = 4 inches (standard deviation for men)\n\nSo, z_m = (74 - 70) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nThat means the man is 1 standard deviation taller than the average man.\n\nNow, let's calculate the z-score for the woman:\n\nx_w = 70 inches (her height)\n\n\u03bc_w = 66 inches (mean height for women)\n\n\u03c3_w = 3 inches (standard deviation for women)\n\nSo, z_w = (70 - 66) / 3 = 4 / 3 \u2248 1.333...\n\nThat means the woman is approximately 1.33 standard deviations taller than the average woman.\n\nComparing the two z-scores, the man is 1 SD above the mean, while the woman is 1.33 SDs above the mean.\n\nSo, in terms of how many standard deviations away from their respective means their heights are, the woman is farther from her group's mean than the man is from his.\n\nTherefore, the woman is more unusually tall within her group.\n\nWait a minute, option D seems to suggest the same thing. It says the woman is more unusually tall because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men.\n\nSo, based on this calculation, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any other factor that I should consider? For example, the means are different, but I think the z-score adjusts for that by standardizing the deviation in terms of standard deviations.\n\nAlso, the standard deviations are different, but again, the z-score takes that into account.\n\nI don't think the differences in means or standard deviations affect the comparison of z-scores.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the normal distribution curves for both men and women.\n\nIf I plot the distribution of men's heights, it's a normal distribution with mean 70 and SD 4.\n\nFor women, it's mean 66 and SD 3.\n\nSo, plotting these, and marking 74 inches for men and 70 inches for women on their respective curves, I can see where they fall.\n\nFor men, 74 is one SD above the mean (70 + 4 = 74).\n\nFor women, 70 is two SDs above the mean (66 + 2*3 = 72, so 70 is just a bit above that, wait no:\n\nWait, no, let's recalculate that.\n\nWait, mean is 66, one SD is 69, two SDs is 72.\n\nSo, 70 is (70 - 66)/3 = 4/3 \u2248 1.33 SDs above the mean, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for men, 74 is one SD above the mean.\n\nSo, again, the woman's height is farther from her group's mean in terms of standard deviations.\n\nTherefore, she is more unusually tall.\n\nWait, but option C says the man is more unusually tall because he is 74 inches tall and the woman is only 70 inches tall.\n\nBut that doesn't take into account the variability within each group.\n\nJust because 74 is higher than 70 doesn't mean he's more unusually tall, especially since the men have a larger standard deviation.\n\nFor example, in men, 74 is one SD above the mean, which might not be that unusual, whereas in women, 70 is 1.33 SDs above the mean, which is relatively farther out in the tail of the distribution.\n\nSo, I think option C is incorrect because it doesn't consider the variability.\n\nOption A says it cannot be determined because the mean heights for the two groups are different.\n\nBut I think by using z-scores, which standardize the deviation, we can compare them directly.\n\nSimilarly, option B says it cannot be determined because the standard deviations are different.\n\nAgain, z-scores adjust for that, so I don't think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps using percentiles.\n\nIf I calculate the percentile rank for each height in their respective groups, I can see how rare their heights are.\n\nFor the man, z = 1 corresponds to about the 84th percentile (since the area to the left of z=1 in a standard normal distribution is about 0.84).\n\nFor the woman, z \u2248 1.33 would correspond to about the 90.8th percentile (using standard normal table).\n\nSo, the woman's height is even rarer in her group than the man's height in his group.\n\nThus, she is more unusually tall.\n\nAlternatively, we could look at the probability of being taller than these heights.\n\nBut calculating exact probabilities might be overkill for this problem.\n\nIn summary, based on the z-scores and the percentile ranks, the woman is more unusually tall within her group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
