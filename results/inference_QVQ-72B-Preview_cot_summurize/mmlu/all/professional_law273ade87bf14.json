A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n\nA. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\nB. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\nC. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\nD.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a city that passed an ordinance to improve rental housing quality. The ordinance requires all new and existing rental units to have certain amenities like bathrooms, laundry hookups, and covered parking spaces. Some rental housing owners are upset because they think this will hurt low-income rentals since they can't raise rents enough to cover the costs. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing is suing, saying the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.\n\nI need to figure out who has the burden of persuasion in this lawsuit. There are four options, and I have to pick the one that best states that burden. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"burden of persuasion\" means in this context. In legal terms, the burden of persuasion is on the party that has to prove their case to the satisfaction of the court. So, in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance, it's important to know who has to prove that the ordinance is constitutional or unconstitutional.\n\nThe plaintiff is claiming that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. That means the plaintiff is arguing that the ordinance is invalid right from the start, without needing any evidence of how it's applied in practice.\n\nNow, generally, ordinances are presumed to be constitutional. So, the burden is usually on the plaintiff to show that the ordinance is unconstitutional. But there are exceptions, especially if the ordinance affects certain fundamental rights or if it discriminates in some way.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the city has to prove something because the ordinance affects a fundamental right of property owners. But is there a fundamental right to use property in any economically efficient way? I'm not so sure. The Fifth Amendment protects property rights, including the right not to have property taken without just compensation, but that's more about takings, not about regulating how property is used economically.\n\nWait, there is a concept called \"regulatory taking.\" That's when government regulations effectively take away the use of property without paying for it. But in this case, the ordinance is requiring improvements to the property, not restricting its use in a way that might be considered a taking.\n\nMaybe this isn't a taking case. The ordinance is about setting minimum standards for rental housing, which is typically within the police power of the city to regulate for health, safety, and welfare.\n\nSo, perhaps property rights aren't being fundamentally affected in a way that would shift the burden to the city to prove a compelling interest.\n\nOption B says that the city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\n\nThis seems to be invoking some sort of equal protection argument. Equal protection requires that laws don't discriminate against certain classes of people without a good reason.\n\nHere, the plaintiff is claiming that the ordinance will decrease the number of low-income rental units, which could disproportionately affect low-income persons.\n\nBut is \"low-income status\" a protected class under equal protection? Not necessarily. Generally, equal protection requires strict scrutiny for laws that target race, national origin, or citizenship status. Intermediate scrutiny is applied to gender and legitimacy status, and rational basis review is applied to all other classifications, including economic status.\n\nSo, unless low-income status is considered a suspect or quasi-suspect class, which it generally isn't, the ordinance would only need to pass rational basis review.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be overreaching by suggesting that strict scrutiny applies.\n\nOption C says that the plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\n\nThis sounds like it's referring to intermediate scrutiny, where a law must be substantially related to an important government interest.\n\nBut again, in economic regulation, rational basis review is usually applied, which is less demanding than intermediate scrutiny.\n\nSo, maybe this isn't the best fit either.\n\nOption D says that the plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n\nThis sounds like rational basis review, which is the lowest level of scrutiny. Under rational basis review, a law is constitutional if there's any rational relationship between the law and a legitimate government interest.\n\nGiven that the ordinance is regulating economic activity related to housing, which is typically within the city's police powers, rational basis review would likely apply.\n\nSo, according to this, the plaintiff would have to show that there's no rational basis for the ordinance.\n\nBut wait, in rational basis review, the challenger (the plaintiff) typically has to show that there's no rational basis, not that the city has to prove there is one.\n\nMoreover, in cases involving economic regulation, the Supreme Court has held that laws regulating economic matters are presumptively valid and that the party challenging the regulation bears the burden of showing that it lacks any rational basis.\n\nSo, this seems to align with option D.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn the case of economic regulation, the courts generally apply rational basis review, and the challenger has to show that there's no rational basis for the regulation.\n\nIn this scenario, the plaintiff is challenging the ordinance on its face, meaning they're arguing that it's invalid in all its applications, not just as applied to them.\n\nIn facial challenges, the plaintiff usually has to establish that the ordinance is invalid in all possible applications, which is a high bar.\n\nSo, in this case, the plaintiff would have to show that there's no rational basis for the ordinance at all, which aligns with option D.\n\nOptions A and B suggest that the city has to prove something, which seems inconsistent with the usual burden in economic regulation cases.\n\nOption C suggests intermediate scrutiny, which doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
