Within the disease prescription, reform packages become part of the government response to reduce the appeal of the terrorist group within the population. However, reforms may encourage terrorists to continue their violent activities because they are being rewarded. Under these conditions reforms may become concessions that fuel the violence rather than a mechanism for ending it. It is also clear that reforms may not eliminate the presence of terrorism.\nB. Contemporary responses to terrorism have been taken within the context of the war on terror analogy, in which the norms of retaliation and punishment prevail. Implicit within this view is the justification for pre-emptive action taken against training facilities, headquarters, sources of funding, and even the assassination of key individuals.\nC. Whilst the warfare analogy presumes deterrence at times, deterrence is more central to a justice system. The extent of pre-emption available in a normal criminal context is the detention of suspects or judicial harassment.\nD. All of these options. Responses to terrorist attacks vary either explicitly or implicitly, if warfare is seen as warfare, crime, or disease.\n"

The question gives a few options, and I need to pick which one is correct. But I think it's important to consider all of them to get a full picture.\n\nOption A talks about the disease perspective. It says that if terrorism is seen as a disease, reforms or prescription packages are part of the government's response to reduce the appeal of the terrorist group among the population. But it also mentions that these reforms might backfire because they could be seen as rewards for terrorism, encouraging more violence. So, reforms might actually fuel the violence instead of ending it. It also says that even with reforms, terrorism might not go away completely.\n\nOption B mentions that contemporary responses to terrorism are often based on the war on terror analogy. This means that retaliation and punishment are the main approaches. Pre-emptive actions like attacking training facilities, headquarters, cutting off funding, and even assassinating key members are justified under this perspective.\n\nOption C brings up the justice system perspective. It says that while the warfare analogy might involve deterrence, in a justice system, deterrence is more central. It also mentions that in a normal criminal context, pre-emptive actions are limited to detaining suspects or judicial harassment.\n\nOption D suggests that all of these perspectives influence the government's response to terrorism.\n\nI think the answer is D, that all of these options influence the government's response. Because in reality, governments might use a combination of these approaches depending on the situation.\n\nFor example, they might view terrorism as a disease and try to address the root causes through reforms, but at the same time, they might also see it as a war and take pre-emptive military actions against terrorist groups. Additionally, they might handle individual terrorists through the criminal justice system, prosecuting them for their crimes.\n\nIt's probably not just one perspective that influences the response, but a mix of these views. So, selecting D seems the most comprehensive answer.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Maybe one perspective is more dominant than others in shaping the response. For instance, after 9/11, the U.S. adopted the war on terror approach, leading to military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. That seems very much aligned with Option B.\n\nAt the same time, there have been efforts to counter violent extremism through social and economic reforms, which aligns with Option A. And of course, individual terrorists are often prosecuted through the criminal justice system, which fits Option C.\n\nSo, it's clear that governments draw from multiple perspectives when formulating their responses to terrorism. Therefore, the most accurate answer is D: all of these options.\n\nI don't think it's just one perspective because terrorism is a complex issue, and a multi-faceted approach is often necessary to address it effectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
