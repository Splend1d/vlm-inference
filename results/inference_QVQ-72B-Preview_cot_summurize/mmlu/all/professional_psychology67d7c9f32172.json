                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Kohlberg's theory of moral development. Let's see what it's asking. The question is: \"For Kohlberg, morality:\n\nA. Develops independent of outside influence\n\nB. Cannot be rationalized in every instance\n\nC. Is independent from emotion\n\nD. Shows a logical progression from egocentric thought to broad moral principles\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall Kohlberg's stages of moral development. I remember that Kohlberg proposed that moral development progresses through a series of stages, from simpler to more complex understanding of right and wrong.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Develops independent of outside influence. Hmm, I don't think that's accurate. Kohlberg's theory emphasizes socialization and the influence of society and culture on moral development. So, morality doesn't develop in a vacuum; it's shaped by our interactions with others and the values we learn from our environment. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: Cannot be rationalized in every instance. This one is a bit tricky. Kohlberg's theory does suggest that at higher stages of moral development, individuals are better at justifying their moral decisions with logical reasoning. However, it doesn't say that morality can't be rationalized in every instance. Maybe there are situations where moral choices are too complex to be fully rationalized, but I'm not sure if that's specifically part of Kohlberg's theory. Perhaps not the best choice.\n\nOption C: Is independent from emotion. Now, this is interesting. Kohlberg's theory focuses primarily on cognitive development and rational thought in moral reasoning. It doesn't directly address emotions. But I do recall that later theorists, like Carol Gilligan, criticized Kohlberg for neglecting the role of emotion and care in moral decision-making. So, while Kohlberg might have seen morality as primarily a rational process, it's important to note that emotions do play a role in moral judgments, even if his theory doesn't emphasize it. Still, based on Kohlberg's original theory, this option might be considered correct, but I have a feeling there's a better answer.\n\nOption D: Shows a logical progression from egocentric thought to broad moral principles. This seems very much in line with Kohlberg's theory. He outlined three levels of moral development, each consisting of two stages, progressing from pre-conventional morality (focused on rewards and punishments, and self-interest), to conventional morality (valuing social approval and following rules), and finally to post-conventional morality (based on abstract principles and individual rights). This definitely describes a progression from more self-centered thinking to broader, more principled moral reasoning.\n\nGiven these considerations, option D seems to be the most accurate description of Kohlberg's view on moral development. It captures the essence of his stage theory and the movement towards more mature moral reasoning.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any chance that another option could also be correct?\n\nWell, option A is about independence from outside influence, which contradicts Kohlberg's emphasis on social interactions driving moral development. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B suggests that morality can't always be rationalized, but Kohlberg's theory actually strives to understand moral development through increasingly sophisticated rational capacities. So, this seems at odds with his approach.\n\nOption C states that morality is independent from emotion. While Kohlberg's theory focuses on cognitive aspects, it doesn't explicitly claim that morality is independent from emotion. In fact, his stages do imply some emotional development, even if indirectly. For example, at higher stages, individuals are more capable of empathy and considering the well-being of others. So, perhaps this isn't entirely accurate.\n\nTherefore, option D remains the best choice. It accurately reflects Kohlberg's stage theory of moral development, highlighting the logical progression from egocentric thought to broader moral principles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
