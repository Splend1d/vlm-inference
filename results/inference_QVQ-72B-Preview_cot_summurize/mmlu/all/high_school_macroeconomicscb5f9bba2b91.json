                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about money and financial markets, and there are four options. I need to pick the one that's true. I'm not super confident with economics, but I'll try to work through this.\n\nOption A says that as the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate increases. Hmm, I thought that when demand for bonds goes up, their price goes up, and interest rates go down. Wait, is that right? Let me think. If bonds are in higher demand, people are willing to pay more for them, so the bond prices rise. And since interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions, that would mean interest rates go down. So, option A seems wrong.\n\nOption B says that for a given money supply, if nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money decreases. Okay, so velocity of money is the rate at which money circulates in the economy. There's a formula: MV = PQ, where M is money supply, V is velocity, P is price level, and Q is real GDP. Nominal GDP is P times Q. So, if nominal GDP increases and money supply (M) is constant, then V must increase to make the equation hold, right? Because M is fixed, P times Q goes up, so V has to go up too. So, option B says velocity decreases, but according to this, it should increase. So, option B is false.\n\nOption C says that when demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls. Okay, so if people are buying more stocks and bonds, that means they're shifting their assets from money to these financial assets. So, the demand for holding money as an asset should decrease. That makes sense. So, option C seems plausible.\n\nOption D says that a macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds. Hmm, in a recession, the economy is slowing down, businesses aren't doing as well, and people might be less likely to borrow money because they're uncertain about the future. So, I would think that the demand for loans decreases in a recession, not increases. So, option D seems false.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option C seems to be the correct answer. But just to make sure, let's recap:\n\n- Option A: Incorrect, because increasing bond demand should lead to lower interest rates, not higher.\n\n- Option B: Incorrect, because with constant money supply and increasing nominal GDP, velocity should increase, not decrease.\n\n- Option C: Correct, because increased demand for stocks and bonds typically leads to decreased demand for holding money as an asset.\n\n- Option D: Incorrect, because in a recession, demand for loans usually decreases due to economic uncertainty and slowdown.\n\nYeah, I think I've got it right. Option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
