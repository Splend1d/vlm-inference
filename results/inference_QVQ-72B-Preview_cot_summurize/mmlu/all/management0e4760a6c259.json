Team members can be recruited for their specific skills or experience.\n\nB. No overhead costs associated with physical buildings.\n\nC. Conflict can be resolved easily using face-to-face meetings.\n\nD. Low transport or commuting costs.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what is a virtual team? It's a group of people who work together but are geographically dispersed, right? They might be in different offices, different cities, or even different countries, and they collaborate using technology like email, video conferencing, and collaboration tools.\n\nNow, let's look at option A: Team members can be recruited for their specific skills or experience.\n\nThis seems like a big advantage of virtual teams. Since you're not limited by location, you can hire the best people for the job, no matter where they are. So, this should be an advantage.\n\nNext, option B: No overhead costs associated with physical buildings.\n\nWell, virtual teams often don't require a central office space. That means you save on rent, utilities, office supplies, and other expenses that come with maintaining a physical workspace. This sounds like a clear advantage in terms of cost savings.\n\nThen, option C: Conflict can be resolved easily using face-to-face meetings.\n\nHmm, this one seems a bit off. One of the challenges of virtual teams is that communication can be more difficult because team members are not in the same place. Face-to-face meetings can be tough to arrange, especially if team members are in different time zones or countries. So, actually, resolving conflicts might be harder in a virtual team setting because of the lack of face-to-face interaction.\n\nFinally, option D: Low transport or commuting costs.\n\nIn a virtual team, since people work from home or from their own locations, they don't have to commute to a central office. That means they save time and money on transportation, which is beneficial for both the employees and the employer in terms of reduced environmental impact and possibly increased productivity due to less time spent commuting.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like option C is not an advantage of a virtual team. In fact, it's more of a challenge because arranging face-to-face meetings can be difficult when team members are spread out geographically.\n\nLet me double-check this. Is there any way that virtual teams could resolve conflicts easily through face-to-face meetings?\n\nWell, some virtual teams might have occasional in-person retreats or meetings, but these are exceptions rather than the rule, especially considering the costs and logistics involved in bringing everyone together in one place.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that conflict resolution via face-to-face meetings is not an advantage of virtual teams.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
