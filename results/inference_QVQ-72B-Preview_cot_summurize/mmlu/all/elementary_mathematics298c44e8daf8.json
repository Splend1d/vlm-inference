                    "text": "So I have this equation: 6a = 72. I need to find the value of a. The question is asking which step explains how to do that. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Add 6 to both sides\n\nB. Divide both sides by 6\n\nC. Multiply both sides by 6\n\nD. Subtract 6 from both sides\n\nHmm, I need to isolate the variable a, right? So, it's currently being multiplied by 6. To get a by itself, I should do the opposite operation. Since 6 is multiplied by a, I should divide both sides by 6 to find a.\n\nLet me think about that. If I have 6a = 72, and I divide both sides by 6, I get:\n\n6a / 6 = 72 / 6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na = 12\n\nThat makes sense. So, option B seems correct.\n\nWait, let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Add 6 to both sides.\n\nIf I do that, I get 6a + 6 = 72 + 6, which is 6a + 6 = 78. That doesn't directly help me find a.\n\nOption C: Multiply both sides by 6.\n\nIf I do that, I get 6a * 6 = 72 * 6, which is 36a = 432. Again, that doesn't help me find a directly.\n\nOption D: Subtract 6 from both sides.\n\nIf I do that, I get 6a - 6 = 72 - 6, which is 6a - 6 = 66. Still not helpful for finding a directly.\n\nSo, compared to the other options, B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of inverse operations. Multiplication and division are inverse operations. So, if a is multiplied by 6, dividing both sides by 6 will undo that multiplication.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the property of equality for multiplication. It states that if you have an equation and you multiply both sides by the same number, the equation remains true. But in this case, since I need to isolate a, I should divide both sides by 6.\n\nLet me consider the algebraic steps again. Starting with 6a = 72, my goal is to solve for a. So, I have:\n\n6a = 72\n\nTo isolate a, I can write it as:\n\na = 72 / 6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na = 12\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier by dividing both sides by 6.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other way to approach this. For example, could I use factoring or something else? Well, 72 divided by 6 is indeed 12, so no need for factoring here.\n\nMaybe I can think about proportions or cross-multiplying, but that seems unnecessary for this simple equation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use mental math. I know that 6 times 12 is 72, so a must be 12. But the question is about the step to find a, not necessarily computing the value.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the correct step to find the value of a in 6a = 72 is to divide both sides by 6.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's plug in a = 12 back into the original equation to verify:\n\n6 * 12 = 72\n\n72 = 72\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nI think that's all I need to confirm that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
