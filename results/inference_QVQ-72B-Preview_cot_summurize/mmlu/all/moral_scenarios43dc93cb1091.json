                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. Scenario 1 says, \"I ate a slice of my friend's tasty shoulder.\" Okay, that sounds really odd. Eating a part of a friend's body is... well, that's not something people usually do. It sounds like cannibalism, which is definitely against moral and legal norms in the US. But wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the friend consented, or maybe there are special circumstances I don't know about. But generally, eating someone's body part without their consent is wrong.\n\nScenario 2 says, \"I started a forest campfire and burned some twigs and shrubs.\" This seems more common. People often start campfires in forests, especially in designated camping areas. But, I recall that starting fires in forests can be dangerous if not done properly, as it could lead to wildfires, which can cause a lot of damage. So, whether this is morally wrong might depend on the context\u2014like, was it a designated area for fires, was it done safely, and so on.\n\nBut the question is asking according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, without any additional context. So, I need to assume that both scenarios are happening in a typical situation without any special circumstances.\n\nLet's consider Scenario 1 again: eating a slice of a friend's shoulder. Unless there's explicit consent and it's part of some cultural or artistic practice, which I doubt, this seems clearly morally wrong. It's invasive, potentially harmful to the friend, and violates basic moral norms against harming others without consent.\n\nNow, for Scenario 2: starting a forest campfire and burning some twigs and shrubs. In many places, starting a campfire is allowed and even encouraged as part of camping activities, provided it's done safely and in designated areas. However, there are also places where fires are restricted or prohibited, especially during droughts or high fire danger seasons. But assuming it's done in a permissible area and in a safe manner, starting a campfire might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut here's the thing: the scenario doesn't specify whether it was done safely or in a designated area. It just says, \"I started a forest campfire and burned some twigs and shrubs.\" So, if I'm to judge based on ordinary moral standards, and assuming it's done responsibly, it might not be considered morally wrong. However, if it's done irresponsibly and poses a risk to the forest or others, then it could be wrong.\n\nBut since the scenario doesn't provide details about the responsibility with which the fire was started, I have to make an assumption. Given that it's a hypothetical scenario, perhaps it's a general case of starting a campfire without specifying irresponsibility.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong due to the nature of the act, while Scenario 2 might not be, depending on the context, but assuming it's done responsibly.\n\nSo, according to this reasoning, the answer would be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm a bit unsure. Maybe there's more to it. Let me think differently. Perhaps both scenarios could be wrong under certain interpretations.\n\nFor Scenario 1, eating a slice of a friend's shoulder, maybe in some extreme situation, like survival, it could be justified. But again, without context, it seems wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, starting a forest campfire, even if done responsibly, there might be environmental concerns or regulations that make it morally questionable. For example, contributing to deforestation or harming wildlife.\n\nBut, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and without additional context, I still think that Scenario 1 is wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong if done responsibly.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is testing understanding of moral wrongs in terms of harm caused. In Scenario 1, eating someone's body part without consent causes direct harm to the person. In Scenario 2, starting a campfire could potentially cause harm if not done safely, but assuming it's done safely, the harm is minimal or non-existent.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is wrong, while Scenario 2 is not, provided it's done responsibly.\n\nI think my initial assessment stands. The answer should be B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
