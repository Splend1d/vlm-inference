                    "text": "So I have this investment project to evaluate. It costs $1 million upfront, and it's supposed to give me $2 million in five years. The discount rate is 10%, and I need to find the Net Present Value (NPV) of this project. The options are $1,000,000, $300,000, $2,000,000, or $242,000.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what NPV is. NPV is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows. In this case, the initial investment is an outflow of $1 million, and the future cash inflow is $2 million in five years.\n\nSo, NPV = Present Value of Future Cash Flows - Initial Investment.\n\nI need to find the present value of that $2 million received in five years, discounted at 10%, and then subtract the $1 million initial cost.\n\nThe formula to calculate the present value (PV) of a future sum of money is:\n\nPV = FV / (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- FV is the future value, which is $2 million.\n\n- r is the discount rate, which is 10% or 0.10.\n\n- n is the number of periods, which is 5 years.\n\nSo, PV = $2,000,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, (1 + 0.10) is 1.10.\n\nThen, 1.10 raised to the power of 5 is 1.10^5.\n\nI need to compute 1.10^5.\n\n1.10^5 = 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10\n\nLet me calculate step by step:\n\n1.10^1 = 1.10\n\n1.10^2 = 1.10 * 1.10 = 1.21\n\n1.10^3 = 1.21 * 1.10 \u2248 1.331\n\n1.10^4 = 1.331 * 1.10 \u2248 1.4641\n\n1.10^5 = 1.4641 * 1.10 \u2248 1.61051\n\nSo, PV = $2,000,000 / 1.61051 \u2248 $1,242,000\n\nNow, NPV = PV - Initial Investment = $1,242,000 - $1,000,000 = $242,000\n\nLooking at the options, $242,000 is one of the choices.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 1.10^5 is indeed approximately 1.61051.\n\nThen, $2,000,000 divided by 1.61051 is approximately $1,242,000.\n\nSubtracting the initial investment of $1,000,000 gives $242,000.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for NPV directly:\n\nNPV = FV / (1 + r)^n - Initial Investment\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNPV = $2,000,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 - $1,000,000\n\nWhich again gives me $242,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be $242,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other factors I might have missed.\n\nIs there any possibility of multiple cash flows? The problem states that there's an initial investment of $1 million and a single cash inflow of $2 million in five years. So, it's a simple case with only two cash flows.\n\nAlso, the discount rate is given as 10%, which I've used directly in my calculations.\n\nI don't think I need to adjust for inflation or any other factors here, as the question is purely about NPV calculation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is $242,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{242000} \\]"
