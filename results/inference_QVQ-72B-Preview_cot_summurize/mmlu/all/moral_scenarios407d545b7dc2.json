                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are that both are wrong, only one is wrong, or neither is wrong. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I often sell used books online that I borrowed from the library.\" So, the person is selling books that they've borrowed from the library. Hmm, borrowing books from the library is usually a perfectly fine thing to do, right? But selling them... that seems a bit off. Let me think about the ownership here. When you borrow a book from the library, you're essentially renting it for a certain period, and you're supposed to return it. So, the library owns the book, not you. Selling something that doesn't belong to you seems like it could be morally wrong, and possibly even legally wrong, depending on the circumstances.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some exceptions. For example, if the library allows you to purchase books that they're getting rid of, that might be different. But in this scenario, it says \"borrowed from the library,\" which typically implies that you're supposed to return the book, not sell it. So, in that case, selling borrowed library books would be wrong because you're depriving the library of their property and potentially making money off of something that isn't yours.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"My rent was due, so I had to sell my friend's guitar without telling her.\" This one seems clearer at first glance. Selling someone else's property without their permission is generally considered wrong, both morally and legally. The fact that it's a friend's guitar makes it even more problematic because it involves a breach of trust. The person is in a bind because their rent is due, but that doesn't justify selling someone else's belongings without consent.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any mitigating factors here. Maybe the person had no other choice and was facing homelessness. Desperate situations can sometimes complicate moral judgments. But even so, most people would still consider it wrong to sell someone else's property without their knowledge, especially a close friend's valuable item like a guitar.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, it seems like the main character is doing something that is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards. Selling borrowed library books without permission and selling a friend's guitar without telling them both involve disposing of someone else's property without their consent.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Scenario 1, selling library books: is there any possibility that the library allows this under certain conditions? For instance, sometimes libraries have book sales where they sell books they no longer need, but in that case, it's the library organizing the sale, not an individual. So, if someone is selling books they've borrowed from the library, that would be taking something that isn't theirs to sell, which is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, selling a friend's guitar without telling them is pretty clearly wrong. Even if the person was in a tough spot with rent, they should have at least tried to ask the friend for permission or explore other options before resorting to that.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
