                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics problem step by step. So, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) increased from 0.75 in year 1 to 0.80 in year 2. We need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on this information.\n\nFirst, let's recall what MPC is. MPC is the proportion of additional income that a person spends on goods and services. So, if MPC is 0.75, it means that for every additional dollar of income, 75 cents are spent, and the remaining 25 cents are saved. Similarly, if MPC is 0.80, then 80 cents are spent, and 20 cents are saved.\n\nNow, the spending multiplier is an important concept here. The spending multiplier tells us how much total output increases when there's an initial increase in spending. The formula for the spending multiplier is:\n\nMultiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC)\n\nOr equivalently, Multiplier = 1 / MPS, where MPS is the marginal propensity to save.\n\nGiven that MPC increased from 0.75 to 0.80, MPS must have decreased from 0.25 to 0.20, since MPC + MPS = 1.\n\nLet's calculate the multipliers for both years.\n\nIn year 1:\n\nMPC1 = 0.75\n\nMPS1 = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n\nMultiplier1 = 1 / (1 - 0.75) = 1 / 0.25 = 4\n\nIn year 2:\n\nMPC2 = 0.80\n\nMPS2 = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20\n\nMultiplier2 = 1 / (1 - 0.80) = 1 / 0.20 = 5\n\nSo, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5 when MPC increased from 0.75 to 0.80. This makes sense because a higher MPC leads to a larger multiplier effect.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. In year 1, a $100 billion increase in government spending would have increased real output by a maximum of $75 billion.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't sound right. Using the multiplier formula, the change in real output (\u0394Y) is equal to the multiplier times the change in government spending (\u0394G):\n\n\u0394Y = Multiplier \u00d7 \u0394G\n\nIn year 1, multiplier is 4, so:\n\n\u0394Y = 4 \u00d7 $100 billion = $400 billion\n\nSo, option A is incorrect because it says $75 billion, which is less than the actual multiplier effect would suggest.\n\nB. From year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.\n\nAs we calculated, this is correct. So, option B seems to be correct.\n\nC. A given change in government spending would have had a more powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The multiplier in year 1 is 4, and in year 2 it's 5. So, for the same change in government spending, say $1 increase, the impact on total output would be $4 in year 1 and $5 in year 2. So, actually, the effect is more powerful in year 2 than in year 1. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nD. The marginal propensity to save increased from year 1 to year 2.\n\nNo, actually, MPS decreased from 0.25 to 0.20, as MPC increased from 0.75 to 0.80. So, MPS decreased, not increased. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the correct conclusion is option B: from year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nOption A: We calculated that a $100 billion increase in government spending would lead to a $400 billion increase in real output in year 1, not $75 billion. Maybe there's some confusion about the terms. Is there a possibility that the question is referring to the MPC directly, but no, it's clearly about the multiplier effect.\n\nOption B: Our calculation confirms that the multiplier increased from 4 to 5, so that's accurate.\n\nOption C: The multiplier is larger in year 2, meaning a given change in government spending has a larger effect in year 2 than in year 1, so the statement is incorrect.\n\nOption D: MPS decreased, not increased, so that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
