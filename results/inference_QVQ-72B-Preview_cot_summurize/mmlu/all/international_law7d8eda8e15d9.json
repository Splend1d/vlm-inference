Let me think through each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that sovereignty means being recognized by all other states. Hmm, that seems important, but is it the defining characteristic of sovereignty? I know that recognition by other states can be significant for a state's international standing and diplomatic relations, but I don't think it's the core definition of sovereignty. There might be states that aren't recognized by all others but still have sovereignty over their territory and affairs. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B states that sovereignty means being able to enter into treaties and join the UN. Again, these seem like outcomes or benefits of sovereignty rather than the definition itself. Being able to make treaties and join international organizations like the UN is a manifestation of being a sovereign state, but it's not the essence of sovereignty. There could be sovereign states that choose not to enter into treaties or join the UN, right? So, perhaps this isn't the most accurate definition.\n\nOption C says that sovereignty means freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference. This sounds a lot like the concept of independence and self-governance. It suggests that a sovereign state has the authority to make its own decisions regarding politics, economy, and other internal matters without being dictated to by external powers. This seems very much in line with what I understand about sovereignty. After all, if a state can't govern itself without interference, can it really be considered sovereign?\n\nOption D proposes that sovereignty means possessing the right to defend oneself. While self-defense is indeed a right of sovereign states under international law, this seems more like a right derived from sovereignty rather than the definition of sovereignty itself. All states have the right to self-defense, but that's because they are sovereign, not the other way around. So, while important, this option doesn't capture the essence of sovereignty.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts. Sovereignty is about independence and the exclusive right to govern oneself without external interference. It's about having supreme authority within one's own territory and being free to make decisions without being controlled by outside forces. Recognition by other states, the ability to enter into treaties, and the right to self-defense are all consequences or attributes of sovereignty, but they don't define it.\n\nTherefore, I believe that Option C is the correct answer. Sovereignty means freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
