                    "text": "So I have this problem here: evaluate log base 8 of 2. And there are some multiple-choice options: A. 1/4, B. 4, C. 3, D. 1/3. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a logarithm is. A logarithm is like the inverse of an exponent. So, log base b of a is the exponent you put on b to get a. In mathematical terms, if b to the power of x equals a, then log base b of a is x.\n\nSo, for log base 8 of 2, I need to find out what power I need to raise 8 to get 2. In other words, 8 to the power of x equals 2.\n\nLet me write that down: 8^x = 2.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. I know that 8 is 2 cubed, right? Because 2 times 2 times 2 is 8. So, 2^3 = 8.\n\nGiven that, if I take 8 to the power of 1/3, I should get 2. Because the cube root of 8 is 2.\n\nSo, 8^(1/3) = 2.\n\nTherefore, log base 8 of 2 is 1/3.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I have 8 raised to the power of 1/3, that's the cube root of 8, which is 2. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 1/4\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 1/3\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, but let me see if there's another way to think about this, just to be sure.\n\nI can also use logarithm properties. I know that log base b of a is equal to log base c of a divided by log base c of b, for any positive c not equal to 1.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating things. Since I already know that 8 is 2^3, and I'm looking for the exponent that when applied to 8 gives 2, I think I'm on the right track.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to express both 8 and 2 in terms of the same base. Since 8 is 2^3, I can write 8^x = (2^3)^x = 2^(3x). And I want that to equal 2^1.\n\nSo, 2^(3x) = 2^1.\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: 3x = 1.\n\nTherefore, x = 1/3.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the change of base formula to convert log base 8 of 2 into natural logarithms or common logarithms, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. 1/3.\n\nJust to make sure, let me plug in the value to verify.\n\nIf log base 8 of 2 is 1/3, then 8^(1/3) should equal 2.\n\nAnd indeed, the cube root of 8 is 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ \\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
