Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these presidents was featured on the $500 bill.\n\nFirst off, I know that U.S. currency has different presidents on different bills. For example, George Washington is on the $1 bill, Thomas Jefferson on the $2, Abraham Lincoln on the $5, Andrew Jackson on the $20, Ulysses S. Grant on the $50, and Benjamin Franklin on the $100. But what about the $500 bill? I'm not as familiar with that one.\n\nLet me think about this. I remember that some higher denomination bills were discontinued a while back because they weren't used as much anymore. Maybe the $500 bill falls into that category. But who was on it?\n\nOption A is Calvin Coolidge. He was the 30th President of the United States, serving from 1923 to 1929. He was known for his quiet demeanor and his policies during the Roaring Twenties. But I don't recall seeing his face on any currency.\n\nOption B is Andrew Jackson, who was the 7th President, serving from 1829 to 1837. He's famously on the $20 bill, so I don't think he's on the $500 bill.\n\nOption C is Aaron Burr. He was actually a Vice President, not a President. He served under Thomas Jefferson from 1801 to 1805. Since the question specifies \"who was on the $500 bill,\" and Burr wasn't a president, maybe that eliminates him.\n\nOption D is William McKinley. He was the 25th President, serving from 1897 until his assassination in 1901. He was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nSo, based on elimination, it's likely either Calvin Coolidge or William McKinley. I don't think Aaron Burr was ever on a U.S. bill, and Andrew Jackson is already on the $20 bill.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can recall which presidents were on the higher denomination bills. I think the $500 bill had William McKinley on it. Let me double-check that.\n\nI remember that the $500 bill was discontinued in 1969 due to lack of use, but it was still legal tender. If I'm correct, William McKinley was featured on that bill.\n\nJust to be sure, maybe I can think of another way to confirm this. Perhaps thinking about the sequence of presidents on the bills could help. For instance, the $100 bill has Benjamin Franklin, who wasn't a president, but a founding father. Wait, that's an exception.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern based on the order of presidents. For example, the $50 bill has Ulysses S. Grant, who was the 18th President, and the $500 bill might have a later president.\n\nBut I think the best approach is to recall that William McKinley was on the $500 bill. To make sure, perhaps I can visualize the bill or think of any images I've seen of it.\n\nYes, I think William McKinley was on the $500 bill. So, the answer should be D. William McKinley.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
