                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement isn't part of the Osman test from the case Osman v UK in 1998. The European Court established this test to impose a general positive obligation on states. There are four options, and one of them doesn't belong. Let me think through each one.\n\nFirst, option A says, \"The risk must emanate from a state agent.\" Hmm, in the Osman case, I recall that the risk was from a private individual, not directly from a state agent. Maybe this is the one that's not part of the Osman test.\n\nBut let me double-check. The Osman test is about when a state has a positive obligation to take preventive measures to protect individuals from harm, especially under Article 2 (right to life) or Article 3 (prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn Osman v UK, the court held that there must be a real and imminent risk of harm, and that the authorities knew or ought to have known of this risk. So, options B, C, and D seem to align with that.\n\nOption B mentions, \"If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm),\" which matches with what I remember about the test.\n\nOption C says, \"A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring,\" which also sounds right because the state has a duty to protect individuals.\n\nOption D states, \"A state knows or ought to have known,\" which is another key component of the test.\n\nSo, comparing these to option A, which suggests that the risk must come from a state agent, I think that's not part of the Osman test. In fact, I believe the Osman test applies regardless of whether the threat comes from a state agent or a private individual.\n\nLet me see if I can find some confirmation for this. I recall that in Osman v UK, the risk was from a private person, not a state agent. So, the test was applied in a situation where the danger was from a non-state actor.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the risk doesn't have to emanate from a state agent for the Osman test to apply. Hence, option A is likely not part of the Osman test.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there's any other possibility. Maybe there's another case or a different context where the risk has to come from a state agent for a positive obligation to arise. But I don't think that's the case. The positive obligations under Articles 2 and 3 are generally triggered by any real and imminent risk of serious harm, regardless of the source.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that option A, \"The risk must emanate from a state agent,\" is not part of the Osman test.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
