                    "text": "So I've got this number pattern here: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. And I need to figure out which rule was used to make this pattern. There are four options given, so I'll go through each one carefully.\n\nFirst, option A says to start with 0 and add 4 each time to get the next number. Let's see what that would look like:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n0 + 4 = 4\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n8 + 4 = 12\n\n12 + 4 = 16\n\n16 + 4 = 20\n\n20 + 4 = 24\n\n24 + 4 = 28\n\nSo the pattern would be: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28.\n\nBut looking at the given pattern, it starts with 5 and the numbers are 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. This doesn't match the pattern from option A. So, option A is probably not the correct rule.\n\nNext, option B suggests starting with 0 and adding 5 each time to get the next number. Let's try that:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n5 + 5 = 10\n\n10 + 5 = 15\n\n15 + 5 = 20\n\n20 + 5 = 25\n\n25 + 5 = 30\n\n30 + 5 = 35\n\nSo the pattern would be: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.\n\nAgain, comparing this to the given pattern: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. These don't match either. So, option B is likely incorrect.\n\nMoving on to option C, which says to start with 5 and add 4 each time to get the next number. Let's see:\n\nStart with 5.\n\n5 + 4 = 9\n\n9 + 4 = 13\n\n13 + 4 = 17\n\n17 + 4 = 21\n\n21 + 4 = 25\n\n25 + 4 = 29\n\n29 + 4 = 33\n\nSo the pattern would be: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33.\n\nThis matches the given pattern perfectly up to 29. So, this seems like a possible rule.\n\nFinally, option D proposes starting with 5 and adding 5 each time to get the next number. Let's check that:\n\nStart with 5.\n\n5 + 5 = 10\n\n10 + 5 = 15\n\n15 + 5 = 20\n\n20 + 5 = 25\n\n25 + 5 = 30\n\n30 + 5 = 35\n\n35 + 5 = 40\n\nSo the pattern would be: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.\n\nComparing this to the given pattern: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. These don't match, so option D is incorrect.\n\nGiven that option C matches the given pattern, I would conclude that the correct rule is to start with 5 and add 4 each time to get the next number.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the differences between consecutive numbers in the given pattern:\n\n9 - 5 = 4\n\n13 - 9 = 4\n\n17 - 13 = 4\n\n21 - 17 = 4\n\n25 - 21 = 4\n\n29 - 25 = 4\n\nSo, each number increases by 4 from the previous one. Since the first number is 5, option C is indeed the correct rule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
