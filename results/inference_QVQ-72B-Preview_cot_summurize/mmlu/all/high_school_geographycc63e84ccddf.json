                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about the urban hierarchy model where the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank in the hierarchy. The options are A. Multiplier effect, B. Rank-size rule, C. Central place theory, D. Burgess's sector model. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these best describes this relationship.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what an urban hierarchy model is. I think it's a way to categorize cities based on their size and the services they provide. So, in this model, cities are ranked based on their population or the level of services they offer.\n\nNow, the question mentions that the population is inversely proportional to the rank. That sounds like a mathematical relationship where as the rank increases, the population decreases in a specific way.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Multiplier effect. I recall that the multiplier effect is related to economics, where an initial change in spending leads to a larger change in overall economic activity. It doesn't seem directly related to the relationship between city population and rank in the urban hierarchy.\n\nOption B: Rank-size rule. This sounds promising. The rank-size rule is about the relationship between a city's population and its rank in the size distribution. It states that in a particular country or region, the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank. So, the largest city is twice as big as the second-largest, three times as big as the third-largest, and so on. That seems to match the description in the question.\n\nOption C: Central place theory. I've heard of this theory. It's about the spatial arrangement of settlements based on the services they provide. It involves a hierarchy of central places that provide different types of goods and services based on the threshold population required to support them. While it does involve an urban hierarchy, it doesn't specifically state that population is inversely proportional to rank in the same way the rank-size rule does.\n\nOption D: Burgess's sector model. I think this is a model of urban land use, suggesting that cities develop in sectors or wedges from the center outward. It's more about the internal structure of a city rather than the relationship between different cities in a hierarchy.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the rank-size rule is the one that describes a situation where a city's population is inversely proportional to its rank in the urban hierarchy. The other options don't fit as closely with this specific relationship.\n\nLet me just double-check. In the rank-size rule, if I have cities ranked from largest to smallest, the population of each city is equal to the population of the largest city divided by its rank. So, if the largest city has a population of, say, 1 million, then the second-largest should have 500,000, the third-largest 333,333, and so on. That's definitely a case of inverse proportionality between population and rank.\n\nThe central place theory, while it does involve a hierarchy, is more about the spacing and sizing of cities based on economic thresholds and consumer behavior. It doesn't prescribe a exact inverse relationship between population and rank.\n\nThe multiplier effect is entirely different, relating to economic impacts, and Burgess's sector model is about the internal spatial structure of a single city.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be B. Rank-size rule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
