                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a whiffle ball being tossed straight up, reaching its highest point, and then falling back down. The key thing here is that air resistance isn't negligible, which means I have to consider its effect on the ball's motion. There are three statements, and I need to figure out which ones are true.\n\nFirst, let's think about the motion. When the ball is tossed up, it's moving against gravity, which is pulling it down. Additionally, there's air resistance, which also acts downward since the ball is moving upward. So, both gravity and air resistance are working against the upward motion, causing the ball to slow down.\n\nStatement I says that the ball's speed is zero at the highest point. That makes sense because at the highest point, the ball momentarily stops before starting to fall back down. So, its speed should be zero there.\n\nStatement II says that the ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully. When the ball is at its highest point, it's not moving, but both gravity and air resistance are still acting on it. Gravity is always pulling downward, and air resistance, since the ball is momentarily stationary, should be zero because air resistance depends on the velocity. So, at that instant, the only force acting on the ball is gravity. That means there's an acceleration due to gravity, which is not zero. Therefore, the acceleration isn't zero at the highest point.\n\nStatement III says that the ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down. This is interesting. In the absence of air resistance, the time up and the time down would be equal because gravity is constant. However, with air resistance acting against the upward motion, it's going to make the time up longer because the ball is slowing down more quickly. On the way down, air resistance acts upward, opposing gravity, which would make the ball fall slower than it would without air resistance. So, the time down would be longer than it would be without air resistance, but compared to the time up, it's still shorter because the ball is accelerating downward due to gravity, even though air resistance is slowing it down somewhat.\n\nWait, let me think about that again. On the way up, air resistance and gravity are both acting against the motion, so the ball slows down more quickly than it would with just gravity. This means the time to reach the top is longer than it would be without air resistance. On the way down, gravity is pulling the ball down, but air resistance is acting upward, opposing the downward motion. This means the ball accelerates downward, but not as quickly as it would without air resistance. As a result, the time down is longer than it would be without air resistance. But compared to the time up, since the ball is accelerating downward, the time down should still be shorter than the time up.\n\nLet me try to put that differently. Without air resistance, time up equals time down. With air resistance, time up is increased because the ball doesn't reach as high as it would without air resistance, and time down is also increased because the ball doesn't accelerate as quickly downward due to air resistance. But since the ball doesn't reach as high, the time down should be less than the time up.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the forces more carefully. Let's see.\n\nOn the way up:\n\n- Gravity: downward\n\n- Air resistance: downward (since velocity is upward)\n\nTotal force: downward\n\nThis causes the ball to decelerate, meaning its upward velocity decreases.\n\nOn the way down:\n\n- Gravity: downward\n\n- Air resistance: upward (since velocity is downward)\n\nTotal force: downward, but less than gravity alone\n\nThis causes the ball to accelerate downward, but the acceleration is less than g because air resistance reduces the net downward force.\n\nGiven that, the time to go up is longer because the ball is decelerating more slowly due to air resistance adding to gravity, and the time to come down is shorter because air resistance reduces the net downward force, making the acceleration less than g.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nActually, with air resistance on the way up, the ball decelerates more quickly than it would with just gravity, because air resistance adds to gravity. So, it would reach the top sooner than it would without air resistance. But that seems counterintuitive. If air resistance is making it harder to go up, shouldn't it take longer to reach the top?\n\nLet me consider the equations of motion with air resistance. Air resistance is proportional to velocity, so as velocity decreases on the way up, air resistance decreases. At the top, air resistance is zero since velocity is zero.\n\nOn the way down, air resistance acts upward, opposing the downward motion, so the net force is gravity minus air resistance. As the ball speeds up, air resistance increases, reducing the net downward force.\n\nGiven that, the time to reach the top is determined by the upward velocity and the deceleration. With air resistance adding to gravity, the deceleration is greater than g, so the ball reaches zero velocity sooner than it would with just gravity. Therefore, the time up is shorter, not longer.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me see.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the forces:\n\nOn the way up:\n\n- Weight (mg) downward\n\n- Drag force (proportional to velocity, say bv) downward\n\nSo, net force = mg + bv, leading to a deceleration a = (mg + bv)/m. As velocity decreases, bv decreases, so deceleration decreases.\n\nComparing to no air resistance, where a = -g, with air resistance, a is more negative initially, meaning the ball slows down more quickly at first.\n\nThis would mean that the ball reaches the top sooner than it would without air resistance.\n\nOn the way down:\n\n- Weight (mg) downward\n\n- Drag force (bv) upward\n\nSo, net force = mg - bv, leading to acceleration a = (mg - bv)/m. As velocity increases, bv increases, so acceleration approaches g asymptotically.\n\nComparing to no air resistance, where a = g, with air resistance, a is less than g, meaning the ball accelerates downward more slowly.\n\nTherefore, the time to fall back down is longer than it would be without air resistance.\n\nBut since the time to go up is shorter with air resistance, and the time to come down is longer, but the height is less because it doesn't reach as high, it's not immediately clear which time is longer.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of symmetry.\n\nIn the absence of air resistance, the time up equals the time down because the motion is symmetrical.\n\nWith air resistance, the time up is shorter because the ball is decelerated more quickly, and the time down is longer because the ball accelerates downward more slowly due to air resistance.\n\nBut actually, since the ball doesn't reach as high with air resistance, the time down should be shorter than it would be without air resistance, but compared to the time up with air resistance, it's still longer because the ball is accelerating downward.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose there's no air resistance; the ball goes up and comes down in equal times, say t.\n\nWith air resistance, on the way up, the ball is decelerated more quickly, so it reaches the top in less time, say t_up < t.\n\nOn the way down, it accelerates downward more slowly due to air resistance, so it takes longer to come down, say t_down > t.\n\nBut since it didn't reach as high as it would without air resistance, t_down is less than it would be without air resistance, but still t_down > t_up.\n\nTherefore, the time down is longer than the time up.\n\nSo, statement III is true.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that time up is longer with air resistance because the ball is moving against both gravity and air resistance.\n\nLet me see an example.\n\nSuppose, without air resistance, the ball goes up to a height h in time t = sqrt(2h/g), and comes down in the same time.\n\nWith air resistance, the height is less than h, say h', so time down is t_down = sqrt(2h'/g), which is less than t.\n\nBut due to air resistance, time up is t_up = some value less than t because the ball is decelerated more quickly.\n\nBut since h' < h, and time down is based on h', t_down < t_up.\n\nTherefore, time down is less than time up.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nLet me try to find a formula for the time up and time down with air resistance.\n\nAssuming drag force proportional to velocity, F_d = -bv, where b is a constant.\n\nNewton's second law:\n\nm a = -mg - b v (upward direction is positive)\n\nOn the way up, v is positive, so a = -g - (b/m) v\n\nOn the way down, v is negative, so a = -g + (b/m) v\n\nThis is a differential equation, which is not easy to solve without knowing the exact form of drag.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider terminal velocity or other approximations, but that might be too complicated for this problem.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should accept that with air resistance, the time up is shorter than the time down, which would make statement III false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some cases, time up could be longer, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should look for a general principle.\n\nI recall that with air resistance, the time of ascent is shorter than the time of descent, assuming the ball doesn't reach terminal velocity.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in projectile motion with air resistance, the time of ascent is generally shorter than the time of descent because the drag force reduces the downward acceleration on the way down.\n\nBut in this case, since the motion is purely vertical, perhaps it's different.\n\nLet me consider that on the way up, the ball is decelerated by both gravity and air resistance, so it reaches the top faster than it would with just gravity.\n\nOn the way down, it's accelerated by gravity but decelerated by air resistance, so it comes down slower than it would with just gravity.\n\nTherefore, time up is shorter, and time down is longer, meaning time down is longer than time up.\n\nThus, statement III is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I & III only.\n\nBut to confirm, let's summarize:\n\n- Statement I: The ball's speed is zero at the highest point. This is true because at the highest point, the ball momentarily stops.\n\n- Statement II: The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point. This is false because only gravity acts at that point, providing a downward acceleration of g.\n\n- Statement III: The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down. This is true because with air resistance, the time up is shorter than the time down.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: I & III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
