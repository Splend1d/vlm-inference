                    "text": "So I have this problem about resistance in a conductor. The initial situation has a conductor with diameter d and length l, and its resistance is R ohms. Then, the diameter is halved and the length is doubled. I need to find out what the new resistance will be. The options are A. R \u03a9, B. 2R \u03a9, C. 4R \u03a9, and D. 8R \u03a9.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between resistance, resistivity, length, and cross-sectional area of a conductor. I remember that resistance (R) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ R = \\rho \\frac{l}{a} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the resistivity of the material,\n\n- \\(l\\) is the length of the conductor,\n\n- \\(a\\) is the cross-sectional area of the conductor.\n\nIn this problem, the material of the conductor remains the same, so \\(\\rho\\) stays constant. Initially, the resistance is R when the diameter is d and the length is l.\n\nNow, if the diameter is halved and the length is doubled, I need to find out how these changes affect the resistance.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cross-sectional area. Since the conductor is cylindrical, the cross-sectional area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\n\\[ a = \\pi \\left( \\frac{d}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\]\n\nSo, initially, the area is:\n\n\\[ a_1 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\]\n\nAfter halving the diameter, the new diameter is \\(\\frac{d}{2}\\), so the new area is:\n\n\\[ a_2 = \\frac{\\pi \\left( \\frac{d}{2} \\right)^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi \\left( \\frac{d^2}{4} \\right)}{4} = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{16} \\]\n\nSo, the new area is one-fourth of the original area because \\(\\frac{\\pi d^2}{16} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\\).\n\nNext, the length is doubled from l to 2l.\n\nNow, let's find the new resistance using the same formula:\n\n\\[ R' = \\rho \\frac{l'}{a'} = \\rho \\frac{2l}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{16}} \\]\n\nBut wait, I have the initial resistance R, which is:\n\n\\[ R = \\rho \\frac{l}{a_1} = \\rho \\frac{l}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}} = \\rho \\frac{4l}{\\pi d^2} \\]\n\nSo, I can express \\(\\rho\\) in terms of R:\n\n\\[ \\rho = R \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4l} \\]\n\nNow, plug this expression for \\(\\rho\\) into the equation for R':\n\n\\[ R' = \\rho \\frac{2l}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{16}} = \\left( R \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4l} \\right) \\times \\frac{2l \\times 16}{\\pi d^2} \\]\n\nSimplify the equation step by step:\n\nFirst, \\(\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4l} \\times \\frac{2l \\times 16}{\\pi d^2} = \\frac{\\pi d^2 \\times 2l \\times 16}{4l \\times \\pi d^2} = \\frac{32l}{4l} = 8\\)\n\nSo, R' = R \u00d7 8, which means the new resistance is 8R \u03a9.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ R = \\rho \\frac{l}{a} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ a_1 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ a_2 = \\frac{\\pi \\left( \\frac{d}{2} \\right)^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi \\frac{d^2}{4}}{4} = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{16} \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ R' = \\rho \\frac{2l}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{16}} \\]\n\nAnd since \\( R = \\rho \\frac{l}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}} = \\rho \\frac{4l}{\\pi d^2} \\), then:\n\n\\[ \\rho = R \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4l} \\]\n\nPlugging back into R':\n\n\\[ R' = \\left( R \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4l} \\right) \\times \\frac{2l \\times 16}{\\pi d^2} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ R' = R \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2 \\times 2l \\times 16}{4l \\times \\pi d^2} = R \\times \\frac{32l}{4l} = R \\times 8 = 8R \\]\n\nEverything checks out. So, the new resistance is 8R \u03a9.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how changes in diameter and length affect the resistance individually.\n\nFirst, the relationship between resistance and area: \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{a} \\), since \\( R = \\rho \\frac{l}{a} \\).\n\nGiven that area \\( a \\propto d^2 \\), then \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2} \\).\n\nSo, halving the diameter would quadruple the resistance because \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{(d/2)^2} = \\frac{4}{d^2} \\), which is four times the original resistance due to area change.\n\nAdditionally, doubling the length would double the resistance because \\( R \\propto l \\).\n\nSo, combined effect:\n\nFirst, quadruple the resistance due to diameter halving, then double it due to length doubling.\n\nThus, total multiplication factor is 4 \u00d7 2 = 8.\n\nSo, new resistance is 8R, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 8R \u03a9.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the resistance in this scenario. Since the material remains the same, resistivity \\(\\rho\\) doesn't change. The only variables are the length and the cross-sectional area, which we've accounted for.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to express the new resistance in terms of the original resistance R.\n\nInitially:\n\n\\[ R = \\rho \\frac{l}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}} = \\rho \\frac{4l}{\\pi d^2} \\]\n\nAfter changes:\n\n\\[ R' = \\rho \\frac{2l}{\\frac{\\pi (d/2)^2}{4}} = \\rho \\frac{2l}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{16}} = \\rho \\frac{32l}{\\pi d^2} \\]\n\nComparing R' to R:\n\n\\[ R' = \\left( \\rho \\frac{32l}{\\pi d^2} \\right) \\div \\left( \\rho \\frac{4l}{\\pi d^2} \\right) = \\frac{32l}{\\pi d^2} \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4l} = 8 \\]\n\nAgain, R' = 8R.\n\nThis reinforces that the correct answer is 8R \u03a9.\n\nSo, the final answer is D. 8R \u03a9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 8R\\ \\Omega} \\]"
