                    "text": "So I have this question about long-run adjustments for a small caf\u00e9, and I need to pick which option is an example of that. The options are:\n\nA. The owners switch from whole wheat to sourdough bread.\n\nB. The owners hire several part-time workers to cover the dinner shifts.\n\nC. The owners work overtime on a busy weekend.\n\nD. The owners buy the office next door, and this doubles the customer seating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a long-run adjustment is in economics. In economics, the long run is a period when all factors of production can be adjusted. Unlike the short run, where some factors are fixed, in the long run, businesses can change all their inputs, including the scale of their operations.\n\nSo, for the caf\u00e9, a long-run adjustment would involve changes that allow them to adjust their capacity or their production possibilities fully.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The owners switch from whole wheat to sourdough bread.\n\nThis seems like a change in the type of bread they use, probably to offer a different product or based on customer preference. While this is a change in production, it doesn't necessarily involve adjusting the scale of their operations or their production capacity. It's more of a product mix change rather than an adjustment in the long run.\n\nOption B: The owners hire several part-time workers to cover the dinner shifts.\n\nHiring part-time workers suggests that they are adjusting their labor input, which could be a short-run adjustment to handle increased demand during dinner shifts. However, in the long run, labor can be adjusted as well, but this seems more like a short-run response to fluctuating demand rather than a fundamental change in the business's capacity.\n\nOption C: The owners work overtime on a busy weekend.\n\nThis is similar to option B, where they are adjusting labor input to meet temporary increases in demand. Working overtime is typically a short-run measure because it's not sustainable indefinitely. It's a way to handle peaks in demand without making permanent changes to the business.\n\nOption D: The owners buy the office next door, and this doubles the customer seating.\n\nThis seems like a significant change because they are expanding their physical space, which directly increases their capacity to serve more customers. Buying the adjacent office and converting it into seating area would require investments in renovation and possibly reconfiguring the layout to accommodate more seats. This kind of change isn't easily reversible in the short term and involves a substantial commitment of resources.\n\nComparing all the options, option D appears to be the most aligned with the concept of a long-run adjustment because it involves changing the scale of the business operations by increasing its physical capacity to serve more customers. The other options involve changes in product mix or labor inputs, which are more readily adjustable and don't represent the same level of commitment or permanence as buying additional property.\n\nTherefore, I would say that option D is the best example of a long-run adjustment for the caf\u00e9 owners.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
