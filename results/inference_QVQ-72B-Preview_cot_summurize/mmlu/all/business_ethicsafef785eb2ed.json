                    "text": "So I've got this question here about different types of theories in ethics or morality. It's a bit confusing, but I'll try to work through it.\n\nThe question is:\n\n\"_______ theory can be described as a code of conduct to which all rational beings should adhere. This contrasts with ________ morality which is the code of conduct adopted by a particular group or society.\n\nA. Descriptive, Normative\n\nB. Normative, Instrumental\n\nC. Normative, Descriptive\n\nD. Ethical, Descriptive\"\n\nAlright, so the blank in the first part seems to be about a theory that proposes a universal code of conduct for all rational beings. That sounds like it's talking about a normative theory, because normative ethics deals with what people ought to do, based on moral principles that can be universal.\n\nNow, the second blank is about a code of conduct that's specific to a particular group or society. That sounds more like descriptive ethics, which describes how people actually behave and what moral codes they follow, rather than prescribing what they ought to do.\n\nSo, if I put that together, the first blank should be \"Normative\" and the second should be \"Descriptive.\" That would make the correct answer C. Normative, Descriptive.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is Descriptive, Normative. But that doesn't fit because descriptive ethics is about observing moral behaviors, not prescribing them. Normative ethics is about setting standards for moral behavior.\n\nOption B is Normative, Instrumental. Instrumental morality isn't immediately clear, but I think it might refer to instrumental ethics, which focuses on the means to achieve certain ends. That doesn't seem to fit the context of a group or society's adopted code of conduct.\n\nOption D is Ethical, Descriptive. \"Ethical\" is too broad; it just means relating to ethics in general. The first blank needs a more specific term, like \"normative.\"\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. Normative, Descriptive is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's recall what each term means:\n\n- **Normative Ethics:** This branch of moral philosophy prescribes how people ought to act, based on moral principles that can be universal.\n\n- **Descriptive Ethics:** This approach describes how people actually behave morally in society, without judging whether their behavior is right or wrong.\n\nGiven these definitions, the contrast in the question makes sense: one is about universal prescriptions for all rational beings (normative), and the other is about the specific moral codes followed by particular groups or societies (descriptive).\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The answer should be C. Normative, Descriptive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
