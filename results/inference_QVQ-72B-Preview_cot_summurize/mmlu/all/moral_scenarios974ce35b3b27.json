                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of their moral standards, at least from what I've seen in media and stuff. So, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"When I see my full refrigerator and think of those starving in the Third World, I feel glad.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit tricky. So, the person has a full fridge and instead of feeling guilty or sad about people who don't have enough to eat, they feel happy. Now, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, on one hand, it's natural to feel grateful for what you have. It's not necessarily bad to be thankful for your own well-being. But when you think about it in the context of others suffering, it might seem insensitive or self-centered.\n\nBut, from a moral standpoint, does feeling glad make you a bad person? I don't think so. Morality is often about actions, not just feelings. Unless this feeling leads to actions that harm others, like hoarding food or something, it's probably not morally wrong.\n\nPlus, everyone has different perspectives on morality. Some people might say that it's important to be compassionate and empathetic towards those who are less fortunate, and feeling glad about your own situation could be seen as lacking in empathy. But does that make it wrong? I'm not so sure.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If someone feels glad about their own prosperity while being aware of global inequality, is that wrong? Well, it might be more constructive to feel motivated to help others, but feeling glad in itself isn't necessarily immoral.\n\nMaybe it's more about what you do with that feeling. If it leads you to ignore the suffering of others and do nothing to help, then perhaps there's a moral issue there. But the scenario only mentions the feeling, not any resulting actions.\n\nSo, for now, I'll lean towards \"not wrong\" for this scenario.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I didn't board the submarine because I knew I could infect the crew.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the person didn't get on the submarine because they knew they might be carrying an infection that could make the crew sick. Is that morally wrong?\n\nFrom what I understand, preventing harm to others is generally considered morally right. So, by not boarding the submarine and potentially making others sick, this person is actually doing the right thing, right?\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person had important business on the submarine, or maybe there were measures in place to handle infections. But the scenario says they knew they could infect the crew, so probably, they made a decision to avoid that.\n\nIn the context of, say, a pandemic, it's widely accepted that you should isolate if you think you might be infectious to prevent spreading disease. So, in that case, not boarding the submarine would be the morally responsible choice.\n\nAgain, unless there's some specific circumstance I'm missing, this seems like a morally sound decision.\n\nSo, combining both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Feeling glad about one's own full refrigerator while thinking of starving people in the Third World.\n\nScenario 2: Not boarding a submarine to prevent potentially infecting the crew.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these seems to be morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm overlooking.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps there's a sense of moral obligation to feel sorrow or to take action when thinking of those in need. But feeling glad in itself isn't an action that harms anyone. It's just an emotion, and emotions are personal and can be complex.\n\nIn Scenario 2, choosing not to board the submarine to prevent potential harm to others seems like a considerate and morally upright decision.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
