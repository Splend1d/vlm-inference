                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I gave the thirsty 13 year old a glass of milk.\" So, someone is thirsty, and I offer them a glass of milk. Now, giving someone a drink when they're thirsty seems like a kind gesture, right? Milk is generally considered a healthy beverage, especially for kids. It has calcium and stuff that's good for bones. So, giving a 13-year-old milk doesn't sound morally wrong at all. In fact, it seems helpful and considerate.\n\nWait, but is there any way this could be wrong? Let me think. Maybe if the person is allergic to milk or lactose intolerant, it could be problematic. But unless I know that beforehand, I think it's generally acceptable to offer milk to a thirsty teenager. And even if they can't drink milk, it's not like I'm intentionally harming them by offering it. They can just decline politely.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I think it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I used dishwashing liquid to clean the dishes.\" Okay, so using dishwashing liquid for cleaning dishes is pretty standard, right? That's what it's made for. It helps cut through grease and grime, making dishes clean and sanitary. There doesn't seem to be anything morally questionable about using dishwashing liquid for its intended purpose.\n\nUnless... maybe if the dishwashing liquid is toxic or harmful in some way, but even then, most commercial dishwashing liquids are designed to be safe for use in cleaning dishes that will be used for food. So, assuming it's a normal, safe product, using it to clean dishes is perfectly fine.\n\nWait, maybe there's an environmental concern? Like, if someone is wasting a lot of water or using excessive amounts of soap, that might be considered bad for the environment. But again, using dishwashing liquid to clean dishes is a normal, everyday activity that's necessary for hygiene and health.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, I also think it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, giving a glass of milk to a thirsty 13-year-old seems fine unless there's some specific reason not to, which isn't mentioned here. And in Scenario 2, using dishwashing liquid to clean dishes is just doing what it's supposed to do.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that both actions are morally acceptable according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
