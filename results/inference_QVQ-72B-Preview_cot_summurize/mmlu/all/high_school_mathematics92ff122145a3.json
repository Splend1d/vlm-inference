We need to reflect this pentagon over the line y = x to get a new pentagon P', and then find which of the given options is one of its vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to reflect a point over the line y = x. I recall that reflecting a point (a, b) over the line y = x results in the point (b, a). That's because y = x is the line where the x and y coordinates are equal, and reflecting over this line swaps the coordinates.\n\nSo, if I have a point (x, y), its reflection over y = x will be (y, x). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's apply this to each of the pentagon P's vertices:\n\n1. (-2, -4) reflects to (-4, -2)\n\n2. (-4, 1) reflects to (1, -4)\n\n3. (-1, 4) reflects to (4, -1)\n\n4. (2, 4) reflects to (4, 2)\n\n5. (3, 0) reflects to (0, 3)\n\nSo, the vertices of P' should be (-4, -2), (1, -4), (4, -1), (4, 2), and (0, 3).\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. (0, \u20133)\n\nB. (4, 1)\n\nC. (2, 2)\n\nD. (\u20134, \u20132)\n\nFrom my calculations, one of the vertices of P' is (-4, -2), which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut the question says \"one of the vertices of P' is...\" and lists these four options. Since (-4, -2) is indeed one of the vertices, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but options A, B, and C are not matching with my calculated vertices. Is there a possibility that I missed something?\n\nLet me double-check the reflection process. Maybe there's a property or formula I'm misremembering.\n\nI know that the reflection of a point (a, b) over the line y = x is indeed (b, a). This is because y = x is the line where x and y coordinates are equal, and reflecting over this line swaps the coordinates.\n\nLet me verify this with a single point. Take (-2, -4). Reflecting over y = x should give (-4, -2), which makes sense because we're swapping x and y.\n\nSimilarly, (3, 0) reflects to (0, 3), which also aligns with swapping coordinates.\n\nSo, my initial calculations seem correct. Therefore, among the given options, D. (-4, -2) is indeed one of the vertices of P'.\n\nBut the question says \"one of the vertices of P' is\", and lists A. (0, \u20133), B. (4, 1), C. (2, 2), D. (\u20134, \u20132). According to my calculations, D is correct.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any trick or additional step I'm missing. Maybe checking the general properties of reflection over y = x.\n\nI recall that reflecting over y = x can also be thought of as applying the inverse function, since y = x is the graph of the identity function. But I don't think that changes anything here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem, like using matrices for reflection transformations. Let's think about that.\n\nThe reflection over the line y = x can be represented by the matrix that swaps x and y coordinates. In matrix form, this would be:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, multiplying the coordinate matrix of the pentagon by this reflection matrix should give the coordinates of P'.\n\nLet's represent the coordinates of pentagon P as a matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & -4 & -1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n-4 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by the reflection matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & -4 & -1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n-4 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-4 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n-2 & -4 & -1 & 2 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the reflected coordinates are indeed (-4, -2), (1, -4), (4, -1), (4, 2), and (0, 3), which matches my earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, the vertex (-4, -2) is correctly identified as one of the vertices of P'.\n\nBut the question mentions \"the pentagon P with vertices at (-2, -4), (-4, 1), (-1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 0) is reflected across the line y = x to get a new pentagon, P', then one of the vertices of P' is\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. (0, \u20133)\n\nB. (4, 1)\n\nC. (2, 2)\n\nD. (\u20134, \u20132)\n\nFrom my calculations, D. (-4, -2) is correct.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the question or the options provided. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach or property I should consider.\n\nLet me think about the properties of reflections again. When reflecting over y = x, not only do the coordinates swap, but also the orientation of the figure changes. However, that might not affect the coordinates directly.\n\nAnother way to think about reflection over y = x is that for any point (a, b), its reflection is (b, a), as established.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the general formula for reflecting a point over the line y = x, it should still be the same as swapping coordinates.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and my initial conclusion remains that D. (-4, -2) is the correct answer.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from misreading the options or misunderstanding the reflection process, but based on standard geometric transformations, D should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
