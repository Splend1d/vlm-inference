                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Lorenz Curve, and I need to figure out what it's used to measure. The options are:\n\nA. The ratio of income to wealth in different countries.\n\nB. The ratio of public goods to private goods in different countries.\n\nC. The ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries.\n\nD. The ratio of the working poor to the non-working poor.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what the Lorenz Curve is. I remember that it's a graphical representation that shows the distribution of income or wealth in a population. It was developed by Max Lorenz in 1905.\n\nSo, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The ratio of income to wealth in different countries.\n\nHmm, the Lorenz Curve is primarily used to depict the distribution of income or wealth, but not directly the ratio of income to wealth. It's more about showing how much of the total income or wealth is held by different portions of the population. So, I don't think this is the main purpose of the Lorenz Curve.\n\nOption B: The ratio of public goods to private goods in different countries.\n\nThis seems unrelated to the Lorenz Curve. The Lorenz Curve is about income or wealth distribution, not about the types of goods a country produces or consumes. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C: The ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries.\n\nThis sounds promising. The Lorenz Curve is indeed used to illustrate income or wealth inequality. It compares the actual distribution to a perfectly equal distribution, and the deviation from the perfect equality line indicates the degree of inequality. So, it's essentially measuring income inequality, which could be considered as the ratio of inequality to equality.\n\nOption D: The ratio of the working poor to the non-working poor.\n\nAgain, the Lorenz Curve doesn't distinguish between working and non-working poor. It just shows the distribution of income or wealth across different segments of the population, regardless of their employment status.\n\nSo, based on this, Option C seems to be the most accurate answer. The Lorenz Curve is used to measure the ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI recall that the Lorenz Curve plots the cumulative percentage of the population against the cumulative percentage of income or wealth they hold. The closer the curve is to the line of perfect equality, the more equal the distribution. The further it deviates, the greater the inequality.\n\nSo, in that sense, it's directly measuring income or wealth inequality, which aligns with Option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be correct.\n\nOption A: While the Lorenz Curve can be used to show income or wealth distribution, it doesn't directly compare income to wealth. It's possible to have separate Lorenz Curves for income and wealth, but the curve itself doesn't provide a ratio of income to wealth.\n\nOption B: As I thought earlier, the Lorenz Curve isn't designed to compare public and private goods. That seems like a different economic analysis.\n\nOption D: The Lorenz Curve doesn't differentiate between working and non-working poor; it just shows the distribution of income or wealth across the population.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I'm confident that Option C is the correct answer. The Lorenz Curve is used to measure the ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
