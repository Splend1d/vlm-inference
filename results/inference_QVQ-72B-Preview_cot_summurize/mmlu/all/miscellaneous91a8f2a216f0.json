Proportion of sand, silt, and clay\n\nC. Organic composition\n\nD. Profile depth\n\nThe correct answer should be A. Arrangement of soil particles.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I understand what soil structure really is.\n\nSoil structure is defined by how individual soil particles group together to form aggregates or peds. These aggregates can be blocky, platy, crumbly, etc., depending on factors like the presence of organic matter, clay content, and the way water and air interact within the soil.\n\nOption B, proportion of sand, silt, and clay, actually refers to soil texture. Texture is about the size distribution of the mineral particles in the soil.\n\nOption C, organic composition, relates to the amount and type of organic matter in the soil, which can influence soil structure but isn't the same as soil structure itself.\n\nOption D, profile depth, refers to the layers or horizons within the soil profile, which can include the O (organic), A (topsoil), B (subsoil), and C (parent material) horizons. While these layers do relate to the arrangement of materials in the soil, the term \"soil structure\" is more specifically about the arrangement of particles within these horizons rather than the horizons themselves.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate definition of soil structure among the given options is indeed option A: arrangement of soil particles.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation.\n\nFor example, could \"profile depth\" be considered a aspect of soil structure? While the profile depth does influence how the soil functions, soil structure is more about the spatial arrangement and bonding of soil particles, which can affect properties like permeability, aeration, and root growth.\n\nSimilarly, organic composition is crucial for soil health and can influence structure, but it's not the same as the structure itself.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
