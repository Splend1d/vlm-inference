                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about orbital resonances in the solar system. It's asking which statement is not true, and there are four options: A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which one doesn't align with the facts about planetary orbits and resonances.\n\nStarting with option A: \"The Earth and Venus are in a 1:1 orbital resonance (for every 1 Earth orbit there is exactly 1 Venus orbit).\" Hmm, that seems a bit off. I know that Venus orbits the Sun faster than Earth does, but I don't think their orbital periods are the same. Let me recall: Earth takes about 365 days to orbit the Sun, and Venus takes about 225 days. So, for every one Earth orbit, Venus has already made more than one orbit. Therefore, they're not in a 1:1 resonance. Maybe it's a different ratio.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"for every 1 Earth orbit there is exactly 1 Venus orbit.\" That can't be right, because Venus orbits faster. So, this seems like it could be the incorrect statement. But let me check the others to be sure.\n\nOption B: \"Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 orbital resonance (for every 3 Neptune orbits there are exactly 2 Pluto orbits).\" I've heard of this before. Pluto is a dwarf planet that's way out there, and Neptune is the eighth planet. I think Pluto's orbit is tilted and elliptical, but because of this resonance, they don't collide. Let me confirm: Neptune orbits the Sun once every about 165 Earth years, and Pluto every about 248 Earth years. So, 248 divided by 165 is approximately 1.5, which would make sense for a 3:2 resonance. That is, 3 orbits of Neptune take about the same time as 2 orbits of Pluto. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"The Kirkwood Gaps in the asteroid belt are due to resonances with Jupiter.\" I've come across this before. The asteroid belt is between Mars and Jupiter, and Jupiter's gravity affects the orbits of asteroids. Kirkwood Gaps are regions in the asteroid belt that have fewer asteroids than expected, and these gaps correspond to orbital resonances with Jupiter. For example, there might be gaps at distances where asteroids would orbit the Sun in simple fractions of Jupiter's orbital period, like half or one-third. So, this seems accurate.\n\nOption D: \"Neptune and Pluto won't collide because of their orbital resonance.\" This relates back to option B. Since Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 resonance, their orbits are synchronized in such a way that they never come close enough to collide. Their orbital paths are arranged so that when one is at a certain point, the other is elsewhere, avoiding a direct hit. So, this should be true.\n\nGiven all that, it seems like option A is the incorrect one. Earth and Venus do not have a 1:1 orbital resonance; in fact, their orbital periods are different, with Venus orbiting faster than Earth. So, for every Earth orbit, Venus has completed more than one orbit, not exactly one.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the orbital periods:\n\n- Earth: approximately 365.25 days\n\n- Venus: approximately 224.7 days\n\nSo, the ratio is about 224.7 / 365.25 \u2248 0.615, which is not 1:1. The actual resonance between Venus and Earth is more like 8:13 or something like that, but not 1:1.\n\nTherefore, option A is not true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
