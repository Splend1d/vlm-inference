                    "text": "I'm here to tackle these two statements about rings, subrings, fields, and integral domains. It's been a while since I've dug into abstract algebra, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring.\"\n\nOkay, so first things first, what's a subring? A subring is a subset of a ring that itself forms a ring under the same operations as the original ring. And a unity, or multiplicative identity, is an element that, when multiplied by any element of the ring, leaves that element unchanged. So, for a ring R, there's an element 1_R in R such that for any a in R, 1_R * a = a * 1_R = a.\n\nNow, the question is whether the unity of a subring S of R must be the same as 1_R. My initial thought is that it should be, because if S is a subring of R, it should contain the multiplicative identity of R. But let me think carefully.\n\nSuppose R is a ring with unity 1_R, and S is a subring of R. By definition, S must contain the additive identity of R, but what about the multiplicative identity? Is it necessarily contained in S?\n\nLet me consider an example. Take R = integers, Z, with the usual addition and multiplication, and unity 1. Now, consider S = even integers, 2Z. Is this a subring? Well, it's closed under addition and subtraction, but does it contain the multiplicative identity of Z? No, because 1 isn't even. So, in this case, S doesn't contain 1_R, but is it still a subring?\n\nWait a minute, actually, in this case, S doesn't contain 1, but it's still a subring because it's closed under the operations. But in this case, S doesn't have a multiplicative identity, because there's no element in 2Z that, when multiplied by any other element, gives that element back. So, in this subring, there isn't a unity.\n\nBut the statement says \"the unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring.\" In this example, S doesn't even have a unity, so it can't be the same as R's unity. That seems like a counterexample, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check another source or think differently. Perhaps in some contexts, when we talk about subrings, we assume they contain the unity of the original ring. But I don't think that's universally true. There's a concept of a \"unital subring,\" which does contain the unity, but generally, a subring doesn't have to contain the multiplicative identity.\n\nSo, based on this, Statement 1 seems to be false because there are subrings that don't contain the unity of the ring, like the even integers in the integers.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"Every field is an integral domain.\"\n\nAlright, let's recall what a field and an integral domain are.\n\nA field is a commutative ring with unity where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. So, in a field, you can divide by any nonzero element.\n\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors. That is, if a and b are elements of the ring and a*b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.\n\nSo, a field is an integral domain because:\n\n1. It's commutative (since multiplication in a field is commutative).\n\n2. It has a unity.\n\n3. It has no zero divisors: if a and b are elements of a field and a*b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0. This is because if a != 0, it has an inverse, so multiplying both sides by a's inverse gives b = 0, and similarly if b != 0.\n\nTherefore, every field satisfies the definition of an integral domain.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStatement 1: False (as shown by the subring of even integers in the integers, which doesn't contain the unity).\n\nStatement 2: True (since fields are integral domains by definition).\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. False, True.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nFor Statement 1, another perspective: in ring theory, a subring must contain the unity of the original ring if the original ring has one. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Actually, some authors require subrings to contain the unity, but in general, a subring is just a subset that forms a ring under the same operations, and it may or may not contain the unity of the original ring.\n\nTo be precise, in the standard definition, a subring doesn't necessarily have to contain the unity of the ring. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nFor Statement 2, it's well-established that every field is an integral domain. So, yes, that's true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
