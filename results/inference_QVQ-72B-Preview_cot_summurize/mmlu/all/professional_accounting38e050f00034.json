                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a CPA who prepared some income tax returns for a client. After the client signs and mails the returns, the CPA finds an error. And the question is, according to Treasury Circular 230, what must the CPA do?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what Treasury Circular 230 is. I believe it's a set of regulations that governs the behavior of tax professionals who practice before the IRS. So, it's like a code of conduct for CPAs and other tax preparers when they're dealing with tax matters.\n\nNow, in this situation, the CPA has discovered an error after the returns have been signed and mailed. That means the returns are already submitted to the IRS. So, the question is, what are the CPA's obligations at this point?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Document the error in the workpapers.\n\nB. Prepare an amended return within 30 days of the discovery of the error.\n\nC. Promptly advise the client of the error.\n\nD. Promptly resign from the engagement and cooperate with the successor accountant.\n\nHmm, let's think about each one.\n\nOption A: Document the error in the workpapers. Well, keeping good records is always important for CPAs, both for their own reference and for potential audits or reviews. So, documenting the error makes sense from a record-keeping perspective. But is this the primary action required by Treasury Circular 230 in this scenario?\n\nOption B: Prepare an amended return within 30 days of the discovery of the error. This seems like a direct response to finding an error in a previously filed return. Amending the return to correct the error would be a way to fix the mistake and ensure that the IRS has accurate information. However, I need to check if Treasury Circular 230 specifically requires amending the return within a certain timeframe.\n\nOption C: Promptly advise the client of the error. This seems like a responsible action. The client has signed and mailed the returns, but there's an error. The CPA should probably inform the client about this mistake, especially since it could affect the client's tax liabilities or refunds. The client has a right to know, and it's good practice to maintain transparency in the client relationship.\n\nOption D: Promptly resign from the engagement and cooperate with the successor accountant. This seems a bit drastic. Resigning from the engagement might be necessary in some circumstances, like if there's a fundamental disagreement with the client or if continuing would compromise the CPA's independence or integrity. But in this case, an error was made in a return that has already been filed. Resigning doesn't directly address the error or help correct it.\n\nLet me consider this more carefully. If the CPA resigns, what happens to the error? It still exists, and it needs to be corrected. So, cooperating with the successor accountant might be part of the process, but it doesn't directly solve the problem of the erroneous return that's already been filed.\n\nI think the most straightforward and immediate action required by Treasury Circular 230 in this situation is to inform the client about the error. After all, the client is the one who could be affected by the mistake. Plus, it's ethical to be honest with the client about any errors made in the course of professional services.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps after informing the client, the CPA is also required to take steps to correct the error, such as preparing an amended return. However, I need to check if Treasury Circular 230 specifies that the CPA must prepare the amended return or if that's something the client chooses to do.\n\nI recall that Treasury Circular 230 imposes duties on practitioners to exercise due diligence and to avoid preparing returns that are incorrect. But what specifically does it say about correcting errors discovered after the return has been filed?\n\nLet me try to recall or look up the relevant sections of Treasury Circular 230. I know that Treasury Circular 230 is officially titled \"Regulations Governing Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service.\" It covers various aspects of tax practice, including the conduct of practitioners and their responsibilities.\n\nIn particular, I think Section 10.33 of Treasury Circular 230 addresses the discovery of errors or omissions in returns or documents filed with the IRS. Let me see if I can recall the exact requirements.\n\nI think Section 10.33 requires practitioners to take reasonable steps to remedy any errors or omissions they discover in returns or documents they have prepared and signed. This would likely involve informing the client and possibly preparing an amended return to correct the error.\n\nWait, but the question specifies that the CPA prepared the returns, the client signed and mailed them, and then the CPA discovered an error. So, the CPA is the one who prepared the returns, and now has found an error in them.\n\nGiven that, I would think that the CPA has an obligation to inform the client immediately about the error, so that they can discuss the best course of action, which might include filing an amended return.\n\nBut does Treasury Circular 230 specifically require the CPA to prepare the amended return, or just to inform the client of the error?\n\nI think the primary requirement is to inform the client promptly. After all, the client is the one who owns the tax return, and they should be the one to decide whether to file an amended return or not. The CPA can advise on the implications of the error and recommend amending the return, but the final decision rests with the client.\n\nHowever, if the CPA is continuing to work with the client, it would be reasonable for them to prepare the amended return as part of their services. But again, the initial step should be to inform the client about the error.\n\nConsidering all this, option C\u2014promptly advise the client of the error\u2014seems to be the most directly required action under Treasury Circular 230.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Document the error in the workpapers. While this is good practice for record-keeping and may be necessary for the CPA's internal quality control, it doesn't directly address the issue of the erroneous return that has been filed.\n\nOption B: Prepare an amended return within 30 days of the discovery of the error. While amending the return is a way to correct the error, I don't recall Treasury Circular 230 specifying a timeframe for doing so. Moreover, it's the client's decision to file an amended return, not the CPA's. So, while the CPA may recommend and prepare an amended return, they can't unilaterally decide to file one without the client's consent.\n\nOption D: Promptly resign from the engagement and cooperate with the successor accountant. This seems excessive for simply discovering an error in a previously filed return. Resigning from the engagement might be necessary in some circumstances, but it's not the primary action required upon discovering an error in a return that has already been filed.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option C: promptly advise the client of the error.\n\nTo summarize, under Treasury Circular 230, when a CPA discovers an error in a tax return that has already been signed and mailed by the client, the CPA must promptly inform the client about the error. This ensures that the client is aware of the issue and can make an informed decision about whether to amend the return or take other appropriate actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
