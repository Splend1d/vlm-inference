                    "text": "Let's dive into this real estate law problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, there's a seller and a buyer who signed a contract for improved real property. The contract had a financing contingency for a certain percentage of the purchase price. The buyer got the necessary financing from a bank. At closing, the buyer signed a note to the seller for part of the purchase price, and this note wasn't secured by a mortgage. Then, the buyer signed another note to the bank, secured by a mortgage, and used the loan proceeds to pay for the property. The bank knew about the prior note to the seller. The bank recorded its mortgage right away. Now, the buyer is defaulting on both notes, and there's no applicable statute. The question is, who has priority\u2014the bank or the seller?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events and the nature of each obligation.\n\n1. **Contract Signing:** Seller and buyer agree on terms, including a financing contingency.\n\n2. **Financing Obtained:** Buyer gets a loan from the bank to meet the financing contingency.\n\n3. **Closing:**\n\n- Buyer signs a note to the seller for a portion of the purchase price. This note isn't secured by a mortgage.\n\n- Buyer signs a second note to the bank, secured by a mortgage on the property, and uses the loan proceeds to pay for the property.\n\n4. **Recording:** The bank records its mortgage promptly.\n\n5. **Default:** Buyer defaults on both notes.\n\nNow, let's consider the interests involved:\n\n- **Seller's Interest:** The seller has a note from the buyer for a portion of the purchase price, unsecured.\n\n- **Bank's Interest:** The bank has a secured note with a mortgage on the property.\n\nThere are a few key points to consider:\n\n- **Financing Contingency:** The contract had a financing contingency, which the buyer satisfied by obtaining the bank loan.\n\n- **Knowledge of the Bank:** The bank knew about the seller's prior note.\n\n- **Recording of the Mortgage:** The bank recorded its mortgage promptly.\n\nI need to determine the priority of these interests, especially since the buyer is in default on both notes.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n**Option A:** The bank has priority because its loan satisfied the financing contingency in the contract of sale.\n\n- While the bank's loan did satisfy the financing contingency, this alone doesn't necessarily give it priority over other interests. The financing contingency is more about whether the buyer can proceed with the purchase, not about the priority of interests in the property.\n\n**Option B:** The bank has priority because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.\n\n- A purchase money mortgage is a mortgage used to buy the property. These mortgages often have specific priority rules. In many jurisdictions, a purchase money mortgage has priority over certain other liens, but this isn't universally true.\n\n- However, in this case, the seller already had a note from the buyer before the bank's mortgage was recorded. The seller's interest is unsecured, but the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.\n\n**Option C:** The seller has priority because the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.\n\n- The fact that the bank knew about the seller's note might affect the priority, depending on the jurisdiction's laws on notice.\n\n- In some jurisdictions, if a subsequent lender has actual knowledge of a prior unrecorded interest, that lender may be bound by that interest despite not recording it.\n\n- However, the seller's interest is unsecured, which typically means it doesn't have the same priority as a secured interest.\n\n**Option D:** The seller has priority because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.\n\n- A vendor's lien is a lien retained by a seller for the purchase price of goods or services. In real estate, this could refer to a purchase money lien or some other type of lien retained by the seller.\n\n- However, in this scenario, the seller accepted a note from the buyer, which suggests that no formal lien was retained. The note is unsecured, meaning there's no specific security interest in the property.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think about it differently.\n\nIn real estate transactions, the general rule is \"first in time, first in right,\" meaning whoever records their interest first generally has priority. However, this can be influenced by actual knowledge or other equitable considerations.\n\nHere, the bank recorded its mortgage promptly, which would typically give it priority over subsequent interests. But, the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's prior note.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if a subsequent mortgagee has actual knowledge of an unrecorded interest, they may be equitably subordinated to that interest, even if they recorded their mortgage first.\n\nHowever, the seller's interest is unsecured, which puts it in a weaker position compared to the bank's secured interest.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the seller has any implied security interest or lien on the property for the note. If the seller didn't take any steps to secure the note with a mortgage or other lien, it's likely that the note remains unsecured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an argument that the seller has an equitable lien on the property for the amount of the note, especially since the bank had knowledge of the note.\n\nBut, generally, in real estate law, to have a secured interest, there needs to be a formal security instrument like a mortgage.\n\nGiven that the seller didn't secure the note with a mortgage, and the bank recorded its mortgage promptly with actual knowledge of the seller's note, the priority might still favor the bank because of the recorded mortgage.\n\nHowever, the bank's knowledge of the seller's prior note could affect its priority in some jurisdictions.\n\nLet me consider if there's any doctrine that might give the seller priority in this scenario.\n\nOne possibility is the doctrine of equitable subordination, where a court might subrogate the bank's interest behind the seller's interest due to the bank's knowledge of the seller's prior claim.\n\nBut, equitable subordination is typically used in cases where there's some wrongdoing or inequitable conduct by the party whose interest is being subordinated.\n\nIn this case, the bank had knowledge of the seller's note but still proceeded to take a mortgage on the property. Is that enough to subrogate their interest?\n\nIt's possible, but not certain. The bank did record its mortgage promptly, which is a standard practice to protect its interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the seller has a purchase money lien or some other type of statutory lien that gives them priority over the bank's mortgage.\n\nBut the problem states there is no applicable statute, so that rules out statutory liens.\n\nAnother angle: since the seller's note was executed before the bank's mortgage, and the bank had knowledge of it, perhaps the seller can argue that the bank's mortgage is subject to the seller's unsecured note.\n\nHowever, generally, recording provides priority, and since the bank recorded its mortgage, it should have priority over the seller's unsecured note.\n\nUnless, of course, there's a specific exception for purchase money mortgages or some equitable principle that applies here.\n\nWait a minute, the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage because it was used to purchase the property.\n\nPurchase money mortgages sometimes have special priority rules. For example, in some jurisdictions, purchase money mortgages have priority over certain other liens that were attached before the mortgage was recorded.\n\nBut in this case, the seller's interest is an unsecured note, not a lien.\n\nSo, perhaps the bank's purchase money mortgage has priority over the seller's unsecured note.\n\nMoreover, the bank recorded its mortgage promptly, which typically protects its interest against subsequent liens or interests.\n\nTherefore, despite the bank's knowledge of the seller's note, its recorded purchase money mortgage should have priority.\n\nBut let's consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose the seller argues that the bank's mortgage is invalid because it was recorded after the seller's note was executed.\n\nHowever, recording is generally about protecting the mortgagee against subsequent liens or interests, not about the priority between the mortgage and pre-existing unrecorded interests.\n\nGiven that, the bank's recorded mortgage should take priority over the seller's unsecured note.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the seller can argue that the bank's knowledge of the seller's note means that the bank's mortgage is subject to the seller's interest.\n\nBut, again, since the seller's interest is unsecured, it's unclear how that would affect the priority.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the seller has an implied security interest in the property for the amount of the note.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch, especially since the note was explicitly not secured by a mortgage.\n\nIf the seller wanted a security interest, they should have taken steps to secure the note with a mortgage or another type of lien.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the bank has the\u4f18\u5148\u6743 because of its recorded purchase money mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: The bank has priority because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
