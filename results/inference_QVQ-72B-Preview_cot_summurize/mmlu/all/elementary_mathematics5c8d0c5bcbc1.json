                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a student has 3 puzzles, and each puzzle has 1,250 pieces. I need to find out the total number of pieces in all the puzzles combined. Okay, let's see.\n\nWell, it seems pretty straightforward. If one puzzle has 1,250 pieces, then three puzzles would have three times that amount. So, I guess I just need to multiply 1,250 by 3.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal pieces = 1,250 \u00d7 3\n\nHmm, multiplying by 3 seems right. But let me think about it again to make sure. Each puzzle is independent, so for each puzzle, there are 1,250 pieces. So, for three puzzles, it should be 1,250 plus 1,250 plus 1,250.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, adding 1,250 three times would give me the total number of pieces.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about multiplying 1,250 by 3 directly.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe breaking down the numbers to make the multiplication easier.\n\nFor instance, 1,250 is the same as 1,250 = 1,000 + 250. So, maybe I can distribute the multiplication:\n\nTotal pieces = (1,000 + 250) \u00d7 3\n\nThen, using the distributive property:\n\nTotal pieces = (1,000 \u00d7 3) + (250 \u00d7 3)\n\nThat would be 3,000 plus 750.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3,000 + 750 equals 3,750.\n\nOh, so the answer is 3,750.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I'll try the multiplication directly.\n\n1,250 \u00d7 3.\n\nFirst, 1,250 times 2 is 2,500, and then adding another 1,250 makes 3,750.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider 1,250 as 125 tens, because 1,250 divided by 10 is 125.\n\nSo, 125 tens times 3 would be 375 tens, which is 3,750.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nSuppose I think about it in terms of dollars. If one puzzle costs $1,250, then three puzzles would cost 3 times $1,250, which is $3,750.\n\nYeah, that makes sense too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of place value.\n\n1,250 is the same as 1,000 + 250, as I did before.\n\nMultiplying each part by 3:\n\n1,000 \u00d7 3 = 3,000\n\n250 \u00d7 3 = 750\n\nAdding them up gives 3,750.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. It seems consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that the correct answer is 3,750.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 3,650\n\nB. 3,750\n\nC. 4,650\n\nD. 4,750\n\nSo, option B is 3,750, which matches my calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A is 3,650. That's 100 less than 3,750. Maybe someone misadded or miscalculated somewhere, but I don't see a logical reason for that.\n\nOption C is 4,650, which is 900 more than 3,750. That might be if someone mistakenly multiplied 1,250 by 4 and subtracted something, but it doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D is 4,750, which is 1,000 more than 3,750. Perhaps if someone added an extra 1,000 somewhere, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is B. 3,750.\n\nI think that's it. I've checked and double-checked, and I'm satisfied with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3750} \\]"
