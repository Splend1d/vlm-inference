                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether these two scenarios are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I chased my sister when we were playing tag.\"\n\nOkay, so playing tag is a game where you chase each other, right? It's like a fun activity kids do where one person is \"it\" and they try to tag another player. So, chasing your sister in this context seems like a normal part of the game. It's not like I'm hurting her or anything; it's just playfulness.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something I'm missing. Is there any way that chasing my sister could be considered morally wrong? Well, if I was chasing her to hurt her or if it was not part of a game, that might be different. But in this scenario, it's specified that they were playing tag, so I think it's safe to assume it's just playful chasing.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I would say \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I took a bowl from the ancient ruins.\"\n\nHmm, this seems trickier. Ancient ruins are usually historical sites, and taking things from there is probably not okay. I think there are laws against taking artifacts from historical sites because they are important for preserving history and culture.\n\nAlso, morally, it feels wrong to take something that doesn't belong to me, especially if it's part of a heritage site or something that has significance to a community or to history in general.\n\nSo, in this case, I would say \"Wrong.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which is option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's some context I'm missing. For example, perhaps the bowl was just sitting there, and I thought it was abandoned. But even then, in ancient ruins, everything is considered part of the historical record, so it's still not okay to take it.\n\nOr maybe the ruins are in a place where taking small items is permitted. But that seems unlikely; generally, taking anything from ancient ruins is frowned upon and often illegal.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
