                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out the strongest argument for the assistant to remove the barriers that the neighbor put up, blocking access to the assistant's property. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a chef who owns a summer cottage on the lake. To make it easier to get to the cottage, the chef makes an agreement with a neighbor who owns land next door. The neighbor agrees, in writing, to give the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land that's 30 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long, along the eastern edge of the neighbor's property.\n\nSo, this sounds like an easement, right? An easement is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. In this case, it's for access to the chef's cottage via a road.\n\nThe chef then improves the road by asphaltizing it without telling the neighbor. This is interesting because generally, modifying an easement might require consent from the servient tenement owner, which is the neighbor in this case. But since the chef didn't notify the neighbor, maybe there are implications there.\n\nSeveral years later, the neighbor starts a sand business that involves heavy hauling, which ends up destroying the asphalt on the road. So, the improvements made by the chef are ruined by the neighbor's activities.\n\nTen years after the sand business starts, the chef sells his lakefront property to his assistant. So, now the assistant owns the cottage and the property.\n\nShortly after the assistant takes possession, the neighbor puts up wooden barriers across the roadway, blocking access to the assistant's property. So, the assistant is trying to get these barriers removed.\n\nNow, the question is about the assistant's strongest argument in an action against the neighbor to remove the barriers. The options are:\n\nA. An easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.\n\nB. The assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.\n\nC. Because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.\n\nD. The chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could \"tack on\" their successive use periods.\n\nAlright, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: An easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.\n\nFirst, what's an easement appurtenant? It's an easement that benefits a particular piece of land, called the dominant tenement, and burdens another piece of land, called the servient tenement. When the dominant tenement is sold, the easement generally passes with it, benefiting the new owner.\n\nIn this scenario, the chef's property is the dominant tenement, and the neighbor's property is the servient tenement. When the chef sells his property to the assistant, the easement should pass to the assistant automatically because it's appurtenant to the land.\n\nSo, this seems like a strong argument. The assistant, as the new owner of the dominant tenement, should have the right to use the easement.\n\nOption B: The assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.\n\nA bonafide purchaser is someone who buys property in good faith, without knowledge of any defects in the title, and pays valuable consideration for it.\n\nIn this case, the assistant bought the property from the chef, presumably in good faith, without knowing about any issues with the easement.\n\nHowever, the easement was granted in writing, but it wasn't recorded. In some jurisdictions, an unrecorded easement may not be enforceable against a subsequent purchaser who doesn't have actual knowledge of it.\n\nBut in this scenario, the easement was created by written agreement, which suggests it's a recorded easement. Wait, but the problem says the chef improved the road without notifying the neighbor, but it doesn't specify if the easement was recorded or not.\n\nActually, re-reading the scenario: \"the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way...\". So, it was granted in writing, but it doesn't say if it was recorded.\n\nIn many places, easements created by written agreement are enforceable against subsequent purchasers if they have actual, constructive, or inquiry notice of the easement.\n\nGiven that the easement was in writing and likely recorded, or at least should be discoverable through a title search, the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, should still be protected.\n\nBut since the problem mentions that the easement was unrecorded, I need to be careful. If the easement wasn't recorded, and the assistant didn't have actual knowledge of it, then perhaps the easement isn't enforceable against the assistant.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way\", but it doesn't specify if it was recorded or not. Maybe I misread it.\n\nLet me check again: \"the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way...\". It doesn't say anything about recording.\n\nIn that case, if the easement wasn't recorded, and the assistant didn't have actual knowledge of it, then perhaps the easement isn't enforceable against the assistant.\n\nBut, generally, easements created by written agreement are supposed to be recorded to give notice to third parties.\n\nIf the easement wasn't recorded, and the assistant didn't have actual knowledge of it, then perhaps the neighbor could argue that the easement isn't enforceable against the assistant.\n\nHowever, in practice, easements are often discoverable through title searches, even if not recorded, because they may be apparent from the physical use of the property or other documents.\n\nMoreover, the assistant likely had some knowledge of the easement since he bought the property from the chef, who had the easement agreement.\n\nSo, perhaps the assistant does have knowledge of the easement, making him a chargeable purchaser.\n\nTherefore, even if the easement wasn't recorded, the assistant might still be entitled to it if he had constructive notice.\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Option A seems stronger because it directly states that the easement passes with the dominant tenement.\n\nOption C: Because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.\n\nPrescriptive easements are typically acquired through long-term, continuous, and open use without permission, which can turn into a legal right after a certain period.\n\nIn this scenario, the easement was originally created by written agreement, not by implication or prescription.\n\nSo, this option doesn't seem to apply here. The easement was granted by agreement, not through adverse use.\n\nOption D: The chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could \"tack on\" their successive use periods.\n\nTacking is a concept used in prescriptive periods, where successive periods of adverse possession by different parties can be added together to meet the required statutory period for claiming title by prescription.\n\nHowever, in this case, we're dealing with an easement, not fee simple title.\n\nTacking is more relevant to claims of adverse possession for acquiring ownership, not for easements.\n\nMoreover, both the chef and the assistant are in privity of estate because they both own the dominant tenement at different times, but tacking isn't typically applicable in easement claims.\n\nSo, this option seems less relevant.\n\nComparing options A and B, option A seems more directly applicable and stronger.\n\nOption A clearly states that an easement appurtenant passes with the dominant tenement, which is the case here.\n\nThe assistant, as the new owner of the dominant tenement, should inherit the easement rights that the chef had.\n\nOption B is about the assistant being a bonafide purchaser and being protected despite the easement being unrecorded.\n\nBut since the easement was created in writing and likely should be discoverable, and assuming the assistant had some knowledge of it, this might not be as strong as option A.\n\nMoreover, the problem states that the easement was unrecorded, which might weaken the assistant's position under option B.\n\nTherefore, option A seems like the strongest argument.\n\nAdditionally, even if the easement wasn't recorded, the fact that it was granted in writing and has been used for a significant period suggests that it's a valid easement that should pass to the assistant.\n\nBut based on the information provided, option A is the most straightforward and strongest argument.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
