                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the encomienda system in the Spanish colonies. The question is asking which of the given options did NOT contribute to the ending of the encomienda system. Before I dive into the options, I should probably make sure I understand what the encomienda system was.\n\nFrom what I recall, the encomienda system was put in place by the Spanish during their colonization of the Americas. It was a way to reward conquistadors and other prominent Spaniards by granting them the labor and tribute of indigenous people in certain areas. So, essentially, these encomenderos had the right to collect taxes or require labor from the indigenous populations in their assigned territories.\n\nNow, the text provided seems to be an excerpt from Bernal Diaz del Castillo's memoirs, which describe some events related to the conquest of Mexico, particularly involving Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. The passage mentions the marking of slaves with the letter \"G,\" the deduction of the emperor's and Cort\u00e9s' shares before the soldiers got anything, and the secret setting aside of the finest Indian females. It also talks about the division of gold and how Cort\u00e9s managed to extort more gold from the soldiers under the pretense of a loan.\n\nWhile this background is interesting, I need to focus on the encomienda system and which of the provided options did NOT lead to its end.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:** The protests of the Catholic missionaries against abuses of forced labor.\n\nI know that there were Catholic missionaries who were appalled by the treatment of the indigenous people under the encomienda system. Figures like Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas are famous for their advocacy on behalf of the natives and their criticism of the encomenderos' abuses. Their protests and writings did influence Spanish policy regarding the treatment of indigenous people. So, it seems likely that their protests did contribute to the eventual reform or ending of the encomienda system.\n\n**Option B:** The lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores.\n\nAs the colonization progressed, the amount of unclaimed land diminished. With fewer new territories being conquered and settled, there would be less need to grant encomiendas to new arrivals or to reward conquistadors with new lands. This could have led to a decline in the encomienda system as the pool of available land shrank.\n\n**Option C:** The Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly.\n\nThe Spanish monarchy, particularly under rulers like Philip II, sought to centralize power and control over the colonies. The encomienda system, which granted considerable autonomy to encomenderos, might have been seen as a barrier to royal control. By phasing out the encomienda system, the crown could exert more direct control over the colonies, perhaps through royal officials or other means.\n\n**Option D:** An increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas.\n\nMestizos are people of mixed European and indigenous ancestry. If the law forbade them from working on encomiendas, that might have created labor shortages, especially as the indigenous population decreased due to disease and overwork. However, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of this law. Maybe mestizos weren't allowed to hold encomiendas but could work on them? I need to verify this point.\n\nUpon a quick search in my notes, I find that mestizos were indeed often excluded from holding encomiendas, which were primarily reserved for peninsulares (people born in Spain) and criollos (people of Spanish descent born in the Americas). However, mestizos could be subjected to encomiendas, but their status was sometimes ambiguous. It's possible that over time, as the number of mestizos increased, there were changes in how they were treated regarding encomiendas.\n\nBut to answer the question accurately, I need to determine if the increase in the mestizo population was a factor in ending the encomienda system.\n\nConsidering that the encomienda system was primarily based on the labor of indigenous people, the decline of the indigenous population due to diseases and overexploitation was a significant factor that led to its decline. However, the mention in option D specifically refers to mestizos being forbidden from working on encomiendas, which might not have been the primary reason for the system's end.\n\nPerhaps the key issue here is that the encomienda system was already in decline due to other factors, such as the protests of missionaries, the lack of new land, and the crown's desire for more control, before the mestizo population became a significant factor.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the increase in the number of mestizos, while a significant demographic change in the colonies, was not a direct cause for the ending of the encomienda system.\n\nTo cross-verify this, I recall that the encomienda system began to be reformed in the 16th century with laws like the New Laws of 1542, which aimed to improve the treatment of indigenous people and gradually phase out the encomienda system. These reforms were primarily driven by humanitarian concerns and the crown's desire for more direct control, aligning with options A and C.\n\nAdditionally, the exhaustion of new lands for conquest and the diminishing returns from encomiendas due to the decline in indigenous populations also pushed for changes, supporting option B.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, option D seems less directly related to the ending of the encomienda system compared to the other options.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is D. An increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nWhile the increase in the mestizo population was a significant demographic shift in the Spanish colonies, it was not the primary factor that led to the ending of the encomienda system. The system was already under reform due to protests from Catholic missionaries against abuses, the lack of new land to assign to encomenderos, and the Spanish crown's desire to exert more direct control over the colonies. These factors were more directly responsible for the decline and eventual abolition of the encomienda system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
