                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand the rights that coastal states have over their continental shelves. There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me see.\n\nFirst, option A says that coastal states have \"ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights\" over their continental shelf for exploring and exploiting its natural resources. Hmm, \"ipso facto\" means \"by the fact itself,\" and \"ab initio\" means \"from the beginning.\" So, this seems to suggest that coastal states automatically have sovereign rights over their continental shelves without needing to do anything special to claim them, and these rights are there from the start.\n\nOption B contradicts that, saying that coastal states can only exercise sovereign rights over their continental shelves after they make a declaration. So, unlike option A, which says rights are automatic, option B says there's a process required before rights can be exercised.\n\nOption C mentions that coastal states exercise sovereign rights over their continental shelves specifically for exploiting fishing resources. This seems narrower than option A, which talks about exploring and exploiting all natural resources, not just fishing resources.\n\nOption D is different again. It says that coastal states may only exercise limited rights over their continental shelves and only upon the consent of their neighboring states. That sounds like there are restrictions on these rights and that neighboring states have a say in the matter.\n\nAlright, so I need to recall what international law says about coastal states' rights over their continental shelves. I remember that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defines these rights pretty clearly.\n\nLet me think about UNCLOS. It states that coastal states have sovereign rights over their continental shelves for the purpose of exploring and exploiting the natural resources there. But is this automatic, as in option A, or does the coastal state need to make a declaration first, as in option B?\n\nI think under UNCLOS, coastal states do not need to make any formal declaration to exercise their sovereign rights over the continental shelf. These rights are inherent to their status as coastal states. So, option A seems more accurate than option B.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Maybe some countries do need to make declarations for certain purposes. Let me see.\n\nUpon checking, UNCLOS Article 76 provides for the delimitation of the continental shelf, but it doesn't require a declaration to exercise sovereign rights over it. Rather, it outlines how the shelf is defined and how disputes can be resolved.\n\nSo, it seems that coastal states have these rights by virtue of being coastal states, without needing to declare anything specifically.\n\nNow, option C mentions only fishing resources. But the continental shelf can have other natural resources, like oil, gas, minerals, and so on. So, limiting the rights to just fishing resources seems incomplete.\n\nOption D talks about limited rights and requiring neighboring states' consent. That doesn't sound right, because generally, coastal states have sovereign rights over their continental shelves without needing neighboring states' approval.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions, like in cases of overlapping claims, where agreements between states are necessary to resolve boundaries.\n\nBut in general, coastal states have sovereign rights over their continental shelves for exploring and exploiting natural resources, without needing consent from neighboring states.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the most accurate statement.\n\nWait, but let's look at the exact wording of UNCLOS. Article 77 says: \"The coastal State has sovereign rights over the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.\"\n\nThis aligns with option A, which says the coastal state enjoys \"ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights\" for exploring and exploiting natural resources.\n\nSo, according to UNCLOS, these rights are inherent and exist from the beginning, without needing any declaration.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct, while options B, C, and D are incorrect based on UNCLOS provisions.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where declarations are required.\n\nI recall that for extended continental shelves beyond 200 nautical miles, there might be requirements to submit data to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS). But this is more about establishing the outer limits of the shelf, not about exercising sovereign rights over it.\n\nSo, even in that case, the rights themselves are not contingent on making a declaration; it's about defining the boundaries accurately.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: the coastal state enjoys ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
