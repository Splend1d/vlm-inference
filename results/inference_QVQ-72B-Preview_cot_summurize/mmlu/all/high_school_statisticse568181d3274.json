                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about chicken eggs and their masses. It says that the masses are normally distributed with a mean of 45 grams and a standard deviation of 4 grams. I need to find the mass that corresponds to the 25th percentile of all the eggs. The options are A. 42.2 g, B. 42.3 g, C. 42.4 g, and D. 42.5 g.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what the 25th percentile means in this context. The 25th percentile is the value below which 25% of the observations fall. So, in a normal distribution, it's the point where 25% of the eggs have a lower mass than this value.\n\nSince the distribution is normal, I can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this value. I know that the normal distribution is defined by its mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3). Here, \u03bc = 45 g and \u03c3 = 4 g.\n\nTo find the 25th percentile, I can use the inverse normal distribution function, which will give me the value corresponding to a specific cumulative probability. In statistical terms, I need to find the value of X such that P(X < x) = 0.25.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of Z-scores. The Z-score is calculated as Z = (X - \u03bc)/\u03c3. If I can find the Z-score that corresponds to the 25th percentile, I can then plug that back into the equation to find X.\n\nI recall that for a standard normal distribution (mean 0 and standard deviation 1), the 25th percentile corresponds to a Z-score of approximately -0.674. This is because 25% of the data lies to the left of this Z-score in a standard normal distribution.\n\nSo, if Z = -0.674, then:\n\nX = \u03bc + Z * \u03c3\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nX = 45 + (-0.674) * 4\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, -0.674 times 4 is -2.696.\n\nThen, 45 plus -2.696 is 45 - 2.696 = 42.304 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options, that would be approximately 42.3 g, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have the exact Z-score for the 25th percentile. I know that the 25th percentile in a standard normal distribution is exactly Z = -0.6745. Let me use that for more accuracy.\n\nSo, X = 45 + (-0.6745) * 4\n\nCalculate -0.6745 * 4:\n\n-0.6745 * 4 = -2.698\n\nThen, X = 45 - 2.698 = 42.302 grams.\n\nRounding to one decimal place, that's 42.3 g.\n\nAlternatively, I could use statistical software or a calculator to find the exact value without rounding.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm this answer.\n\nI can use the formula for the inverse normal distribution:\n\nX = \u03bc + Z * \u03c3\n\nWhere Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired percentile.\n\nAs I said earlier, for the 25th percentile, Z \u2248 -0.6745.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nX = 45 + (-0.6745) * 4\n\nX \u2248 45 - 2.698 = 42.302 g\n\nWhich again gives me 42.3 g.\n\nAlternatively, I could look up the exact Z-score for the 25th percentile using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator.\n\nUsing a calculator, I find that the Z-score for the 25th percentile is indeed -0.6745.\n\nTherefore, X = 45 + (-0.6745) * 4 = 42.302 g, which rounds to 42.3 g.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 42.2 g\n\nB. 42.3 g\n\nC. 42.4 g\n\nD. 42.5 g\n\nSo, the closest option is B. 42.3 g.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other method to confirm this.\n\nAnother way is to use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.\n\nIf I have a normal distribution with mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3, the CDF gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a specific value x.\n\nSo, I want to find x such that P(X < x) = 0.25.\n\nUsing the CDF formula, this is equivalent to finding x where:\n\n\u03a6((x - \u03bc)/\u03c3) = 0.25\n\nWhere \u03a6 is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.\n\nSo, \u03a6((x - 45)/4) = 0.25\n\nAs before, this implies that (x - 45)/4 = Z, where Z is the Z-score corresponding to the 25th percentile, which is -0.6745.\n\nThus, x - 45 = -0.6745 * 4\n\nx - 45 = -2.698\n\nx = 45 - 2.698 = 42.302 g\n\nAgain, this confirms that the 25th percentile is approximately 42.3 g.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a different number of decimal places or a different Z-score, I might get a slightly different answer, but based on standard tables and calculator outputs, -0.6745 is the precise Z-score for the 25th percentile.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the mass at the 25th percentile is 42.3 g.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 42.3 g.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 42.3\\ \\text{g}} \\]"
