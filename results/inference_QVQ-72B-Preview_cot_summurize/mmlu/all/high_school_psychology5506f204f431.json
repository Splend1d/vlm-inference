                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Georgia and Kathy working in a hospital, and their different motivations for doing so. Georgia wants to help others, while Kathy is there just to make money. The question is asking what their individual motivations demonstrate, and there are four options: primary and secondary drives, positive and negative loci of control, sympathetic and autonomic motivation, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and see which one fits the scenario best.\n\nStarting with option A: primary and secondary drives. I recall that primary drives are basic physiological needs like hunger, thirst, and sleep, whereas secondary drives are more learned or acquired motivations, like achievement or recognition. Neither of these seems to directly apply to Georgia and Kathy's motivations. Georgia wants to help others, which might be considered a secondary drive, and Kathy wants to make money, which could also be a secondary drive. But the distinction between primary and secondary doesn't seem to capture the difference between their motivations clearly.\n\nMoving on to option B: positive and negative loci of control. Locus of control refers to whether a person believes that events in their life are due to their own actions (internal locus of control) or due to external factors beyond their control (external locus of control). Positive and negative might refer to whether they see control as within their reach or not, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Anyway, I don't think this is the right choice because the question is about their motivations for working, not about how they perceive control over events.\n\nOption C: sympathetic and autonomic motivation. This sounds a bit confusing. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are parts of the autonomic nervous system, which handles involuntary functions like heart rate and digestion. I don't see a direct connection between these physiological systems and the motivations of Georgia and Kathy. Maybe this is a typo or mis phrasing.\n\nLastly, option D: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. This seems promising. Intrinsic motivation is doing something because it's enjoyable or aligns with your values, whereas extrinsic motivation is doing something for external rewards, like money or praise.\n\nGeorgia wants to help others, which sounds like it's driven by her internal values and a sense of purpose. That fits with intrinsic motivation. Kathy is working solely to make money, which is an external reward. That sounds like extrinsic motivation.\n\nSo, their motivations seem to represent the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is Kathy's motivation entirely extrinsic? Could there be any intrinsic aspect to it? Well, she might find satisfaction in earning money, but the primary driver is the external reward of money, not the joy of the work itself.\n\nSimilarly, Georgia finds meaning in helping others, which is an intrinsic reward. Even if she gets paid, her main motivation is not the paycheck but the act of helping.\n\nTherefore, the difference between their motivations is best described as intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation.\n\nI think the answer is D. intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
