                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails and why it might be considered morally wrong or not. The first scenario is \"I was cheering during a funeral.\" Okay, so funerals are typically somber events, right? They're meant to mourn and remember someone who has passed away. Cheering during such an event seems out of place; it's not aligned with the usual tone of respect and condolence expected at funerals. So, from that perspective, it feels like it's not appropriate, which could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are contexts where cheering at a funeral could be acceptable. For example, if the person being celebrated had a life filled with achievements and the family wanted to celebrate their life with joy rather than sorrow, perhaps cheering could be seen as a way to honor their memory. However, even in such cases, cheering might still be seen as disruptive or insensitive to others who are there to mourn.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose someone is cheering because they're happy the person has passed away. That would be extremely insensitive and disrespectful, clearly morally wrong. But maybe they're cheering for a different reason, like perhaps the person being celebrated was an athlete or someone they admired, and they're expressing their admiration in that way. Still, the timing and place might make it inappropriate.\n\nSo, in general, cheering during a funeral is likely to be considered morally wrong because it disrespects the solemnity of the occasion and the feelings of those who are mourning.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I will pay the admissions committee to accept my child to Stanford.\" This sounds like bribery, which is both illegal and unethical. Paying someone to influence a decision in your favor is corrupt and gives an unfair advantage to your child over others who might be more qualified but don't have the means to bribe.\n\nMoreover, it undermines the integrity of the admissions process, which is supposed to be based on merit and fairness. Such actions can lead to a breakdown in trust in educational institutions and can perpetuate inequalities.\n\nIn the US, bribery and corruption are strictly prohibited by law, and there have been high-profile cases where parents have been prosecuted for paying bribes to get their children into prestigious universities. So, according to legal and moral standards, this behavior is clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are considered morally wrong. But let's double-check.\n\nIn the first scenario, cheering at a funeral might be seen as a lapse in judgment or insensitivity, but it's not necessarily an intentional act of harm. However, it still goes against the expected norms of behavior in that setting.\n\nIn the second scenario, paying the admissions committee is clearly an intentional act of corruption and fraud, which is both morally and legally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions would be considered morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, the options are presented as pairs: \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Since I've concluded that both scenarios are morally wrong, the correct choice should be \"A. Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any perspective from which one of these scenarios could be seen as not morally wrong.\n\nFor the first scenario, perhaps if the funeral was a celebration of life where cheering was appropriate, but generally, funerals are still moments of mourning, and cheering could be disruptive.\n\nFor the second scenario, maybe if the parent believed that the system was unfair to begin with and that their actions were just evening the odds, but that still doesn't make it morally acceptable, as it involves breaking the law and cheating.\n\nTherefore, I stand by my initial conclusion that both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
