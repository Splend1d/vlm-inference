                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this strict liability in tort case involving a snowmobile accident. The scenario is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a manufacturer who makes snowmobiles, specifically Model IA, which have a speed-regulating device that prevents them from going faster than 50 mph. These snowmobiles are distributed through wholesalers and retailers. The manufacturer also warns all distributors not to modify the snowmobiles without checking with their engineers first.\n\nIn this case, there's an operator of a shop in a mountain community who has the exclusive right to distribute Model IA snowmobiles in that area. This operator, despite the manufacturer's warnings, removes the speed regulators from all the Model IA snowmobiles in stock. As a result, these snowmobiles can now go faster than 50 mph.\n\nA buyer purchases one of these modified snowmobiles and is driving it at over 70 mph in a snow-covered field. The snowmobile hits a snow-covered rock, causing the buyer to crash into a tree and get seriously injured.\n\nNow, the buyer is thinking about filing a strict liability in tort action. The question is against whom they would most likely recover damages: the manufacturer only, the manufacturer even though it was unaware of the modification, the operator only, or both the manufacturer and the operator.\n\nOkay, let's recall what strict liability in tort means. Strict liability imposes liability for damages without requiring proof of negligence or fault. It's often applied in cases involving defective products.\n\nIn product liability cases, manufacturers can be held strictly liable for defects in their products that cause injury. There are typically three types of defects:\n\n1. **Design defects:** The product's design is inherently unsafe.\n\n2. **Manufacturing defects:** Errors occur during the manufacturing process that make the product unsafe.\n\n3. **Marketing defects:** Inadequate warnings or instructions are provided with the product.\n\nIn this scenario, the snowmobile was originally designed with a speed regulator to prevent it from exceeding 50 mph. The manufacturer also warned against modifying the snowmobiles without consulting their engineers.\n\nThe operator removed the speed regulator, which is a modification that likely changes the characteristics of the snowmobile, potentially making it more dangerous at higher speeds.\n\nNow, considering strict liability, who should be held responsible?\n\nLet's consider the manufacturer first. They designed the snowmobile with a speed regulator and warned against modifications. If the snowmobile was modified without their knowledge or consent, and they had no role in the modification, it's questionable whether they should be held strictly liable for the modified version of the product.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, manufacturers are not liable for modifications made to their products by third parties, especially if they warned against such modifications.\n\nOn the other hand, the operator who removed the speed regulator knew or should have known that removing the regulator could make the snowmobile unsafe, especially at higher speeds.\n\nMoreover, the operator removed the regulator despite the manufacturer's warnings, which suggests that the operator was aware of the potential risks but chose to modify the snowmobile anyway.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the operator's actions directly contributed to the snowmobile becoming unsafe, leading to the buyer's injuries.\n\nBut what about the manufacturer? Could they still be held liable under strict liability?\n\nWell, the original product was designed with a speed regulator to ensure safety. The defect that led to the injury was introduced by the operator's modification, not by the manufacturer.\n\nIn strict liability cases, the focus is often on the condition of the product when it left the manufacturer's control. If the product was safe at that point but was later modified in a way that made it unsafe, the manufacturer may not be liable for the modified version.\n\nAdditionally, the manufacturer had warned against modifications, which might serve as a defense against strict liability claims.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the operator, who modified the product, would be the primary party responsible for the injuries caused by the modified snowmobile.\n\nHowever, in some cases, both the manufacturer and the modifier might be held liable if the modification was foreseeable.\n\nBut in this scenario, the manufacturer explicitly warned against modifications, indicating that they did not anticipate or condone such changes.\n\nGiven this information, it's less likely that the manufacturer would be held strictly liable for the modified product.\n\nOn the other hand, the operator knowingly and deliberately removed the safety feature, increasing the risk of harm, and should be held accountable for the consequences of that action.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is that the buyer will recover against the operator only.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A says the manufacturer only. That doesn't seem right, because the manufacturer warned against modifications and the product was safe when it left their control.\n\nOption B says the manufacturer, even though it was unaware of the removal of the speed regulator. Again, if the manufacturer is not responsible for modifications made without their knowledge or consent, and they warned against such modifications, it's unlikely they would be held strictly liable.\n\nOption C says the operator only. This seems plausible, as the operator modified the product in a way that made it unsafe, despite warnings.\n\nOption D says both the manufacturer and the operator. But if the manufacturer is not responsible for modifications made by third parties, especially when they warned against it, it's unlikely they would be jointly liable.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is Option C: the operator only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
