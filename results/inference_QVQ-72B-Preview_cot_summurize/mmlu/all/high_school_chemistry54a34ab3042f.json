                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What is the conjugate acid of the H2PO4- ion?\" and the options are A. HPO42-, B. H2PO4-, C. H3PO4, D. PO43-. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I remember that in chemistry, when we talk about acids and bases, there's this concept called a conjugate pair. Like, when an acid donates a proton, it turns into its conjugate base, and vice versa.\n\nSo, specifically, if I have H2PO4-, which is a polyprotic acid, I think, because it can donate more than one proton. Wait, no, actually, H3PO4 is phosphoric acid, which can donate three protons, but H2PO4- is already its first conjugate base. Wait, let me recall the steps of ionization for phosphoric acid.\n\nPhosphoric acid, H3PO4, can donate three protons in aqueous solution. The first ionization is H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4-, the second is H2PO4- \u2192 H+ + HPO42-, and the third is HPO42- \u2192 H+ + PO43-. So, H2PO4- is the conjugate base of H3PO4, and it's also an acid because it can donate another proton to become HPO42-.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the conjugate acid of H2PO4-. So, if H2PO4- donates a proton, what does it become? According to the ionization steps, it should become HPO42-. So, that would make HPO42- its conjugate base, but the question is asking for the conjugate acid.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me think again. The conjugate acid of a base is the species that is formed when the base accepts a proton. So, if H2PO4- is acting as a base, its conjugate acid would be what it forms when it accepts a proton.\n\nSo, if H2PO4- accepts a proton, it would become H3PO4. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because H3PO4 is the original acid before ionization. Let me check the options again: A. HPO42-, B. H2PO4-, C. H3PO4, D. PO43-.\n\nI think I might have gotten confused. Let me recall the definition. The conjugate acid of a base is the species formed by adding a proton (H+) to the base. So, if H2PO4- is the base, adding a proton would give H3PO4. So, that would make H3PO4 the conjugate acid of H2PO4-.\n\nBut wait, H2PO4- can also act as an acid by donating a proton to form HPO42-. So, in that case, HPO42- would be its conjugate base. So, depending on whether H2PO4- is acting as an acid or a base, its conjugate pair changes.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the conjugate acid of H2PO4-. So, it's looking for the species that is formed when H2PO4- accepts a proton. Therefore, it should be H3PO4.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. Could H2PO4- accept another proton besides H+? No, I don't think so. So, the answer should be C. H3PO4.\n\nWait, but option B is H2PO4-, which is the same as the starting species. That can't be right because the conjugate acid isn't the same as the base. Option A is HPO42-, which is the conjugate base, not the acid. Option D is PO43-, which is the fully ionized form.\n\nSo, yeah, the conjugate acid of H2PO4- should be H3PO4. I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
