                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: solve for the sum of all possible values of \\( x \\) when \\( 3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 9^{x + 2} \\). The options are A. 1, B. 2, C. -2, D. 0. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I notice that both sides of the equation are exponential expressions. The left side has a base of 3, and the right side has a base of 9. Wait a minute, 9 can be written as 3 squared, right? So, \\( 9 = 3^2 \\). That might be useful because it could help me write both sides with the same base.\n\nSo, if I express the right side with base 3, it would be \\( 9^{x + 2} = (3^2)^{x + 2} = 3^{2(x + 2)} = 3^{2x + 4} \\). Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the equation becomes \\( 3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 3^{2x + 4} \\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So, \\( x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2x + 4 \\).\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 + 4x + 4 - 2x - 4 = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( x^2 + 2x = 0 \\). Factor this, and I get \\( x(x + 2) = 0 \\). So, the solutions are \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of all possible values of \\( x \\), so that would be \\( 0 + (-2) = -2 \\). Looking back at the options, C. -2 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I should check if both solutions are valid. Maybe there are extraneous solutions or something. Let's plug them back into the original equation.\n\nFirst, \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 3^{0^2 + 4(0) + 4} = 9^{0 + 2} \\) becomes \\( 3^{4} = 9^{2} \\), which is \\( 81 = 81 \\). That checks out.\n\nSecond, \\( x = -2 \\):\n\n\\( 3^{(-2)^2 + 4(-2) + 4} = 9^{-2 + 2} \\) becomes \\( 3^{4 - 8 + 4} = 9^{0} \\), which is \\( 3^{0} = 1 \\), and \\( 9^{0} = 1 \\). So, \\( 1 = 1 \\), which is also true.\n\nTherefore, both solutions are valid, and their sum is indeed -2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Like taking logarithms on both sides. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with \\( 3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} = 9^{x + 2} \\), take the natural log (or log base 10, doesn't matter) of both sides.\n\nSo, \\( \\ln(3^{x^2 + 4x + 4}) = \\ln(9^{x + 2}) \\).\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, \\( \\ln(a^b) = b \\ln a \\), so this becomes \\( (x^2 + 4x + 4) \\ln 3 = (x + 2) \\ln 9 \\).\n\nNow, since \\( 9 = 3^2 \\), \\( \\ln 9 = \\ln(3^2) = 2 \\ln 3 \\). So, the equation becomes \\( x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2) \\cdot 2 \\).\n\nSimplify the right side: \\( 2(x + 2) = 2x + 4 \\).\n\nSo, \\( x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2x + 4 \\). Subtract \\( 2x + 4 \\) from both sides: \\( x^2 + 2x = 0 \\), which is the same as before.\n\nAgain, factoring gives \\( x(x + 2) = 0 \\), so \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = -2 \\), with their sum being -2.\n\nHmm, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. Maybe I should consider if there are any restrictions or if I missed something.\n\nIs there any possibility of negative exponents or undefined expressions? Well, the original equation involves exponents with variables, but since the bases are positive (3 and 9), and the exponents can be any real number, there are no restrictions on the domain of \\( x \\). So, \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) are both valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider graphing both sides to visualize the solutions.\n\nLet me consider the function \\( y = 3^{x^2 + 4x + 4} \\) and \\( y = 9^{x + 2} \\). Since I've already established that they are equal when \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\), and no other solutions seem to exist, I think that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the sum of all possible values of \\( x \\), and I have two solutions, 0 and -2, whose sum is -2. So, the answer should be -2.\n\nLooking back at the multiple-choice options, C. -2 is the correct choice.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any flaws in this approach, and both methods confirm the same solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-2} \\]"
