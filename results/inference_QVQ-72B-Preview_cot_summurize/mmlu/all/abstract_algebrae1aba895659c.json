                    "text": "So I'm looking at these two statements about fields and polynomials, and I need to figure out which ones are true. Let's take them one at a time.\n\nFirst statement: \"Q is an extension field of Z_2.\"\n\nOkay, so Q is the field of rational numbers, and Z_2 is the field with two elements, right? I need to remember what it means for one field to be an extension of another. Basically, if Q contains Z_2 as a subfield, then Q is an extension field of Z_2.\n\nBut wait, does Q really contain Z_2? Z_2 has only two elements: 0 and 1, and arithmetic is done modulo 2. In Q, which consists of numbers of the form p/q where p and q are integers and q \u2260 0, the arithmetic is standard addition and multiplication of rational numbers.\n\nBut in Z_2, 1 + 1 equals 0, because it's modulo 2. In Q, 1 + 1 equals 2, not 0. So, the element \"2\" in Q is not equal to 0, whereas in Z_2, adding 1 + 1 gives 0. This suggests that Z_2 is not a subfield of Q because their arithmetic operations don't match up.\n\nMoreover, Q is a field characteristic 0, while Z_2 is characteristic 2. I recall that the characteristic of a field is the smallest positive integer n such that n*1 = 0, or infinite if no such n exists. Q has characteristic 0 because no finite sum of 1's equals 0, whereas Z_2 has characteristic 2 because 2*1 = 0.\n\nSo, since Q doesn't contain Z_2 as a subfield, Q cannot be an extension field of Z_2. Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, moving on to statement 2: \"Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.\"\n\nThis sounds familiar. I think this is related to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra for polynomials over the complex numbers, but I need to see if it holds in general for any field.\n\nLet me recall that a polynomial over a field F is non-constant, meaning it has degree at least 1. The question is whether such a polynomial has a zero in some extension field of F.\n\nI remember learning about algebraic extensions where polynomials can have roots. For example, if you take a polynomial in F[x], and it's irreducible over F, then you can construct an extension field where this polynomial has a root by taking F[x]/(p(x)), where p(x) is the irreducible polynomial.\n\nIn the case of the real numbers R, which is a field, the polynomial x^2 + 1 has no roots in R, but if we extend to the complex numbers C, then it has roots i and -i.\n\nSimilarly, in finite fields, like Z_2, the polynomial x^2 + x + 1 has no roots in Z_2, but in the extension field Z_2[x]/(x^2 + x + 1), which is isomorphic to the field with 4 elements, it does have roots.\n\nSo, in general, for any field F and any non-constant polynomial in F[x], there exists an extension field where the polynomial has a zero. This is essentially the statement of the existence of algebraic closures for fields.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Statement 1: False, because Q is not an extension field of Z_2.\n\n- Statement 2: True, because every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
