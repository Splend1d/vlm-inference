                    "text": "Let's see. Anton has two species of ants, A and B. On day 0, there are 30 ants in total. Every day, the number of ants of species A doubles, and the number of species B triples. By day 5, there are 3281 ants in total. I need to find out how many of these are species A on day 5.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of species A ants on day 0 as \\(a\\) and species B as \\(b\\). So, \\(a + b = 30\\).\n\nNow, since species A doubles every day, on day 1 there will be \\(2a\\), day 2 is \\(4a\\), and so on, up to day 5, which would be \\(2^5 a = 32a\\).\n\nSimilarly, species B triples every day, so day 1 is \\(3b\\), day 2 is \\(9b\\), day 3 is \\(27b\\), day 4 is \\(81b\\), day 5 is \\(243b\\).\n\nOn day 5, the total number of ants is \\(32a + 243b = 3281\\).\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\(a + b = 30\\)\n\n2. \\(32a + 243b = 3281\\)\n\nI need to solve for \\(a\\) and then find \\(32a\\), which is the number of species A ants on day 5.\n\nLet me solve the first equation for \\(a\\): \\(a = 30 - b\\).\n\nNow substitute this into the second equation:\n\n\\(32(30 - b) + 243b = 3281\\)\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n\\(960 - 32b + 243b = 3281\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(960 + 211b = 3281\\)\n\nNow, subtract 960 from both sides:\n\n\\(211b = 3281 - 960\\)\n\n\\(211b = 2321\\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 211:\n\n\\(b = \\frac{2321}{211}\\)\n\nLet me check if 211 divides 2321 evenly. 211 times 11 is 2321, because 200 times 11 is 2200, and 11 times 11 is 121, so 2200 + 121 = 2321. So, \\(b = 11\\).\n\nNow, from \\(a + b = 30\\), \\(a = 30 - 11 = 19\\).\n\nTherefore, on day 5, the number of species A ants is \\(32a = 32 \\times 19\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: 30 times 19 is 570, and 2 times 19 is 38, so 570 + 38 = 608.\n\nSo, there are 608 ants of species A on day 5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 211\n\nB. 2321\n\nC. 11\n\nD. 608\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 608.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with \\(a + b = 30\\), and \\(32a + 243b = 3281\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 30 - b\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\(32(30 - b) + 243b = 3281\\)\n\n\\(960 - 32b + 243b = 3281\\)\n\n\\(960 + 211b = 3281\\)\n\n\\(211b = 3281 - 960 = 2321\\)\n\n\\(b = 11\\)\n\nThen \\(a = 30 - 11 = 19\\)\n\nOn day 5, \\(32a = 32 \\times 19 = 608\\)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the growth rates are correctly applied.\n\nSpecies A doubles every day: day 0: a, day 1: 2a, day 2: 4a, ..., day 5: \\(2^5 a = 32a\\).\n\nSpecies B triples every day: day 0: b, day 1: 3b, day 2: 9b, ..., day 5: \\(3^5 b = 243b\\).\n\nTotal on day 5: \\(32a + 243b = 3281\\), which matches the equation I set up earlier.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is 608.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{608} \\]"
