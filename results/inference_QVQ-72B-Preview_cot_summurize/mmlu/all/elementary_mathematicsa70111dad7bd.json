We need to find out how many cookies Darius has.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many cookies Sara has. Since Sara has 2 more cookies than John, and John has 4 cookies, I should add 2 to John's cookie count. Let's do that:\n\nJohn's cookies: 4\n\nSara's cookies: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, Sara has 6 cookies.\n\nNext, Darius has 3 times as many cookies as Sara. So, I need to multiply Sara's cookie count by 3 to find out how many cookies Darius has.\n\nSara's cookies: 6\n\nDarius's cookies: 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n\nTherefore, Darius has 18 cookies.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 9\n\nB. 14\n\nC. 18\n\nD. 24\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 18.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nJohn has 4 cookies.\n\nSara has 2 more than John: 4 + 2 = 6 cookies. That seems right.\n\nDarius has 3 times as many as Sara: 6 \u00d7 3 = 18 cookies. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]"
