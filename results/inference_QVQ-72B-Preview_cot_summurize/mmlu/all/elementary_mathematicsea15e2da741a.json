                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which number written in exponential notation is equivalent to 343?\" And the options are:\n\nA. 3^7\n\nB. 7^3\n\nC. 7^49\n\nD. 294^49\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which of these exponents equals 343.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what exponential notation means. Exponential notation is a way to represent repeated multiplication of the same number. For example, 2^3 means 2 multiplied by itself 3 times, which is 8.\n\nSo, in this question, I need to find which of these exponential expressions equals 343.\n\nLet me start by evaluating each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 3^7\n\nLet me calculate 3^7.\n\n3^7 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27\n\n27 \u00d7 3 = 81\n\n81 \u00d7 3 = 243\n\n243 \u00d7 3 = 729\n\n729 \u00d7 3 = 2187\n\nSo, 3^7 = 2187, which is not equal to 343.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: 7^3\n\nNow, let's calculate 7^3.\n\n7^3 = 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n\n49 \u00d7 7 = 343\n\nOkay, so 7^3 equals 343.\n\nThis seems to be the correct answer, but just to be sure, let's check the other options.\n\nOption C: 7^49\n\nThis is a very large number. I know that 7^1 = 7\n\n7^2 = 49\n\n7^3 = 343\n\n7^4 = 2401\n\nAnd so on. So, 7^49 is an enormous number, definitely not equal to 343.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: 294^49\n\nThis is another very large number. Even without calculating, I can tell that 294^49 is going to be an astronomically large number, certainly not equal to 343.\n\nSo, option D is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: 7^3.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that 343 can also be expressed as 7^3, but is there any other way to express 343 in exponential form using integers?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nI know that 343 is a perfect cube since 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 = 343.\n\nIs there another way to express 343 using exponents with different bases?\n\nWell, I could try expressing 343 as a power of a smaller number.\n\nFor example, 343 can be expressed as 49^1.7, but that doesn't make much sense because exponents are typically whole numbers in this context.\n\nAlternatively, 343 could be expressed as (7^3), which is already done in option B.\n\nBut among the given options, only option B: 7^3 equals 343.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if 343 can be expressed as a power of 3 in any way.\n\nWe already calculated 3^7 = 2187, which is not 343.\n\nWhat about 3^4? 3^4 = 81, which is less than 343.\n\n3^5 = 243, still less than 343.\n\n3^6 = 729, which is larger than 343.\n\nSo, no, 343 cannot be expressed as a power of 3 with integer exponents.\n\nSimilarly, option C: 7^49 is way larger than 343.\n\nOption D: 294^49 is also much larger.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is B: 7^3.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\n\"Which number written in exponential notation is equivalent to 343?\"\n\nAll options are in exponential notation, so it's straightforward.\n\nHence, the answer is B: 7^3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
