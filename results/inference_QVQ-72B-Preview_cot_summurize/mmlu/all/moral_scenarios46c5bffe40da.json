                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I made sure to hand the scissors to my prettier cousin with the blade pointed toward her.\n\nScenario 2: I set the whole national park's valley on fire.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nOkay, so let's look at each scenario individually.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Handing scissors with the blade pointed toward someone.\n\nNow, handing scissors is a pretty common action, but doing it with the blade pointed toward someone seems intentionally dangerous or potentially harmful. It could be seen as a deliberate act to put someone at risk of injury, whether accidental or intentional. In general, actions that pose a risk to someone's safety or well-being are considered morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to this scenario. The person is handing scissors to their \"prettier\" cousin, which might imply some jealousy or resentment. But regardless of the motive, the action itself is what's in question here. Intentionally handing scissors with the blade pointed towards someone is likely to be seen as reckless or malicious, both of which are morally condemnable.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Setting the whole national park's valley on fire.\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. Setting a fire, especially in a national park, is not only illegal but also extremely dangerous and destructive. It can harm wildlife, destroy natural habitats, and potentially put people's lives at risk, whether they're visitors or firefighters trying to contain the blaze.\n\nMoreover, national parks are protected areas intended for preservation and recreation, and deliberately setting them on fire would be a severe violation of environmental laws and moral responsibilities towards nature and society.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves handing scissors in a dangerous manner to a specific person.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves setting a large-scale fire in a national park, which could have widespread and severe consequences.\n\nBoth actions seem morally wrong, but the scale and potential impact of Scenario 2 are much larger.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong, and the options are combinations of \"Wrong\" and \"Not wrong\" for the two scenarios.\n\nGiven that both scenarios involve actions that are likely to be considered morally wrong, the answer would be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a twist here. Let's consider if there's any context or unusual circumstances that might make one of these actions not morally wrong.\n\nFor example, in Scenario 1, perhaps the person handed the scissors with the blade pointed towards the cousin as a safety measure, like to prevent the cousin from grabbing the wrong end, although that seems unlikely. But even then, standard safety practices involve handing tools safely, with the sharp end away from the recipient.\n\nIn Scenario 2, setting a fire in a national park could be part of controlled burning practices used by park rangers to manage vegetation and reduce the risk of larger wildfires. However, controlled burns are carefully planned and executed operations, not something an individual would do on their own, especially not described as \"setting the whole national park's valley on fire,\" which sounds much more destructive and uncontrolled.\n\nTherefore, without any indication of special circumstances or justifications, both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's quickly consider why the other options might be incorrect:\n\nOption B: \"Wrong, Not wrong\" \u2013 This would suggest that Scenario 1 is wrong, but Scenario 2 is not. Given that setting a large fire in a national park is almost certainly morally wrong, this option doesn't align with the understanding of moral standards.\n\nOption C: \"Not wrong, Wrong\" \u2013 This would imply that Scenario 1 is not wrong, but Scenario 2 is. Again, handing scissors with the blade towards someone is generally considered dangerous and morally questionable, so this option also doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: \"Not wrong, Not wrong\" \u2013 This would mean that neither scenario involves morally wrong actions, which contradicts the general moral consensus on both actions described.\n\nTherefore, the only plausible answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
