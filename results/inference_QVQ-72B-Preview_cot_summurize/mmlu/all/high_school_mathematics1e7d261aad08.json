                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that we're rolling two fair 6-sided dice and we want to find the probability that the two numbers sum to 4. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what probability means. Probability is basically a measure of how likely an event is to occur, and it's usually expressed as a fraction or a percentage. The formula for probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{event}) = \\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}}\n\\]\n\nSo, in this case, the event we're interested in is rolling two dice and getting a sum of 4.\n\nNext, I need to figure out two things: the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice, and the number of those outcomes that result in a sum of 4.\n\nLet's start with the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 6 faces, and since there are two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 6 = 36\n\\]\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the number of favorable outcomes, I need to find all the pairs of numbers from two dice that add up to 4. Let's list them out.\n\nThe possible pairs that sum to 4 are:\n\n1. (1, 3)\n\n2. (2, 2)\n\n3. (3, 1)\n\nWait, is there any other pair where the sum is 4? Let's check:\n\n- (1,3): 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (2,2): 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (3,1): 3 + 1 = 4\n\n- (4,0): but there's no 0 on a die, so that's not possible.\n\n- (0,4): similarly, no 0.\n\n- (2,2) is already listed.\n\n- (1,3) and (3,1) are both different pairs.\n\nSo, there are 3 distinct pairs that sum to 4.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 3.\n\nNow, plugging into the probability formula:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{sum} = 4) = \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nB. \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\)\n\nC. \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\nD. \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\)\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the possible combinations.\n\nEach die is independent, so the first die can land on any number from 1 to 6, and the second die can land on any number from 1 to 6 as well.\n\nTo get a sum of 4, as I listed earlier, there are three possible ways:\n\n1. First die shows 1, second die shows 3.\n\n2. Both dice show 2.\n\n3. First die shows 3, second die shows 1.\n\nEach of these is distinct and there are no overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to think in terms of ordered pairs, the possible pairs are:\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (3,1)\n\nAgain, that's three possible outcomes out of 36.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the probability for each pair.\n\nFor example, what's the probability of rolling a 1 on the first die and a 3 on the second die?\n\nSince each die is fair, the probability for each number is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), so for two specific numbers on two dice, it's \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of rolling (2,2) is also \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\), and the probability of rolling (3,1) is \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\nSince these are mutually exclusive events, I can add the probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{sum} = 4) = P(1,3) + P(2,2) + P(3,1) = \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way that the sum could be 4? Let's make sure I haven't missed any possible pairs.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- (1,3): yes.\n\n- (2,2): yes.\n\n- (3,1): yes.\n\n- (4,-): no, die only goes up to 6.\n\n- (0,+): no.\n\nSo, indeed, only three pairs sum to 4.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the possible sums, the minimum sum is 2 (1+1), and the maximum is 12 (6+6), so sum of 4 is within that range.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the number of ways to get each sum and then find the probability accordingly.\n\nBut in this case, since the question is specifically about summing to 4, listing the pairs is straightforward.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other consideration I might have missed.\n\nAre the dice distinguishable or indistinguishable? The problem says \"two fair 6-sided dice,\" which typically implies that they are distinguishable, meaning that (1,3) is different from (3,1).\n\nYes, in probability, unless specified otherwise, dice are considered distinguishable.\n\nTherefore, the pairs I've listed are correct.\n\nAlso, the problem states that the dice are fair, so each outcome is equally likely.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, B. \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) is the correct choice.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning, so I'm going to go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\dfrac{1}{12}} \\]"
