Hmm, I need to figure out which one is urbanizing the fastest right now.\n\nFirst off, I know that urbanization is when more and more people move from rural areas to cities. This happens for lots of reasons, like better job opportunities, education, healthcare, and sometimes because of things like climate change or conflicts that make rural life difficult.\n\nI think of Europe first because it's highly urbanized already. Like, in countries like the UK or France, most people live in cities. But is it still urbanizing rapidly, or is it pretty much there already? Maybe it's not growing as fast anymore.\n\nEast Asia comes to mind because of China and India, which are both huge countries with lots of people moving to cities. China has this huge population, and over the past few decades, it's seen massive urban growth. India is also experiencing a lot of urbanization. So maybe East Asia is still urbanizing very quickly.\n\nThen there's Sub-Saharan Africa. I've heard that African cities are growing really fast, partly because of high population growth rates and people moving from rural areas in search of better lives. There are challenges there too, like providing infrastructure and services to all these new city dwellers.\n\nSouth Asia also seems like a likely candidate. Countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan are seeing increases in urban populations. But I'm not sure if it's happening faster than in East Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nI should probably look at some data to see which region has the highest rate of urbanization right now. Maybe check some statistics on urban population growth rates.\n\nLet me recall: The United Nations publishes data on world urbanization prospects. They might have information on regional urbanization trends.\n\nIf I remember correctly, in terms of absolute numbers, East Asia has been adding the largest number of people to its cities each year, especially China. But that might not necessarily mean it has the highest rate of growth.\n\nWait, rate of growth would be the percentage increase in urban population over time. So even if a region is adding a lot of people absolutely, if its urban population is already large, the rate might not be as high as another region where the urban population is smaller but growing quickly.\n\nFor example, Sub-Saharan Africa might have a higher growth rate even if the total number of people added each year is less than in East Asia.\n\nLet me try to find some recent data on this.\n\nI think I saw somewhere that Sub-Saharan Africa is currently the region with the highest urban growth rate. Yeah, I think that rings a bell. It's been projected that by 2050, more than half of Africa's population will be urban.\n\nBut I should verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe South Asia is also urbanizing very rapidly. India, for instance, is expected to add a significant number of people to its cities in the coming decades.\n\nWait, but again, it's about the rate of growth, not just the absolute numbers.\n\nLet me consider this: If a region has a small urban population and it's growing quickly, say at 5% per year, that's a high growth rate. Conversely, a region with a large urban population growing at 2% per year has a lower growth rate but adds more people absolutely.\n\nSo, to answer the question, I need to focus on the growth rate, not the total number of people being added to cities.\n\nGiven that, I believe Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest urbanization growth rate currently.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific numbers. I think the annual urban population growth rate for Sub-Saharan Africa is around 3.5%, whereas for South Asia it's around 2.5%, and for East Asia it's about 1.5%.\n\nWait, those numbers might not be accurate, but they suggest that Sub-Saharan Africa has a higher growth rate.\n\nEurope, on the other hand, is already mostly urbanized, so its growth rate is quite low, maybe around 0.5% or even negative in some countries.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about any other factors that might influence this.\n\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic might have affected urbanization trends, perhaps slowing down migration to cities in some regions.\n\nBut I think that's a temporary factor, and long-term trends are likely to continue.\n\nAlso, economic developments can influence urbanization. If a region is experiencing economic growth, that might attract more people to cities.\n\nSimilarly, if there are policies that restrict or encourage urban growth, that could affect the rate of urbanization.\n\nBut generally speaking, based on recent data and trends, Sub-Saharan Africa seems to be the region with the highest urbanization growth rate.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C. Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Sub-Saharan Africa}} \\]"
