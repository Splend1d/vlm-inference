The question is asking which of these options\u2014superstition, classical conditioning, operant aversive conditioning, or modeling\u2014best explains his behavior in this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Superstition: This is a belief or practice resulting from ignorance or fear of the unknown, often without any logical basis. It's about attributing causal relationships where none exist.\n\nB. Classical conditioning: This is a type of learning where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus to elicit a similar response. For example, Pavlov's dogs learned to salivate at the sound of a bell because it was associated with food.\n\nC. Operant aversive conditioning: This seems a bit tricky. Operant conditioning is about how consequences affect behavior. Positive reinforcement increases a behavior, while negative reinforcement removes an unpleasant stimulus to increase a behavior. Aversive conditioning might involve punishment, which decreases a behavior by introducing an unpleasant consequence.\n\nD. Modeling: This is when someone learns a behavior by observing another person perform it. It's about imitation and learning through example.\n\nNow, let's think about the scenario: My little cousin sees me using the computer and then, when I get up, he tries to use the keyboard.\n\nOption A: Superstition\u2014Does his behavior stem from a belief that using the keyboard has some magical or unclear benefit? Probably not. He likely sees me doing it and wants to imitate me.\n\nOption B: Classical conditioning\u2014Is there a neutral stimulus becoming associated with a meaningful one? Maybe if using the computer is associated with something rewarding, but I'm not sure if that fits here.\n\nOption C: Operant aversive conditioning\u2014If he's been punished for using the keyboard before, maybe he's learned not to do it. But the question says he tries to use it when I get up, which suggests he wants to use it, not avoid it.\n\nOption D: Modeling\u2014This seems the most straightforward. He sees me using the computer and wants to do the same, so he imitates my behavior.\n\nLet me consider this further. Maybe he associates the computer with entertainment or learning, which could be a form of classical conditioning, but the act of him trying to use it when I get up seems more about imitation than association.\n\nAlso, if it were operant conditioning, there would need to be some reinforcement or punishment related to his behavior. But the scenario doesn't mention any consequences for him trying to use the keyboard.\n\nSuperstition doesn't seem to fit because his behavior is likely based on observation and imitation, not on irrational beliefs.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is modeling. He sees me using the computer and tries to imitate that behavior when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. modeling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
