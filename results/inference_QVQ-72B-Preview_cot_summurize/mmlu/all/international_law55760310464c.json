                    "text": "So I have this question about the jurisdiction of international tribunals and how it relates to national courts. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nOption A says that the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts are also common to international tribunals. Hmm, but I think there are some differences between how national courts and international tribunals operate. National courts are part of a country's legal system, and their jurisdiction is usually based on territory or nationality. International tribunals, on the other hand, deal with disputes between states or other international entities, and their jurisdiction might be based on different principles, like consent of the parties involved.\n\nOption B claims that the jurisdiction of all international tribunals is regulated by the UN Security Council. That seems too broad. While the UN Security Council does play a role in some international legal proceedings, especially those related to peace and security, not all international tribunals are under its control. For example, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is not directly regulated by the Security Council, even though both are parts of the UN system.\n\nOption C suggests that international tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts. This sounds more plausible. There are certainly similarities, like the concept of personal jurisdiction or subject-matter jurisdiction, which exist in both systems. However, international tribunals often rely on the consent of the states or parties involved to establish their jurisdiction, which might not be as strictly applied in national courts.\n\nOption D states that the jurisdiction of international tribunals is dictated solely by their founding treaties. While it's true that treaties often define the scope and jurisdiction of international tribunals, it's not the only factor. For instance, the Statute of the International Court of Justice outlines its jurisdiction, but the ICJ also has certain inherent powers and can hear cases based on agreements between states.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think Option C is the most accurate. International tribunals do share some jurisdictional principles with national courts, but there are also significant differences due to the nature of international law and the consent-based nature of their jurisdiction.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. In national legal systems, jurisdiction is often based on territoriality or nationality, meaning that a court has authority over cases that occur within its territory or involve its nationals. International tribunals, however, typically require the consent of the parties to the dispute to exercise jurisdiction. This could be through specific treaties, declarations accepting jurisdiction, or special agreements.\n\nAdditionally, some international tribunals have more defined mandates based on their founding documents. For example, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction over specific crimes as outlined in the Rome Statute, which is its founding treaty. Similarly, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) handles disputes based on the consent of the parties and the rules agreed upon by them.\n\nSo, while there are similarities in jurisdictional principles, such as the need to have some connection to the parties or the subject matter, the way these principles are applied differs between national courts and international tribunals.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the best answer is C: International tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
