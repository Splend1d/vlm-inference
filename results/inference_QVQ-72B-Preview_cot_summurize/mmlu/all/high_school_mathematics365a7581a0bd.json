                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem that says g(x) = f(\u2013x) for all real numbers x, and that (3, 2) is a point on the graph of g. It's asking which of the following points must be on the graph of f: (3, 2), (3, \u20132), (\u20133, 2), or (\u20133, \u20132).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for g(x) to be equal to f(\u2013x). So, g(x) is defined in terms of f, but with the input negated. That means that for any x, the value of g at x is the same as the value of f at \u2013x.\n\nNow, I know that (3, 2) is on the graph of g. That means that when x = 3, g(3) = 2. So, g(3) = f(\u20133) = 2. Wait, that seems straightforward. If g(3) = f(\u20133), then f(\u20133) must be equal to 2. So, that would mean that the point (\u20133, 2) is on the graph of f.\n\nIs that all there is to it? It seems almost too simple. Let me double-check. If g(x) = f(\u2013x), and (3, 2) is on the graph of g, then plugging in x = 3 into g gives g(3) = 2, which implies that f(\u20133) = 2. Therefore, the point (\u20133, 2) must be on the graph of f.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here that I'm missing. It's a direct application of the definition given. So, the correct answer should be C. (\u20133, 2).\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. (3, 2): Just because (3, 2) is on g doesn't mean that (3, 2) is on f. There's no direct relationship given between g and f at x = 3 except through the definition g(x) = f(\u2013x).\n\nB. (3, \u20132): This would suggest that f(3) = \u20132, but we don't have any information about f at x = 3, only about f at x = \u20133.\n\nD. (\u20133, \u20132): Again, since g(3) = f(\u20133) = 2, that means f(\u20133) = 2, not \u20132.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that C. (\u20133, 2) is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
