                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: 50.0 mL of 0.0025 M HBr is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.0023 M KOH, and I need to find the pH of the resulting mixture. The options are A. 1, B. 4, C. 5, D. 11.\n\nFirst off, I know that HBr is a strong acid and KOH is a strong base. When a strong acid and a strong base react, they neutralize each other to form water and a salt. But in this case, they're not being mixed in exactly equal amounts, so there might be an excess of one or the other, which will affect the pH.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of moles of HBr and KOH.\n\nFor HBr:\n\nVolume = 50.0 mL = 0.050 L\n\nConcentration = 0.0025 M\n\nNumber of moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume = 0.0025 mol/L \u00d7 0.050 L = 0.000125 moles\n\nFor KOH:\n\nVolume = 50.0 mL = 0.050 L\n\nConcentration = 0.0023 M\n\nNumber of moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume = 0.0023 mol/L \u00d7 0.050 L = 0.000115 moles\n\nSo, moles of HBr = 0.000125 mol\n\nMoles of KOH = 0.000115 mol\n\nSince HBr and KOH react in a 1:1 ratio, the amount of KOH is less than HBr, meaning that HBr is in excess.\n\nThe total volume of the mixture is 50.0 mL + 50.0 mL = 100.0 mL = 0.100 L\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much HBr is left after reacting with KOH.\n\nAmount of HBr that reacted = moles of KOH = 0.000115 mol\n\nTherefore, excess moles of HBr = total moles of HBr - moles of KOH = 0.000125 mol - 0.000115 mol = 0.000010 mol\n\nNow, the concentration of excess HBr in the final solution is:\n\n[HBr] = moles of excess HBr / total volume = 0.000010 mol / 0.100 L = 0.0001 M\n\nSince HBr is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate in water to give H+ ions. So, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of excess HBr.\n\n[H+] = 0.0001 M\n\nNow, to find the pH, I use the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\npH = -log(0.0001)\n\nlog(0.0001) = -4\n\nSo, pH = -(-4) = 4\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting mixture is 4.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 11\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 4.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of HBr and KOH:\n\nMoles of HBr = 0.0025 M \u00d7 0.050 L = 0.000125 mol\n\nMoles of KOH = 0.0023 M \u00d7 0.050 L = 0.000115 mol\n\nExcess moles of HBr = 0.000125 - 0.000115 = 0.000010 mol\n\nTotal volume = 100.0 mL = 0.100 L\n\nConcentration of excess HBr = 0.000010 mol / 0.100 L = 0.0001 M\n\npH = -log(0.0001) = 4\n\nEverything seems correct. So, the answer should be B. 4.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using the pOH or something, but no, since we're dealing with acid and base, and we have excess acid, pH should be less than 7, which it is.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might consider the reaction going to completion and then see if there's any excess, but in this case, since both are strong, the reaction goes to completion, and we've already accounted for that.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the equivalence point, but since they are not at equimolar concentrations, there is no equivalence point in this scenario.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the calculation is correct. The pH should be 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
