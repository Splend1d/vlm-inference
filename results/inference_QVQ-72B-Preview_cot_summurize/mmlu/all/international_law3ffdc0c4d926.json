                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what defines a 'rock' under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). There are a few options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see.\n\nFirst, option A says that rocks are islands that are less than 10 square miles. Hmm, that sounds a bit vague. I don't think size is the only determining factor. There must be more to it than just the area of the island.\n\nOption B says that rocks are islands that do not have any maritime zone. Well, I know that islands generally have their own territorial seas and possibly exclusive economic zones (EEZs), but I wonder if 'rocks' are treated differently.\n\nOption C is a bit longer: it says that rocks are islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and, according to Article 121(3) of UNCLOS, have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf. That seems pretty specific and detailed.\n\nOption D says that rocks are small islands that can sustain human habitation. That contradicts part of option C, which says they cannot sustain human habitation.\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what UNCLOS says about rocks. I remember that Article 121 of UNCLOS defines what constitutes an island. Let me try to recall the exact wording.\n\nArticle 121(1) defines an island as a naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide. But that's for islands in general.\n\nThen, Article 121(2) says that islands have their own territorial sea, contiguous zone, EEZ, and continental shelf, provided they can sustain human habitation or have economic life of their own.\n\nNow, Article 121(3) specifies that rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or have economic life of their own shall have no EEZ or continental shelf. So, these rocks only have a territorial sea, which cannot exceed 12 nautical miles from the baseline.\n\nWait a minute, option C says they have no EEZ or continental shelf, which matches with Article 121(3). But option D says they can sustain human habitation, which would actually make them qualify for an EEZ and continental shelf under Article 121(2).\n\nSo, if I'm correct, option C is accurate, and option D is not.\n\nOption B says they do not have any maritime zone. But according to Article 121(3), they do have a territorial sea, just not an EEZ or continental shelf. So, option B is incorrect because they do have at least a territorial sea.\n\nOption A mentions size, saying less than 10 square miles. I don't think size is the determining factor under UNCLOS. There might be some guidelines or interpretations that consider size, but it's not the primary criterion in the convention itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: rocks are islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and, according to Article 121(3), have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. If an island can sustain human habitation or has economic life of its own, it qualifies for an EEZ and continental shelf under Article 121(2). If not, then it's considered a rock under Article 121(3) and only has a territorial sea.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, option C is the accurate definition of a 'rock' under UNCLOS.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
