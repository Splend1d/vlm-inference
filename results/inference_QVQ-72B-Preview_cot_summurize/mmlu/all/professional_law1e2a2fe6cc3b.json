                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what the most likely outcome would be if the intern sues the nurse for contribution. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the background. There's a surgeon who operated on a patient in Marina General Hospital. Assisting the surgeon were an intern and a nurse, both of whom were part of the hospital's staff. After the operation, the patient started experiencing pain that wasn't typical for post-operative recovery. It turned out that the intern and the nurse had improperly bandaged the patient, which constricted some blood vessels, causing acute pain and slowing down the patient's recovery.\n\nThe patient eventually recovered but decided to sue the intern for damages, asking for $20,000. Before the case went to trial, the patient and the intern reached a settlement. The intern paid the patient $12,000, and in exchange, the patient released the intern from any further claims related to the incident.\n\nNow, the question is about what happens if the intern decides to sue the nurse for contribution. Contribution is a legal concept where, when multiple parties are liable for the same harm, one who has paid more than their fair share can seek to recover some of that amount from the others.\n\nSo, the options are:\n\nA. Prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.\n\nB. Prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur.\n\nC. Not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: Prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.\n\nIs this accurate? I need to check if settling without a judgment affects the right to seek contribution. Generally, in many legal systems, including American law, when multiple tortfeasors are involved, one who pays more than their share can seek contribution from others. But does settling without a judgment impact this right?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, settling a claim may affect the right to seek contribution, especially if the settlement releases not only the paying party but also other potential tortfeasors. However, typically, settling without a judgment doesn't preclude seeking contribution from non-settling parties, provided that the settlement doesn't release those parties.\n\nIn this case, the patient released the intern from all further claims, but didn't mention the nurse. So, the settlement was specifically between the patient and the intern, and the nurse wasn't a party to it. Therefore, the intern should still be able to seek contribution from the nurse for the amount paid to the patient, assuming the nurse was also at fault.\n\nBut wait, option C says the opposite: Not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.\n\nThis seems contradictory to what I just thought. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. Let me think again.\n\nIn many contribution doctrines, settling parties can still seek contribution from non-settling parties, especially if the settlement doesn't release the non-settling parties. So, in this scenario, since the patient only released the intern, the intern should still be able to seek contribution from the nurse.\n\nPerhaps option A is correct.\n\nBut let's look at option B: Prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur is a doctrine that allows for the inference of negligence in certain circumstances where the harm wouldn't have occurred without someone's negligence, and the defendant had exclusive control over the instrumentality that caused the harm.\n\nIn this case, the harm was caused by improper bandaging, which constricted blood vessels. Both the intern and the nurse were involved in the bandaging. So, if the patient had sued both, res ipsa loquitur might have been applicable to infer negligence on their part.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the patient only sued the intern, and the intern settled. The nurse wasn't a party to that lawsuit or settlement. So, does that mean the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur? Not necessarily, because the nurse wasn't a party to the original lawsuit or the settlement.\n\nMaybe the intern can argue that since both were involved in the bandaging, and the harm occurred, res ipsa loquitur establishes the nurse's liability. But I'm not sure if that's a strong enough basis for contribution, especially since the nurse wasn't a party to the original case.\n\nPerhaps option B isn't the best choice.\n\nMoving on to option C: Not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.\n\nAs I thought earlier, this seems contrary to general contribution principles. Settling without a judgment typically doesn't preclude seeking contribution from non-settling parties, unless the settlement agreement specifically releases those parties.\n\nIn this scenario, the settlement was between the intern and the patient, and it released the intern from further claims. It doesn't mention the nurse, so the nurse's liability remains unaffected by the settlement.\n\nTherefore, option C seems incorrect.\n\nFinally, option D: Not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.\n\nIndemnification is different from contribution. Indemnification involves one party being fully responsible for the loss and reimbursing another party who was required to pay for it. Contribution, on the other hand, involves multiple parties who are jointly liable, each paying their fair share.\n\nIn this case, both the intern and the nurse were involved in the improper bandaging, so their liability is joint. Therefore, if the intern paid more than their share, they should be able to seek contribution from the nurse, not indemnification.\n\nUnless there's some specific reason to believe that the nurse should indemnify the intern fully, which isn't indicated in the scenario, contribution seems like the appropriate remedy.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option A seems to be the most accurate: Prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check some key points.\n\nFirst, in the settlement, the patient released the intern from all further claims arising out of the incident. This suggests that the intern is no longer liable to the patient for any additional damages related to this incident. However, it doesn't release the nurse from any potential liability to the patient, nor does it affect the intern's right to seek contribution from the nurse.\n\nSecond, the nurse was not a party to the settlement, so her liability remains unaffected by the settlement agreement.\n\nTherefore, the intern should be able to seek contribution from the nurse for the amount paid to the patient, assuming that the nurse was also at fault and that the payment by the intern was more than what the intern should have paid based on their share of liability.\n\nOption B seems less likely because res ipsa loquitur might establish liability in the original lawsuit, but it doesn't directly apply to the contribution action between the intern and the nurse.\n\nOption C is contrary to general contribution principles.\n\nOption D suggests indemnification is the proper remedy, but that doesn't seem to align with the facts given, as both parties were involved in the negligent act.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is that the intern will prevail in seeking contribution from the nurse.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
