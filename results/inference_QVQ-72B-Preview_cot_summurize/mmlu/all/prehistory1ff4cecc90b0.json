                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The Pleistocene epoch lasted until how long ago?\" and there are four options to choose from: A. 1,000,000 years, B. 100,000 years, C. 10,000 years, D. 1,000 years. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Pleistocene is a geological epoch in the history of Earth. It's part of the Ice Age, right? I think it's when the glaciers were really active, covering large parts of the planet. But when did it end? I don't remember off the top of my head.\n\nLet me think about it. I recall that the Pleistocene started about 2.6 million years ago, but when did it finish? I think it ended around 11,700 years ago, give or take a few hundred years. Wait, is that right? Let me see if I can recall more accurately.\n\nI think the Pleistocene ended around 11,700 years ago, which marks the boundary between the Pleistocene and the current Holocene epoch. So, if that's the case, then option C. 10,000 years would be the closest answer.\n\nBut I should double-check because I might be confusing it with another date. Let me consider the context. The last glacial maximum was around 20,000 to 25,000 years ago, and then the ice sheets started retreating as the climate warmed. The Pleistocene ended when the Earth entered a warmer period, the Holocene, which is when human civilizations started to develop more rapidly.\n\nSo, if the Pleistocene ended around 11,700 years ago, then 10,000 years is pretty close to that. Maybe the exact number isn't listed here, but among the options, 10,000 years is the nearest.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other information that could influence my choice. I know that the Maya civilization had their calendar end around 12,000 years ago, but I'm not sure about the exact correlation with the Pleistocene.\n\nAlso, I remember that the Younger Dryas was a brief cold period that occurred around 12,900 to 11,700 years ago, which might coincide with the end of the Pleistocene. So, that seems to align with my earlier thought that the Pleistocene ended around 11,700 years ago.\n\nGiven that, I think option C. 10,000 years is the best answer among the choices provided. Even though it's not perfectly precise, it's the closest to the actual figure I can recall.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap what I know about the Pleistocene epoch. It's characterized by repeated glacial advances and retreats, known as ice ages. Humans evolved during this time, and many large mammals like woolly mammoths and sabertooth tigers were prevalent.\n\nThe transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene was a significant shift in Earth's climate, marking the end of the last ice age and the beginning of a warmer, more stable climate that allowed for the development of agriculture and settled communities.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'm fairly confident that the Pleistocene epoch ended around 11,700 years ago, which makes 10,000 years the closest approximation among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
