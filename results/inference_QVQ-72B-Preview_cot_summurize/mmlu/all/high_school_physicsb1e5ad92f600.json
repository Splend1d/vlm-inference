                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about standing waves on a string. There's a 100-Hz generator producing standing waves, and then the tension in the string is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced. I need to figure out whether the wavelength of these new standing waves is greater than or less than the original ones. And there are four options to choose from, each with some explanation about tension, wave speed, and wavelength.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic relationships about waves on a string. I know that the speed of a wave on a string depends on the tension (T) and the linear density (\u03bc) of the string. The formula is:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\]\n\nSo, if I increase the tension (T), the wave speed (v) increases because it's directly proportional to the square root of T.\n\nNow, for standing waves on a string fixed at both ends, the wavelength of the possible standing waves depends on the length of the string (L) and the harmonic number (n). The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n} \\]\n\nwhere n is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), representing the harmonic.\n\nThe frequency (f) of the standing wave is related to the wave speed (v) and the wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nCombining these, I can express the frequency in terms of tension and length:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}}{\\frac{2L}{n}} = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\]\n\nIn the problem, the generator has a fixed frequency of 100 Hz. So, as I increase the tension, the wave speed increases, but the wavelength also changes depending on which harmonic is being excited.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"a new set of standing waves is produced.\" Does this mean that the harmonic number n changes when the tension is increased?\n\nI think I need to think about how changing the tension affects the possible wavelengths and frequencies of the standing waves.\n\nLet me consider the fundamental frequency (n=1) first. For the fundamental, the wavelength is:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_1 = 2L \\]\n\nAnd the frequency is:\n\n\\[ f_1 = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\]\n\nIf I increase the tension, the frequency of the fundamental increases because of the square root term.\n\nBut the generator is fixed at 100 Hz. So, if the fundamental frequency changes with tension, but the generator's frequency is fixed, maybe the harmonic being excited changes.\n\nWait, perhaps the generator is still producing the same frequency, but because the wave speed changes with tension, the wavelength changes, and thus the harmonic number changes to match the fixed frequency.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's think about the relationship between tension, wave speed, and wavelength more directly.\n\nGiven that \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\), and \\( f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\), I can solve for \u03bb:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}}{f} \\]\n\nSo, \u03bb is inversely proportional to the square root of T, assuming \u03bc and f are constant.\n\nBut in this problem, when tension increases, does f stay constant? The generator is still producing 100 Hz, but the possible standing waves on the string have specific frequencies determined by the tension and length.\n\nI think I need to consider that the generator will excite the harmonic whose frequency matches its own frequency of 100 Hz.\n\nSo, as tension increases, the possible frequencies of the harmonics change, and the generator will couple to whichever harmonic's frequency is closest to 100 Hz.\n\nBut in reality, if the tension changes, the fundamental frequency changes, and thus the harmonics' frequencies change.\n\nLet me assume that the generator is fixed at 100 Hz, and when tension increases, the fundamental frequency increases, which would mean that higher harmonics could be excited.\n\nWait, let's calculate the fundamental frequency in terms of tension.\n\nFrom \\( f_1 = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\), if T increases, f1 increases.\n\nSo, if the generator is at 100 Hz, and T increases, f1 increases, meaning that the harmonic number n that matches the generator's frequency changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between tension and wavelength directly.\n\nFrom \\( \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} \\), and \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}}{f} \\]\n\nIf f is fixed, then \u03bb is proportional to the square root of T.\n\nBut in this problem, f is fixed at 100 Hz, so if T increases, \u03bb increases.\n\nWait, but that would suggest that the wavelength gets larger, which seems counterintuitive.\n\nLet me check this with an example. Suppose the original tension is T, and the new tension is 4T.\n\nThen, the wave speed increases by a factor of 2, since \\( v \\propto \\sqrt{T} \\).\n\nIf f remains 100 Hz, then \\( \\lambda_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{new}}}{f} = 2 \\times \\frac{v_{\\text{original}}}{f} = 2 \\lambda_{\\text{original}} \\).\n\nSo, the wavelength doubles.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"a new set of standing waves is produced,\" which might imply that the harmonic number changes.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that when tension increases, the possible wavelengths change, and the generator might excite a different harmonic.\n\nLet me think about the possible wavelengths on the string.\n\nFor a string fixed at both ends, the possible wavelengths are \\( \\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n} \\), where n is an integer.\n\nThe corresponding frequencies are \\( f_n = \\frac{n}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\).\n\nIf the generator is at 100 Hz, it will excite the harmonic where \\( f_n = 100 \\) Hz.\n\nSo, \\( n = \\frac{2L \\times 100}{\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}} \\).\n\nWhen T increases, the denominator increases, so n decreases.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom \\( n = \\frac{2L \\times 100}{\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}} \\), if T increases, n decreases.\n\nSo, as tension increases, the generator excites a lower harmonic.\n\nBut from \\( \\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n} \\), if n decreases, \u03bb increases.\n\nTherefore, the new standing waves have a larger wavelength than the original ones.\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier conclusion that \u03bb increases with T when f is constant.\n\nBut let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nB. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nC. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nD. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nFrom my reasoning, the wavelength increases when tension increases, so options A and D suggest the wavelength decreases, which I think is incorrect based on my reasoning.\n\nOptions B and C both suggest the wavelength increases, but they differ in the relationships they cite.\n\nOption B says \"greater, because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies inversely with wavelength.\"\n\nFrom \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\), v increases with T, which is correct.\n\nThen, from \\( f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\), if f is constant, \\( \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} \\), so \u03bb increases with v, which is also correct.\n\nOption C says \"greater, because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies directly with wavelength.\"\n\nBut according to \\( \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} \\), if f is constant, \u03bb increases with v, but it's not that T varies directly with \u03bb, but rather T varies directly with v, and v varies directly with \u03bb when f is constant.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is more accurate in its description.\n\nBut the main point is that the wavelength increases when tension increases, assuming frequency remains constant.\n\nHowever, in the problem, the generator is fixed at 100 Hz, but the possible standing waves have specific frequencies that depend on T.\n\nSo, when T increases, the fundamental frequency increases, and thus higher harmonics have higher frequencies.\n\nTherefore, to match the generator's 100 Hz, the harmonic number n must adjust.\n\nFrom \\( f_n = n \\times f_1 = n \\times \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\), if T increases, f1 increases, so for fn to be 100 Hz, n must decrease.\n\nAs n decreases, \\( \\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n} \\) increases.\n\nTherefore, the new standing waves have a larger wavelength than the original ones.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B: Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose the original tension is T, and the new tension is 4T.\n\nThen, the wave speed increases by a factor of 2.\n\nIf originally, the fundamental frequency is f1 = 100 Hz, then with T quadrupled, the new fundamental frequency is f1_new = 2 \u00d7 100 Hz = 200 Hz.\n\nBut the generator is still at 100 Hz, so it would excite the first harmonic (n=1) at 100 Hz, but now the first harmonic is at 200 Hz.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, original T: f1 = 100 Hz.\n\nNew T: f1_new = \\(\\sqrt{4} = 2\\) \u00d7 100 Hz = 200 Hz.\n\nBut the generator is still at 100 Hz, which is now half of the new fundamental frequency.\n\nSo, the generator would excite the second harmonic, where f2 = 2 \u00d7 f1_new = 400 Hz, but that's higher than the generator's 100 Hz, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that the generator's frequency must match one of the possible standing wave frequencies of the string at the new tension.\n\nOriginally, at tension T, f1 = 100 Hz.\n\nWhen tension increases to 4T, f1_new = 200 Hz.\n\nNow, the generator is still at 100 Hz, which is now equal to f0.5, but harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental.\n\nSo, perhaps the generator now excites the n=0.5 harmonic, but that doesn't make sense because n must be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it excites the first subharmonic, but that's not standard.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the generator can only excite harmonics where f_n = n \u00d7 f1, and if f1 increases, then the harmonic number n that matches the generator's frequency decreases.\n\nSo, originally, n \u00d7 f1 = 100 Hz, with f1 = 100 Hz, so n=1.\n\nWith new tension, f1_new = 200 Hz, then n \u00d7 200 = 100 \u21d2 n=0.5, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the generator can't excite any harmonic at the new tension because none of the possible f_n match 100 Hz.\n\nBut in reality, the generator would couple to the harmonic whose frequency is closest to 100 Hz.\n\nSo, if f1_new = 200 Hz, then the first harmonic is 200 Hz, which is higher than 100 Hz.\n\nThe second harmonic would be 400 Hz, which is even higher.\n\nSo, perhaps no standing waves can be produced at 100 Hz when tension is increased to 4T.\n\nBut that seems unlikely; maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can have standing waves at frequencies that are not exact multiples of the fundamental due to non-idealities, but let's assume ideal conditions.\n\nIn ideal conditions, standing waves on a string fixed at both ends can only exist at frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nSo, if the fundamental frequency increases to 200 Hz, then the possible frequencies are 200 Hz, 400 Hz, 600 Hz, etc.\n\nThe generator is at 100 Hz, which doesn't match any of these, so perhaps no standing waves can be produced.\n\nBut the problem states that \"a new set of standing waves is produced,\" which suggests that standing waves do form at the new tension.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the generator can excite standing waves if its frequency is a submultiple of one of the harmonics.\n\nIn other words, if the generator's frequency is half of the first harmonic, for example.\n\nIn this case, if the new fundamental frequency is 200 Hz, then 100 Hz is half of that, which could excite a standing wave pattern corresponding to two loops, or n=2.\n\nWait, but n=2 corresponds to the second harmonic, which is at 400 Hz, not 100 Hz.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the generator can excite a standing wave where the frequency is below the fundamental, but that doesn't make much sense in standard wave theory.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the problem differently.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between tension, wave speed, and wavelength again.\n\nGiven that \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\), and \\( f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\), then \\( \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} \\).\n\nIf f is fixed at 100 Hz, and T increases, v increases, so \u03bb increases.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the standing waves increases when tension increases.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nThis suggests that wavelength decreases with increasing tension, which contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nB. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nThis suggests that wavelength increases with increasing tension, which matches my conclusion.\n\nC. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nThis suggests that both wave speed and wavelength increase with tension, but according to \\( \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} \\), if f is constant, \u03bb increases with v, but it's not that T varies directly with \u03bb, but rather T varies directly with v, and v varies directly with \u03bb when f is constant.\n\nD. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nThis suggests that wavelength decreases with increasing tension, which again contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the relationship between tension and wavelength more carefully.\n\nFrom \\( \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f} \\), and \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}}{f} \\]\n\nIf f is constant, then \\( \\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{T} \\).\n\nTherefore, increasing T increases \u03bb.\n\nThis reinforces that the wavelength increases with increasing tension.\n\nThus, the new standing waves will have a greater wavelength than the original standing waves.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
