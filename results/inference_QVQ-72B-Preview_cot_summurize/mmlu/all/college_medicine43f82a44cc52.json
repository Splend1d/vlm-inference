                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The coding sequences of genes are called:\" and the options are A. extrons, B. exons, C. introns, D. codons. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that genes are segments of DNA that carry the instructions for making proteins. These instructions are coded in the DNA sequence, and there are parts of the gene that actually code for the protein, while other parts don't. So, the coding sequences should be the parts that directly instruct the cell on how to make the protein.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Extrons: I don't recall this term. Maybe it's a typo or something? I think the correct term might be \"exons,\" but I'm not sure. Let me check.\n\nB. Exons: Yes, I've heard of exons. They are the parts of the gene that code for the protein. The name \"exon\" comes from \"expressed regions,\" because these segments are expressed in the final mRNA and translated into protein. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nC. Introns: These are the parts of the gene that don't code for the protein. They are spliced out during mRNA processing. So, they are non-coding sequences. Therefore, they aren't the coding sequences.\n\nD. Codons: These are specific sequences of three nucleotides that code for a particular amino acid. So, codons are part of the coding sequence, but they are not the entire coding sequence; they are the units within the coding sequence that specify amino acids.\n\nSo, if I have to choose between exons and codons, exons are the entire coding regions, while codons are the specific triplets within those coding regions that specify amino acids. Therefore, exons are the coding sequences of genes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe extrons is a misprint for exons. I think exons are indeed the coding sequences because they are the parts of the gene that are expressed in the protein.\n\nLet me double-check. In eukaryotic genes, the DNA is often split into exons and introns. During transcription, the entire gene is transcribed into pre-mRNA, which then undergoes splicing where the introns are removed, and the exons are joined together to form the mature mRNA that is translated into protein.\n\nSo, the exons are the coding sequences because they are the parts that actually code for the protein sequence.\n\nCodons are just the three-letter codes within the exons that specify each amino acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. exons.\n\nI think A. extrons is probably a typo or a misprint, and it should be exons instead.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other possibility. In prokaryotes, genes don't have introns, but they still have coding sequences that correspond to exons in eukaryotes.\n\nAlso, in some genes, there are coding and non-coding regions, and the coding regions are the exons.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is B. exons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
