                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Alice has 8 buckets, and each bucket has t tennis balls in it. Altogether, there are 56 tennis balls in all the buckets. I need to find out which number sentence shows how to find t, the number of tennis balls in each bucket.\n\nLet me see. I have four options:\n\nA. 8 \u00f7 t = 56\n\nB. 8 \u00d7 t = 56\n\nC. t + 8 = 56\n\nD. t \u00f7 8 = 56\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that there are 8 buckets, and each bucket contains t tennis balls. So, the total number of tennis balls would be the number of buckets times the number of tennis balls in each bucket. That sounds like basic multiplication, right?\n\nSo, total tennis balls = number of buckets \u00d7 number of tennis balls per bucket.\n\nPlugging in the numbers I have: total tennis balls is 56, number of buckets is 8, and number of tennis balls per bucket is t.\n\nSo, 56 = 8 \u00d7 t.\n\nWait, that looks like option B.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to look at it.\n\nMaybe I can think about division instead of multiplication. If I have 56 tennis balls in total and 8 buckets, then to find the number of tennis balls per bucket, I could divide the total number of tennis balls by the number of buckets.\n\nSo, t = 56 \u00f7 8.\n\nBut which option represents that?\n\nOption A is 8 \u00f7 t = 56, which doesn't match.\n\nOption D is t \u00f7 8 = 56, which also doesn't match.\n\nOption C is t + 8 = 56, which suggests that adding the number of tennis balls per bucket and the number of buckets gives the total, which doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nSo, going back to my first thought, 56 = 8 \u00d7 t, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, I also thought about t = 56 \u00f7 8. That's another way to express the same relationship.\n\nSo, if t = 56 \u00f7 8, then multiplying both sides by 8 would give 8t = 56, which is the same as 8 \u00d7 t = 56.\n\nSo, both ways lead me back to option B.\n\nMaybe I should try plugging in a number to see if it works.\n\nSuppose t = 7. Then, 8 \u00d7 7 = 56, which checks out because 8 times 7 is indeed 56.\n\nOr, if t = 6, then 8 \u00d7 6 = 48, which is less than 56.\n\nOr, if t = 8, then 8 \u00d7 8 = 64, which is more than 56.\n\nSo, t = 7 is the correct number of tennis balls per bucket.\n\nBut the question isn't asking for the value of t, just which number sentence shows how to find t.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that the number of tennis balls per bucket isn't constant? The problem says \"each bucket has t tennis balls in it,\" which implies that each bucket has the same number of tennis balls.\n\nSo, no, it's safe to assume that t is the same for each bucket.\n\nTherefore, the total number of tennis balls is indeed 8 times t.\n\nSo, the correct number sentence is 8 \u00d7 t = 56.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
