                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a state that built a racetrack using bond financing. The bonds were repaid through admission charges, with specific rules for how much per ticket goes to repayment in the first five years and then potentially the next five years if needed. After two years of operation, the state legislature passed a law that requires the racetrack to admit senior citizens over 65 for a discounted admission fee of 50 cents. The question is whether this law is probably constitutional or unconstitutional, and it gives four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The racetrack was built with public money through bonds, and there's a bond agreement that dictates how the repayment is handled. The agreement says that for the first five years, at least $2 from each admission charge should be used to repay the bond debt. If the proceeds from admission charges in those first five years aren't enough to repay the bonds, then for the next five years, at least $1 from each admission charge should be used to make up the difference.\n\nNow, after two years of operation, which is within the first five years, the legislature passes a law that mandates a discounted admission fee for seniors over 65 at 50 cents. This could potentially affect the revenue from admission charges, which in turn could impact the repayment of the bond debt as per the bond agreement.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\n\nB. Unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.\n\nI need to consider which of these is most likely correct.\n\nLet's start with option A: constitutional because it's a justifiable exercise of the state's police power. Police power refers to the state's authority to regulate for the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of its citizens. Providing a discount for seniors could be seen as a benefit for elderly citizens, perhaps recognizing their contributions or addressing their potentially limited incomes. However, I need to think about whether this is a justifiable exercise in this specific context. The racetrack was built with bond financing that relies on admission charges for repayment. Imposing a discount for seniors could reduce the revenue from admissions, which might affect the ability to repay the bonds as agreed. This could potentially interfere with the contract between the bondholders and the state. So, while the state has police power, using it in a way that interferes with existing contracts might be problematic.\n\nOption B: unconstitutional because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law. Equal protection is a principle derived from the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which requires states to treat all persons equally under the law. By providing a discount based on age, the law is creating a classification that treats seniors over 65 differently from those under 65. Whether this constitutes a denial of equal protection depends on the level of scrutiny applied by the court. Age-based classifications are generally subject to rational basis review, which is the least stringent level of scrutiny. Under rational basis review, the classification is permissible if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Providing benefits to seniors is often considered legitimate due to their age and potential needs. So, it's possible that this classification could be upheld under equal protection.\n\nOption C: unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract. The Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from passing any law that impairs the obligation of contracts. The bond agreement specifies how the repayment is to be handled through admission charges. If the new law reduces the admission charges for seniors, it could reduce the revenue available for bond repayment, potentially impairing the bondholders' ability to receive their contracted payments. This could be seen as an impairment of the contract, making the law unconstitutional under the Contract Clause.\n\nOption D: unconstitutional because it is an ex post facto law. Ex post facto laws are laws that criminalize actions that were legal when committed or that increase the penalties for crimes after they were committed. They are prohibited by the Constitution. In this scenario, the law in question is about admission fees for a racetrack, not about criminal penalties or retroactively changing laws related to crimes. So, this option doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems the most relevant. The law could be seen as impairing the obligation of the bondholders' contract by potentially reducing the revenue from admission charges, which are crucial for repaying the bonds as agreed. While option B is also a possibility, age-based classifications are often upheld under rational basis review, making it less likely that this law would be struck down on equal protection grounds. Option A suggests it's constitutional based on police power, but as I thought earlier, the interference with the contract might override the exercise of police power in this case. Option D doesn't apply because the law isn't about criminal matters.\n\nTherefore, the most probable answer is option C: unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
