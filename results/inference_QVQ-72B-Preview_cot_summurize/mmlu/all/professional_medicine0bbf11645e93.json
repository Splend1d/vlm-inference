She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months. She is a college student who is in good health, has not had any medical illnesses or surgery, and has never been pregnant. She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception. She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6 months ago. She also notes that she has gained about 9 kg (20 lb) in the past 6 months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen. She has been somewhat depressed about this, and her grades have declined. She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married. Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen, and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries. This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following?\n\nA. Androgen-producing ovarian tumor\nB. Cushing syndrome\nC. Hypothyroidism\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this case of a 19-year-old woman who hasn't had a menstrual period for the past six months. She's been sexually active but using barrier contraception, so pregnancy is unlikely. She's also gained about 9 kilograms in the last six months and has been experiencing more acne and increased hair growth on her thighs and abdomen. She's feeling depressed about these changes, and her grades have dropped. One of her sisters had a similar issue before getting married.\n\nOn physical exam, she's mildly obese with scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on her abdomen, and slightly enlarged uterus and ovaries.\n\nI need to figure out what's going on here. The options are an androgen-producing ovarian tumor, Cushing syndrome, hypothyroidism, or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n\nFirst, let's consider the symptoms:\n\n1. Amenorrhea (no menstrual periods for six months)\n\n2. Weight gain (9 kg in six months)\n\n3. Acne\n\n4. Increased hair growth (hirsutism) in male pattern on thighs and abdomen\n\n5. Mild obesity\n\n6. Enlarged uterus and ovaries\n\n7. Family history (sister had similar issues)\n\nAlso, she's feeling depressed and her grades have declined, which might be related to the physical changes or emotional stress.\n\nLet's think about each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: Androgen-producing ovarian tumor**\n\n- These tumors produce male hormones (androgens), which can cause amenorrhea, hirsutism, and acne.\n\n- Rapid weight gain is possible, but not specifically typical of these tumors.\n\n- Enlarged ovaries could be consistent with a tumor.\n\n- However, these tumors are relatively rare, and the fact that her sister had similar issues suggests a possible hereditary component, which might make a tumor less likely.\n\n**Option B: Cushing syndrome**\n\n- Cushing syndrome is caused by high levels of cortisol in the body.\n\n- Symptoms can include weight gain, particularly in the face and trunk, acne, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities.\n\n- However, Cushing syndrome is less commonly associated with amenorrhea, and the enlargement of the uterus and ovaries isn't typical.\n\n- It's possible, but maybe not the first thing that comes to mind.\n\n**Option C: Hypothyroidism**\n\n- Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone.\n\n- Symptoms can include weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, and menstrual irregularities, including amenorrhea.\n\n- However, hirsutism is not typically associated with hypothyroidism. In fact, some forms of hypothyroidism can cause hair loss rather than increased hair growth.\n\n- Acne isn't a common symptom of hypothyroidism.\n\n- So, this seems less likely based on the presented symptoms.\n\n**Option D: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)**\n\n- PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age.\n\n- Key features include menstrual irregularities (amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea), hirsutism, acne, and often weight gain.\n\n- It's also associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease if not managed.\n\n- Enlarged ovaries with multiple small cysts are a characteristic finding in PCOS.\n\n- There is often a family history, as her sister had similar issues, suggesting a genetic component.\n\n- Additionally, PCOS can cause depression and anxiety, which might explain her declining grades and mood changes.\n\nGiven all these points, PCOS seems to fit the description best. Let's double-check.\n\n- Amenorrhea: common in PCOS due to hormonal imbalances.\n\n- Weight gain: common, especially central obesity.\n\n- Acne: due to increased androgens.\n\n- Hirsutism: classic sign of androgen excess.\n\n- Enlarged ovaries with cysts: typical finding.\n\n- Family history: suggests a hereditary tendency.\n\n- Psychological impacts: depression and anxiety are common in PCOS patients.\n\nTherefore, PCOS is the most consistent diagnosis based on the presented symptoms and examination findings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
