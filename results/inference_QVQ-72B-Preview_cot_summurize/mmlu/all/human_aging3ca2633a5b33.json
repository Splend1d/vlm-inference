For something that happened a long time ago\n\nC. To do something in the future\n\nD. For the context and source of remembered information\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about what prospective memory is.\n\nI remember learning about prospective memory in my psychology class. It has something to do with remembering to do things in the future, like remembering to go to a doctor's appointment or to mail a letter. So, option C seems like it might be correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Prospective memory sounds like it's about looking ahead or thinking forward, right? So, if it's about memory, it should be related to remembering something in the future.\n\nOption A says \"for some recent event.\" That sounds more like retrospective memory, which is about remembering past events, whether recent or long ago.\n\nOption B is \"for something that happened a long time ago.\" That also seems like retrospective memory, focusing on distant past events.\n\nOption C is \"to do something in the future.\" That aligns with my initial thought about prospective memory being about remembering to do things ahead of time.\n\nOption D is \"for the context and source of remembered information.\" That sounds more like source memory or context-dependent memory, which is about recalling where or when you learned something.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other information that could make another option seem plausible. For example, could prospective memory also involve remembering the context or source of future intentions?\n\nWell, in some cases, yes, when you remember to do something, you might also recall the context that led you to form that intention. But that seems more like an aspect of retrospective memory combined with prospective memory.\n\nLet me try to define prospective memory more clearly. Prospective memory is the ability to remember to perform an intended action at a future time. It involves both retrospective components (remembering the intention) and prospective components (remembering to perform the action at the appropriate time).\n\nSo, again, this points towards option C being the most accurate description.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer. But just to be thorough, I'll consider an example.\n\nSuppose I need to remember to pick up groceries after work tomorrow. That's a future action I need to remember. Prospective memory would be involved in ensuring that I don't forget to do that when the time comes.\n\nIn this case, the memory is for doing something in the future, which matches option C.\n\nIf I were to consider option A, remembering a recent event, that would be more like recalling what happened this morning or last week. That's retrospective memory.\n\nOption B, remembering something from a long time ago, is also retrospective, focusing on distant past events.\n\nOption D, remembering the context and source of information, is about knowing where and when you learned something, which is different from remembering to do something in the future.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, option C is the correct choice.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check a reliable source, like a psychology textbook or a reputable online resource.\n\n[Imagining searching for \"prospective memory definition\"]\n\nOkay, according to my search, prospective memory is indeed defined as \"the memory for intended actions to be performed in the future.\" So, that confirms my understanding.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that prospective memory can be further divided into time-based and event-based subtypes. Time-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform an action at a specific time, like a doctor's appointment at 2 pm. Event-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform an action in response to a specific event, like remembering to buy milk when you see the milk carton is empty.\n\nBut for the purposes of this question, the distinction isn't necessary, as all options seem to be focusing on the general concept of prospective memory.\n\nSo, in conclusion, prospective memory refers to memory to do something in the future. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
