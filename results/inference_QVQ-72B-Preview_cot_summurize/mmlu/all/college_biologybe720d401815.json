                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about mitochondria and chloroplasts in different organisms. The options are about plants, animals, and fungi. I need to figure out which statement is generally true.\n\nFirst, I know that mitochondria are involved in producing energy for the cell, like through cellular respiration. They're kind of like the cell's powerhouses. Chloroplasts, on the other hand, are found in plants and some other organisms, and they're where photosynthesis happens. So, plants use chloroplasts to make their own food using sunlight.\n\nOption A says that plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria, and animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Plants definitely have mitochondria; they need energy too, right? And animals don't have chloroplasts because they don't perform photosynthesis. So, I think A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says that plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria, and fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. Again, I'm pretty sure plants have mitochondria. As for fungi, they are similar to animals in that they don't perform photosynthesis, so they shouldn't have chloroplasts. They do have mitochondria though. So, this option also seems off.\n\nOption C says that plants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria, and animals have only mitochondria. This contradicts what I know about plants and fungi. Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria, and fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. Animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts. So, this option is also incorrect.\n\nOption D says that plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria, while animals and fungi have only mitochondria. This seems to align with what I know. Plants perform photosynthesis in chloroplasts and produce energy in mitochondria. Animals and fungi rely on mitochondria for energy production but don't have chloroplasts because they don't perform photosynthesis.\n\nLet me double-check this. In plants, both processes happen: photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, and cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria. In animals and fungi, they only perform cellular respiration in mitochondria, since they don't perform photosynthesis.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct statement.\n\nWait a minute, is there any exception or special case that might make this not generally true? For example, are there any plants that don't have chloroplasts? Well, some plants, like certain parasites, might lose their chloroplasts over time, but generally, most plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria.\n\nAs for fungi, they are eukaryotes and all eukaryotes have mitochondria or at least reduced forms of them. But in terms of structure and function, fungi typically have functional mitochondria involved in energy production.\n\nSo, I think option D is the best answer.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Plants: have both chloroplasts and mitochondria.\n\n- Animals: have only mitochondria.\n\n- Fungi: have only mitochondria.\n\nThis makes sense because only plants perform photosynthesis, which requires chloroplasts, while all organisms need mitochondria for energy production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
