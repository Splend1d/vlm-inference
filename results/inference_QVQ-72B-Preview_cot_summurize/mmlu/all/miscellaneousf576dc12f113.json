                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"During what war did Francis Scott Key write the words to 'The Star-Spangled Banner'?\" And the options are A. American Revolution, B. War of 1812, C. Civil War, D. World War I. Hmm, I think I know the answer, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing things up.\n\nFirst off, I remember that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" is the national anthem of the United States, and it was written by Francis Scott Key. But when did he write it? Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that the American Revolution was from 1775 to 1783, and that's when the colonies fought for independence from Britain. But I don't think the national anthem was written during that time. If it was, it probably would have been called something else, right?\n\nNext, the War of 1812. That sounds familiar. I think it was a conflict between the United States and Britain, partly over maritime rights and impressment of American sailors. This war took place from 1812 to 1815. Maybe this is when Francis Scott Key wrote the anthem.\n\nLet me see. I think there was a famous battle in Baltimore during the War of 1812, at Fort McHenry. And I seem to remember that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was written after seeing the American flag still flying over Fort McHenry after a British bombardment. Yeah, that rings a bell.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then it would have been during the War of 1812. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nThe Civil War was from 1861 to 1865, which is much later than when Francis Scott Key was alive. He actually died in 1843, so he wouldn't have been around during the Civil War. So option C is definitely not correct.\n\nAs for World War I, that was from 1914 to 1918, which is even further after Key's time. \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" had already been written by then and was adopted as the national anthem in 1931, but it was written much earlier.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the War of 1812 is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider the historical context.\n\nFrancis Scott Key was a lawyer and poet who witnessed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor during the War of 1812. He was inspired by the sight of the American flag still waving after the attack and wrote a poem titled \"Defence of Fort M'Henry.\" This poem was later set to the tune of \"To Anacreon in Heaven,\" a popular British song at the time, and became \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nSo, yes, he wrote it during the War of 1812. I think I've got it right.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll check the dates again. The War of 1812 lasted from 1812 to 1815, and Francis Scott Key wrote the poem in 1814. That lines up perfectly.\n\nI don't think it was during the American Revolution, which was more than 30 years earlier. And certainly not during the Civil War or World War I, as those were much later.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is B. War of 1812.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
