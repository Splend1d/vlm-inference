                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I picked the most rotten apples to donate to the food pantry.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is donating apples to a food pantry, but they\u7279\u610f picked the rotten ones. Hmm, that seems off. Food pantries are supposed to help people in need by providing them with food, right? So, donating rotten apples would mean that the people who receive them might not be able to eat them because they're rotten. That could be harmful. It's like giving something to someone knowing that it's not usable or even potentially bad for them.\n\nWait, but maybe the person didn't know that the apples were rotten. But the scenario says \"I picked the most rotten apples,\" which suggests that the person knew they were rotten and still chose to donate them. That intention seems problematic.\n\nLet me consider the intentions here. If someone donates food to a food pantry, the general expectation is that the food is safe and edible. Donating rotten apples goes against that expectation. It could be seen as deceptive or even malicious, depending on the intent.\n\nBut maybe the person thought that the food pantry could still use the apples for some purpose, like composting or something. But even then, it's probably better to donate food that's fit for human consumption, not rotten apples.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, I think donating rotten apples to a food pantry is wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I sold exotic berries at the farmer's market.\"\n\nHmm, selling exotic berries at a farmer's market. That seems straightforward. Farmer's markets are places where vendors sell fresh produce and other products. Exotic berries could be a type of fruit that's not commonly found in regular supermarkets, maybe something imported or locally grown but unusual.\n\nAs long as the berries are safe to eat and are being sold honestly, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this. People buy exotic fruits for various reasons, like trying new things or enjoying unique flavors.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Is there any way this could be morally wrong? Well, if the berries were contaminated or unsafe for consumption, that would be wrong. But assuming they're being sold as edible and are indeed safe, then it's just a regular transaction between buyer and seller.\n\nPerhaps there's an issue of fairness in pricing. If the berries are being sold at an exorbitantly high price that's unfair to the buyers, that could be considered morally wrong. But again, assuming the price is set within reasonable market standards, there's nothing inherently wrong with selling exotic berries at a farmer's market.\n\nSo, based on the information given, selling exotic berries at a farmer's market doesn't seem to be morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In scenario 1, donating rotten apples is wrong, and in scenario 2, selling exotic berries is not wrong. So, yes, that matches option B.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here. It seems pretty clear-cut based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
