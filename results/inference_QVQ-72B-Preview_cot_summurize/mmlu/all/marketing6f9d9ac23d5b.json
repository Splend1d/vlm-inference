                    "text": "So I have this question about probability sampling, and I need to figure out which type of sample is being described. The question mentions that it's a probability sample where randomly selected sub-samples of different groups are represented in the total sample. The options are A. Stratified sample, B. Convenience sample, C. Quota sample, and D. Cluster sample.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Stratified Sample**: This is a method where the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata, and then random samples are drawn from each stratum. It's like dividing the population into different categories and sampling from each category.\n\n2. **Convenience Sample**: This is not a probability sample; it's based on selecting participants who are convenient or easily accessible. It's often used in preliminary research but can introduce bias.\n\n3. **Quota Sample**: This is also not a probability sample. It involves selecting participants to fit certain quotas, ensuring that the sample has a certain number of individuals with specific characteristics.\n\n4. **Cluster Sample**: This is a probability sample where the population is divided into clusters (usually based on geographical locations), and entire clusters are randomly selected for sampling. All units within the selected clusters are included in the sample, or a random sample of units within the cluster is selected.\n\nGiven that the question specifies a probability sample, I can eliminate convenience and quota samples right away because they are non-probability sampling methods.\n\nNow, between stratified and cluster samples, which one involves randomly selected sub-samples of different groups being represented in the total sample?\n\nIn a stratified sample, the population is divided into strata, and random samples are drawn from each stratum. So, each stratum is represented by a sub-sample in the total sample. This sounds a lot like what the question is describing.\n\nIn contrast, a cluster sample involves selecting entire clusters or a sample of units within selected clusters. While clusters are groups, the sampling approach is different. In cluster sampling, you're selecting whole groups or a sample from selected groups, whereas in stratified sampling, you're selecting samples from each stratum.\n\nGiven this, it seems that the description in the question aligns more closely with a stratified sample.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. The question says \"randomly selected sub-samples of different groups are represented in the total sample.\" In stratified sampling, each stratum is a group, and a sub-sample is drawn from each stratum, which are then combined to form the total sample. This matches perfectly with the description.\n\nIn cluster sampling, if you're selecting a sample of units within each cluster, that could also involve sub-samples, but the key difference is that in cluster sampling, you might not be sampling from every cluster, only from those that are selected randomly. Whereas in stratified sampling, you are sampling from every stratum.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look deeper. Could the question be referring to multi-stage sampling, which isn't listed here? No, that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to proportional stratified sampling, where the sample size from each stratum is proportional to the stratum's size in the population.\n\nBut again, the description seems to fit stratified sampling best.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If I think about the characteristics of each type:\n\n- **Stratified Sampling**: Ensures representation from all strata, reduces sampling error, especially when strata are homogeneous.\n\n- **Cluster Sampling**: More cost-effective, especially for large populations spread out geographically, but can introduce more sampling error if clusters are heterogeneous.\n\nGiven that, and considering the question mentions randomly selected sub-samples of different groups, it points towards stratified sampling.\n\nI should also consider the key difference between stratified and cluster sampling:\n\n- In stratified sampling, you divide the population into mutually exclusive groups (strata) and sample from each stratum.\n\n- In cluster sampling, you divide the population into mutually exclusive groups (clusters), but you sample entire clusters or a sample within selected clusters.\n\nSo, if the question is emphasizing that sub-samples are selected from different groups and represented in the total sample, that aligns more with stratified sampling where each group (stratum) is represented by a sub-sample.\n\nCluster sampling, on the other hand, involves selecting entire clusters, not necessarily sub-samples from different groups, unless it's a two-stage cluster sampling where you select clusters first and then sample within clusters.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest a single-step process, which makes me think it's more about stratified sampling.\n\nTo further confirm, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a population divided into age groups: 18-30, 31-45, 46-60, and 61+. If we use stratified sampling, we would randomly select samples from each age group and combine them to form the total sample. This matches the description in the question.\n\nIn cluster sampling, if we divide the population into geographical areas (clusters), select some of these areas, and then sample everyone in those areas or a sample within them, it's a different approach.\n\nTherefore, based on the description provided, the most appropriate answer is A. Stratified sample.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check the definitions:\n\n- **Stratified Sample**: A method where the population is divided into distinct, non-overlapping subgroups (strata), and a random sample is drawn from each stratum.\n\n- **Cluster Sample**: A method where the population is divided into clusters, usually based on geographical proximity, and a random sample of these clusters is selected. Then, either all units within the selected clusters are included in the sample (one-stage cluster sampling), or a random sample is drawn from within these clusters (two-stage cluster sampling).\n\nGiven this, the initial description in the question aligns more closely with stratified sampling, where different groups (strata) are represented by sub-samples in the total sample.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. Stratified sample.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Stratified sample.}} \\]"
