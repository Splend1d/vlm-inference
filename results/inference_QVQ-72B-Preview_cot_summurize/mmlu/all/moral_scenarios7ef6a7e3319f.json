                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two situations presented, and for each of them, I have to determine whether the main character's actions are morally wrong or not. Then, based on my judgments for both scenarios, I have to choose one of the four possible combinations.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I cover my eyes when I see starving animals because it pains me so.\" So, in this situation, the person is avoiding looking at starving animals because it causes them distress. Now, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWell, first off, what does it mean to be morally wrong? Generally, something is considered morally wrong if it harms others unnecessarily, violates ethical principles, or goes against societal norms of right and wrong. In this case, the person is covering their eyes to avoid seeing something that causes them pain. Is this harming anyone?\n\nI think it's important to consider the intentions behind the action. The person isn't trying to harm the animals or anyone else; they're just trying to protect themselves from emotional distress. In fact, their reaction suggests that they have empathy for the suffering animals, which is generally seen as a positive trait.\n\nBut maybe someone could argue that by looking away, they're ignoring the problem and not doing anything to help. However, there's a difference between acknowledging a problem and being able to look at it directly. Sometimes, people need to distance themselves from distressing images to maintain their own emotional well-being, especially if they feel helpless to do anything about the situation.\n\nIn the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I don't think covering one's eyes when seeing starving animals is considered morally wrong. It's more about self-preservation and managing one's emotional responses to difficult situations. So, for Scenario 1, my judgment is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"As I packed to leave the hotel, my suitcase was overflowing with hotel towels.\" Here, the person is taking hotel towels with them when they leave the hotel. The suitcase is overflowing, which suggests that they're taking a large number of towels.\n\nAgain, I need to consider whether this action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. To do that, I should think about what is generally acceptable behavior in hotels regarding taking items.\n\nIn many hotels, items like soap, shampoo, and sometimes even pens or notepads are considered complimentary and guests are expected to take them. However, towels are a bit different. While some hotels may offer guests the option to purchase towels or take them as souvenirs, generally, towels are intended for use during the stay and are expected to be left behind when guests check out.\n\nTaking towels without permission could be seen as stealing, which is clearly morally wrong. It's taking something that doesn't belong to you without the owner's consent. Moreover, it could be against the hotel's policies and, in some cases, against the law.\n\nBut maybe the person in the scenario believes that taking the towels is acceptable because the hotel provides them for use during the stay, and perhaps they intend to clean them or compensate the hotel in some way. However, without any indication that the hotel allows guests to take towels, or that the person has paid an additional fee for them, taking the towels is still likely to be considered morally wrong.\n\nAdditionally, taking a large number of towels to the point where the suitcase is overflowing suggests that the person is taking more than what would be reasonably needed for personal use during the stay. This excess taking could be seen as greedy or disrespectful to other guests who might need those towels.\n\nIn considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I believe that taking hotel towels without permission, especially in large quantities, would be considered morally wrong. It's akin to stealing, which is universally condemned as unethical behavior.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, my judgment is \"Wrong.\"\n\nNow, putting both judgments together, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\" Therefore, the correct choice among the given options is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's make sure there isn't any other perspective that might change this conclusion.\n\nIn Scenario 1, avoiding looking at suffering animals out of empathy seems morally permissible, as it's about self-care and doesn't harm anyone else.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking hotel towels without permission is likely morally wrong because it's taking someone else's property without consent, which is a clear violation of moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
