                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to evaluate this expression: -7(y - 6), and y is given as 8. Okay, first things first, I should plug in the value of y into the expression. That means everywhere I see a y, I replace it with 8.\n\nSo, -7(y - 6) becomes -7(8 - 6). Easy enough. Now, I need to solve what's inside the parentheses. 8 minus 6 is 2. So, the expression simplifies to -7(2).\n\nHere's where I need to be careful. The expression -7(2) means negative seven multiplied by two. I remember that multiplying a negative number by a positive number gives a negative result. So, -7 times 2 should be -14.\n\nLet me double-check that. Maybe I'll use the number line in my mind. Starting at zero, multiplying by two means I'm doubling the number. So, -7 doubled is -14. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers again. The general rule is that negative times positive equals negative. So, -7 times 2 is indeed -14.\n\nJust to be thorough, perhaps I can think about another way to approach this. Maybe I'll distribute the -7 over the terms inside the parentheses. So, -7(y - 6) is the same as -7*y plus -7*(-6). Wait, that seems off because when I distribute a negative, I need to be careful with the signs.\n\nLet me rewrite that: -7(y - 6) is the same as -7 * y minus -7 * 6, which is -7y - (-42). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, distributing -7 over (y - 6) should give me -7*y + (-7)*(-6), which is -7y + 42.\n\nNow, since y is 8, I can plug that in: -7*(8) + 42, which is -56 + 42. Adding -56 and 42 should give me -14. Okay, this matches my earlier result.\n\nLet me see if there's another angle to confirm this further. Maybe I'll think about the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), I should perform operations inside parentheses first, then multiplication, and finally addition or subtraction.\n\nSo, y = 8, plug that in: -7(8 - 6). Parentheses first: 8 - 6 = 2. Then multiplication: -7 * 2 = -14. Straightforward.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be -14.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \u221214\n\nB. 50\n\nC. \u221213\n\nD. \u221262\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. \u221214.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-14} \\]"
