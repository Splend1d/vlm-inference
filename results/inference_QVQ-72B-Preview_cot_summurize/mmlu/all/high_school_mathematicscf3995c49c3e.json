                    "text": "Alright, let's see which of these statements is true. I need to recall some calculus concepts here.\n\nStarting with option A: If f(x) is continuous at x = c, then f\u2032(c) exists.\n\nHmm, I remember that continuity is a necessary condition for differentiability, but it's not sufficient on its own. There are functions that are continuous at a point but not differentiable there. For example, the absolute value function is continuous everywhere, but it's not differentiable at zero because of the sharp corner there. So, in that case, even though it's continuous at zero, the derivative doesn't exist. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nMoving on to option B: If f\u2032(c) = 0, then f has a local maximum or minimum at (c, f(c)).\n\nI know that f\u2032(c) = 0 suggests that the function has a critical point at c, which could be a local max, a local min, or possibly a point of inflection. So, for example, if f(x) = x\u00b3, then f\u2032(x) = 3x\u00b2, and f\u2032(0) = 0. But at x = 0, the function has a point of inflection, not a local maximum or minimum. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nOption C: If f\u2032\u2032(c) = 0, then the graph of f has an inflection point at (c, f(c)).\n\nI recall that an inflection point is where the concavity of the function changes. While it's true that at an inflection point, the second derivative is often zero, it's not the only condition. The second derivative being zero doesn't necessarily mean there's an inflection point. For example, consider f(x) = x\u2074; f\u2032\u2032(x) = 12x\u00b2, and f\u2032\u2032(0) = 0, but the function doesn't change concavity at zero\u2014it's concave up on both sides. So, this statement isn't always true either.\n\nLastly, option D: If f is differentiable at x = c, then f is continuous at x = c.\n\nI think this is a fundamental theorem in calculus. Differentiability implies continuity. That is, if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous at that point. I can't think of any counterexample where a function is differentiable but not continuous. In fact, it's a standard result that differentiability at a point requires continuity at that point.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the correct statement.\n\nJust to make sure, let me summarize:\n\n- A: Not always true because continuity doesn't guarantee differentiability.\n\n- B: Not always true because f\u2032(c) = 0 can correspond to a point of inflection.\n\n- C: Not always true because f\u2032\u2032(c) = 0 doesn't necessarily indicate an inflection point.\n\n- D: Always true because differentiability implies continuity.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
