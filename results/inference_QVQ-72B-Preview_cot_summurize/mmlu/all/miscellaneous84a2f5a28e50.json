                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What are the Smothers Brothers' first names?\" And the options are A. Frank and Bill, B. Tom and Dick, C. Dave and George, D. Ed and Pete. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Smothers Brothers are a comedy duo, famous from back in the day. They had a TV show, I think, and they were known for their mock arguments, especially about who was the older brother and who got more attention from their parents. It was all in good fun, of course.\n\nBut now, I need to recall their actual first names. Let me think. One of them is named Tom, I'm pretty sure. But is it Tom and Dick? Or was it Tom and something else?\n\nWait, I think it's Tom and Dick Smothers. Yeah, that sounds familiar. Let me see if I can confirm that.\n\nI remember that Tom was the one who played the guitar on their show, and Dick was more of the straight man. But I might be mixing them up. Anyway, I'm pretty confident that Tom is one of the brothers.\n\nLet me consider the other options. Frank and Bill don't sound right. I don't recall Frank being a Smothers Brother, and Bill seems off too.\n\nDave and George also don't ring a bell. I know Dave was a common name, but not in this context.\n\nEd and Pete? No, that doesn't seem right either. Ed was maybe on some other show.\n\nSo, between the options, B. Tom and Dick seems the most plausible. But just to be sure, maybe I should double-check.\n\nI recall that the Smothers Brothers were active in the 1960s and 1970s, and their show was controversial at times because of their political humor. But that doesn't help me with their first names.\n\nMaybe I should think about it differently. If I can remember their full names, that might help. Wait, their last name is Smothers, right? So, it's Smothers brothers, not brothers with different last names.\n\nI think I've got it. Tom and Dick Smothers. Yeah, that sounds correct.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think of a joke or a sketch they did. Like, one of them would say, \"Mom always liked you best,\" and the other would deny it. I think it was Tom who was the older brother and felt that Dick was favored.\n\nBut again, that doesn't confirm their first names.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the process of elimination. Let's see:\n\nOption A: Frank and Bill \u2013 No, doesn't sound right.\n\nOption B: Tom and Dick \u2013 Seems familiar, likely correct.\n\nOption C: Dave and George \u2013 No, doesn't ring a bell.\n\nOption D: Ed and Pete \u2013 No, that doesn't fit.\n\nSo, based on that, B. Tom and Dick seems to be the answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think of something else. I think Tom Smothers was known for his mustache, and Dick was clean-shaven. That might be another way to remember it.\n\nAlso, I think Tom was the one who played the acoustic guitar, and Dick played the electric bass sometimes. But I might be mixing that up with other musicians.\n\nAnother approach: maybe think about other famous comedy duos and see if that helps. Like Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, but that doesn't directly help here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, which was their TV show. I think it was on CBS in the late 1960s. But again, doesn't directly answer the question.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is straightforward: what are their first names? And based on my knowledge, it's Tom and Dick.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try to recall if there were any other siblings or something, but I don't think so. I believe they were the only two brothers in the act.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer should be B. Tom and Dick.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
