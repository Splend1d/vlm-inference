                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"The distance from Chicago to New York City is 794 miles. What is 794 rounded to the nearest hundred?\" And there are four options to choose from: A. 700, B. 794, C. 800, D. 894.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to round 794 to the nearest hundred. I remember that rounding involves looking at the digit in the place just after the one I'm rounding to. So, if I'm rounding to the nearest hundred, I should look at the tens place.\n\nLet me write down the number to visualize it:\n\n7 9 4\n\nThe 7 is in the hundreds place, the 9 is in the tens place, and the 4 is in the ones place.\n\nTo round to the nearest hundred, I need to look at the digit in the tens place, which is 9. Now, I recall that if this digit is 5 or greater, I should round up. If it's less than 5, I should round down.\n\nSince the tens digit is 9, which is greater than 5, I should round up. So, that means I add 1 to the hundreds digit.\n\n7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the rounded number should be 800.\n\nLet me double-check that. Starting with 794, the tens digit is 9, which is greater than 5, so round up to the next hundred, which is 800.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance I'm missing something here? Let me see. Maybe I should consider the actual distance and see which option is closest to 794.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 700\n\nB. 794\n\nC. 800\n\nD. 894\n\nNow, 794 is between 700 and 800. Since 794 is closer to 800 than it is to 700, rounding to 800 seems correct.\n\nBut why is there option B, which is 794 itself? Is that a trick option? Well, maybe someone might think that since 794 is already closer to 800, they shouldn't change it, but that doesn't make sense because the question is asking to round to the nearest hundred, not to the nearest original number.\n\nOption D is 894, which is way off, so that can't be right.\n\nOption A is 700, which is also farther away from 794 than 800 is.\n\nSo, I think C. 800 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about how far each option is from 794.\n\nA. 700: 794 - 700 = 94 miles difference\n\nB. 794: 0 difference (but that's not rounding)\n\nC. 800: 800 - 794 = 6 miles difference\n\nD. 894: 894 - 794 = 100 miles difference\n\nSo, clearly, 800 is the closest hundred to 794, with only a 6-mile difference.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. 800.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any other factor that would affect this rounding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
