The options are formal operational thought, adolescent egocentrism, early sociocentrism, and identity foreclosure. Hmm, let's see what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, formal operational thought. I remember from psychology class that this is a stage in cognitive development where a person can think abstractly and hypothetically. It usually starts around age 12 or so. But in this case, the teen is 15, so they should already be in that stage. But is this behavior an example of formal operational thought? I don't think so. Maybe not directly.\n\nNext, adolescent egocentrism. I've heard of this before. It's when teenagers think that everyone is as focused on them as they are, like the world revolves around them. They might also feel invincible, like nothing bad can happen to them. Maybe this relates to the idea that they don't think they can get pregnant or get an STD. That sounds like feeling invincible or thinking that rules don't apply to them. So, this could be a possible answer.\n\nThen, early sociocentrism. I'm not as familiar with this term. Let me think. Sociocentrism might refer to focusing on social groups or conforming to social norms. But I'm not sure about \"early sociocentrism.\" Maybe it's about conforming to peer pressure or something like that. But in this scenario, the behavior seems more about the teen's personal beliefs and risks they're taking, not necessarily conforming to a group.\n\nLastly, identity foreclosure. I recall that this is when someone adopts an identity without fully exploring other options, often adopting their parents' views or an early commitment without much self-reflection. Does this relate to the situation? Well, the teen is engaging in risky behavior and denying possible negative outcomes, which doesn't seem directly related to forming an identity or committing to certain beliefs without exploration.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, adolescent egocentrism seems to fit best. The teen feels invincible and doesn't think negative consequences will happen to them, which is a classic symptom of adolescent egocentrism.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Formal operational thought is about abstract thinking, which isn't directly related to the behavior described. Early sociocentrism might involve conforming to social groups, but again, the behavior seems more individualistic and related to personal risk assessment. Identity foreclosure is about forming identity without exploration, which isn't clearly linked here.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be B. adolescent egocentrism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
