Which number could be the actual population of Louisiana in 2010?\" And there are four options to choose from:\n\nA. 4,500,321\n\nB. 4,524,491\n\nC. 4,533,372\n\nD. 4,535,343\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means to round to the nearest 10,000. When we round a number to the nearest 10,000, we're looking at the thousands digit to decide whether to round up or down.\n\nSo, for the number 4,530,000, that's already rounded to the nearest 10,000. But what could the actual population be? It must be a number that, when rounded to the nearest 10,000, equals 4,530,000.\n\nI remember that when rounding to the nearest 10,000, if the thousands digit is 5 or greater, you round up, and if it's less than 5, you round down.\n\nSo, for 4,530,000 to be the rounded figure, the actual number must be between 4,525,000 and 4,534,999, inclusive. Anything from 4,525,000 up to, but not including, 4,535,000 would round down to 4,530,000.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Actually, no. Let's think more carefully.\n\nIf I have 4,525,000, rounding to the nearest 10,000 would round up to 4,530,000 because the thousands digit is 5. Similarly, 4,534,999 would also round to 4,530,000 because the thousands digit is less than 5.\n\nSo, the range should be from 4,525,000 to 4,534,999, inclusive.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 4,500,321\n\nThis is below 4,525,000, so it would round to 4,500,000, not 4,530,000.\n\nB. 4,524,491\n\nThis is 4,524,491. Let's see, the thousands digit is 4, so rounding to the nearest 10,000 would round down to 4,520,000. But we need it to round to 4,530,000, so this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be between 4,525,000 and 4,534,999.\n\nOption B is 4,524,491, which is below 4,525,000, so it wouldn't round to 4,530,000.\n\nOption C is 4,533,372. This is within the range of 4,525,000 to 4,534,999, so it should round to 4,530,000.\n\nOption D is 4,535,343. This is above 4,535,000, so it would round up to 4,540,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be Option C: 4,533,372.\n\nBut wait, let's verify again. The rounding to the nearest 10,000 depends on the thousands digit. In 4,533,372, let's break it down:\n\nThe number is 4,533,372.\n\nThe thousands digit is the third digit from the right in the thousands place. So, starting from the right: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 3 (hundreds), 3 (thousands).\n\nSo, the thousands digit is 3, which is less than 5, so it should round down to 4,530,000. Yes, that matches.\n\nNow, just to be sure, let's check Option B again: 4,524,491.\n\nThe thousands digit is 4 (since it's 4,524,491), which is less than 5, so it would round down to 4,520,000, not 4,530,000.\n\nOption D: 4,535,343.\n\nThe thousands digit is 5 (since it's 4,535,343), so it would round up to 4,540,000.\n\nOption A: 4,500,321.\n\nThe thousands digit is 0 (since it's 4,500,321), so it would round down to 4,500,000.\n\nTherefore, only Option C fits the criteria.\n\nWait a minute, is there any possibility that the actual population could be exactly 4,530,000? If it's exactly 4,530,000, it would stay 4,530,000 when rounded to the nearest 10,000. But in this problem, since we're dealing with real-world data, populations are rarely exact multiples of 10,000, so it's likely that the actual population is within the range that rounds to 4,530,000.\n\nGiven that, Option C is the only one within the acceptable range.\n\nAlternatively, if the actual population was exactly 4,530,000, that would also be acceptable, but none of the options provide that exact number.\n\nSo, based on the options given, the correct answer is C. 4,533,372.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
