Rostow, B. Ravenstein, C. Von Th\u00fcnen, and D. Burgess. Hmm, I need to figure out who came up with this model of urban structure.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the concept of concentric rings in urban geography refers to a model where different social groups and land uses are arranged in circular bands moving away from the city center. So, the city grows outward in circles, each ring having its own characteristics.\n\nLet me recall what I know about each of these geographers and see who proposed this model.\n\nStarting with Rostow: I think Walt Rostow was an economist known for his stages of economic growth model, which outlines five stages that countries pass through as they develop from traditional societies to modern industrial states. But I don't recall him having a significant contribution to urban geography, especially regarding the structure of cities.\n\nNext, Ravenstein: I believe he was involved in migration studies. He formulated a set of laws of migration, which describe patterns and tendencies in migration flows, such as people migrating over short distances first before moving longer distances. While important, this seems more related to population movement rather than the spatial structure of cities.\n\nThen there's Von Th\u00fcnen: He's famous for the Von Th\u00fcnen model, which is a theoretical model of land use in the isolated state. This model arranges land uses in concentric rings based on their profitability, with the city center being the central point and agriculture types varying based on their distance from the city. This sounds a bit similar to the concept mentioned in the question, but I think his model was more about agricultural land use rather than urban social structure.\n\nFinally, Burgess: Now, Ernest W. Burgess was an American sociologist who developed the concentric zone model of urban structure. This model, proposed in the 1920s, describes how cities expand through a process of invasion and succession, with different social groups occupying successive rings as they move out from the central business district. The model includes zones such as the central business district, transition zone, working-class zone, middle-class zone, and commuter zone.\n\nWait a minute, the question specifies the 1920s, which aligns perfectly with Burgess's work since he developed this model during that period. The other geographers I mentioned either focused on different aspects of economics and migration or had models that were more related to land use in agriculture rather than urban social structure.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Burgess is the one who viewed US urban communities in the 1920s as a set of concentric rings radiating outward from a central core.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. The concentric zone model by Burgess was indeed proposed in the early 20th century, specifically in 1925, I think. It was a response to the rapid urbanization and social changes occurring in the United States at that time.\n\nIn contrast, Rostow's stages of growth were developed in the 1960s, Ravenstein's laws of migration were formulated in the late 19th century, and Von Th\u00fcnen's model was from the early 19th century, primarily focusing on agricultural economics.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Burgess.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
