This is from 2019, so I should look for data from that year.\n\nFirst, I should consider where to find this kind of information. Probably, it's from some survey or poll. Maybe something like the Pew Research Center, which often does international opinion polls.\n\nLet me think about Pew Research. They conduct a lot of global attitude surveys. I recall that they have a project called the Global Attitudes Project, which might have data on this.\n\nSo, if I were to look this up, I'd go to the Pew Research Center's website and search for reports or data related to U.S.-Germany relations in 2019.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recall if I've heard any numbers recently about this topic. But since it's from 2019, it's a bit before my immediate memory.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any general perceptions about the relationship between the U.S. and Germany around that time. In 2019, there were discussions about trade relations, NATO contributions, and diplomatic ties between the two countries. Generally, I think the relationship was considered strong, but there might have been some points of tension.\n\nGiven that, I would guess that a majority of Americans thought the relationship was good, but maybe not an overwhelming majority.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 60%\n\nB. 75%\n\nC. 90%\n\nD. 45%\n\nSo, 60% seems like a solid majority, but not everyone. 75% is higher, indicating a stronger consensus. 90% is very high, suggesting near-universal agreement, and 45% is less than half, which would imply that more Americans thought the relationship was not good.\n\nConsidering the general perception I have, I think 60% might be a bit low. Maybe closer to 75%. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think about similar relationships. For example, the relationship between the U.S. and the UK is often very positive, and Germany is also a key ally in Europe, so perhaps similarities there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about approval ratings for Germany in general. I know that Germany has a good reputation globally, often ranking high in best countries indices.\n\nBut, to be honest, I'm not confident enough to make a precise guess based on this.\n\nPerhaps another approach: looking at historical data. If I could recall what percentage thought the relationship was good in previous years, I might be able to make an educated guess based on trends.\n\nBut, alas, I don't have that information off the top of my head.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the relationship might have been perceived differently by different political affiliations. For example, with the U.S. having a Republican president in 2019, and Germany having a center-right chancellor, perhaps there were differences in perception based on political leanings.\n\nBut again, without specific data, this doesn't help me much.\n\nMaybe I can look at economic ties. The U.S. and Germany have strong trade relations, with Germany being one of the top trading partners for the U.S. Perhaps positive economic relations contribute to a positive view of the relationship overall.\n\nAdditionally, cultural exchanges and historical alliances might influence public perception.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should consider any potential tensions. In 2019, there were discussions about the U.S. requesting Germany to increase its defense spending within NATO, which might have caused some friction.\n\nHowever, despite such disagreements, overall relations are likely to be viewed positively.\n\nConsidering all this, I think that 75% is a reasonable estimate for the percentage of Americans who said the relationship between the U.S. and Germany is good in 2019.\n\nSo, my answer is B. 75%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
