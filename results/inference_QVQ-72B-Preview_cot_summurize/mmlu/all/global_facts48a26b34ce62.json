Hmm, that seems like a pretty significant question. I'm not sure off the top of my head, but maybe I can make an educated guess.\n\nFirst, I should think about what literacy rates were like in 1950. That was right after World War II, and a lot of countries were still recovering from the war. Education systems might not have been as developed back then compared to now. So, maybe the literacy rate wasn't as high as it is today.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- 36% seems really low. Is that possible?\n\n- 56% seems a bit higher but still not very high.\n\n- 76% seems more reasonable, but maybe too optimistic for 1950.\n\n- 96% seems really high for that time period.\n\nI think 96% is probably too high. I don't think literacy was that widespread back then, especially considering that many countries were still developing their education systems.\n\nLet me consider some current literacy rates to get a sense of perspective. I know that today, global literacy rates are around 80-90%, but that's after decades of educational advancements and initiatives like universal primary education.\n\nIn 1950, I doubt it was anywhere near 96%. Maybe around 50-60%? That seems plausible. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about historical trends. I recall that literacy rates have been increasing over time, but not at a steady pace everywhere. Some regions have seen faster improvements than others.\n\nPerhaps I should look at specific countries or regions to estimate the global average.\n\nLet's see, in 1950, industrialized countries like the United States, Western European nations, and parts of Asia like Japan likely had higher literacy rates, maybe around 90-95%.\n\nIn contrast, many developing countries in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America might have had lower literacy rates, perhaps around 30-60%.\n\nGiven that, the global average would be somewhere in between, depending on the population weights of these regions.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say around 50-60% might be a reasonable estimate for 1950.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about that. Maybe I should consider other factors.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I can look at the history of literacy. I know that literacy has been spreading since the 19th century, especially with the rise of mass education systems.\n\nBut even by 1950, there were still many people who couldn't read or write, especially in rural areas and among women.\n\nThat makes me think that maybe 56% could be a plausible figure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the United Nations' data, as they often track literacy rates.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the UN has statistics on adult literacy rates over time.\n\nBut since I don't have access to that data right now, I'll have to make an educated guess based on what I know.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B. 56%.\n\nI don't feel entirely sure, but it seems like a reasonable estimate given the historical context and the variations in literacy rates across different regions in 1950.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
