                    "text": "So I've got this question about boundary problems along the United States-Mexico border. It's asking what causes these issues, and the options are ownership of fertile ground, land use, irredentism, and immigration. I need to pick which one of these is the primary cause of boundary problems in that area.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a boundary problem is in this context. It likely refers to disputes or conflicts that arise due to the division between the two countries. So, anything that challenges or complicates the division of territory and jurisdiction along the border could be considered a boundary problem.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Ownership of fertile ground\n\nThis seems related to agriculture and natural resources. Both the U.S. and Mexico have agricultural sectors that benefit from fertile land. Disputes over who owns certain fertile areas could lead to boundary issues. However, I'm not sure how prominent this issue is specifically along the border.\n\nB. Land use\n\nLand use involves how land is utilized by people, including for residential, commercial, agricultural, or conservation purposes. Differences in land use policies between the two countries might lead to tensions along the border. For example, one country might allow more industrial development close to the border, affecting the other side environmentally or economically.\n\nC. Irredentism\n\nIrredentism is a political movement that aims to reclaim and incorporate territories that are considered part of a particular nation but are currently under the control of another state. In the context of the U.S.-Mexico border, this could involve groups in one country claiming parts of the other country's territory as rightfully theirs. This could definitely cause boundary problems.\n\nD. Immigration\n\nImmigration is a significant issue between the U.S. and Mexico. There are ongoing debates and conflicts regarding the flow of people across the border, both legally and illegally. Border security measures are often implemented to control immigration, which can lead to tensions and problems along the border.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these is the main cause of boundary problems. Let's think about the history and current situation.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico border has a complex history involving territorial changes resulting from wars and treaties. The Mexican-American War in the 19th century led to Mexico ceding large territories to the United States, including what is now California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Colorado. This historical context means that there are people on both sides who might have claims or sentiments about the current border lines.\n\nIrredentism could be a factor here, as there might be movements in Mexico that view some U.S. territories as rightfully Mexican, or vice versa. However, in reality, official government positions generally respect the current international boundaries as established by treaties.\n\nLand use and ownership of fertile ground are also important, especially in regions where agriculture is a significant part of the economy. Disputes over water rights, for example, are common along the border due to shared river basins like the Colorado River, which is crucial for agriculture in both countries. These disputes can sometimes relate to fertile land ownership.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most pressing and frequently discussed issue along the border is immigration. The U.S. has seen high levels of immigration from Mexico over the years, both documented and undocumented. This has led to the construction of border walls, increased border patrol presence, and various policy changes aimed at controlling immigration.\n\nThe immigration issue has been a source of political tension between the two countries, with disagreements over how to handle migrants, asylum seekers, and issues related to security.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that immigration is a major cause of boundary problems along the U.S.-Mexico border. While land use and irredentism may play roles in some specific instances, immigration is a more widespread and persistent issue that affects the entire length of the border.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. Immigration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
