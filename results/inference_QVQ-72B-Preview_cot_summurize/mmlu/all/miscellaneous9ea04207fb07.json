Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Frank Sinatra was a legendary singer and actor, but did he write his own songs? I think he was primarily a performer and interpreter of other people's music. So, maybe option A is not the right answer.\n\nKris Kristofferson is a renowned songwriter, but I don't recall him being associated with \"My Way.\" He wrote songs like \"Me and Bobby McGee\" and \"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,\" which were big hits for other artists. Maybe he didn't write \"My Way.\"\n\nCarole King is another famous songwriter, known for writing hits like \"You've Got a Friend\" and \"Natural Woman.\" I think her work was more in the pop and rock genre, whereas \"My Way\" seems more standards or Rat Pack style. So, maybe not her.\n\nThat leaves Paul Anka. I know Paul Anka was a popular singer and songwriter, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. He wrote songs like \"Diana\" and \"Puppy Love,\" which were big hits. But does he have a connection to \"My Way\"?\n\nI remember that \"My Way\" was a signature song for Frank Sinatra, and it was released in the late 1960s or early 1970s. Let me think about the timing. Paul Anka was still active during that period, so it's possible he could have written it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a translation from another language? I think \"My Way\" is based on a French song. Wait, yes, I believe the music was originally from a French song, and the English lyrics were written by someone else.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the lyrics were adapted by an English-speaking songwriter. Could that be Paul Anka? I think I've heard somewhere that Paul Anka was involved in writing \"My Way,\" but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me try to recall the credits of the song. I think the music was by Jacques Revaux and Gilles Thibault, and the French lyrics were by Jean Gilles Thibault. Then, for the English version, the lyrics were written by Paul Anka.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, if that's the case, then Paul Anka would be the one who wrote the English lyrics that Frank Sinatra sang.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try to verify this information. I think there might be some confusion because the music and the original French lyrics were by different people, and then Paul Anka wrote the English lyrics.\n\nSo, to clarify, Paul Anka wrote the English-language lyrics for \"My Way,\" which Frank Sinatra made famous. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. Paul Anka.\n\nI don't think it's A. Frank Sinatra, because Sinatra was primarily a performer and didn't write most of his material. Kris Kristofferson and Carole King are both talented songwriters, but they weren't involved in writing \"My Way.\"\n\nSo, I'm confident that Paul Anka is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
