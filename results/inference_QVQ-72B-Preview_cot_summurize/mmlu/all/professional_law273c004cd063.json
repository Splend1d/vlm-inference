An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of \"willingly and knowingly\" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it.

                    "text": "So I've got this case here, and I need to figure out if the federal appellate court is likely to reverse the conviction of this drug store owner who was indicted for taking cash over $10,000 into Canada without reporting it. The owner claims he didn't know about the law, but the trial judge said that mistake of law is no defense. Now, I need to see if the appellate court will agree with that or not, based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the law in question. There's a federal law that prohibits \"willfully and knowingly\" taking cash in excess of $10,000 from the U.S. into a foreign country without reporting it in detail. The owner of this Detroit drug store was taking his gross cash receipts each week into Canada, where he lives and banks. He was indicted on 10 counts for this action.\n\nHis main defense is that he didn't know about the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense, and he was convicted. Now, he's appealing, and I need to decide whether the appellate court is likely to reverse the conviction based on the given options.\n\nOption A says yes, because the \"willfulness\" clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime. So, according to this option, the prosecution needs to show that the owner knew the law and intentionally violated it.\n\nOption B says yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable. Hmm, that seems like a different issue. I don't have any information about treaties between the U.S. and Canada that would make this particular law unenforceable. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C says no, because the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required. This suggests that due to the nature of the offense, the law doesn't require proof of knowledge or specific intent to convict. It's more of a strict liability offense in this case.\n\nOption D says no, because willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash. So, even if the owner claims he didn't know the law, his repeated actions suggest that he should have known and was willfully violating the law.\n\nAlright, I need to think through these options.\n\nFirst, regarding Option A: Does the \"willfulness\" clause require proof of knowledge of the law and specific intent to commit the crime? In general, \"willfulness\" in federal law often requires that the defendant knew the conduct was unlawful. But does it necessarily require knowledge of the specific law? I think there's a distinction between knowing that what you're doing is against the law and knowing the exact law.\n\nIn some cases, the courts have held that \"willfulness\" requires knowledge of the law, but in others, especially in regulatory schemes, it might just require knowledge that the conduct is unlawful, not necessarily knowledge of the specific statute.\n\nGiven that, maybe the appellate court would consider whether the owner knew that taking large amounts of cash out of the country without reporting it was against the law, even if he didn't know the exact law or reporting requirements.\n\nBut the option seems to suggest that both knowledge of the law and specific intent are required, and if the prosecution didn't prove that, the conviction should be reversed.\n\nOption B seems off-base because there's no mention of any treaty that would make this law unenforceable. It's possible that there are international agreements about reporting cross-border cash transactions, but without specific information, I can't assume that.\n\nOption C suggests that because the offense is so dangerous to the public interest, knowledge and specific intent aren't required. This sounds like a strict liability offense, where you can be convicted regardless of your knowledge or intent, just based on the act itself.\n\nBut in criminal law, strict liability offenses are generally disfavored, especially for serious crimes. There's usually a requirement of some level of intent or knowledge.\n\nMoreover, the law in question here specifically mentions \"willfully and knowingly,\" which suggests that some level of intent is required.\n\nSo, Option C seems unlikely.\n\nOption D argues that willfulness and knowledge can be inferred from the habitual practice of transporting the cash. So, even if the owner claims he didn't know the law, the fact that he was doing this repeatedly suggests that he should have known and was willfully violating the law.\n\nThis seems plausible. If someone is engaging in a behavior repeatedly, especially if it's part of their business operations, they have a responsibility to know the laws related to that behavior.\n\nSo, perhaps the appellate court would agree that, based on his habitual practice, the owner's willfulness and knowledge can be inferred.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to decide which option is most likely correct.\n\nOption A suggests the conviction should be reversed because the prosecution didn't prove knowledge of the law and specific intent. However, in some cases, \"willfulness\" might not require specific knowledge of the exact law, just knowledge that the conduct is unlawful.\n\nOption B seems unrelated to the facts presented, as there's no information about treaties with Canada that affect this law.\n\nOption C proposes that because the offense is dangerous to the public interest, knowledge and specific intent aren't required. But the law itself specifies \"willfully and knowingly,\" which implies some level of intent.\n\nOption D suggests that willfulness and knowledge can be inferred from the habitual practice of transporting the cash, which seems reasonable.\n\nGiven that, I think Option D is the most likely correct answer. The appellate court is unlikely to reverse the conviction because the owner's repeated actions suggest that he should have known the law and was willfully violating it.\n\nSo, the answer is D. No, the federal appellate court is unlikely to reverse the conviction because willfulness and knowledge can be inferred from the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
