                    "text": "So I have this question about short-term memory, and I need to pick the best characterization from the options provided. Let me see, I've learned a bit about memory systems, including short-term memory, so I should be able to figure this out.\n\nFirst, let's recall what short-term memory is. It's a component of our memory system where information is temporarily stored and manipulated for immediate use. Unlike sensory memory, which holds information for a very brief period (like the afterimage of a flash or an echo), short-term memory can hold information for a few seconds to about a minute.\n\nOption A says that short-term memory processes only raw sensory data. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Sensory memory is where raw sensory data is initially processed, but short-term memory is more about processing and storing information that has already been attended to from sensory memory.\n\nOption B states that its span is limited by the number and form of the items presented. I know that short-term memory has a limited capacity. There's the famous \"magic number seven, plus or minus two\" items that most people can hold in their short-term memory. So, yes, the number of items can affect how much we can remember. But what about the form of the items? Well, the form can influence memorability too. For example, information presented visually might be easier to recall than information presented auditorily for some people, depending on their learning styles and the nature of the information. So, perhaps the form does play a role in limiting short-term memory span.\n\nOption C says that short-term memory is relatively unaffected by interference. Interference refers to when new information disrupts the recall of old information (retroactive interference) or when old information hinders the recall of new information (proactive interference). In short-term memory, since information is held for a shorter period, interference might not be as pronounced as in long-term memory. However, I think that short-term memory can still be affected by interference, especially if similar information is being processed simultaneously. For example, trying to remember a phone number while someone is dictating another phone number can lead to confusion.\n\nOption D claims that short-term memory is the initial level of processing of sensory information. Well, actually, sensory memory is the first stage where sensory information is briefly stored in its raw form. Short-term memory comes after sensory memory, where information that has been selected for further processing is held temporarily.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Option A: Incorrect, because short-term memory processes information beyond just raw sensory data.\n\n- Option B: Seems plausible, as short-term memory has limited capacity and the form of information can affect memorability.\n\n- Option C: Not entirely accurate, as short-term memory can be affected by interference, although perhaps less so than long-term memory.\n\n- Option D: Incorrect, as sensory memory precedes short-term memory in the processing sequence.\n\nBetween options B and C, B seems more accurate because it directly addresses the limited capacity of short-term memory, which is a well-established characteristic. The span of short-term memory is indeed limited by the number and, to some extent, the form of the items presented.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is Option B: Its span is limited by the number and form of the items presented.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
