                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how members of an arbitral tribunal are appointed. There are a few options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's see.\n\nOption A says that all members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties. Hmm, that sounds plausible. In arbitration, it's often the case that the parties involved get to choose the arbitrators. It makes sense because they're the ones in dispute, and they should have a say in who decides their case.\n\nBut wait, is it always the case that both parties get to appoint all the arbitrators? Maybe not. Perhaps there's a chairperson or a neutral arbitrator who is appointed differently.\n\nOption B is similar, saying that all members are appointed by the parties from a restricted list. So, similar to A, but with the added condition that the arbitrators must be chosen from a specific list. Is this common practice? I think in some arbitration rules, there might be a list of approved arbitrators, but I'm not sure if this is universally applied.\n\nOption C suggests that all members are appointed by an impartial third party, like the president of the ICJ. The ICJ is the International Court of Justice, which is a principal organ of the United Nations. Its president is often respected for impartiality and legal expertise. But, in arbitration, it's more common for the parties to have a role in appointing arbitrators, isn't it? Having an external party appoint all arbitrators might be rare, except in cases where the parties cannot agree on appointments.\n\nOption D is interesting. It says that all members are appointed by the parties from a restricted list of arbitrators. This seems similar to option B but emphasizes that the list is restricted. Again, this might be a possibility in some arbitration procedures, but I'm not sure if it's the general rule.\n\nI need to think about international arbitration practices. In many arbitration rules, such as those of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) or the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the appointment process typically involves the parties appointing arbitrators, possibly with the involvement of an appointing authority to ensure impartiality and independence.\n\nLet me recall the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. In those rules, each party appoints one arbitrator, and then the two party-appointed arbitrators agree on a third arbitrator who serves as the chairperson. If they can't agree, the third arbitrator is appointed by an appointing authority.\n\nSimilarly, in the ICC Arbitration Rules, the parties can agree on the number of arbitrators and the appointment procedure. If they don't agree, the ICC Court can intervene to appoint arbitrators.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that in many cases, the parties do have a role in appointing at least some of the arbitrators, if not all.\n\nBut what about ad hoc arbitrations where there's no institutional involvement? In such cases, the parties might agree to appoint all arbitrators themselves, without any restriction to a list.\n\nWait, but the question is asking about generally how arbitral tribunal members are appointed, not specifying a particular arbitration regime.\n\nPerhaps the most accurate answer is option A: all members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties. This seems to align with common arbitration practices where parties have a significant say in the composition of the tribunal.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because in some arbitration rules, especially in institutional arbitrations, there might be more structured ways of appointing arbitrators, possibly from a list of approved arbitrators maintained by the institution.\n\nLet me check some specific examples. Take the ICC Arbitration Rules: parties can agree on the arbitrators, and the ICC Court can intervene if necessary to ensure the appointment process is fair and efficient. Similarly, in UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, parties appoint arbitrators directly or with the assistance of an appointing authority.\n\nIn investment arbitration under the ICSID Convention, parties can agree on the method of appointment, which can include appointment by the parties or by an appointing authority.\n\nSo, across different arbitration regimes, it's common for parties to have a direct role in appointing arbitrators, whether directly or through an appointing authority.\n\nGiven that, option A seems the most general and accurate statement. The other options introduce restrictions or involve third parties in the appointment process, which may not always be the case.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: all members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
