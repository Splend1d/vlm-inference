                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem where 960 mg of Cotrimoxazole is prescribed every 12 hours. I need to find out the daily dose in grams. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what's being asked.\n\nSo, the drug is given every 12 hours, right? That means in one day, which is 24 hours, there are two doses of 960 mg each. Because 24 divided by 12 is 2. So, if you take 960 mg every 12 hours, that means you're taking it twice a day.\n\nAlright, so the total daily dose would be 2 times 960 mg. Let me calculate that: 2 * 960 = 1920 mg per day.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the daily dose in grams, not milligrams. I know that 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams. So, to convert milligrams to grams, I need to divide by 1000.\n\nLet me do that conversion: 1920 mg divided by 1000 is 1.92 grams.\n\nSo, the daily dose is 1.92 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.192\n\nB. 1.92\n\nC. 1920\n\nD. 0.96\n\nIt seems like option B is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the total milligrams per day and then convert directly.\n\nSo, 960 mg every 12 hours means 960 mg in the morning and 960 mg in the evening, totaling 1920 mg per day.\n\nConverting 1920 mg to grams: 1920 \u00f7 1000 = 1.92 grams.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor I need to consider here. It seems straightforward.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the drug is continuous or if there's any accumulation, but no, the question is just asking for the daily dose, not any cumulative effect over time.\n\nAlso, sometimes drugs have different dosing schedules, but in this case, it's clear: 960 mg every 12 hours.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate how many doses are taken in a day and multiply by the single dose.\n\nSo, 24 hours divided by 12 hours per dose equals 2 doses per day.\n\nEach dose is 960 mg, so 2 * 960 = 1920 mg.\n\nThen, 1920 mg is equal to 1.92 grams.\n\nYeah, I'm confident with that.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any unit conversion error.\n\nWe know that:\n\n1 gram = 1000 milligrams\n\nSo, 1920 mg = 1920 \u00f7 1000 = 1.92 grams.\n\nAlternatively, you can move the decimal point three places to the left since milli- is three orders of magnitude smaller than base unit.\n\nSo, 1920 mg is 1.92 grams.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1.92 grams, which is option B.\n\nI think that's it. No further confusion here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.92} \\]"
