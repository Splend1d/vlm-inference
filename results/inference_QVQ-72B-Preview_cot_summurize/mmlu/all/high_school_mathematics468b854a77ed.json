                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that a and b are real numbers with -3 \u2264 a \u2264 1 and -2 \u2264 b \u2264 4, and they're chosen at random. I need to find the probability that their product, a * b, is positive. The options are a few fractions, but I want to make sure I understand how to get to the right answer, not just guess.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total possible outcomes. Since a and b are real numbers within given ranges, this sounds like a uniform continuous probability distribution. The total area where a and b can be chosen is the rectangle defined by a from -3 to 1 and b from -2 to 4.\n\nLet me visualize this. I'll plot a on the x-axis and b on the y-axis. So, a goes from -3 to 1, which is a span of 4 units, and b goes from -2 to 4, which is 6 units. So, the total area is 4 * 6 = 24 square units.\n\nNow, I need to find the region within this rectangle where the product a * b is positive. A product is positive if both a and b are positive, or both are negative.\n\nLet's consider the cases:\n\n1. Both a and b are positive.\n\n2. Both a and b are negative.\n\nI need to find the combined area of these two regions.\n\nFirst, both a and b positive:\n\nFor a to be positive, it needs to be greater than 0. From the given range, a goes from -3 to 1, so the positive part is from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, b needs to be positive, so from 0 to 4.\n\nSo, the area where a > 0 and b > 0 is a rectangle: a from 0 to 1, b from 0 to 4. The area is 1 * 4 = 4 square units.\n\nNext, both a and b negative:\n\na needs to be less than 0, so from -3 to 0.\n\nb needs to be less than 0, so from -2 to 0.\n\nThe area where a < 0 and b < 0 is a rectangle: a from -3 to 0, b from -2 to 0.\n\nThe width of a is 3 units (from -3 to 0), and the height of b is 2 units (from -2 to 0). So, the area is 3 * 2 = 6 square units.\n\nTherefore, the total area where a * b is positive is 4 + 6 = 10 square units.\n\nThe total possible area is 24 square units.\n\nSo, the probability that a * b is positive is 10 / 24.\n\nSimplifying that fraction, I get 5 / 12.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5/12\n\nB. 5/11\n\nC. 7/12\n\nD. 5/17\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's any other region where a * b could be positive that I might have missed.\n\nNo, I think I've covered all possibilities. Both positive and both negative are the only ways their product can be positive.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the regions where a * b is negative, but that's not necessary for this problem.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that 5/12 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\dfrac{5}{12}} \\]"
