                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is the smallest unit that natural selection can change. The options are:\n\nA. a species' gene frequency\n\nB. a population's gene frequency\n\nC. an individual's genome\n\nD. an individual's genotype\n\nFirst, I need to understand what natural selection is and how it works. Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution where certain traits become more or less common in a population over time based on their impact on survival and reproduction.\n\nNow, let's break down each option:\n\nA. A species' gene frequency: This seems like it's referring to the frequency of particular genes or alleles within a species. But natural selection operates on individuals within populations, not directly on the species as a whole.\n\nB. A population's gene frequency: This is similar to option A but specifies a population. Populations are groups of individuals of the same species living in the same area. Natural selection can affect gene frequencies in populations over time, which is a fundamental concept in evolution.\n\nC. An individual's genome: The genome is the complete set of genetic material in an organism. While natural selection acts on individuals, it's important to consider that selection operates on the phenotype, which is influenced by the genome, but the genome itself isn't directly changed through natural selection.\n\nD. An individual's genotype: Genotype refers to the specific genetic makeup of an individual for a particular trait. Natural selection can favor certain genotypes over others, but again, it's the phenotype that is directly subjected to selection pressures.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about this differently. Natural selection acts on phenotypes, which are expressions of genotypes. So, it's through the phenotype that natural selection influences the frequency of genotypes in a population.\n\nBut the question is asking for the smallest unit that natural selection can change. So, is it the species, the population, the individual's genome, or the individual's genotype?\n\nLet me consider that natural selection operates at the level of the individual organism. It's the individuals with certain traits that survive and reproduce better, passing on their genes to the next generation.\n\nSo, in that case, would it be an individual's genotype? But actually, natural selection doesn't change an individual's genotype; it selects for or against certain genotypes based on the environment.\n\nMaybe it's an individual's genome, but that seems similar to genotype. I think there might be some overlap here.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to think about the unit that natural selection can act upon. In other words, what is the smallest entity that can be affected by natural selection?\n\nI recall that natural selection acts on individuals within populations. So, it's not the species as a whole but rather the individuals within a population.\n\nBut between an individual's genome and an individual's genotype, which is smaller?\n\nGenotype refers to specific genetic variations, while the genome is the entire set of genetic material. So, genotype is a part of the genome.\n\nTherefore, the genotype is a smaller unit within the genome.\n\nBut natural selection acts on the phenotype, which is influenced by the genotype.\n\nSo, if two individuals have different genotypes for a particular trait, natural selection might favor one over the other based on how that trait manifests in the environment.\n\nTherefore, natural selection can change the frequencies of different genotypes in a population over time.\n\nWait, but the question is about the smallest unit that natural selection can change, not necessarily the unit that natural selection acts upon.\n\nMaybe I need to think about it in terms of what natural selection can directly influence.\n\nNatural selection can directly influence phenotypes, which are determined by genotypes.\n\nSo, by selecting for certain phenotypes, it indirectly selects for the genotypes that produce those phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, the smallest unit that natural selection can change is an individual's genotype.\n\nBut option C is an individual's genome, which is larger than the genotype.\n\nOption B is a population's gene frequency, which is a consequence of natural selection acting on individuals over time.\n\nOption A is a species' gene frequency, which is even broader than a population.\n\nSo, among the given options, an individual's genotype seems to be the smallest unit that natural selection can change.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because natural selection doesn't change an individual's genotype during its lifetime. It affects the frequency of genotypes in the population across generations.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is a bit tricky.\n\nLet me look up what the smallest unit of natural selection is.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that natural selection acts on individual organisms within populations. It's the individuals that survive and reproduce based on their traits.\n\nTherefore, the smallest unit that natural selection can change is an individual's genotype.\n\nBut some might argue that it's the phenotype, but phenotype isn't listed here.\n\nGiven the options, D. an individual's genotype seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I'm still a bit unsure because natural selection doesn't change an individual's genotype; rather, it leads to differential reproduction based on genotype.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to say that natural selection can lead to changes in the frequencies of genotypes within a population, but the smallest unit of change is at the level of the individual's genotype.\n\nSo, in that case, option D would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the population's gene frequency, option B, but that seems like a consequence of natural selection rather than the smallest unit.\n\nWait, maybe both B and D are related, but D is more specific.\n\nNatural selection can change an individual's genotype frequency in a population, and thereby change the population's gene frequency.\n\nBut again, the smallest unit would be the individual's genotype.\n\nI think the answer is D. an individual's genotype.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
