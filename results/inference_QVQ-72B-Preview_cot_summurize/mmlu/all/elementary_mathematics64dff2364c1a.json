                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which expression shows a prime factorization?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. 2 \u2022 9 \u2022 11\n\nB. 2.5 \u2022 7 \u2022 3\n\nC. 1 \u2022 11 \u2022 13\n\nD. 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 11\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to remember what a prime factorization is. Prime factorization is when you express a number as a product of prime numbers. So, all the numbers in the factorization should be prime, and when you multiply them together, you get the original number.\n\nOkay, so let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 2 \u2022 9 \u2022 11\n\nHmm, 2 is prime, 11 is prime, but 9 is not prime. 9 is 3 times 3, which means it can be factored further into primes. So, this can't be a prime factorization because it includes a composite number, 9.\n\nOption B: 2.5 \u2022 7 \u2022 3\n\nWait a minute, 2.5 is not an integer. Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have no positive integer divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, 2.5 isn't a prime number. Maybe this is a typo or something, but as it is, this can't be a prime factorization because it includes a non-integer.\n\nOption C: 1 \u2022 11 \u2022 13\n\nHere, 11 and 13 are both prime numbers, but there's a 1 in there. Is 1 considered a prime number? No, 1 is neither prime nor composite. So, in prime factorization, we only include prime numbers, not 1. So, this might not be correct.\n\nOption D: 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 11\n\nLet's check this one. 2 is prime, 3 is prime, and 11 is prime. So, all the factors are prime numbers. But wait, is this the complete factorization of some number?\n\nLet me see, if I multiply them all together: 2 times 2 is 4, times 2 is 8, times 3 is 24, times 11 is 264. So, the number being factored is 264. But the question isn't asking for the number, just which expression shows a prime factorization.\n\nSo, based on that, this seems correct because all the factors are prime numbers.\n\nNow, let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: We already saw that 9 is not prime, so it's incorrect.\n\nOption B: 2.5 is not an integer, so it's incorrect.\n\nOption C: 1 is not a prime number, so it's incorrect.\n\nOption D: All factors are prime, so it seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but is there any possibility that one of the other options could also be considered a prime factorization?\n\nFor example, could option A be considered a prime factorization if we factorize 9 further into 3 and 3?\n\nWell, yes, but the way it's written, it includes 9, which is not prime, so as presented, it's incorrect.\n\nOption B has a non-integer, which doesn't fit the definition of prime factorization.\n\nOption C has a 1, which isn't prime.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option D: 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 11.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about whether there could be any other considerations.\n\nIs the question asking for the prime factorization of a specific number, or just which expression shows a prime factorization?\n\nIt says, \"Which expression shows a prime factorization?\" without specifying of which number.\n\nSo, in that case, any of the options that consist solely of prime numbers multiplied together could be considered a prime factorization of some number.\n\nHowever, option D is the only one where all factors are prime numbers.\n\nOption A has 9, which is not prime.\n\nOption B has 2.5, which is not an integer, hence not prime.\n\nOption C has 1, which is not prime.\n\nTherefore, option D is the only correct expression showing a prime factorization.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
