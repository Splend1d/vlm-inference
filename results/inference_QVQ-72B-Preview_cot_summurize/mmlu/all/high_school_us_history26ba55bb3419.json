But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.\n\u2014William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation\nSamoset and Squanto can most directly be compared to whom?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Samoset and Squanto, and I need to compare them directly to someone from the options provided: Tecumseh, Crazy Horse, Sacagawea, or Geronimo. I'm not super familiar with all these historical figures, but let me see what I can recall.\n\nFirst off, the passage is from William Bradford's \"History of Plymouth Plantation,\" which is about the early Pilgrims in Plymouth, Massachusetts. So, Samoset and Squanto were Native Americans who interacted with the English settlers in the 17th century.\n\nSamoset came to the settlers speaking broken English and was from the eastern parts where English fishermen were active. He knew some English names and was familiar with their language because of that contact. He provided valuable information about the local area and the indigenous people there, including introducing them to Squanto.\n\nSquanto was a Native American from the local area who had been to England and could speak English better than Samoset. So, both Samoset and Squanto were bridges between the Native American communities and the English settlers, primarily through their ability to speak English and their knowledge of both cultures.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Tecumseh: I think he was a Native American leader who tried to unite various tribes against the American settlers in the early 19th century. He was involved in conflicts like the War of 1812. So, his role was more of a military and political leader, resisting European expansion.\n\nB. Crazy Horse: He was a prominent Native American chief and warrior among the Oglala Lakota. He was known for his role in the Battle of the Little Bighorn where he defeated General Custer. Similar to Tecumseh, he was involved in resisting white expansion and was a military leader.\n\nC. Sacagawea: She was a Shoshone Native American woman who assisted the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the early 19th century. She served as an interpreter and guide, helping the expedition navigate and communicate with various tribes they encountered.\n\nD. Geronimo: He was a prominent leader of the Chiricahua Apache who fought against Mexican and American forces in the 19th century. Like Tecumseh and Crazy Horse, he was involved in resisting colonization and protecting his people's land.\n\nFrom this, Sacagawea seems to be the most similar to Samoset and Squanto because she, like them, served as an interpreter and bridge between the Native American tribes and the European explorers/settlers. Tecumseh, Crazy Horse, and Geronimo were more involved in military resistance against European expansion, whereas Samoset and Squanto were more about facilitating communication and providing information.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Sacagawea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
