                    "text": "So I have this problem here about calculating the required rate of return for two stocks using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). I'm a bit rusty on CAPM, but I remember that it's a model that helps us understand the relationship between risk and expected return for assets. The formula for CAPM is:\n\n\\[ E(r) = r_f + \\beta (E(r_m) - r_f) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E(r) \\) is the expected return on the asset.\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the beta of the asset.\n\n- \\( E(r_m) \\) is the expected return on the market.\n\nSo, given that the expected return on the market is 10%, the risk-free rate is 7%, and we have two stocks with different betas: Stock A has a beta of 0.8 and Stock B has a beta of 1.4. I need to find the required rate of return for both stocks.\n\nLet me start with Stock A.\n\nFor Stock A:\n\n\\[ \\beta = 0.8 \\]\n\nPlugging into the CAPM formula:\n\n\\[ E(r_A) = 7\\% + 0.8 \\times (10\\% - 7\\%) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the market risk premium:\n\n\\[ E(r_m) - r_f = 10\\% - 7\\% = 3\\% \\]\n\nThen, multiply the beta with the market risk premium:\n\n\\[ 0.8 \\times 3\\% = 2.4\\% \\]\n\nFinally, add this to the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ E(r_A) = 7\\% + 2.4\\% = 9.4\\% \\]\n\nSo, the required rate of return for Stock A is 9.4%.\n\nNow, for Stock B:\n\n\\[ \\beta = 1.4 \\]\n\nAgain, using the CAPM formula:\n\n\\[ E(r_B) = 7\\% + 1.4 \\times (10\\% - 7\\%) \\]\n\nFirst, the market risk premium is the same:\n\n\\[ 10\\% - 7\\% = 3\\% \\]\n\nThen, multiply the beta with the market risk premium:\n\n\\[ 1.4 \\times 3\\% = 4.2\\% \\]\n\nAdd this to the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ E(r_B) = 7\\% + 4.2\\% = 11.2\\% \\]\n\nSo, the required rate of return for Stock B is 11.2%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A seems to match this:\n\nA. 9.4% and 11.2%\n\nB. \u22122.6% and 4.9%\n\nC. 4.3% and 7.4%\n\nD. 6.4% and 10.5%\n\nYes, option A is correct.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for Stock A:\n\n\\[ E(r_A) = 7\\% + 0.8 \\times (10\\% - 7\\%) = 7\\% + 0.8 \\times 3\\% = 7\\% + 2.4\\% = 9.4\\% \\]\n\nThat looks correct.\n\nFor Stock B:\n\n\\[ E(r_B) = 7\\% + 1.4 \\times (10\\% - 7\\%) = 7\\% + 1.4 \\times 3\\% = 7\\% + 4.2\\% = 11.2\\% \\]\n\nAlso correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the answer should be option A: 9.4% and 11.2%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
