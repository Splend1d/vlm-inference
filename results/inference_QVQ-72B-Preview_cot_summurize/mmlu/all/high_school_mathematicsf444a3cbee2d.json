                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. So, Mrs. Busywork asked her class to multiply 10 by 1/3 five times. That sounds like doing 10 multiplied by 1/3, and then multiplying that result by 1/3 again, and repeating this five times. John found a way to do it with just one multiplication, and we need to find out what that single fraction is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to multiply 10 by 1/3 five times. Is it like 10 times (1/3) to the power of 5? Let me think about it.\n\nIf I multiply 10 by 1/3 once, I get 10 * 1/3 = 10/3.\n\nThen, multiplying that by 1/3 again: (10/3) * 1/3 = 10/9.\n\nAgain: (10/9) * 1/3 = 10/27.\n\nAnd so on, until I've multiplied by 1/3 five times.\n\nAlternatively, since each multiplication by 1/3 is like multiplying by 1/3, doing it five times is like multiplying by (1/3)^5.\n\nSo, 10 * (1/3)^5 should give the same result as multiplying by 1/3 five times.\n\nLet me calculate (1/3)^5:\n\n(1/3)^5 = 1/243.\n\nSo, 10 * (1/243) = 10/243.\n\nTherefore, the single fraction that John is using is 1/243.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1/27\n\nB. 1/68\n\nC. 1/3\n\nD. 1/243\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 10, multiplying by 1/3 once: 10 * 1/3 = 10/3.\n\nThen, multiplying that result by 1/3: (10/3) * 1/3 = 10/9.\n\nThen: (10/9) * 1/3 = 10/27.\n\nNext: (10/27) * 1/3 = 10/81.\n\nFinally: (10/81) * 1/3 = 10/243.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent with 10 * (1/3)^5 = 10/243.\n\nTherefore, the single fraction is 1/243, which corresponds to option D.\n\nI think that's the answer. I don't see any other way to interpret the problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
