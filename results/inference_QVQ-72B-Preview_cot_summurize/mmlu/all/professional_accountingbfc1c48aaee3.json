                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Aston and Becker are equal partners in AB Partnership. That means each has a 50% share in the partnership, right? In the tax year, the partnership has ordinary income of $20,000 and a long-term capital gain of $12,000. Aston's basis in AB is $40,000, and he received distributions of $5,000 during the year. We need to find Aston's share of AB's ordinary income.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how partnership income is allocated to partners. Since they're equal partners, I think their shares of income should be equal unless there's some other agreement. But the problem doesn't mention any special allocation, so I'll assume they split everything 50/50.\n\nSo, the ordinary income is $20,000. If Aston and Becker are equal partners, each should get half of that. Let me calculate that:\n\nAston's share of ordinary income = 50% of $20,000 = 0.50 * $20,000 = $10,000\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But maybe there's more to it. There's also a long-term capital gain of $12,000. Does that affect Aston's share of ordinary income? Or is it separate?\n\nI recall that in partnerships, different types of income can be allocated differently, but unless specified otherwise, ordinary income and capital gains are generally allocated based on the partners' profit-sharing ratios. Since they're equal partners, both should get half of each type of income.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for Aston's share of the ordinary income, not including the capital gain. So, maybe the capital gain doesn't affect this calculation directly.\n\nLet me double-check. If the partnership has ordinary income of $20,000 and each partner gets half, then Aston should get $10,000. The capital gain is separate and would be allocated separately, probably also 50% to each.\n\nSo, Aston's total income from the partnership would be his share of ordinary income plus his share of the capital gain. But the question only asks for the ordinary income share, so perhaps the capital gain is irrelevant to this specific question.\n\nMaybe the distributions and basis come into play later, but for now, it seems like the straightforward answer is $10,000.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's more to this. Maybe the basis and distributions affect Aston's taxable income or his basis in the partnership, but again, the question is specifically about his share of ordinary income.\n\nLet me consider if there's any tax treatment that might affect the allocation. For tax purposes, partners are generally allocated their share of income based on their profit-sharing ratio, which in this case is 50%.\n\nUnless there's some special allocation or other factors at play, which the problem doesn't mention, I think the answer is simply $10,000.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe through the lens of partnership accounting. The partnership has income, which is allocated to partners, and then distributions are made, which could affect the partner's basis.\n\nBut in terms of Aston's share of ordinary income, that should be directly half of the partnership's ordinary income.\n\nWait, perhaps the distributions affect the taxable income reported. But no, the distribution is typically tax-free up to the partner's basis, and the income is reported regardless of distributions.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is pretty direct: Aston and Becker are equal partners, ordinary income is $20,000, so each gets $10,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. $10,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\n- If there are any guaranteed payments, but the problem doesn't mention any.\n\n- If there are any special allocations based on the partnership agreement, but again, the problem assumes they're equal partners with no special allocations mentioned.\n\n- If the capital gain is being treated differently, but since it's separate from ordinary income, it shouldn't affect this specific calculation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 10000} \\]"
