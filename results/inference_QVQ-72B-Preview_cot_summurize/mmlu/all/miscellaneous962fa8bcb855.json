Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that 'Kingpin' is a movie from 1996. I remember watching it a while back, but it's been a bit since I've seen it. I think it's a comedy, right? Anyway, I need to recall what the main sport in the movie is.\n\nLet me think about the plot. I think it's about a bowler who loses his hand or something and then tries to make a comeback. Wait, is that right? Or is it about golf? I'm a bit confused now.\n\nLet me consider the title 'Kingpin'. In bowling, a kingpin is like the first pin, right? So that might suggest that bowling is involved. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption A is wrestling. I don't recall any wrestling in 'Kingpin'. Maybe there's a wrestling movie out there with a similar name, but I don't think so. So, probably not wrestling.\n\nOption B is golf. There are a lot of golf movies, like 'Caddyshack' or 'Tin Cup', but I don't think 'Kingpin' is about golf. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't remember any golfing scenes in it.\n\nOption C is chess. Chess movies are less common, but there's 'Searching for Bobby Fischer'. I don't think 'Kingpin' is about chess. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I don't recall any chess themes in the movie.\n\nOption D is bowling. This seems the most likely. I remember the main character is a bowler who faces some challenges and tries to regain his status. Plus, the title 'Kingpin' makes sense in the context of bowling.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up some information about the movie to confirm. I recall that Woody Harrelson is in it, and maybe Bill Murray. They're both known for comedy roles, especially in sports movies.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific scenes. There's a scene where the main character's hand gets injured or something, and he has to adjust his bowling style. That sounds like it's related to bowling.\n\nAlso, I think there's a big bowling tournament at the end where everything is resolved. Yeah, that rings a bell.\n\nSo, based on my memory, it seems like the sport featured in 'Kingpin' is bowling. I don't think it's wrestling, golf, or chess.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider each option again:\n\n- Wrestling: No, I don't remember any wrestling in the movie.\n\n- Golf: There might be some sports movies that crossover, but 'Kingpin' isn't one of them.\n\n- Chess: Doesn't seem to fit the plot or the title.\n\n- Bowling: Fits the title, the plot, and the scenes I recall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. bowling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. bowling}} \\]"
