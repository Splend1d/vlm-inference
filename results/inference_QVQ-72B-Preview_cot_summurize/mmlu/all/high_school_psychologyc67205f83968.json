But Maria isn't really into it; she's late for sessions, uncooperative, and even hostile towards the therapist. Then, her counselor starts to look into why Maria is feeling this way and realizes that Maria's hostility is actually directed at her parents. So, the question is, what's this an example of?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. suppression\n\nB. conflicting motives\n\nC. transference\n\nD. countertransference\n\nOkay, let's break these terms down.\n\nFirst, suppression. I think suppression is when someone consciously pushes away uncomfortable thoughts or feelings. Like, you know, when you don't want to deal with something, so you just try to ignore it and hope it goes away. But in Maria's case, she's not just ignoring her feelings; she's directing her hostility towards her therapist instead of her parents. So, it seems like there's more to it than just suppression.\n\nNext, conflicting motives. That sounds like when a person has two or more desires that clash with each other. For example, Maria might want to get better but also resent her parents for making her go to therapy. That could cause her to act out against the therapist. Hmm, that seems plausible, but is that exactly what's happening here? The question is more about why she's hostile towards the therapist, not just having conflicting feelings inside.\n\nThen there's transference. I've heard of this before. It's when a patient projects feelings about someone else onto the therapist. So, maybe Maria is seeing her therapist as a figure of authority, like her parents, and directing her feelings towards her parents onto her therapist. That sounds a lot like what's happening here. She's mad at her parents for making her go to therapy, and she's taking it out on the therapist.\n\nCountertransference is similar but the other way around. It's when the therapist projects their own feelings onto the patient. For example, if the therapist doesn't like Maria and starts treating her poorly because of personal issues. But that's not what's happening here. The counselor is trying to understand Maria's feelings and where they're coming from.\n\nSo, between the options, C. transference seems to be the most fitting. Maria is transferring her feelings about her parents onto her therapist, which is why she's being hostile towards the therapist.\n\nLet me double-check. Suppression is more about pushing away feelings, not transferring them to someone else. Conflicting motives involve internal struggles between different desires, but doesn't directly explain why she's hostile towards the therapist. Countertransference is about the therapist's projections, not the patient's.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. transference.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
