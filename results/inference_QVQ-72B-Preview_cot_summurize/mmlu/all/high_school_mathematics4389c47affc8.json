                    "text": "So I have this problem about Morse code. It says that each symbol is represented by a sequence of dashes and dots, and I need to find out how many distinct symbols can be represented using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes. The options are 3, 4680, 30, and 10.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Morse code is. Morse code is a method used to encode text characters as sequences of dots and dashes. Each character is represented by a unique sequence, and these sequences have a certain length in terms of the number of dots and dashes they contain.\n\nThe problem is asking for the total number of distinct symbols that can be made using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 dots and dashes combined. So, I need to calculate the number of possible sequences for each of these lengths and then add them all up.\n\nLet me start by considering sequences of length 1. That means there's only one symbol, which can either be a dot or a dash. So, for sequences of length 1, there are 2 possibilities: either a dot or a dash.\n\nNext, for sequences of length 2, each position can be either a dot or a dash. So, for two positions, it's 2 choices for the first position and 2 choices for the second position. That means 2 * 2 = 4 possibilities. The sequences could be: dot-dash, dash-dot, dot-dot, dash-dash.\n\nFor sequences of length 3, it's similar. Each of the three positions can be a dot or a dash, so it's 2^3 = 8 possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences of length 4, it's 2^4 = 16 possibilities.\n\nNow, to find the total number of distinct symbols, I need to add up these numbers: 2 (for length 1) + 4 (for length 2) + 8 (for length 3) + 16 (for length 4) = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30.\n\nLooking back at the options, 30 is one of them, so I think the answer is 30.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. In Morse code, the order matters because the sequence dot-dash is different from dash-dot. So, it's correct to treat this as combinations with repetition where order matters, which is indeed what I've done.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether there are any restrictions in Morse code that might disallow certain sequences, but the problem seems to be abstractly asking for the number of possible sequences, not necessarily the number of sequences used in practice. So, I think it's safe to assume that all possible sequences are allowed.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that for each position in the sequence, there are 2 choices: dot or dash. So, for a sequence of length n, there are 2^n possible sequences. Therefore, for sequences of lengths 1 through 4, the total number is the sum of 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4, which is 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30.\n\nI don't see any other factors that would affect this calculation, so I'm confident that the correct answer is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
