                    "text": "So I have this question here about the U.S. Constitution and presidential powers. It's asking which one of these options is NOT a power that the president has according to the Constitution. The options are:\n\nA. Negotiate treaties\n\nB. Veto legislation\n\nC. Grant reprieves and pardons\n\nD. Declare war\n\nAlright, let's go through each one of these.\n\nStarting with option A: Negotiate treaties.\n\nI know that the President does have the power to negotiate treaties with other countries. In fact, it's a pretty well-known presidential power. But just to be sure, I remember that the President can negotiate treaties, but they have to be ratified by the Senate. So, the President can negotiate them, but the Senate has to approve them. So, that seems like a presidential power.\n\nMoving on to option B: Veto legislation.\n\nAgain, I recall that the President can veto bills that are passed by Congress. This is a check and balance system to prevent\u7acb\u6cd5ative overreach. So, the President has the power to say no to a bill, and then it's up to Congress to override that veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses. So, vetoing legislation is definitely a presidential power.\n\nNext is option C: Grant reprieves and pardons.\n\nI know that the President has the power to pardon individuals, which is like forgiving them for crimes they've committed, often after they've been convicted. This is another presidential power, though there might be some limitations, especially in cases of impeachment. But generally, the President can grant pardons and reprieves for federal offenses. So, that's also a presidential power.\n\nNow, finally, option D: Declare war.\n\nThis is the one that seems a bit different. I know that the President is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and has a lot of power in military matters. But when it comes to declaring war, I think that's something only Congress can do. Let me think about this.\n\nI believe that the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power to declare war. There might be times when the President orders military actions without a formal declaration of war, but that's usually based on existing authorizations from Congress or in cases of national emergency.\n\nSo, to my knowledge, the President cannot unilaterally declare war; that's a power reserved for Congress.\n\nTo double-check, I can recall that the War Powers Resolution of 1973 was passed to limit the President's ability to send troops into combat without Congressional approval. So, even though the President can order military actions in certain circumstances, formally declaring war is indeed a Congressional power.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, option D\u2014declare war\u2014is not a constitutionally mandated presidential power.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
