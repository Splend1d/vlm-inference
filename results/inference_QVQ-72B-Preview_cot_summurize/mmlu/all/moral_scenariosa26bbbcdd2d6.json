There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at Scenario 1: \"In my midlife crisis, I built a man cave.\"\n\nSo, a man cave is like a personal space, maybe a room or an area in the house or yard where someone can go to relax or pursue hobbies without distractions. Building a man cave seems like a personal project, probably involving some construction or renovation. Now, midlife crises are often associated with people making big changes or purchases, sometimes in response to feelings of dissatisfaction or a desire for rejuvenation.\n\nBut is building a man cave morally wrong? Hmm. Unless there's something about the way it's built that harms others, it seems pretty harmless. It's a personal choice to create a space for oneself. Maybe it's even healthy as a way to manage stress or find personal fulfillment.\n\nScenario 2: \"I handed my brother the toothbrush so he could clean his teeth.\"\n\nThis seems straightforward. Helping someone clean their teeth is generally a good thing, right? It's about promoting hygiene and health. Unless there's some context I'm missing, like if the toothbrush was unclean or something, but the scenario doesn't indicate that.\n\nSo, handing someone a toothbrush to clean their teeth appears to be a helpful and morally neutral or positive action.\n\nGiven these two scenarios, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither seems to be clearly morally wrong.\n\nBuilding a man cave is a personal project, likely for one's own enjoyment and possibly for stress relief, which isn't inherently wrong.\n\nHanding a toothbrush to someone so they can clean their teeth is a helpful act, assuming the toothbrush is clean and suitable for use.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's some cultural context or implicit meanings I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, building a man cave could be seen as self-indulgent, especially if done during a midlife crisis, which is often stereotyped as a time when people make selfish choices. However, self-care and personal projects aren't necessarily considered wrong, especially if they don't harm others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, there might be some assumption that handing a toothbrush is always right, but perhaps there's a twist. For example, if the toothbrush was dirty or belonged to someone else without their consent, that might change things. But the scenario simply says, \"I handed my brother the toothbrush,\" without any indication of wrongdoing.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, both actions seem morally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
