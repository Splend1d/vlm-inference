Hmm, I need to recall what letters are associated with the number '3' on a standard touch-tone telephone keypad.\n\nLet me think back to when I've used such keypads. I know that each number from 2 to 9 on a telephone keypad is associated with a set of three letters. The number 1 and 0 usually don't have letters, right? So, it's a grid layout with numbers and their corresponding letters.\n\nLet me list out what I remember:\n\n- 2: ABC\n\n- 3: DEF\n\n- 4: GHI\n\n- 5: JKL\n\n- 6: MNO\n\n- 7: PQRS\n\n- 8: TUV\n\n- 9: WXYZ\n\nWait, sometimes I get confused because on some older keypads, the letters might be different, but I think this is the standard layout.\n\nSo, according to this, the number '3' should have DEF. Let me double-check that.\n\nI recall that '2' is ABC, '3' is DEF, '4' is GHI, and so on. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, option B. DEF should be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any variation. Maybe in different countries or on specific types of phones, the layout could differ, but in the United States, this is the standard arrangement.\n\nAlso, I remember that the letters are typically arranged in the order of the alphabet on the keypads, starting with '2' having A, B, C; '3' has D, E, F, and so on.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is B. DEF.\n\nWait a minute, but option A is ABC, which is '2'; option C is GHI, which is '4'; and option D is WXY, which is part of '9'. So, based on that, B. DEF corresponds to '3'.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can visualize the keypad. Starting from the top left:\n\n- '1' is usually the top left corner, which has no letters.\n\n- Then '2' is ABC.\n\n- '3' is DEF.\n\n- '4' is GHI.\n\n- '5' is JKL.\n\n- '6' is MNO.\n\n- '7' is PQRS.\n\n- '8' is TUV.\n\n- '9' is WXYZ.\n\n- And then '0' is sometimes used for operators or voicemail, without letters.\n\nSo, again, confirming that '3' is DEF.\n\nI think that's solid. The answer should be B. DEF.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that sometimes keypads might have different mappings, but in the absence of specific information, I should go with the standard layout.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. DEF.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ DEF} \\]"
