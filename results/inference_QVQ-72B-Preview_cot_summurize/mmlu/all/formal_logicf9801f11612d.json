                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on propositional logic (PL), but I remember that it involves logical connectives and propositions. The problem gives us five premises and asks which proposition is an immediate consequence of these premises.\n\nFirst, let's list out the premises again:\n\n1. ~E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. G \u2283 F\n\n3. H \u2228 ~E\n\n4. H \u2283 I\n\n5. ~I\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. E \u2283 F\n\nB. F \u2283 G\n\nC. H \u2283 ~E\n\nD. ~H\n\nMy goal is to determine which of these options necessarily follows from the given premises in just one step. In propositional logic, an immediate consequence typically involves applying a basic rule of inference, like modus ponens, modus tollens, disjunctive syllogism, etc., directly to one or more of the premises.\n\nI should recall some of these inference rules:\n\n- Modus Ponens: If P \u2283 Q and P, then Q.\n\n- Modus Tollens: If P \u2283 Q and ~Q, then ~P.\n\n- Hypothetical Syllogism: If P \u2283 Q and Q \u2283 R, then P \u2283 R.\n\n- Disjunctive Syllogism: If P \u2228 Q and ~P, then Q.\n\n- Simplification: If P \u2227 Q, then P.\n\n- Conjunction: If P and Q, then P \u2227 Q.\n\n- Addition: If P, then P \u2228 Q.\n\n- Constructive Dilemma: If (P \u2283 Q) \u2227 (R \u2283 S) and P \u2228 R, then Q \u2228 S.\n\n- Absorption: If P \u2283 Q, then P \u2283 (P \u2227 Q).\n\n- De Morgan's Laws: ~(P \u2227 Q) \u2261 ~P \u2228 ~Q and ~(P \u2228 Q) \u2261 ~P \u2227 ~Q.\n\nI need to see which of the options can be derived directly from the premises using one of these rules.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: E \u2283 F**\n\nI need to see if from the given premises, I can immediately conclude that E \u2283 F.\n\nLooking at the premises:\n\n1. ~E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. G \u2283 F\n\n3. H \u2228 ~E\n\n4. H \u2283 I\n\n5. ~I\n\nI don't see a direct way to derive E \u2283 F from these. Maybe if I can manipulate some of them, but it seems a bit involved, possibly more than one step.\n\n**Option B: F \u2283 G**\n\nSimilarly, I need to see if F \u2283 G follows immediately from the premises.\n\nLooking at premise 2: G \u2283 F\n\nIf I could have F, then by modus ponens, I could get G. But I don't have F as a premise. Alternatively, if I had ~G, I could use modus tollens, but I don't have that either.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of G \u2283 F is ~F \u2283 ~G. But I don't have ~F in the premises.\n\nThis also seems like it would take more than one step to derive F \u2283 G.\n\n**Option C: H \u2283 ~E**\n\nThis one looks promising. Let's see.\n\nWe have premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd premise 5: ~I\n\nAlso, premise 4: H \u2283 I\n\nAnd premise 5: ~I\n\nIf H were true, then by premise 4, I would be true. But premise 5 says ~I, so H cannot be true because that would lead to a contradiction (I and ~I). Therefore, H must be false, which is ~H.\n\nWait, but that's not directly leading to H \u2283 ~E.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the disjunctive syllogism.\n\nDisjunctive syllogism states that if P \u2228 Q and ~P, then Q.\n\nIn this case, premise 3 is H \u2228 ~E\n\nIf I had ~H, then by disjunctive syllogism, I could conclude ~E.\n\nBut do I have ~H as a premise? No, but maybe I can derive it.\n\nFrom premise 4: H \u2283 I\n\nAnd premise 5: ~I\n\nUsing modus tollens, from H \u2283 I and ~I, I can conclude ~H.\n\nSo, now I have ~H.\n\nThen, from premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd from the derived ~H, by disjunctive syllogism, I get ~E.\n\nTherefore, from ~H, I get ~E.\n\nSo, H \u2283 ~E\n\nWait, that seems to be what option C is saying.\n\nBut did I derive H \u2283 ~E in one step?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFrom premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd from derived ~H (using modus tollens on premise 4 and 5), I get ~E by disjunctive syllogism.\n\nSo, H \u2283 ~E\n\nBut is this an immediate consequence in one step?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nLet me consider the material conditional: H \u2283 ~E is logically equivalent to ~H \u2228 ~E.\n\nFrom premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd premise 5: ~I\n\nAnd premise 4: H \u2283 I\n\nFrom premise 4 and premise 5, using modus tollens, I get ~H.\n\nSo, now I have ~H.\n\nTherefore, from premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd from ~H, by disjunctive syllogism, I get ~E.\n\nSo, H \u2283 ~E\n\nBut is this an immediate consequence? It seems like it took two steps: first deriving ~H and then applying disjunctive syllogism.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for an immediate (one-step) consequence.\n\nIs there a way to get H \u2283 ~E directly from the premises in one step?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the chain rule or hypothetical syllogism.\n\nLooking at premises 4 and 5:\n\n4. H \u2283 I\n\n5. ~I\n\nUsing modus tollens on these, I get ~H.\n\nNow, from premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd from ~H, by disjunctive syllogism, I get ~E.\n\nTherefore, H \u2283 ~E\n\nBut again, this seems like two steps.\n\nIs there a way to see this as one step?\n\nPerhaps if I consider the exportation rule, which states that (P \u2227 Q) \u2283 R is equivalent to P \u2283 (Q \u2283 R).\n\nBut I don't see that directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to combine premises 3 and 4 directly.\n\nWait, premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nPremise 4: H \u2283 I\n\nIf I assume H, then from premise 4, I get I.\n\nBut I also have premise 5: ~I\n\nSo, if H were true, then I would be true, which contradicts ~I.\n\nTherefore, H cannot be true, so H is false, which is ~H.\n\nTherefore, from premises 4 and 5, I get ~H.\n\nNow, from premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd from ~H, by disjunctive syllogism, I get ~E.\n\nTherefore, H \u2283 ~E\n\nBut again, this seems like more than one step.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the contrapositive.\n\nIf H \u2283 ~E, then its contrapositive is E \u2283 ~H.\n\nBut I don't have E or ~H directly in the premises.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better option.\n\n**Option D: ~H**\n\nThis is interesting.\n\nFrom premises 4 and 5:\n\n4. H \u2283 I\n\n5. ~I\n\nUsing modus tollens, I can immediately conclude ~H.\n\nThis seems like a direct application of modus tollens, which is a fundamental rule of inference in propositional logic.\n\nSo, ~H is an immediate consequence of premises 4 and 5.\n\nTherefore, option D: ~H\n\nBut let's double-check if any other option can also be an immediate consequence.\n\n**Revisiting Option C: H \u2283 ~E**\n\nEarlier, I thought it took more than one step to derive H \u2283 ~E, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nFrom premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd from premises 4 and 5: H \u2283 I and ~I\n\nUsing modus tollens on 4 and 5, I get ~H.\n\nNow, from premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n\nAnd from ~H, by disjunctive syllogism, I get ~E.\n\nTherefore, H \u2283 ~E\n\nBut is this an immediate consequence in one step? It seems like it requires deriving ~H first, which is already one step, and then applying disjunctive syllogism, which is another step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to see H \u2283 ~E as directly following from premise 3 and the negation of premise 4 and 5.\n\nBut I still think it's more than one step.\n\n**Option A: E \u2283 F**\n\nLooking back, is there a way to derive E \u2283 F directly from the premises in one step?\n\nFrom premise 1: ~E \u2283 ~F\n\nWhich is logically equivalent to E \u2228 ~F\n\nBut I don't see a direct way to get E \u2283 F from this.\n\nAlternatively, if I had F \u2283 E, then combined with E \u2228 ~F, maybe something could be done, but I don't have that.\n\nI think this is not an immediate consequence.\n\n**Option B: F \u2283 G**\n\nFrom premise 2: G \u2283 F\n\nWhich is the contrapositive of F \u2283 G, but that doesn't directly give F \u2283 G.\n\nI don't see a way to derive F \u2283 G in one step from the given premises.\n\n**Option D: ~H**\n\nAs previously determined, this follows directly from modus tollens applied to premises 4 and 5.\n\nTherefore, ~H is an immediate consequence.\n\n**Final Verdict**\n\nAfter careful consideration, I conclude that option D: ~H is the correct answer, as it is the only option that can be derived immediately from the given premises in just one step using modus tollens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\sim H}"
