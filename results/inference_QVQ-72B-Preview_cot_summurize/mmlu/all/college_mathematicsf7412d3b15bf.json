                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It says that there's a circle C in the yz-plane with the equation \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\), and if this circle is revolved around the z-axis, it generates a torus. I need to find the equation of this torus from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a torus is. A torus is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space around an axis coplanar with the circle. In this case, the circle is in the yz-plane and we're revolving it around the z-axis.\n\nSo, the original circle has the equation \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\). This looks like a circle with a radius of 1, centered at (0, 3, 0) in the yz-plane.\n\nWhen you revolve this circle around the z-axis, you get a torus. The standard equation for a torus in cylindrical coordinates is something like \\((r - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2\\), where \\(R\\) is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and \\(r\\) is the radius of the tube.\n\nBut here, we need to find the equation in Cartesian coordinates. Maybe I can express the torus in terms of the distances from certain points.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the equation of the torus by considering the path traced by each point on the original circle as it revolves around the z-axis.\n\nLet me try to parametrize the original circle. The equation \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\) can be parametrized as:\n\n\\[y = 3 + \\cos \\theta\\]\\[z = \\sin \\theta\\]\n\nfor \\(\\theta\\) ranging from 0 to \\(2\\pi\\).\n\nNow, when I revolve this circle around the z-axis, each point \\((y, z)\\) will trace out a circle in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis at a fixed \\(z\\), with radius equal to \\(y\\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you revolve around the z-axis, the path of a point is a circle in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, but the radius of that circle is the distance from the point to the z-axis, which is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), but in this case, since the original circle is in the yz-plane, \\(x = 0\\), so the distance is just \\(|y|\\).\n\nBut actually, no. The distance from a point to the z-axis is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), but in the yz-plane, \\(x = 0\\), so it's just \\(|y|\\). But when we revolve around the z-axis, points will have coordinates \\((x, y, z)\\), and the distance from the z-axis will be \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the distance from the axis of revolution.\n\nThe axis of revolution is the z-axis. So, for any point \\((x, y, z)\\), its distance from the z-axis is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\nThe original circle is in the yz-plane, so \\(x = 0\\), and its equation is \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\), which is a circle of radius 1 centered at \\((0, 3, 0)\\).\n\nWhen we revolve this circle around the z-axis, each point on the original circle traces out a circle in space. The radius of this traced circle is the distance from the point to the z-axis, which is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), but since in the original circle \\(x = 0\\), it's just \\(|y|\\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you revolve around the z-axis, the distance from the z-axis to a point on the revolved surface is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\). But in the original circle, \\(x = 0\\), so the distance is \\(|y|\\). But when you revolve it, you get points with \\(x \\neq 0\\), and the distance becomes \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\nMaybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps I can use the concept that the torus can be described as all points at a fixed distance from the original circle.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the torus consists of all points whose closest distance to the original circle is equal to the radius of the circle being revolved.\n\nWait, that might be too vague. Maybe I should look for a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me consider the parametric equations for the torus. Since the original circle is in the yz-plane, parametrized as \\(y = 3 + \\cos \\theta\\), \\(z = \\sin \\theta\\), and when revolved around the z-axis, each point on this circle traces out a circle around the z-axis.\n\nSo, for each \\(\\theta\\), the point \\((y, z)\\) traces a circle in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis at \\(z = \\sin \\theta\\), with radius equal to the distance from the z-axis, which is \\(|y| = |3 + \\cos \\theta|\\).\n\nWait, actually, the radius of the circle traced by each point is the distance from the point to the z-axis, which is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), but in the original circle, \\(x = 0\\), so it's \\(|y| = |3 + \\cos \\theta|\\).\n\nBut when we revolve it, we need to express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\) and another parameter, say \\(\\phi\\), representing the angle of revolution around the z-axis.\n\nSo, the parametric equations for the torus would be:\n\n\\[x = (3 + \\cos \\theta) \\cos \\phi\\]\\[y = (3 + \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\phi\\]\\[z = \\sin \\theta\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) ranges from 0 to \\(2\\pi\\), and \\(\\phi\\) ranges from 0 to \\(2\\pi\\).\n\nNow, I need to eliminate the parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\) to get the equation in terms of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\nFirst, from the expressions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\n\\[x = (3 + \\cos \\theta) \\cos \\phi\\]\\[y = (3 + \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\phi\\]\n\nI can see that \\(x^2 + y^2 = (3 + \\cos \\theta)^2 \\cos^2 \\phi + (3 + \\cos \\theta)^2 \\sin^2 \\phi = (3 + \\cos \\theta)^2 (\\cos^2 \\phi + \\sin^2 \\phi) = (3 + \\cos \\theta)^2\\).\n\nSimilarly, from \\(z = \\sin \\theta\\), and knowing that \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\), I can express \\(\\cos \\theta\\) in terms of \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\\cos \\theta = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - z^2}\\]\n\nBut this might complicate things. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the distance from a point on the torus to the z-axis, which is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), and relate it to the original circle.\n\nFrom the parametric equations:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = |3 + \\cos \\theta|\\]\n\nAnd from \\(z = \\sin \\theta\\), I can write \\(\\cos \\theta = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - z^2}\\), but this seems messy.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of \\(z\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\), but that seems complicated.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can consider the equation of the torus in terms of the distances.\n\nThe torus can be thought of as all points at a fixed distance from the original circle.\n\nSpecifically, the distance from a point \\((x, y, z)\\) to the original circle is equal to the radius of the circle being revolved.\n\nThe original circle is \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\), so the distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to this circle is the minimal distance to any point on the circle.\n\nBut calculating this minimal distance directly seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the torus can be described as all points whose distance to the axis of the torus is equal to a certain value.\n\nIn this case, the axis of the torus is the z-axis, and the distance from a point to the z-axis is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed from here.\n\nMaybe I should look back at the parametric equations and try to eliminate the parameters.\n\nFrom \\(x = (3 + \\cos \\theta) \\cos \\phi\\) and \\(y = (3 + \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\phi\\), I can write:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = (3 + \\cos \\theta)^2 (\\cos^2 \\phi + \\sin^2 \\phi) = (3 + \\cos \\theta)^2\\]\n\nSimilarly, from \\(z = \\sin \\theta\\), and \\(\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta = 1\\), I have \\(\\cos \\theta = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - z^2}\\).\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = (3 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - z^2})^2\\]\n\nThis seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to eliminate the parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation of the torus in terms of the distances.\n\nThe torus can be described as all points where the distance from the point to the center of the tube is equal to the radius of the tube.\n\nIn this case, the center of the tube is the circle \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\), and the radius of the tube is 1 (since the original circle has radius 1).\n\nSo, for any point \\((x, y, z)\\), the distance from this point to the center of the tube (which is the circle \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\)) is equal to 1.\n\nBut calculating this distance directly is complicated.\n\nMaybe I can think about the squared distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to a point on the center circle \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\), and set that equal to 1.\n\nBut that seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the torus can be described as all points where the distance from the point to the z-axis is equal to the distance from the center of the tube to the z-axis minus the radius of the tube.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the general equation of a torus. In cylindrical coordinates, the standard torus equation is \\((r - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2\\), where \\(R\\) is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and \\(r\\) is the radius of the tube.\n\nIn this problem, the original circle is centered at \\((0, 3, 0)\\), with radius 1. So, when revolved around the z-axis, the distance from the center of the tube to the z-axis is 3, and the radius of the tube is 1.\n\nTherefore, the equation in cylindrical coordinates should be \\((r - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\).\n\nBut I need the equation in Cartesian coordinates. To convert from cylindrical to Cartesian, I recall that \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\nSo, substituting \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\nThis doesn't match any of the given options directly. Maybe I need to expand and simplify this expression.\n\nLet's expand \\((\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 3)^2\\):\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 3)^2 = (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 3^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 6 \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 9\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 - 6 \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 9 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\nThis doesn't seem right because it involves a square root, which complicates things. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the general equation for a torus in Cartesian coordinates is different from what I thought.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can consider the equation in terms of the distances.\n\nThe torus can be described as all points where the distance from the point to the center of the tube is equal to the radius of the tube.\n\nIn this case, the center of the tube is the circle \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\), and the radius of the tube is 1.\n\nSo, for any point \\((x, y, z)\\), the distance from this point to the center circle is equal to 1.\n\nThe distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to any point on the center circle \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\) should be 1.\n\nBut calculating this minimal distance is not straightforward.\n\nMaybe I can think about the squared distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to a point on the center circle and set that equal to 1.\n\nLet me denote a general point on the center circle as \\((0, 3 + \\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta)\\).\n\nThen, the squared distance from \\((x, y, z)\\) to this point is:\n\n\\[(x - 0)^2 + (y - (3 + \\cos \\theta))^2 + (z - \\sin \\theta)^2\\]\n\nThis should be equal to 1 for points on the torus.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n\\[x^2 + (y - 3 - \\cos \\theta)^2 + (z - \\sin \\theta)^2 = 1\\]\n\nBut this is an equation involving \\(\\theta\\), which is not desirable. I need to eliminate \\(\\theta\\).\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me consider that the torus can also be described as all points where the distance from the point to the z-axis is equal to the distance from the center of the tube to the z-axis minus the radius of the tube.\n\nIn this case, the distance from the center of the tube to the z-axis is 3, and the radius of the tube is 1.\n\nSo, the distance from any point on the torus to the z-axis should be equal to \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\n\nWait, that can't be right, because if the center of the tube is at a distance of 3 from the z-axis, and the tube has a radius of 1, then points on the torus can be at distances ranging from 2 to 4 from the z-axis, not just at 2.\n\nSo, that approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the general equation for a torus in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nAfter some research, I recall that the standard equation for a torus with major radius \\(R\\) and minor radius \\(r\\) is:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2\\]\n\nIn this problem, the major radius \\(R\\) is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, which is 3, and the minor radius \\(r\\) is the radius of the tube, which is 1.\n\nSo, plugging in these values, the equation should be:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to expand this, it led to an equation involving a square root, which didn't match any of the given options.\n\nMaybe I need to manipulate this equation further.\n\nLet's expand \\((\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 3)^2\\):\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 3^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 6 \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 9\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 - 6 \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 9 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\nThis still involves a square root, which is not ideal. Maybe I need to square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nLet me set:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\]\n\nThen the equation is:\n\n\\[(d - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[d^2 - 6d + 9 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\n\\[d^2 - 6d + z^2 + 8 = 0\\]\n\nBut \\(d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), so squaring both sides:\n\n\\[d^2 = x^2 + y^2\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 - 6 \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + z^2 + 8 = 0\\]\n\nThis still has a square root, which is problematic. Maybe I need a different strategy.\n\nLet me consider the parametric equations again:\n\n\\[x = (3 + \\cos \\theta) \\cos \\phi\\]\\[y = (3 + \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\phi\\]\\[z = \\sin \\theta\\]\n\nI need to eliminate \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\).\n\nFrom \\(x^2 + y^2 = (3 + \\cos \\theta)^2\\), and \\(z^2 = \\sin^2 \\theta\\), and knowing that \\(\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta = 1\\), perhaps I can express everything in terms of \\(\\cos \\theta\\) and \\(\\sin"
