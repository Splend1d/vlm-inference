                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The excitement of the car race made me cheer.\n\nScenario 2: I drove through the intersection before the stoplight turned green.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character (who uses \"I/me/my\") does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I should probably consider what constitutes a moral wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Morality can be subjective and varies across cultures and time periods, but there are some general principles that are widely accepted in the US.\n\nLet's start by analyzing Scenario 1: Cheering at a car race due to excitement.\n\nCheering is generally seen as a positive or neutral action, especially in the context of sports or competitive events like car races. It's a way to show support and enthusiasm for the participants. In this scenario, the person is cheering because of the excitement of the race, which seems like a natural and acceptable reaction. There doesn't appear to be any harm intended or caused by this action.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any context missing that might change this perception. For example, if the person was cheering for someone to get hurt or was engaging in behavior that was disruptive or dangerous to others, that might be considered morally wrong. But based on the information provided, it seems like straightforward cheering due to excitement.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Driving through an intersection before the stoplight turned green.\n\nThis scenario involves disregarding a traffic signal, which is against traffic laws. Running a red light is not only illegal but also poses significant safety risks to both the driver and others on the road, such as pedestrians and other vehicles. It's a reckless behavior that can lead to accidents, injuries, or even fatalities.\n\nIn the US, traffic laws are in place to ensure the orderly and safe flow of traffic. Running a red light is a clear violation of these laws and is considered dangerous behavior. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, driving through an intersection before the stoplight turns green is indeed a morally wrong action because it endangers others and disregards established safety rules.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Cheering at a car race due to excitement \u2013 This seems morally acceptable.\n\n- Scenario 2: Driving through an intersection before the stoplight turns green \u2013 This is morally wrong due to the potential harm it can cause and the disregard for traffic laws.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios, respectively.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any way that cheering could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the cheering was malicious or if it encouraged harmful behavior, that might change things. However, based on the information given, it seems like the person is simply cheering in response to the excitement of the race, which is generally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, driving through a red light is unequivocally wrong from a moral standpoint because it puts others at risk unnecessarily. It's not just a matter of personal convenience; it's about the safety of everyone sharing the road.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I'm confident that the answer is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
