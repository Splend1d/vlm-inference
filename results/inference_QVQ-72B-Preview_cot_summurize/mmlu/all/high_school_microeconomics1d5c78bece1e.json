                    "text": "So I'm at my best friend's birthday party, and I see Skylar helping himself to a second piece of cake. The question is asking about what must be true for Skylar in this situation regarding marginal benefit and marginal cost. Let me try to understand this.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what marginal benefit and marginal cost mean in this context. Marginal benefit is the benefit Skylar gets from consuming one additional piece of cake, and marginal cost would be the cost or the trade-off he faces by consuming that extra piece.\n\nNow, Skylar is already had one piece and is going for a second. So, he must be valuing the second piece enough to take it. That suggests that the benefit he expects from the second piece is worth the cost.\n\nOption A says that the marginal benefit of the second piece is less than the marginal cost. If that were the case, why would he take it? He'd be getting less benefit than the cost, which doesn't seem logical. Maybe if he really loves cake, he might still take it, but generally, people are assumed to make choices where the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost.\n\nOption B says that the total benefit from eating cake is falling. Well, total benefit usually increases as you consume more, but at a decreasing rate due to diminishing marginal utility. But in this case, since he's taking a second piece, it suggests that total benefit is still increasing, just maybe at a decreasing rate.\n\nOption C says that the ratio of marginal benefit over marginal cost is less than one. That would mean that the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost, which seems similar to option A. Again, if the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost, why would he choose to have the second piece?\n\nOption D says that the marginal benefit of the second piece is greater than the marginal cost. This seems more plausible. If the benefit he gets from the second piece is greater than the cost, then it makes sense for him to take it.\n\nWait a minute, but I thought that in economics, people make decisions at the point where marginal benefit equals marginal cost. So if he's taking a second piece, maybe the marginal benefit is still greater than the marginal cost, encouraging him to consume more until MB = MC.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, he's only taking a second piece, not a third or fourth. Maybe for the second piece, MB > MC, but for the third piece, MB < MC, so he stops at two.\n\nBut the question is asking what must be true for the second piece. So, based on that, option D seems the most straightforward answer: the marginal benefit of the second piece is greater than the marginal cost.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose that the first piece gives him a lot of satisfaction, and the second piece gives him less, but still more than the cost. So, MB2 > MC2, which would make sense why he's taking the second piece.\n\nIf MB2 < MC2, as in option A and C, then he shouldn't be taking the second piece because he's getting less benefit than the cost.\n\nOption B talks about total benefit falling, which doesn't seem right because total benefit should be increasing with consumption, even if marginal benefit is decreasing.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: the marginal benefit of the second piece of cake is greater than the marginal cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
