Barry Buzan and Ole Waever\n\nB. Kenneth Waltz and Hans Morgenthau\n\nC. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\n\nD. Adam Smith and Karl Marx\n\nHmm, I need to figure out who founded historical materialism. I remember that historical materialism is a theory about how society evolves and how economic systems shape history. It's often associated with Marxism. So, probably, Karl Marx is one of the founders. But let's see who else is mentioned in these options.\n\nOption A has Barry Buzan and Ole Waever. I think they're associated with the English School of international relations theory, or maybe with constructivism. But historical materialism is more about Marxism, so probably not them.\n\nOption B is Kenneth Waltz and Hans Morgenthau. They are known for realism in international relations. Waltz developed neorealism, and Morgenthau was famous for his principles of political realism. But again, historical materialism is more about Marxism, so maybe not them either.\n\nOption C is Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. That sounds promising. I know that Marx is the main figure behind historical materialism. He wrote \"The Communist Manifesto\" with Engels, didn't he? And Engels was his collaborator. So, maybe they both contributed to historical materialism.\n\nOption D is Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Adam Smith is known for classical economics, especially his book \"The Wealth of Nations,\" which laid the foundation for free-market capitalism. Marx, on the other hand, critiqued capitalism and developed his own economic theories. So, while both were economists, Smith was more about laissez-faire capitalism, and Marx was about critiquing capitalism and proposing socialism or communism.\n\nGiven that historical materialism is closely tied to Marxism, I think the correct answer is Option C: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recall what historical materialism is all about. It's a theory that suggests that the material conditions of a society, particularly its economic base, determine its social and political structures. It's also known as Marxist materialism or dialectical materialism.\n\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels developed this theory in the 19th century, arguing that history progresses through class struggles driven by economic inequalities. They believed that capitalism would eventually be replaced by socialism and then communism, where the means of production would be collectively owned.\n\nSo, yeah, definitely, Marx and Engels are the founders of historical materialism. The other options seem to be from different schools of thought, more related to international relations theory rather than historical materialism.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
