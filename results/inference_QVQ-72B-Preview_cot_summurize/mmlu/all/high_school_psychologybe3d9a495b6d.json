It says that in elementary school, parents are often seen as partners, collaborators, and problem solvers with their kids' education. But as kids get older and go to middle and high school, the role changes. The question is asking what parents are more typically described as in those later years, and the options are:\n\nA. partners\n\nB. collaborators\n\nC. supporters\n\nD. audience\n\nHmm, I need to think about this. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, in elementary school, parents are deeply involved in their kids' learning. They might help with homework, volunteer at school, talk to teachers regularly, and be part of the decision-making process for their child's education. So, they're actively participating and working alongside teachers to support their kid's learning.\n\nNow, as kids move to middle and high school, things seem to shift. I remember that in middle school, kids start becoming more independent learners. They're expected to handle more responsibility for their own studies, and parents might step back a bit. But they're still involved, just maybe in different ways.\n\nIn high school, this independence continues. Parents might be less involved in the day-to-day homework and more focused on things like college preparations, career discussions, or supporting extracurricular activities.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Partners: This seems similar to what they were in elementary school. But the question suggests that their role changes, so maybe not.\n\nB. Collaborators: Again, similar to elementary school. Collaborators are still quite actively involved in the educational process.\n\nC. Supporters: This sounds like parents are there to back their kids up, maybe from a distance, encouraging them but not necessarily directly involved in the educational processes.\n\nD. Audience: This makes me think of parents watching from the sidelines, maybe attending events but not actively participating in the educational process.\n\nGiven this, I'm thinking that parents in middle and high school are more like supporters. They're still very important, but their role shifts from being direct partners in education to being more of a backing force, supporting their kids as they become more independent learners.\n\nLet me see if there's any research or common understanding about this. I recall that in many educational theories, there's an emphasis on fostering independence in students as they progress through school. So, it makes sense that parents would transition from a more hands-on role in elementary school to a more hands-off, supportive role in middle and high school.\n\nBut, I should consider if parents are still considered collaborators in middle and high school. Maybe they collaborate with teachers on things like parent-teacher conferences or discussing their child's progress, but day-to-day involvement might be less.\n\nAlso, being an audience seems too passive. Parents are definitely more than just observers in their kids' education, even in middle and high school.\n\nSo, between supporters and collaborators, supporters seem to fit better with the idea of parents supporting their kids' independence while still being there for guidance and encouragement.\n\nI think the answer is C. supporters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
