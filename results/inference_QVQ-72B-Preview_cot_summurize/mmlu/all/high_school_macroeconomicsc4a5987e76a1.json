                    "text": "So I've got this question here about fundamental economic questions. The options are:\n\nA. Who will get how much of each good and service?\n\nB. Who should pay taxes?\n\nC. Who will work?\n\nD. Who will make the economic decisions?\n\nI need to pick which one of these is a fundamental economic question. Let me think about what a fundamental economic question is. I remember that economics is all about making choices in the face of scarcity. So, fundamental economic questions should be about how we allocate our limited resources to satisfy our unlimited wants.\n\nOption A says, \"Who will get how much of each good and service?\" That sounds a lot like distribution. In economics, distribution refers to how goods and services are allocated among different groups in society. This is definitely a key aspect of economics because it deals with fairness and efficiency in how resources are shared.\n\nOption B is, \"Who should pay taxes?\" Hmm, taxation is an important part of economics, but is this a fundamental economic question? Taxation is a tool that governments use to raise revenue and influence the economy, but the question of who should pay taxes might be more related to political decisions or fiscal policy rather than a fundamental economic question per se.\n\nOption C is, \"Who will work?\" This seems related to labor economics. Labor economics studies how workers are allocated in the economy, which includes things like employment, unemployment, wages, and working conditions. While this is certainly an important area of economics, I'm not sure if this is one of the most fundamental questions.\n\nOption D is, \"Who will make the economic decisions?\" This touches on the structure of the economy and the roles of different entities like individuals, firms, and governments in decision-making. In some economic systems, decisions are made by central planners, while in others, decisions are made by individuals and firms responding to market signals. This is also a significant aspect of economics.\n\nBut if I had to choose the most fundamental economic question, I would probably go with Option A: \"Who will get how much of each good and service?\" Because distribution is central to how we handle scarcity and ensure that resources are allocated in a way that meets societal needs and wants as effectively as possible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are more fundamental questions that underpin distribution. For example, perhaps the question of what to produce is even more basic. If we don't decide what to produce, how can we distribute it? But the question here is specifically about who gets how much, which is directly related to distribution.\n\nAnother fundamental economic question is how to produce goods and services\u2014what resources to use and what methods of production to employ. But again, that's a different question from distribution.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to test my understanding of the three basic economic questions: what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce it. The \"for whom\" part is closely related to distribution, which aligns with Option A.\n\nOption B, who should pay taxes, is more about government revenue and redistribution, which is a layer on top of the basic distribution mechanisms.\n\nOption C, who will work, is about labor allocation, which is important but perhaps not as fundamental as the basic distribution of goods and services.\n\nOption D, who will make the economic decisions, is about the decision-making structure, which could influence how resources are allocated, but again, it's not as directly related to the core distribution issue as Option A.\n\nSo, after considering these points, I think Option A is the best answer here. The fundamental economic question is, \"Who will get how much of each good and service?\" because it goes to the heart of distribution and how society handles scarcity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
