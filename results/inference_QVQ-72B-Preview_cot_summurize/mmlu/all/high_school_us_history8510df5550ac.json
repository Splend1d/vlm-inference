If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result?

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about a speech by Albert Beveridge from 1898, titled \"The March of the Flag.\" It seems to be about the United States taking on new territories, like Hawaii and the Philippines, and how Beveridge thinks the U.S. is fully capable of governing these places. He compares it to how other countries like England and Germany govern their colonies and suggests that it's not any harder for the U.S. to manage these areas than it was to manage places like California and New Mexico when they were acquired.\n\nSo, the question is asking what policy Beveridge is advocating for, and how that foreshadows something in the future. The options are:\n\nA. The rise of the United States to the status of a great power\n\nB. A period of growing isolationism\n\nC. A period of laissez-faire economics\n\nD. Growing support for constitutional strict constructionism\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Beveridge is saying. He's talking about governing new possessions, meaning territories that the U.S. has recently acquired or is considering acquiring. He's arguing that the U.S. has the capability to govern these places effectively, drawing parallels to how other imperial powers handle their colonies.\n\nHe mentions that both Hawaii and the Philippines have populations that are different from the mainland U.S., and that Hawaii was more remote when it came under U.S. control than places like California were when they were acquired. Despite that, he believes that American governance can be extended there successfully.\n\nHe also references American history, suggesting that this expansion is a continuation of what the founding fathers started, moving the \"tents of liberty\" further west and south, and continuing the march of the flag.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like he's advocating for an expansionist policy, where the U.S. takes on the responsibility of governing newly acquired territories, seeing it as a natural progression of American power and influence.\n\nNow, I need to think about what this policy would foreshadow, or in other words, what it might lead to or be indicative of in the future.\n\nOption A is \"the rise of the United States to the status of a great power.\" Given that Beveridge is promoting the idea of the U.S. taking on more territories and governing them, it makes sense that this could be seen as a step towards becoming a more significant global power. Acquiring and successfully governing new territories would enhance the U.S.'s standing in the world.\n\nOption B is \"a period of growing isolationism.\" This seems contradictory to what Beveridge is suggesting. Isolationism involves avoiding involvement in world affairs, especially in terms of political and economic relationships. But Beveridge is advocating for active engagement by taking on new territories, which is the opposite of isolationism. So, this doesn't seem to align with his views.\n\nOption C is \"a period of laissez-faire economics.\" Laissez-faire economics refers to minimal government intervention in the economy. While the U.S. has had periods where laissez-faire principles were more prominent, this doesn't directly relate to the expansionist policy that Beveridge is promoting. His focus is on territorial expansion and governance, not specifically on economic policies.\n\nOption D is \"growing support for constitutional strict constructionism.\" Strict constructionism is an approach to interpreting the Constitution that adheres closely to the text as it was originally written, generally favoring limited federal powers. Again, this doesn't directly relate to the idea of expanding territorial holdings and governing new areas. In fact, strict constructionists might be wary of such expansions if they believed it overreached federal authority.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the most fitting answer. Beveridge's advocacy for the U.S. to govern new possessions and expand its reach suggests a move towards becoming a more prominent global power. This kind of expansionism is often associated with increased influence and status on the international stage.\n\nMoreover, considering the historical context, the late 19th century was a time when the U.S. was beginning to emerge as a world power. The Spanish-American War in 1898, which resulted in the U.S. acquiring territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, marked a significant shift in American foreign policy towards imperialism. Beveridge's speech was delivered just after this war, so his words align with this shift towards a more interventionist and expansionist role in the world.\n\nTherefore, the policy he's advocating would foreshadow the rise of the United States to the status of a great power, as it involved taking on and governing new territories, thereby increasing its global presence and influence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
