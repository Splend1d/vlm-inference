                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about auditing nonissuers. It's asking about designing tests of details to ensure there's enough audit evidence to support something. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says \"the planned level of control risk.\" Hmm, I remember that control risk is related to how much the auditor relies on internal controls. But I'm not sure if that's directly what tests of details are for.\n\nOption B mentions \"management\u2019s assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently.\" So, this seems to be about whether the internal controls are present and working well. But I think tests of details are more about verifying the accuracy of transactions rather than the controls themselves.\n\nOption C says \"the effectiveness of internal controls.\" This sounds similar to option B. Again, I think tests of details are more about the actual transactions and balances, not the controls.\n\nOption D is \"the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\" This seems a bit more abstract, but maybe it's about making sure the auditor has enough evidence to support their opinion on specific financial statement assertions.\n\nLet me think back to my auditing classes. Tests of details are part of substantive procedures, right? They involve checking specific transactions or balances in detail to see if they're accurate and supported by evidence.\n\nSo, in that context, I think tests of details are designed to provide evidence directly supporting or contradicting management's assertions about the financial statements, like the existence, completeness, accuracy, valuation, and presentation of accounts.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D mentions the \"planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\" That sounds like it aligns with ensuring that there's sufficient evidence to support the auditor's conclusions about specific financial statement assertions.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, is about the effectiveness of internal controls, which seems more related to control testing rather than tests of details.\n\nOption B talks about management's assertions regarding internal controls, which again seems more related to control testing.\n\nOption A, the planned level of control risk, might be something the auditor assesses based on control testing and other factors, but again, tests of details seem more focused on the substantive testing of transactions and balances.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look at this differently. Perhaps I should consider the difference between tests of controls and substantive tests.\n\nTests of controls are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls, which would relate to options B and C.\n\nSubstantive tests, which include tests of details, are performed to detect material misstatements in financial statement assertions, which aligns more with option D.\n\nSo, if the question is about designing tests of details, it's likely focusing on substantive testing of specific assertions, which would support the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\n\nLet me see if I can find any specific references or standards that might help clarify this.\n\nI recall that for nonissuers, which are typically private companies not subject to SEC regulations, the auditing standards might differ slightly from those for public companies. However, the fundamental principles of auditing should still apply.\n\nAccording to generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), auditors are required to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a reasonable basis for their opinions on the financial statements.\n\nThis involves performing procedures that include tests of details of balances, accounts, and transactions, as well as analytical procedures.\n\nSo, in designing tests of details, the auditor is looking to gather evidence that directly supports the assertions made by management about those balances and transactions.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that the primary goal is to ensure there's enough evidence to support the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the auditor is trying to ensure that there's sufficient evidence to support the assessed level of control risk.\n\nWait, but control risk is related to the effectiveness of internal controls, which seems more tied to tests of controls rather than tests of details.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose a nonissuer has a large accounts receivable balance. The auditor might perform tests of details on that balance to verify its existence, accuracy, and valuation.\n\nThese tests would involve examining supporting documentation, such as sales invoices, shipping records, and customer payments, to ensure that the accounts receivable are valid and correctly stated.\n\nThis directly supports the auditor's conclusion about the fairness of the accounts receivable assertion, which aligns with option D.\n\nOn the other hand, if the auditor were assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over accounts receivable, they might perform tests of controls, such as observing the segregation of duties or reviewing the reconciliation processes.\n\nSo, tests of details are more about the substance of the account balance, while tests of controls are about the systems and processes in place to prevent or detect errors.\n\nTherefore, in the context of designing tests of details, the primary objective is to obtain evidence to support the planned level of assurance for the relevant financial statement assertions.\n\nThat would make option D the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that tests of details are performed to reduce detection risk, which is the risk that the auditor's procedures will not detect a material misstatement.\n\nDetection risk is inversely related to the amount of substantive testing the auditor performs.\n\nSo, by designing tests of details, the auditor is trying to gather enough evidence to reduce detection risk to an acceptable level, thereby providing the planned level of assurance about the financial statement assertions.\n\nThis again points to option D.\n\nOption A, the planned level of control risk, seems more related to how much the auditor relies on internal controls. If control risk is assessed as low, the auditor might perform less substantive testing. But tests of details are part of substantive testing, so ensuring they support the planned level of control risk might not be the primary objective.\n\nOption B, supporting management's assertions about internal controls existing and operating efficiently, seems more aligned with control testing.\n\nOption C, the effectiveness of internal controls, is again more about control testing.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider the auditing standards for nonissuers.\n\nI believe the standards are set by the AICPA's Auditing Standards Board, particularly in the Auditing Standards for Private Companies.\n\nLooking at AU-C Section 330, \"Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained,\" it states that the auditor should design and perform substantive procedures for all relevant assertions related to each class of transactions, account balance, and disclosure, regardless of the assessed risks of material misstatement.\n\nThis includes tests of details, which are aimed at detecting material misstatements at the assertion level.\n\nSo, this reinforces the idea that tests of details are designed to provide assurance about the financial statement assertions, which aligns with option D.\n\nMoreover, AU-C Section 330 also mentions that the nature, timing, and extent of substantive procedures should be based on the assessed risks of material misstatement.\n\nTherefore, the auditor tailors the tests of details to address specific risks identified for each relevant assertion.\n\nThis further supports the notion that tests of details are geared towards providing the planned level of assurance at the assertion level.\n\nAnother relevant standard is AU-C Section 500, \"Audit Evidence,\" which discusses the quality and sufficiency of audit evidence.\n\nIt emphasizes that audit evidence should be relevant and reliable to support the auditor's opinion on the financial statements.\n\nTests of details are a key component of substantive procedures that provide this relevant and reliable evidence.\n\nAgain, this points to option D as the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the terms.\n\nLet me consider what \"tests of details\" actually entail.\n\nTests of details involve examining individual items that make up an account balance or class of transactions.\n\nFor example, verifying the existence of specific inventory items, confirming accounts receivable balances with customers, or checking the mathematical accuracy of calculations in the general ledger.\n\nThese procedures are directly aimed at verifying the accuracy and completeness of the financial data, which directly supports the assertions made by management about those data.\n\nTherefore, ensuring that there's sufficient audit evidence to support the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level seems fitting.\n\nOn the other hand, tests of controls are designed to assess the operating effectiveness of internal controls, which would relate more to options B and C.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think the best answer is option D: the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
