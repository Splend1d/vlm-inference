                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"A capacitor can store ___. A. charge, B. energy, C. Both of these, D. Neither of these.\" Hmm, I need to figure out what a capacitor does exactly. I remember that a capacitor is like a storage device for electric charge, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nLet me start by recalling what a capacitor is. It's a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in an electric field. Okay, so it stores energy\u2014that seems straightforward. But does it store charge as well?\n\nI think that when you charge a capacitor, you're actually storing charge on its plates, and that creates an electric field, which in turn stores energy. So, in a way, it stores both charge and energy. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate.\n\nLet me think about the formula for a capacitor. I remember that the capacitance C is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the charge on either plate (Q) to the potential difference (V) between the plates: C = Q/V. So, if I have a known capacitance and I apply a certain voltage, I can calculate the charge stored. That suggests that by storing charge, I'm also storing energy.\n\nWait, what's the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor? I think it's (1/2)CV\u00b2 or (1/2)QV, which is proportional to the charge and the voltage. So, again, it seems like storing charge leads to storing energy.\n\nMaybe I should consider the example of a parallel plate capacitor. When you have two plates with equal and opposite charges, the electric field between them stores energy. So, in this case, the energy is stored in the electric field, which is created by the stored charge.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about a capacitor in a circuit, when you connect it to a battery, electrons are moved from one plate to another, creating a charge separation, and energy is transferred to the capacitor in the form of electric potential energy.\n\nSo, from this reasoning, it seems like a capacitor stores both charge and energy. Therefore, the answer should be C. Both of these.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any scenario where a capacitor stores only charge or only energy. I can't think of any such scenario. The way capacitors work, they inherently store charge, which results in storing energy in the electric field.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that without storing charge, there wouldn't be an electric field to store energy in. So, charge storage is necessary for energy storage in a capacitor.\n\nI should also consider if there are different types of capacitors that might behave differently, but I don't think that's the case. Whether it's a parallel plate capacitor, a cylindrical capacitor, or a spherical capacitor, the fundamental principle remains the same: they all store charge and, consequently, energy.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall the unit of capacitance. Capacitance is measured in farads (F), and 1 farad is equal to 1 coulomb per volt (C/V). Coulombs are units of charge, and volts are units of electric potential energy per unit charge. So, again, capacitance relates charge and potential difference, which is related to energy.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. Based on my understanding, the correct answer is C. Both of these.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
