                    "text": "Let's see what this question is about. I'm not super familiar with all these terms, but I think I can figure it out. So, the problem is about relying on the \"representativeness heuristic\" when judging someone's characteristics. And it asks what the issue with doing that is, giving four options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the representativeness heuristic is. From what I recall, a heuristic is a mental shortcut people use to make decisions or judgments quickly. The representativeness heuristic specifically involves judging something based on how similar it is to a prototype or a typical example in our minds.\n\nSo, if I'm judging someone's personality, I might compare them to what I consider a \"typical\" person with that personality trait. For example, if I meet someone who is very quiet and reserved, I might think they're introverted because that matches my idea of what an introverted person is like.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the problem with relying on this heuristic in such judgments. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Causes over-reliance on statistical data.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about this one. If I'm using a heuristic, I'm probably not delving into statistical data; heuristics are more about quick judgments based on superficial similarities. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nB. Doesn't take base rate data into account.\n\nOkay, this sounds familiar. Base rate refers to the overall frequency or prevalence of something in a population. For example, if I know that only 10% of people in a certain group are introverted, but I still judge a quiet person I meet as introverted without considering that only a small percentage is actually introverted, that could be a problem.\n\nSo, relying on the representativeness heuristic might lead me to ignore the base rates and just focus on how much the person resembles my idea of an introvert. That seems like a plausible answer.\n\nC. Overestimates the degree to which dispositional factors affect behavior.\n\nDispositional factors are traits or characteristics that influence how people behave. So, if I see someone acting in a certain way, I might attribute it to their personality traits rather than situational factors.\n\nBut is this directly related to the representativeness heuristic? I think the heuristic is more about categorizing based on similarity to a prototype, not necessarily overestimating the impact of traits on behavior.\n\nMaybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nD. Doesn't take into account the limitations of working memory.\n\nWorking memory is about the amount of information we can hold and process at any given time. While heuristics can be useful for making quick decisions when working memory is limited, I don't think this is the main issue with relying on the representativeness heuristic for judging people's characteristics.\n\nPerhaps this isn't the right answer either.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, I think option B makes the most sense. Relying on the representativeness heuristic can lead us to ignore base rate information, which is important for making accurate judgments.\n\nLet me double-check. For example, consider the classic problem where you're told that Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement, and you're asked whether it's more likely that Linda is a feminist bank teller or just a feminist. People often choose \"feminist bank teller\" because it seems more representative of their idea of a feminist, but statistically, being both a feminist and a bank teller is less likely than just being a feminist, given the base rates.\n\nSo, in this case, relying on the representativeness heuristic leads people to ignore the base rates and the laws of probability.\n\nTherefore, the problem with relying on the representativeness heuristic when judging someone's characteristics is that it doesn't take base rate data into account.\n\nI think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
