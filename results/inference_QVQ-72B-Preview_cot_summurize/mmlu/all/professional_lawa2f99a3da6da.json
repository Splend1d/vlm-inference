                    "text": "So I've got this contract law problem here, and I need to figure out how much the collector should recover from the dealer if the collector sues for damages. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a collector who owns a rare 16th-century tapestry. The collector agrees in writing to sell it to a tapestry dealer for $100,000. The contract says that delivery is \"F.O.B. at the dealer's shop,\" and payment is due one week after tender. Okay, so F.O.B. stands for \"free on board,\" which usually means that the seller fulfills their obligation to deliver when the goods have been delivered to the carrier at the specified location. In this case, it's at the dealer's shop. So, the collector's obligation ends once the tapestry is delivered to the dealer's shop.\n\nWhen the dealer receives the tapestry, it's damaged in transit\u2014it's ripped apart and becoming unwoven. The dealer notifies the collector immediately, rejecting the tapestry and waiting for re-shipping instructions. But the collector doesn't get back to the dealer, and after four weeks, the dealer sells the tapestry to another buyer for $120,000.\n\nNow, the collector is suing the dealer for damages. I need to figure out how much the collector should recover.\n\nFirst, I need to understand if there was a breach of contract. The collector contracted to sell the tapestry to the dealer for $100,000, with specific terms on delivery and payment. The dealer received the tapestry but it was damaged during transit. The question is, who bears the risk of loss in this situation?\n\nSince the contract specified \"F.O.B. at the dealer's shop,\" I think that means the risk passes to the buyer (the dealer) once the goods are delivered to the carrier at the dealer's shop. So, if the tapestry was damaged during transit after it was delivered to the dealer's shop, the risk is with the dealer, not the collector.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to look up what \"F.O.B. at the dealer's shop\" exactly means. In contract law, F.O.B. terms specify when the risk of loss passes from the seller to the buyer. \"F.O.B. at the dealer's shop\" likely means that the seller (collector) is responsible for delivering the goods to the buyer's shop, and the risk passes once the goods are delivered there.\n\nHowever, in this case, the tapestry was damaged in transit after being delivered to the dealer's shop. So, if the risk has passed to the dealer, the damage is the dealer's problem, not the collector's.\n\nBut the dealer rejected the tapestry because it was damaged. Does that mean the collector is still responsible for the damage? I don't think so, because the damage occurred after the risk passed to the dealer.\n\nWait, but the collector didn't make any further contact with the dealer after being notified about the damage. Maybe the dealer was waiting for instructions on what to do with the damaged tapestry.\n\nAfter four weeks without hearing back from the collector, the dealer sold the tapestry to another buyer for $120,000. That seems like the dealer is trying to mitigate their losses by selling the damaged tapestry.\n\nNow, if the collector sues the dealer for damages, what's the basis of the lawsuit? Is the collector claiming that the dealer should have paid the $100,000 as per the original contract? Or is the collector claiming that the dealer converted the tapestry by selling it to someone else?\n\nOption A says $120,000 for conversion. Conversion is when someone wrongfully takes or interferes with another person's property. If the collector claims that the dealer converted the tapestry by selling it, they might seek the full sale price of $120,000.\n\nOption B says $108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe it's referring to some rule about the dealer's right to resell and retain a commission.\n\nOption C says $100,000, which is the contract price. Perhaps the collector is claiming that the dealer should pay the contract price since they sold it for more.\n\nOption D says $20,000, which is the difference between the contract price and the sale price. This might suggest that the dealer is only liable for the difference.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully.\n\nFirst, under the original contract, the collector was to sell the tapestry to the dealer for $100,000, with delivery F.O.B. at the dealer's shop. Assuming the collector delivered the tapestry undamaged to the dealer's shop, fulfilling their obligation, any damage that occurred after that point would be the dealer's responsibility.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the tapestry was damaged during transit after being delivered to the dealer's shop. If the risk had passed to the dealer at the point of delivery, then the damage is the dealer's problem.\n\nBut the dealer rejected the tapestry because it was damaged. Maybe the dealer believed that the collector was still responsible for the damage since it occurred during transit.\n\nWait, but if the risk had passed to the dealer, the collector isn't responsible for the damage that occurred after delivery.\n\nPerhaps the dealer's rejection was invalid because the risk had already passed.\n\nI need to check the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law regarding risk of loss in contracts for the sale of goods.\n\nUnder the UCC, unless otherwise agreed, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the seller completes delivery in accordance with the contract. In this case, since the contract was F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, the collector's obligation likely ended upon delivery to the dealer's shop.\n\nTherefore, any damage that occurred after that point would be the dealer's responsibility.\n\nSo, when the dealer received the damaged tapestry, the damage was already the dealer's problem, not the collector's.\n\nThe dealer's rejection might not be valid because the risk had already passed.\n\nTherefore, the collector has fulfilled their obligation by delivering the tapestry to the dealer's shop, and the dealer is obligated to pay the $100,000 as per the contract.\n\nBut the dealer didn't pay and instead sold the tapestry to another buyer for $120,000.\n\nSo, the collector could sue for breach of contract, seeking the $100,000 contract price.\n\nAlternatively, the collector could sue for conversion, claiming that the dealer wrongfully sold the tapestry.\n\nIf the collector sues for conversion, they might be entitled to the full amount the dealer received from the resale, which is $120,000.\n\nHowever, the dealer might argue that they were entitled to sell the tapestry to mitigate their losses since the original contract was for $100,000 for an undamaged tapestry, and they received a damaged one.\n\nBut since the risk had passed to the dealer, the damage is their problem, and they are still obligated to pay the $100,000 to the collector.\n\nThe fact that they sold it for $120,000 might be irrelevant to the collector's claim for the contract price.\n\nWait, but if the collector sues for conversion, they might be entitled to the full resale price, which is $120,000.\n\nHowever, if the dealer can show that they were entitled to sell the tapestry to mitigate their losses, perhaps they might only be liable for the difference between the contract price and the resale price.\n\nBut in this case, the dealer sold it for more than the contract price.\n\nSo, if the collector is entitled to the $100,000 under the contract, and the dealer sold it for $120,000, the collector might still only be entitled to the $100,000, and the dealer keeps the extra $20,000 as profit from the resale.\n\nAlternatively, if the collector sues for conversion, they might be entitled to the full $120,000, but that seems excessive since the contract was for $100,000.\n\nOption B suggests $108,000, which might account for the dealer's right to a commission or some other expense related to the resale.\n\nOption D suggests $20,000, which is the difference between the resale price and the contract price.\n\nBut I think the most straightforward answer is Option C: $100,000, which is the contract price.\n\nThe collector entered into a contract to sell the tapestry for $100,000, delivered as per the terms, and the dealer is obligated to pay that amount. The fact that the dealer sold it for more doesn't affect the collector's right to the contract price.\n\nSo, if the collector sues for the $100,000, that seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, if the collector sues for conversion, they might be entitled to the full $120,000, but that might be seen as punitive or excessive.\n\nI need to think about which legal theory the collector is suing under.\n\nIf it's for breach of contract, then the damages would be the contract price of $100,000.\n\nIf it's for conversion, then the collector might be entitled to the full resale price of $120,000.\n\nBut I'm not sure which one is more appropriate in this scenario.\n\nMaybe I should consider the dealer's perspective.\n\nThe dealer received a damaged tapestry, which wasn't what was contracted for. However, since the risk had passed to them, they are stuck with the damage.\n\nThey sold it for $120,000, which is more than the contract price, so perhaps they made a profit.\n\nBut the collector is still entitled to the contract price of $100,000.\n\nSo, if the collector sues for $100,000, and the dealer has to pay that, they still keep the $20,000 profit from the resale.\n\nThat seems fair.\n\nBut option A says $120,000 for conversion. Maybe the collector can claim the full resale price because the dealer wrongfully converted the tapestry by selling it.\n\nBut in that case, the dealer might counter that they were entitled to sell the tapestry to mitigate their losses, and they only owe the contract price of $100,000.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up some case law or legal principles regarding conversion and resale.\n\nIn conversion cases, the measure of damages is typically the value of the property at the time of the conversion, which could be the fair market value or the resale price.\n\nSo, if the dealer sold the tapestry for $120,000, that might be the measure of damages in a conversion action.\n\nHowever, in a contract action, the damages would be the contract price of $100,000.\n\nSo, it depends on which cause of action the collector chooses to pursue.\n\nBut perhaps the collector can only choose one or the other, not both.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, a plaintiff can elect to sue for breach of contract or for conversion, but not both for the same act.\n\nIf the collector sues for breach of contract, they would likely recover the contract price of $100,000.\n\nIf they sue for conversion, they might recover the resale price of $120,000.\n\nBut the dealer might argue that the collector is only entitled to the contract price, and any excess is the dealer's profit from mitigating their loss.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the collector can recover the higher amount through a conversion action.\n\nI need to think about which option is most favorable to the collector.\n\nIf the collector sues for conversion, they might get $120,000, which is option A.\n\nIf they sue for breach of contract, they get $100,000, which is option C.\n\nOption B, $108,000, seems arbitrary. Maybe it's trying to account for the dealer's right to a commission on the resale, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D, $20,000, is the difference between the resale price and the contract price. That might be relevant if the dealer was entitled to keep the difference as mitigation of damages, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nI think the collector would prefer to get the full $120,000 through a conversion action, so option A.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because in a conversion action, the damages are typically the value of the property at the time of conversion, which could be the resale price.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the collector can only sue for the contract price plus interest or something, but that doesn't seem to be among the options.\n\nGiven the choices, I think option A is the most likely answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
