                    "text": "So I have this question about the WISC test, which I believe is a type of IQ test for children. The question is asking for the approximate percentage of the population that scores between 70 and 130 on the WISC. The options are 34%, 50%, 68%, or 95%.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the WISC is. I think it stands for Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. It's a commonly used test to assess intelligence in kids. Like many intelligence tests, it's standardized so that scores are normally distributed in the general population.\n\nA normal distribution is like a bell curve, with most scores clustering around the mean, and fewer scores as you move away in either direction. The mean, or average, IQ score is typically 100, and the standard deviation is usually around 15 points.\n\nSo, if the WISC has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15, I can use that to figure out the percentage of scores between 70 and 130.\n\nLet me think about the standard deviations:\n\n- One standard deviation (SD) above the mean is 115 (100 + 15)\n\n- One SD below the mean is 85 (100 - 15)\n\n- Two SDs above is 130 (100 + 30)\n\n- Two SDs below is 70 (100 - 30)\n\n- Three SDs above is 145 (100 + 45)\n\n- Three SDs below is 55 (100 - 45)\n\nSo, the range from 70 to 130 covers from two SDs below the mean to two SDs above the mean.\n\nI remember that in a normal distribution:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the scores fall within one SD of the mean (between 85 and 115)\n\n- Approximately 95% fall within two SDs of the mean (between 70 and 130)\n\n- And about 99.7% fall within three SDs of the mean (between 55 and 145)\n\nSo, based on this, the percentage of the population scoring between 70 and 130 on the WISC would be roughly 95%.\n\nLet me double-check that. If the mean is 100 and SD is 15, then:\n\n- Lower limit: 100 - 2*15 = 70\n\n- Upper limit: 100 + 2*15 = 130\n\nYes, that matches the question's range.\n\nNow, recalling the empirical rule for normal distributions:\n\n- About 95% of values lie within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 95%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question or if there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs the WISC scaled differently? Maybe it has a different mean or SD?\n\nI think the standard WISC has a mean of 100 and an SD of 15, similar to the adult IQ tests.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes tests have different scaling, like a mean of 100 and SD of 20, but I think WISC uses 15.\n\nLet me confirm that.\n\nUpon checking, the WISC-V (the current version) has a standard score with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n\nSo, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the population scoring between 70 and 130 is approximately 95%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 34\n\nB. 50\n\nC. 68\n\nD. 95\n\nSo, option D. 95 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about what each option might represent.\n\n34%: That's roughly the area between the mean and one SD above or below in a normal distribution. So, from 85 to 115, which is one SD, but the question asks for two SDs.\n\n50%: That would be the area from the mean upwards or downwards, but not specifically between 70 and 130.\n\n68%: That's the area within one SD of the mean, again, not covering up to two SDs.\n\n95%: As mentioned, covers two SDs on both sides, which matches the range from 70 to 130.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 95%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{95} \\]"
