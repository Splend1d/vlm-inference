                    "text": "Let's tackle this inventory problem using the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) method. So, Ultra Co. uses a periodic inventory system and has a series of inventory transactions in January. I need to find out the cost of goods sold for the month using LIFO.\n\nFirst, let's list out the transactions:\n\n- January 1: Beginning inventory of 20,000 units at $13 each.\n\n- January 20: Purchase of 30,000 units at $15 each.\n\n- January 23: Purchase of 40,000 units at $17 each.\n\n- January 31: Sale of 50,000 units at $20 each.\n\nSince it's a periodic inventory system, we assume that all purchases are added to inventory at the end of the period, and the cost of goods sold is determined after all purchases have been recorded.\n\nUnder LIFO, the last units purchased are the first ones sold. So, for the sale of 50,000 units on January 31, we need to assign the cost from the most recent purchases first.\n\nLet's see the sequence of purchases:\n\n1. January 23: 40,000 units at $17 each.\n\n2. January 20: 30,000 units at $15 each.\n\n3. January 1: 20,000 units at $13 each.\n\nFirst, we'll allocate the 50,000 units sold from the most recent purchase.\n\nSo, first, we take the 40,000 units from January 23 at $17 each.\n\nThen, we need an additional 10,000 units to make up the 50,000 sold. So, we take 10,000 units from the January 20 purchase at $15 each.\n\nThe remaining units from the January 20 purchase would be 20,000 units (30,000 - 10,000).\n\nThe beginning inventory of 20,000 units remains untouched.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS):\n\n- 40,000 units at $17 = 40,000 * $17 = $680,000\n\n- 10,000 units at $15 = 10,000 * $15 = $150,000\n\nTotal COGS = $680,000 + $150,000 = $830,000\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $710,000\n\nB. $750,000\n\nC. $830,000\n\nD. $1,000,000\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the answer should be C. $830,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the purchases:\n\n- Jan 1: 20,000 units @ $13\n\n- Jan 20: 30,000 units @ $15\n\n- Jan 23: 40,000 units @ $17\n\nTotal units available: 20,000 + 30,000 + 40,000 = 90,000 units\n\nUnits sold: 50,000 units\n\nUnits remaining: 90,000 - 50,000 = 40,000 units\n\nUnder LIFO, the last 50,000 units in are the first 50,000 units out.\n\nSo, the 50,000 units sold consist of:\n\n- All 40,000 units from Jan 23 @ $17\n\n- And 10,000 units from Jan 20 @ $15\n\nCalculating again:\n\n40,000 * $17 = $680,000\n\n10,000 * $15 = $150,000\n\nTotal COGS = $680,000 + $150,000 = $830,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I mistakenly considered the beginning inventory as the last purchase, but in this case, beginning inventory is considered the oldest stock, so it should be allocated last under LIFO.\n\nWait, no. In LIFO, the last units purchased are the first to be sold, meaning that the most recent purchases are considered to be sold first.\n\nSo, in this case, the January 23 purchase is the most recent, followed by January 20, and then the beginning inventory.\n\nTherefore, for the sale of 50,000 units, we first allocate the 40,000 units from January 23, then 10,000 units from January 20.\n\nThe remaining inventory would be:\n\n- 20,000 units from January 20 @ $15\n\n- 20,000 units from beginning inventory @ $13\n\nTotal remaining inventory = 40,000 units valued at $15 and $13 respectively.\n\nSo, the cost of goods sold is indeed $830,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $830,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
