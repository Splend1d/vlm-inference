                    "text": "So I've got this situation here involving a gardener and a homeowner who don't speak each other's language. They had an agreement for some landscaping work, and now there's a dispute over how much was supposed to be paid. The gardener says they agreed on $200, but the homeowner only paid $100. The gardener wants to testify about what was agreed upon, but his friend who could translate is now dead. There's a Dead Man's Statute in place, and the homeowner's lawyer is objecting to the gardener's testimony.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Dead Man's Statute is. From what I recall, it's a rule that prevents a party from testifying about communications with a deceased person in certain cases, especially in civil lawsuits involving contracts. The idea is to prevent one side from testifying about what was said without the other side being able to cross-examine the deceased person.\n\nIn this case, the gardener's friend, who was the translator, is dead. So, the gardener is trying to testify about what his friend told him regarding the agreement with the homeowner. The homeowner's lawyer is objecting to this testimony.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. An admission by a party-opponent is when the other side admits something that's against their interest, and it can be used as evidence. But in this scenario, it's the gardener who's testifying, not the homeowner. So, unless the gardener is admitting something against his interest, which I don't think is the case here, this might not apply.\n\nB. Admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.\n\nHmm, hearsay is a statement made outside of court that's being offered to prove the truth of what's being said. The gardener is testifying about what his friend told him, which is secondhand information. So, that would be hearsay. But the option says it's admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act. I'm not entirely sure what that means. Maybe it's being used to show that a verbal agreement was made, not necessarily to prove the exact terms of the agreement. But I think the terms are crucial here.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nThis seems plausible. Since the translator is deceased, and the Dead Man's Statute is in effect, the gardener might not be allowed to testify about what the translator said. The statute is likely preventing him from testifying about communications involving the deceased person.\n\nD. Inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. It suggests that if the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent, then maybe the testimony could be admitted. But I'm not sure about that. Even if the friend was acting as an agent, the fact that he's deceased might still trigger the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nLet me think about this again. The Dead Man's Statute generally prevents a party from testifying about communications with a deceased person in cases where the deceased person's estate is involved, or in certain contract disputes. In this case, the friend was the one who translated the agreement between the gardener and the homeowner. The friend is now dead, so the gardener wants to testify about what the friend told him.\n\nI need to consider whether the Dead Man's Statute applies here. Is the friend considered a party to the contract? Probably not directly; he was just facilitating communication. So, perhaps the statute doesn't apply in this situation.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the Dead Man's Statute only applies when the deceased person is a party to the contract or has an interest in the matter. In this case, the friend was just a translator, not a party to the contract. So, maybe the statute doesn't bar the gardener's testimony.\n\nBut the problem says that the jurisdiction has a \"typical Dead Man's Statute in effect.\" I need to find out what a typical Dead Man's Statute covers. From what I recall, it usually prevents a party from testifying about communications with a deceased person when those communications are relevant to the case. But again, the friend was not a party to the contract; he was just translating.\n\nPerhaps the statute only applies when the deceased person is a party or has a direct interest in the matter. If that's the case, then the gardener should be able to testify about what the friend told him, since the friend wasn't a party to the contract.\n\nOn the other hand, the translation was essential to the agreement because neither party spoke the other's language. So, the friend's role was crucial in communicating the terms of the contract.\n\nLet me consider the rules of evidence more carefully. If the gardener testifies about what his friend told him, that would be hearsay. Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless there's an exception that allows it.\n\nOption B mentions that it's admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act. Maybe the gardener's testimony is being offered not to prove the truth of what the friend said, but to show that a verbal agreement was made.\n\nBut I think that's a stretch. The gardener is trying to prove the terms of the agreement, which is exactly what hearsay is being used for here.\n\nOption A suggests it's an admission by a party-opponent. But again, it's the gardener who's testifying, not the homeowner. Unless the homeowner admitted something through the friend, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible unless the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent. Well, if the friend was acting as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms, then perhaps the gardener's acceptance of that role is relevant. But I'm not sure how that affects the admissibility under the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nWait, maybe the idea is that if the friend was the homeowner's agent, then the homeowner is bound by what the friend said, and the gardener's testimony about the friend's statements would be admissible as admissions by the homeowner.\n\nBut the problem states that the friend spoke both English and Japanese, and he was accompanying the gardener. It doesn't specify whether the friend was the homeowner's agent or just a translator.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to rephrase the issue. The gardener is trying to testify about what the friend told him regarding the agreement with the homeowner. The friend is now deceased, and there's a Dead Man's Statute in place.\n\nI need to find out whether the Dead Man's Statute bars the gardener's testimony about communications involving the friend.\n\nAfter some research, I recall that the Dead Man's Statute typically prevents a party from testifying about communications with a deceased person when those communications are relevant to the case. However, it usually applies when the deceased person is a party to the contract or has a direct interest in the matter.\n\nIn this case, the friend was not a party to the contract; he was just facilitating communication between the gardener and the homeowner. So, perhaps the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply here because the friend wasn't a party to the contract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend's role was so integral to the agreement that his communications are considered part of the contract negotiations, and thus his statements are necessary to understand the agreement.\n\nBut if the Dead Man's Statute does apply, then the gardener's testimony about what the friend said would be inadmissible.\n\nLet me consider the other options again.\n\nOption A: Admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.\n\nI don't think this applies because it's the gardener who's testifying, not the homeowner.\n\nOption B: Admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.\n\nThis seems a bit vague. Maybe the gardener's testimony is being used to show that a verbal agreement was made, not necessarily to prove the exact terms. But again, the terms are crucial in this breach of contract case.\n\nOption D: Inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.\n\nIf the friend was acting as the homeowner's agent, then the homeowner is bound by the friend's communications. So, if the gardener can show that the friend was the homeowner's agent, then the gardener's testimony about the friend's statements would be admissible as admissions by the homeowner.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether the friend was the homeowner's agent or just a translator. It just says that the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who spoke both languages.\n\nSo, if the friend was acting as the gardener's agent in communicating with the homeowner, then the gardener's testimony about what the friend told him might not be admissible against the homeowner, unless there's some other exception.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about agency law here. If the friend was acting as the gardener's agent, then the gardener is bound by the friend's communications. But if the friend was acting as the homeowner's agent, then the homeowner is bound by the friend's communications.\n\nIn this case, it seems that the friend was accompanying the gardener and translating for him, so he was more likely acting on behalf of the gardener.\n\nIf that's the case, then the homeowner would be bound by what the friend communicated on behalf of the gardener.\n\nBut the gardener is trying to testify about what the friend told him, which is hearsay.\n\nUnless there's an exception that allows this testimony, it might be inadmissible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option C is correct: inadmissible because of the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, maybe the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply because the friend wasn't a party to the contract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gardener's testimony is being offered to prove what was agreed upon, and the friend's statements are being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, making it hearsay.\n\nIn that case, unless there's an exception, it would be inadmissible.\n\nOption D suggests that it's inadmissible unless the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent. If the friend was the homeowner's agent, then the homeowner is bound by what the friend said, and the gardener's testimony about the friend's statements would be admissible as admissions by the homeowner.\n\nBut again, without knowing whether the friend was the homeowner's agent, it's unclear.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I need to look up the specific rules regarding the Dead Man's Statute and agency.\n\nAfter some research, I find that the Dead Man's Statute generally bars a party from testifying about communications with a deceased person when those communications are relevant to the case, especially in contract disputes involving the deceased's estate.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the friend is not a party to the contract; he was just a translator. So, perhaps the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply here.\n\nAdditionally, if the friend was acting as an agent for one of the parties, that might affect the admissibility of the testimony.\n\nBut without more information about the friend's role, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C: inadmissible because of the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nBut I have doubts because the friend wasn't a party to the contract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is correct: inadmissible unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.\n\nIf the friend was the homeowner's agent, then the homeowner is bound by what the friend said, and the gardener's testimony would be admissible as admissions by the homeowner.\n\nBut again, without knowing the friend's role, it's uncertain.\n\nGiven that, I think C is the most straightforward answer: inadmissible because of the Dead Man's Statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
