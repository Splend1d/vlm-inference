                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this phrase: \"4 times as many cans as Tom collected.\" And I need to match it with the correct algebraic expression from the options given. The options are:\n\nA. 4t\n\nB. t over 4\n\nC. t minus 4\n\nD. t plus 4\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what \"4 times as many cans as Tom collected\" means. Let's break it down.\n\nWe have Tom, who collected some number of cans. Let's let t represent the number of cans Tom collected. So, t is the variable here.\n\nNow, the phrase says \"4 times as many cans as Tom collected.\" So, it's talking about multiplying the number of cans Tom has by 4.\n\nLet me think about this. If Tom has t cans, then 4 times t should be 4t.\n\nSo, that seems like option A. 4t.\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nOption B is t over 4, which is t divided by 4. That doesn't sound right because dividing by 4 would give a smaller number, but the phrase says \"4 times as many,\" which should be larger.\n\nOption C is t minus 4. That would mean subtracting 4 from the number of cans Tom has, which isn't what the phrase is saying.\n\nOption D is t plus 4. That would mean adding 4 to the number of cans Tom has, which also doesn't match the \"4 times as many\" part.\n\nSo, based on this, option A, 4t, seems to be the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute. Is there any chance that the phrase could be interpreted differently?\n\nLet me consider if there's any context missing here. The problem says \"4 times as many cans as Tom collected.\"\n\nI think the key words are \"as many as.\" When you say \"4 times as many as,\" it's a direct multiplication.\n\nSo, if Tom has t cans, then 4 times as many would be 4 multiplied by t, which is 4t.\n\nI can also think of an example. Suppose Tom collected 5 cans. Then, 4 times as many would be 4 times 5, which is 20.\n\nSo, the expression should be 4t.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nCould it be that \"4 times as many cans as Tom collected\" is different from 4t?\n\nWell, sometimes people might say \"4 times as many as,\" but in mathematics, the standard interpretation is multiplication by 4.\n\nSo, I don't think there's any trick here. It should be straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A. 4t.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 4t} \\]"
