                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to determine if the argument is valid using indirect truth tables. The argument is:\n\nP \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n(Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n~(~Q \u2228 R) / ~P\n\nWait, that last part is a bit confusing. I think it's supposed to be:\n\nP \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n(Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n~(~Q \u2228 R) \u22a2 ~P\n\nSo, the conclusion is ~P, and the premises are the first two statements.\n\nAlright, to use indirect truth tables, I need to assume that the conclusion is false and see if that leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nFirst, let's list out the premises and the negation of the conclusion.\n\nPremises:\n\n1. P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n2. (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\nNegation of the conclusion: ~(~P), which is P.\n\nNow, I need to see if these three statements can all be true at the same time. If they can, then the argument is invalid; if not, it's valid.\n\nSo, I'll assume P is true, and see if premises 1 and 2 can also be true.\n\nLet's consider premise 1: P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R).\n\nIf P is true, then for this implication to be true, Q \u2228 R must also be true. So, if P is true, then Q \u2228 R must be true.\n\nPremise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P.\n\nBut since we're assuming P is true, ~P is false. So, the implication (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 false.\n\nAn implication is true only when the consequent is true or the antecedent is false. Since the consequent is false (because ~P is false), the only way for the implication to be true is if the antecedent is false. That is, Q \u00b7 S must be false.\n\nSo, Q \u00b7 S is false. That means at least one of Q or S is false.\n\nNow, from premise 1, since P is true, Q \u2228 R must be true.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- P is true\n\n- Q \u2228 R is true\n\n- Q \u00b7 S is false\n\nOur goal is to see if all three premises can be true simultaneously.\n\nLet's consider the possible cases for Q and S, given that Q \u00b7 S is false.\n\nCase 1: Q is false, S is true.\n\nCase 2: Q is true, S is false.\n\nCase 3: Q is false, S is false.\n\nCase 4: Q is true, S is true.\n\nBut wait, Q \u00b7 S is false, so cases where Q and S are both true are excluded. So, only cases 1, 2, and 3 are possible.\n\nLet's analyze each case.\n\n**Case 1: Q is false, S is true.**\n\nFrom premise 1, Q \u2228 R must be true. Since Q is false, R must be true.\n\nSo, P is true, Q is false, R is true, S is true.\n\nNow, check the conclusion: ~P would be false, since P is true. So, ~P is false.\n\nBut the argument has ~(~Q \u2228 R) as another premise. Wait, in the original problem, the argument is:\n\nP \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n(Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n~(~Q \u2228 R) / ~P\n\nI think there might be a confusion here. Maybe it's better to stick to the standard form.\n\nLet me recall: the premises are:\n\n1. P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n2. (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\nAnd the conclusion is ~P.\n\nWe're assuming ~P is false, i.e., P is true, and checking if all premises can be true.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nP is true.\n\nFrom premise 1: since P is true, Q \u2228 R must be true.\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P. But ~P is false, so (Q \u00b7 S) must be false for the implication to be true.\n\nNow, in case 1: Q is false, S is true.\n\nSo, Q \u00b7 S is false (since Q is false). So, premise 2 is true.\n\nFrom premise 1, Q \u2228 R must be true. Since Q is false, R must be true.\n\nSo, P is true, Q is false, R is true, S is true.\n\nNow, check the conclusion: ~P is false, which matches our assumption.\n\nBut we need to see if ~(~Q \u2228 R) holds in this case.\n\n~Q is ~false = true, R is true, so ~Q \u2228 R is true \u2228 true = true.\n\nThen, ~(~Q \u2228 R) is ~true = false.\n\nSo, in this case, ~(~Q \u2228 R) is false, and ~P is false.\n\nSo, the argument would be: premises are true, conclusion is false.\n\nWait, but the argument is presented as P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R), (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P, ~(~Q \u2228 R) \u22a2 ~P.\n\nIn this case, ~(~Q \u2228 R) is false, but the conclusion ~P is false.\n\nSo, the argument would be: premises are true, but the conclusion is false, which would make the argument invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other cases where all premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nLet's check case 2.\n\n**Case 2: Q is true, S is false.**\n\nP is true.\n\nFrom premise 1: Q \u2228 R must be true. Since Q is true, Q \u2228 R is true.\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P. Q is true, S is false, so Q \u00b7 S is false. ~P is false.\n\nSo, (false) \u2283 false, which is true (since only false \u2283 true is false).\n\nSo, premises are satisfied.\n\nNow, check ~(~Q \u2228 R):\n\nQ is true, so ~Q is false.\n\nR is... well, from premise 1, Q \u2228 R is true, and Q is true, so R can be true or false.\n\nWait, in this case, R can be true or false, since Q is true, making Q \u2228 R true regardless of R.\n\nSo, ~(~Q \u2228 R) = ~false \u2228 R = true \u2228 R = true.\n\nThen, ~(~Q \u2228 R) = ~true = false.\n\nConclusion is ~P = false.\n\nSo, in this case, premises are true, conclusion is false, but ~(~Q \u2228 R) is false, which is the negation of the conclusion.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me rephrase.\n\nThe argument is:\n\nP \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n(Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n~(~Q \u2228 R) \u22a2 ~P\n\nAssuming ~P is false, i.e., P is true.\n\nFrom premise 1: P is true, so Q \u2228 R must be true.\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P. ~P is false, so (Q \u00b7 S) must be false.\n\nFrom premise 3: ~(~Q \u2228 R) must be true, since it's the premise.\n\nWait, no: the premises are P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R), (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P, and ~(~Q \u2228 R).\n\nAnd the conclusion is ~P.\n\nWe're assuming ~P is false, i.e., P is true, and checking if all premises can be true.\n\nIn case 2: Q is true, S is false.\n\nFrom premise 1: Q \u2228 R must be true. Q is true, so Q \u2228 R is true.\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P. Q is true, S is false, so Q \u00b7 S is false. ~P is false.\n\nSo, false \u2283 false is true.\n\nFrom premise 3: ~(~Q \u2228 R). ~Q is false, R is... unknown.\n\nSo, ~Q \u2228 R = false \u2228 R = R.\n\nThen, ~(~Q \u2228 R) = ~R.\n\nSo, premise 3 is ~R.\n\nSo, in this case, premises are:\n\nP is true\n\nQ is true\n\nS is false\n\nR is... unknown, but premise 3 says ~R, so R must be false.\n\nWait, premise 3 is ~R, so R must be false for premise 3 to be true.\n\nSo, P is true, Q is true, S is false, R is false.\n\nNow, check the conclusion: ~P is false, which matches our assumption.\n\nSo, in this case, all premises are true, and the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, in case 1, we had P true, Q false, R true, S true.\n\nPremise 1: P true, Q \u2228 R is true (since R is true).\n\nPremise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) is false (Q is false), so false \u2283 false is true.\n\nPremise 3: ~(~Q \u2228 R) = ~true = false.\n\nConclusion: ~P = false.\n\nSo, premises are true, conclusion is false.\n\nAgain, invalid.\n\nIn case 3: Q is false, S is false.\n\nP is true.\n\nFrom premise 1: Q \u2228 R must be true. Q is false, so R must be true.\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) is false (since Q is false), so false \u2283 false is true.\n\nFrom premise 3: ~(~Q \u2228 R) = ~(true \u2228 true) = ~true = false.\n\nConclusion: ~P = false.\n\nAgain, premises are true, conclusion is false.\n\nSo, in all possible cases where P is true, the premises can be true, and the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nNow, the question asks to choose a counterexample if the argument is invalid.\n\nThe options are:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when P, Q, R, and S are true\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R and S are false\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and S are true and Q is false\n\nFrom our analysis:\n\n- In case 1: P true, Q false, R true, S true\n\n- In case 2: P true, Q true, R false, S false\n\n- In case 3: P true, Q false, R true, S false\n\nOption B: P, Q, R, S all true.\n\nLooking at case 1: P true, Q false, R true, S true.\n\nWait, Q is false, but option B says Q is true.\n\nSo, case 1 doesn't match option B.\n\nOption C: P and Q are true and R and S are false.\n\nThis matches case 2: P true, Q true, R false, S false.\n\nOption D: P, R, and S are true and Q is false.\n\nThis matches case 1: P true, Q false, R true, S true.\n\nSo, both options C and D present counterexamples.\n\nBut the problem says \"choose an option which presents a counterexample.\"\n\nSince both C and D are counterexamples, but the problem likely expects to choose one, perhaps D is more general or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn option B: P, Q, R, S all true.\n\nFrom premise 1: P true, Q \u2228 R is true (both true).\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) is true, ~P is false.\n\nSo, true \u2283 false is false. So, premise 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, in this case, not all premises are true, so it's not a valid counterexample.\n\nIn option C: P and Q are true, R and S are false.\n\nFrom premise 1: P true, Q \u2228 R is true (Q is true).\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) is false (S is false), ~P is false.\n\nSo, false \u2283 false is true.\n\nFrom premise 3: ~(~Q \u2228 R) = ~(true \u2228 false) = ~true = false.\n\nConclusion: ~P = false.\n\nSo, premises are true, conclusion is false. This is a counterexample.\n\nIn option D: P, R, and S are true, Q is false.\n\nFrom premise 1: P true, Q \u2228 R is true (R is true).\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) is false (Q is false), ~P is false.\n\nSo, false \u2283 false is true.\n\nFrom premise 3: ~(~Q \u2228 R) = ~(true \u2228 true) = ~true = false.\n\nConclusion: ~P = false.\n\nAgain, premises are true, conclusion is false. This is another counterexample.\n\nSo, both C and D present counterexamples.\n\nBut according to the problem, only one option should be chosen.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects to choose the one that matches the first case found.\n\nIn my analysis, case 1 corresponds to option D, and case 2 to option C.\n\nBut both are counterexamples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to choose the option that directly contradicts the conclusion.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option C is the one to choose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the argument.\n\nLet me re-examine the argument.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n1. P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n2. (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n3. ~(~Q \u2228 R)\n\nAnd the conclusion is ~P.\n\nWait, but in standard logical notation, the argument would be:\n\nP \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n(Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n~(~Q \u2228 R) \u22a2 ~P\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as:\n\nP \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n(Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n~(~Q \u2228 R) / ~P\n\nWhich seems to indicate that the premises are the first two, and the third is the negation of the conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread.\n\nLet me look back.\n\n\"Use indirect truth tables to determine whether the following argument is valid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample.\"\n\nThen, there are three statements:\n\nP \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n(Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n~(~Q \u2228 R) / ~P\n\nI think the last part is the conclusion, so the argument is:\n\nP \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n(Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\nTherefore, ~(~Q \u2228 R) \u22a2 ~P\n\nBut perhaps I need to interpret it differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last line is part of the premises.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: premises are P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R) and (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P, concluding ~P.\n\nSecond possibility: premises are P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R), (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P, and ~(~Q \u2228 R), concluding ~P.\n\nI think the second possibility is more likely, given the notation.\n\nSo, premises are:\n\n1. P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n2. (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n3. ~(~Q \u2228 R)\n\nConclusion: ~P\n\nNow, to use indirect truth tables, assume ~P is false, i.e., P is true, and see if all premises can be true.\n\nFrom premise 1: P true, so Q \u2228 R must be true.\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P. ~P is false, so (Q \u00b7 S) must be false.\n\nFrom premise 3: ~(~Q \u2228 R) must be true, since it's a premise.\n\nSo, ~Q \u2228 R must be false.\n\nWait, premise 3 is ~(~Q \u2228 R), which is the same as ~(Q \u2228 R), since ~Q \u2228 R is the same as Q \u2228 R.\n\nWait, no: ~Q \u2228 R is not the same as Q \u2228 R.\n\nWait, ~Q \u2228 R is the same as ~(Q \u00b7 ~R), by De Morgan's law.\n\nWait, no: ~Q \u2228 R = ~(Q \u00b7 ~R).\n\nSo, ~(~Q \u2228 R) = ~ ~(Q \u00b7 ~R) = Q \u00b7 ~R.\n\nTherefore, premise 3 is Q \u00b7 ~R.\n\nSo, the premises are:\n\n1. P \u2283 (Q \u2228 R)\n\n2. (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P\n\n3. Q \u00b7 ~R\n\nConclusion: ~P\n\nNow, assume ~P is false, i.e., P is true.\n\nFrom premise 1: P true, so Q \u2228 R must be true.\n\nFrom premise 3: Q is true and R is false.\n\nTherefore, Q is true, R is false.\n\nFrom premise 1: Q \u2228 R is true, which holds since Q is true.\n\nFrom premise 2: (Q \u00b7 S) \u2283 ~P. Q is true, S is unknown, ~P is false.\n\nSo, (Q \u00b7 S) must be false for the implication to be true, since ~P is false.\n\nTherefore, Q \u00b7 S is false, which means S is false (since Q is true).\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nP is true\n\nQ is true\n\nR is false\n\nS is false\n\nAll premises are true, and the conclusion ~P is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid, because we have true premises and a false conclusion.\n\nThis matches option C: Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R and S are false.\n\nOption D says P, R, and S are true and Q is false.\n\nBut in our case, R is false and Q is true.\n\nSo, option C matches our counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
