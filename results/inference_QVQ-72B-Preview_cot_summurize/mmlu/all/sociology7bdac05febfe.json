Freedom of movement for citizens\n\nC. One-party rule\n\nD. A centrally planned economy\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to identify which one of these isn't typically found in totalitarian societies.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a totalitarian society is. From what I recall, totalitarianism is a form of government where the state has complete control over every aspect of people's lives. That means politics, economy, religion, everything is under the state's control. So, in such a system, there's usually no room for individual freedom or opposition.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Indoctrination and propaganda.\n\nIndoctrination is when someone is taught to accept the ideas or beliefs of a particular group without question. Propaganda is information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a particular political cause or point of view. In a totalitarian society, the government would likely use indoctrination and propaganda to control people's thoughts and opinions, making sure everyone supports the regime. So, this seems like a characteristic of totalitarianism.\n\nOption B: Freedom of movement for citizens.\n\nFreedom of movement generally means that people can travel where they want within their country and abroad without restrictions. In a totalitarian society, where the state controls all aspects of life, I suspect that freedom of movement might be limited. The government might restrict travel to prevent people from leaving the country or moving to areas where they could organize against the regime. So, if this is the case, then freedom of movement isn't a characteristic of totalitarian societies.\n\nOption C: One-party rule.\n\nA one-party system is when only one political party holds power and there are legal or practical impediments to forming other parties. This seems very much in line with totalitarianism. In such a system, there's no political opposition, and the ruling party makes all the decisions. So, this should be a characteristic of totalitarian societies.\n\nOption D: A centrally planned economy.\n\nIn a centrally planned economy, the government makes all the decisions about what to produce, how much to produce, and how to distribute resources, rather than relying on market forces. This is typical of communist and some authoritarian regimes, where the state controls the means of production and distribution. So, this also seems like a characteristic of totalitarian societies.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that option B, freedom of movement for citizens, is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies. In fact, it's the opposite of what you'd expect in such a system, where control and restriction are key aspects of maintaining power.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about some examples of totalitarian states. Take Nazi Germany, which was notoriously restrictive in many ways, including limiting the movement of Jews and other groups. Or the Soviet Union, where citizens needed special permits to travel, especially abroad. Similarly, in North Korea today, movement is strictly controlled by the government.\n\nSo, in all these examples, freedom of movement is limited, not guaranteed. Therefore, it's accurate to say that freedom of movement for citizens is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies.\n\nI think the answer is B. Freedom of movement for citizens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
