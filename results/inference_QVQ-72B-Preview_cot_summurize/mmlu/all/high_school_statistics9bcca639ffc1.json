                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this statistics problem. It says that researchers are conducting an experiment with a significance level of 0.05, and the null hypothesis is actually false. Then, they decide to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment. I need to determine which statement is true about the changes in Type I error, Type II error, and power.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Type I and Type II errors are. A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n\nIn this scenario, the null hypothesis is false, so we're particularly interested in minimizing the Type II error and maximizing the power.\n\nNow, they're increasing the sample size by using twice as many experimental units for each treatment. I know that increasing sample size generally makes the test more sensitive, which should help in detecting actual effects.\n\nLet's think about the significance level. The significance level is set at 0.05, which is the probability of making a Type I error. But since the null hypothesis is false, we're not as concerned about increasing the sample size affecting the Type I error rate because we're assuming the null is already false.\n\nWait, but theoretically, the significance level should remain the same unless we change the significance level itself, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, option A says that both the probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would decrease. But if the significance level is fixed at 0.05, the probability of a Type I error shouldn't change, right?\n\nOption B says that both the probability of a Type I error and the power would increase. Again, if the significance level is fixed, the probability of a Type I error shouldn't change.\n\nOption C says that both the probability of a Type II error and the power would increase. That seems contradictory because if power increases, the probability of a Type II error should decrease because power is 1 minus the probability of a Type II error.\n\nOption D says that the probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\n\nGiven that, it seems like option D makes the most sense because increasing the sample size should increase the power of the test without changing the significance level, assuming we don't adjust it.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the null hypothesis is false and we increase the sample size, the test should become more powerful in detecting the alternative hypothesis, thus increasing the power and decreasing the probability of a Type II error.\n\nSo, according to this, option D seems correct.\n\nWait, but option C says that both the probability of a Type II error and the power would increase, which doesn't make sense because power and Type II error probability are inversely related.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice: the probability of a Type I error stays the same, and the power increases.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
