                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Financial adjustment to retirement has been most difficult for...?\" and the options are A. Married couples, B. Single men, C. Single women, D. Older adults. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that retirement can be a big transition for everyone, but it might hit some groups harder than others financially. I need to consider various factors like income, savings, pension plans, and how they might differ based on marital status and gender.\n\nLet me start by thinking about married couples. In many cases, married couples might have dual incomes before retirement, and when they both retire, their combined income might drop significantly. However, they might also have joint savings and pension plans that could help buffer that drop. Plus, they might have more support systems in place since there are two people sharing the burden. So, maybe it's not as difficult for them compared to single individuals. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNow, moving on to single men. They don't have a partner's income or savings to fall back on in retirement. That means they have to rely solely on their own savings, Social Security, or other pensions. Depending on how much they've saved, this could be challenging. But perhaps men generally earn more on average, so they might have higher savings. Still, retirement can be lonely without a partner to share the experience with, which might affect their overall well-being and potentially their finances if they need to pay for companionship or care.\n\nNext, single women. This is an interesting group. Women often earn less than men on average, which could mean they have less savings going into retirement. Additionally, women tend to live longer than men, so their savings might have to stretch further. They might also have taken time off work for caregiving, which could affect their retirement contributions and Social Security benefits. Moreover, without a partner's income or assets, they might face greater financial strains. But on the other hand, there might be specific support systems or programs aimed at helping single women in retirement.\n\nLastly, older adults in general. Well, this seems a bit too broad. All the other options are more specific, so I'm not sure if \"older adults\" is the right answer here. The question is probably looking for a more precise group within older adults.\n\nWait a minute, maybe \"older adults\" is referring to those who are retired, but that seems too vague compared to the other options. Perhaps it's a distractor to make me think more carefully.\n\nLet me try to summarize what I've thought so far:\n\n- Married couples might have advantages in sharing resources and planning for retirement together.\n\n- Single men might face challenges due to lack of a partner's income but might have higher earnings and savings.\n\n- Single women might have lower lifetime earnings, longer life expectancies, and potentially greater caregiving responsibilities that affect their savings.\n\n- Older adults in general might include a mix of these situations.\n\nGiven this, it seems like single women might be at a greater disadvantage financially in retirement. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI recall reading somewhere that women, especially those who are single, can face significant financial challenges in retirement due to the gender pay gap, longer life expectancy, and potentially interrupted careers for caregiving. All of these factors can lead to lower retirement savings and higher lifetime healthcare costs.\n\nOn the other hand, married couples might have some protections through shared resources and potentially higher overall savings from two incomes, even if one income is part-time or interrupted.\n\nSingle men might also face challenges, but generally, men earn more than women, so they might have higher individual savings to draw upon in retirement.\n\n\"Older adults\" is too vague to really assess compared to the other options.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I would say that financial adjustment to retirement has been most difficult for single women.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Single women}} \\]"
