The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character approaches their little cousin at her birthday party and pops her balloon. In Scenario 2, the main character tells their son to turn off the lawnmower before clearing the blades. So, the question is asking whether either of these actions is morally wrong.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first. Popping someone's balloon at a birthday party might be seen as playful or mischievous, especially in a party setting where balloons are often part of the decorations and activities. However, if the action was intended to spoil the cousin's fun or was done in a malicious way, it could be considered wrong. But from the description, it doesn't seem like there's any malicious intent; it just seems like a prank or part of the festivities. So, in this context, I don't think it's morally wrong. It's more of a harmless prank among family members during a celebration.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Here, the main character tells their son to turn off the lawnmower before clearing the blades. This seems like a safety instruction. Turning off the lawnmower before clearing the blades is a standard safety practice to prevent accidents, such as getting injured by moving blades. So, in this case, the main character is actually giving good advice or instructions to their son, which is not morally wrong but rather responsible parenting. Ensuring one's child's safety and teaching them safe practices is morally right.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, neither scenario seems to involve a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Both actions can be considered not wrong in their respective contexts. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it again. In Scenario 1, popping a balloon at a birthday party is more of a playful act without any harmful intent, so it's not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, advising someone to turn off the lawnmower before clearing the blades is a safety measure, which is morally responsible. So, both scenarios fall into the \"Not wrong\" category.\n\nI think I'm confident with this conclusion. Choosing option D, \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" seems to be the appropriate response to the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
