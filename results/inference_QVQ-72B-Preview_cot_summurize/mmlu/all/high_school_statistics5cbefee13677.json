                    "text": "So I have this question here about confidence intervals, and I need to figure out which scenario would result in the narrowest confidence interval. The options are:\n\nA. Small sample size and 95% confidence\n\nB. Small sample size and 99% confidence\n\nC. Large sample size and 95% confidence\n\nD. Large sample size and 99% confidence\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what factors affect the width of a confidence interval. From what I recall, the width of a confidence interval is influenced by three main things:\n\n1. Sample size: Generally, larger sample sizes lead to narrower confidence intervals because they provide more precise estimates.\n\n2. Confidence level: Higher confidence levels usually result in wider intervals because you're being more certain about capturing the true population parameter.\n\n3. Standard deviation: The variability in the data also affects the width\u2014less variability means narrower intervals.\n\nBut in this question, only sample size and confidence level are mentioned, so I'll focus on those.\n\nLet me think about sample size first. I know that as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases, which in turn makes the confidence interval narrower. So, between a small and large sample size, the large sample size should give a narrower interval, all else being equal.\n\nNow, for the confidence level. A higher confidence level means that I want to be more sure that the interval captures the true population parameter. To achieve higher confidence, the interval needs to be wider. So, a 99% confidence interval will be wider than a 95% confidence interval, assuming the same sample size and standard deviation.\n\nSo, if I have a large sample size and a lower confidence level, would that give me the narrowest interval? Wait, but option C is large sample size and 95% confidence, while option D is large sample size and 99% confidence. According to what I just thought, option C should be narrower than option D because of the confidence level.\n\nBut let's consider the options again:\n\nA. Small sample size and 95% confidence\n\nB. Small sample size and 99% confidence\n\nC. Large sample size and 95% confidence\n\nD. Large sample size and 99% confidence\n\nI think it's safe to assume that with a larger sample size, you get narrower intervals, and with a higher confidence level, you get wider intervals.\n\nSo, comparing options A and B: both have small sample sizes, but option B has a higher confidence level, so its interval should be wider than option A's.\n\nSimilarly, options C and D have large sample sizes, with option D having a higher confidence level, so it should be wider than option C.\n\nBetween options A and C: both have the same confidence level, but option C has a larger sample size, so it should be narrower than option A.\n\nTherefore, among all these options, option C seems to have the narrowest confidence interval because it combines a large sample size with a lower confidence level.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nImagine I have two scenarios:\n\n1. Large sample size and 95% confidence (option C)\n\n2. Large sample size and 99% confidence (option D)\n\nBoth have large sample sizes, so the sample size isn't the differentiating factor here. The difference is in the confidence level. A higher confidence level requires a wider interval to be more certain about capturing the true parameter. So, option D should have a wider interval than option C.\n\nNow, comparing option C with option A:\n\n- Option C: large sample size, 95% confidence\n\n- Option A: small sample size, 95% confidence\n\nBoth have the same confidence level, but option C has a larger sample size, which should lead to a narrower interval.\n\nSimilarly, option B has a small sample size and 99% confidence, which should be even wider than option A.\n\nTherefore, among all options, option C should have the narrowest confidence interval.\n\nBut let me think about this differently. Maybe I should consider the formula for a confidence interval to confirm.\n\nFor a large sample size and normally distributed data, the confidence interval for the population mean is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x} \\pm z \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean\n\n- \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation\n\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size\n\nThe width of the interval is twice the margin of error:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times z \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the width decreases as the sample size \\(n\\) increases (since it's in the denominator under the square root) and increases as the \\(z\\)-score increases, which corresponds to higher confidence levels.\n\nSo, to minimize the width, we need the smallest possible \\(z\\)-score and the largest possible \\(n\\).\n\nIn the options:\n\n- Small sample size vs. large sample size: larger \\(n\\) is better (narrower interval)\n\n- 95% confidence vs. 99% confidence: 95% has a smaller \\(z\\)-score (since 95% corresponds to a lower \\(z\\)-value than 99%)\n\nTherefore, combining large sample size and 95% confidence should give the narrowest interval.\n\nWait, but option C is large sample size and 95% confidence, which seems correct.\n\nIs there any other factor to consider? Maybe the type of data or distribution, but the question doesn't provide that, so I think it's safe to proceed with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trade-off between sample size and confidence level, but based on the formula, it seems clear that larger \\(n\\) and lower confidence level lead to a narrower interval.\n\nLet me consider an extreme case to illustrate this.\n\nSuppose I have a very large sample size, say 1000, and a 95% confidence level. The interval should be quite narrow.\n\nOn the other hand, with a small sample size, say 50, and a 99% confidence level, the interval should be much wider.\n\nSo, yes, option C seems to be the best choice for the narrowest confidence interval.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Small sample size and 95% confidence\n\nB. Small sample size and 99% confidence\n\nC. Large sample size and 95% confidence\n\nD. Large sample size and 99% confidence\n\nComparing A and C: larger \\(n\\) in C makes it narrower.\n\nComparing C and D: lower confidence level in C makes it narrower.\n\nComparing B and C: B has both smaller \\(n\\) and higher confidence level, making its interval wider than C.\n\nTherefore, option C is the one with the narrowest confidence interval.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
