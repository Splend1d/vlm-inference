                    "text": "So I have this question about the chi-square (\u03c7\u00b2) probability distribution function, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the area under the \u03c7\u00b2 curve is 1. I remember that in probability distributions, the total area under the curve is always 1 because it represents the total probability of all possible outcomes. So, this should be true for the \u03c7\u00b2 distribution as well.\n\nOption B states that \u03c7\u00b2 is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable. From what I recall, the \u03c7\u00b2 statistic is calculated as the sum of the squares of standard normal variables, and since squares are always nonnegative, the \u03c7\u00b2 distribution should only take on nonnegative values. So, this seems correct too.\n\nOption C mentions that for small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness. I know that the shape of the \u03c7\u00b2 distribution changes with the degrees of freedom. For small degrees of freedom, like df=1 or df=2, the distribution is indeed skewed to the right. As the degrees of freedom increase, the distribution becomes more symmetric. So, this statement appears to be true.\n\nOption D says that for the same \u03b1, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases. This one seems a bit tricky. I need to think about the critical values of the \u03c7\u00b2 distribution. For a given significance level \u03b1, like 0.05, the critical value that defines the rejection region changes with the degrees of freedom.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I look at a \u03c7\u00b2 distribution table or plot, for higher degrees of freedom, does the critical value decrease or increase? Wait, actually, I think for a fixed \u03b1, as the degrees of freedom increase, the critical value increases. Let me confirm this.\n\nFor example, consider a right-tailed test with \u03b1=0.05. The critical value is the point above which 5% of the distribution lies. For df=1, the critical value is around 3.84, and for df=5, it's around 11.07. So, as df increases from 1 to 5, the critical value increases, not decreases. Therefore, option D seems to be incorrect because it states that the critical value decreases as df increases, but in reality, it increases.\n\nSo, based on this, option D is not true.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another example. For df=10, the \u03c7\u00b2 critical value at \u03b1=0.05 is approximately 18.31, and for df=20, it's around 31.41. Again, as df increases, the critical value increases. So, my initial conclusion holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
