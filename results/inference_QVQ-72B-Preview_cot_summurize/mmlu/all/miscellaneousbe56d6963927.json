Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these countries had shoguns as rulers.\n\nFirst off, I know that shoguns were feudal military dictators in Japan. They were like the de facto rulers, even though there was an emperor who was more of a figurehead. So, right off the bat, I'm pretty sure the answer is Japan. But just to be thorough, I should eliminate the other options.\n\nLet's see, China has a long history, but I don't recall any shoguns there. They had emperors and dynasties, like the Tang and Ming dynasties, but not shoguns. So, probably not China.\n\nNorth Korea is a more recent state, and it's been ruled by the Kim family for most of its history. Before that, it was part of Japan for a while, but I don't think shoguns were involved there.\n\nTaiwan, well, it was also under Japanese rule for some time, but again, I don't think shoguns were part of its governance.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Japan is the country that was once ruled by shoguns. Just to double-check, let me think about the different shogunate periods in Japan. There was the Kamakura shogunate, then the Ashikaga shogunate, and finally the Tokugawa shogunate. These shoguns held real power, while the emperor mostly stayed in Kyoto, removed from politics.\n\nI don't remember any similar systems in China, North Korea, or Taiwan. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is Japan.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there were any shoguns in other countries that I'm not aware of. Let me think about Korea again. I know that Korea had its own kings and dynasties, but I don't think they had shoguns. Similarly, in Taiwan, which was a part of the Chinese empire for many years, I don't recall any shoguns being part of their history.\n\nChina is a big one; it has such a long history with many different rulers and dynasties, but again, shoguns were specifically Japanese figures. So, I think it's safe to say that Japan is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I can look up a quick definition of \"shogun.\" According to most definitions, a shogun was a hereditary military dictator in feudal Japan, who held power in the name of the emperor. So, this further confirms that shoguns were unique to Japan.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is B. Japan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ Japan} \\]"
