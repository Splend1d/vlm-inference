                    "text": "So I have this question here about the definition of law. The statement is: \"Law consists of a set of principles or body of rules recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice.\" And I need to identify who made this statement from the options: A. Austin, B. Salmond, C. Holland, D. Gray.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what each of these legal theorists believed about the nature of law. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.\n\nStarting with Austin, I remember that he was a proponent of the command theory of law. He thought that law is essentially the commands of the sovereign, backed by sanctions. So, according to Austin, law is the command of the sovereign, enforced by the state. But the statement here seems a bit different; it talks about principles and rules recognized and applied by the state in administering justice. While Austin does emphasize the state's role, his focus is more on commands and sovereignty. Maybe this isn't exactly Austin's view.\n\nNext, Salmond. I think Salmond had a more nuanced view of law. He defined law as \"a rule of civil conduct prescribed by a sovereign power under which the failure to discharge a duty involving another person is redressable by an independent tribunal.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit different from the statement given. Salmond emphasizes rules of civil conduct and the idea of duties and rights. The statement mentions principles and rules recognized by the state, which might align somewhat with Salmond's view, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThen there's Holland. I recall that Holland was another legal theorist from the 19th century. He defined law as \"the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in administering its legal system.\" Wait a minute, that sounds very similar to the statement in the question. Holland's definition talks about principles recognized and applied by the state, which matches the statement almost word for word. So, maybe the answer is C. Holland.\n\nBut let me double-check. I don't want to jump to conclusions. Gray is the last option. I think Gray was an American legal realist, and his views on law were quite different. He emphasized the role of judges in shaping law through decisions based on facts and circumstances. His definition of law might be more about the outcomes of judicial decisions rather than a set of recognized principles. So, probably not Gray.\n\nLet me consider this again. The statement says, \"Law consists of a set of principles or body of rules recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice.\" This seems to align closely with Holland's definition, as I recalled earlier. Holland defined law as the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in administering its legal system. The wording is almost identical.\n\nI think I can confidently say that the statement is made by Holland. So, the answer should be C. Holland.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me see if any of the other theorists have similar definitions. Austin's command theory is quite distinct. Salmond's definition focuses on rules of civil conduct and the idea of rights and duties, which is different from the statement provided. Gray, being a legal realist, might have a different perspective emphasizing the practical outcomes of law rather than a set of recognized principles.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C. Holland.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
