                    "text": "Let's see here. Susan reads a book at a rate of 1 page every 3 minutes. I need to find out how many minutes it will take her to read 18 pages. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that her reading rate is 1 page every 3 minutes. So, if she reads 1 page in 3 minutes, then for 18 pages, it should take her 18 times 3 minutes, right? Let me calculate that. 18 multiplied by 3 is 54. So, 54 minutes for 18 pages.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure that's the right approach. Sometimes, people might think differently about rates. Maybe I should use another method to confirm. Maybe I can set up a proportion. If 1 page takes 3 minutes, then for p pages, it would take m minutes. So, 1 page : 3 minutes = 18 pages : m minutes.\n\nTo solve for m, I can cross-multiply. So, 1 * m = 18 * 3. That gives me m = 54 minutes. Okay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nLet me consider another way. Maybe using division. If she reads 1 page every 3 minutes, then per minute, she reads 1/3 of a page. So, for 18 pages, I can divide 18 by (1/3), which is the same as multiplying by 3. So, 18 divided by 1/3 is 18 * 3 = 54 minutes. Again, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the correct method is to multiply 3 by 18 to get 54 minutes. Let me just check the options again to make sure.\n\nOption A: add 18 and 3. That would be 21, which is not 54.\n\nOption B: divide 18 by 3. That's 6, not 54.\n\nOption C: multiply 3 by 18. That's exactly 54.\n\nOption D: subtract 3 from 18. That's 15, not 54.\n\nSo, clearly, option C is the correct method to determine the number of minutes for Susan to read 18 pages.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the rate is pages per minute or minutes per page. The problem says she reads at a rate of 1 page every 3 minutes. So, it's 1 page per 3 minutes, meaning for each page, it takes 3 minutes. So, for 18 pages, it should be 18 times 3, which is 54 minutes. That seems consistent across multiple methods I've used.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of time per page. Since each page takes 3 minutes, then for 18 pages, it's 18 multiplied by 3, which is 54 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it in terms of pages per time. If she reads 1 page in 3 minutes, then her reading rate is 1/3 page per minute. To read 18 pages, the time required would be 18 divided by (1/3), which again, is 18 multiplied by 3, resulting in 54 minutes.\n\nI think I've approached this in several different ways and consistently arrived at the same answer. So, I feel pretty confident that multiplying 3 by 18 is the correct method to find out how many minutes Susan needs to read 18 pages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
