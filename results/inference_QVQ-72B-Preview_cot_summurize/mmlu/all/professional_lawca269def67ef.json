                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario about a pharmacist who's allegedly making synthetic cocaine, and the police used a tracking device on his car to find evidence. The pharmacist wants to suppress the evidence of the synthetic cocaine that the police found, and I need to decide whether his motion will likely be granted or denied.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The police got an anonymous tip that the pharmacist was making illegal drugs. They put a tracking device on his car without a warrant and followed his movements for almost a month. Eventually, they tracked him to a warehouse where they saw drug paraphernalia and equipment through the window. Based on that, they got a search warrant, went in, arrested him, and seized a bunch of synthetic cocaine.\n\nNow, the pharmacist is trying to suppress that evidence, probably arguing that the police obtained it illegally. I need to see what the likely outcome of that motion would be.\n\nOption A says the motion will be granted because the information for the search warrant was illegally obtained using the tracking device. Option B also says it will be granted because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search. Option C says it will be denied because the police could have just followed the pharmacist's car without the tracking device. Option D says it will be denied because the electronic surveillance didn't exceed 30 days.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, was it legal for the police to put a tracking device on the pharmacist's car without a warrant? I recall that in some cases, the use of GPS tracking devices has been a point of legal debate, especially regarding privacy rights and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nI think there was a Supreme Court case, United States v. Jones, where the Court held that attaching a GPS device to a car and tracking its movements without a warrant was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. So, maybe the police needed a warrant to install the tracking device.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's not specified which state this is in, and different states might have different laws regarding tracking devices. However, generally, under federal law, warrantless GPS tracking might be considered unconstitutional.\n\nSo, if the police didn't have a warrant and installed the tracking device without one, that could be seen as an illegal search. And evidence obtained from that illegal search could be suppressed under the exclusionary rule.\n\nBut wait, the police saw the drug paraphernalia and equipment through the window, which might be considered plain view. Does that make a difference?\n\nWell, if the police were lawfully present outside the warehouse and saw the evidence through the window without any enhancement, like binoculars or anything, that might be considered plain view, and they could use that to get a search warrant.\n\nBut they got to the warehouse by tracking the car using the tracking device, which might have been illegally obtained information.\n\nSo, if the tracking device placement was illegal, then the information leading them to the warehouse was fruit of the poisonous tree, and thus the observation through the window and the subsequent search warrant could be tainted.\n\nThat means that even though the observation through the window was in plain view, the police only got to that point because of the illegal tracking.\n\nTherefore, the evidence from the search might be suppressed because it was derived from the illegal use of the tracking device.\n\nBut option C says the motion will be denied because the police could have discovered the location by just following the pharmacist's car. Hmm.\n\nWell, yes, theoretically, the police could have followed the pharmacist's car without a tracking device, but in practice, tracking devices make it easier, especially over a month-long period.\n\nBut the fact is, they used the tracking device without a warrant, which might be illegal, and that's what led them to the warehouse.\n\nSo, even if they could have found the warehouse another way, they actually used an illegal method to find it, and that might taint the evidence.\n\nBut maybe the court would consider that the tracking device was just a more convenient way of following the car, and since following the car without a device would be legal, the evidence shouldn't be suppressed.\n\nBut I think that's not how it works. The exclusionary rule is meant to deter police misconduct, so if they used an illegal method to obtain evidence, even if they could have obtained it legally, the evidence can still be suppressed.\n\nSo, in that case, the motion might be granted.\n\nOption D says the motion will be denied because the electronic surveillance didn't exceed 30 days. I'm not sure about that. Even if the tracking was for less than 30 days, if it was without a warrant and considered illegal, the evidence could still be suppressed.\n\nI don't think the duration matters as much as whether a warrant was obtained or not.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option A is correct: the motion will be granted because the information for the search warrant was illegally obtained via the tracking device.\n\nOption B also suggests it will be granted because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search, which seems similar to option A.\n\nBut option C says it will be denied because the police could have followed the car without the device, which might be a counterargument, but I think the use of the illegal method still taints the evidence.\n\nOption D seems irrelevant because the duration of surveillance isn't the main issue here; it's whether a warrant was obtained or not.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is A: granted, because the information upon which the search warrant was based was illegally obtained by means of the tracking device.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
