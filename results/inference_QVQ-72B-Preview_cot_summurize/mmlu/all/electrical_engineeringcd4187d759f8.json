                    "text": "So I have this question about diodes. It says that when a diode, specifically a p-n junction, is reverse biased, it acts as which of the following: an on switch, a zener diode, a capacitor, or an off switch. Hmm, I need to recall how a diode behaves under reverse bias.\n\nFirst off, I know that a diode is made up of a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor joined together, forming a junction. When it's forward biased, meaning the positive voltage is applied to the p-side and negative to the n-side, it allows current to flow easily. That's like being turned on, right?\n\nBut in this case, it's reverse biased. So, the positive voltage is applied to the n-side and negative to the p-side. I think in this configuration, the diode doesn't conduct current, meaning it's off. So, would that make it an off switch? That seems straightforward, but let me think deeper.\n\nI remember that under reverse bias, the depletion region widens, and there's a very high resistance across the junction. So, ideally, no current flows, making it act like an open circuit, or in other words, an off switch. But I've also heard about zener diodes, which are designed to conduct in reverse bias once the voltage reaches a certain value, called the zener voltage.\n\nWait a minute, is the question referring to a standard diode or could it be implying a zener diode? The question just says \"a diode (p-n junction),\" which is generally a standard diode. Zener diodes are a specific type of diode designed to operate in reverse bias without getting damaged, but they're not typical p-n junction diodes in reverse bias.\n\nIn a standard p-n junction diode under reverse bias, the diode doesn't conduct until the reverse voltage reaches the breakdown voltage, which can be quite high, unlike zener diodes which are designed to break down at lower voltages.\n\nSo, if it's a standard diode, in reverse bias, it should block current flow until the breakdown voltage is reached, acting like an off switch. Therefore, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider if it could be a capacitor. A capacitor stores electric charge, and in a p-n junction, the depletion region acts somewhat like a capacitor because it has positive and negative charges separated by a dielectric-like region. However, in reverse bias, the depletion region widens, increasing the capacitance, but I don't think the diode as a whole acts primarily as a capacitor in this mode.\n\nAs for a zener diode, as I mentioned earlier, it's a special type of diode designed to conduct in reverse bias at a specific voltage. But since the question specifies a p-n junction diode, not a zener diode, I don't think that's the intended answer.\n\nAn on switch seems unlikely because in reverse bias, the diode doesn't conduct current; it's more like being off rather than on.\n\nSo, after considering all options, I believe the correct answer is D. Off Switch.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
