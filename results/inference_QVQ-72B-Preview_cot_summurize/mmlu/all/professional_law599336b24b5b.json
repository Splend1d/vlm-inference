                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out which fact the defendant's attorney would be least likely to try to prove in a motion to suppress the gun that was found. Let me first make sure I understand the situation.\n\nSo, the defendant suspected her boyfriend was cheating, went to his apartment with her key, found him with another woman, got angry, and killed them both with a gun she found in the nightstand. Then, she went on a two-day trip to the mountains to clear her head. While she was gone, she asked her teenage neighbor to look after her apartment and her 4-year-old daughter. The police showed up at the apartment, asked the neighbor if they could search, and the neighbor said yes. During the search, they found the gun in the defendant's bedroom, which was used in the killings.\n\nNow, the defendant's attorney is trying to suppress the gun as evidence before the trial. I need to determine which of the given facts the attorney would be least likely to try to prove in this motion.\n\nFirst, let's think about the motion to suppress. Typically, a motion to suppress is used to exclude evidence that was obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights, usually under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nSo, for the gun to be suppressed, the attorney would need to argue that the police obtained it through an illegal search.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.\n\nIf the defendant gave the neighbor keys, that might imply that the neighbor had some level of access or authority over the apartment. However, giving keys doesn't necessarily mean that the neighbor has the right to consent to a search by the police. So, the attorney might argue that the neighbor didn't have the authority to consent to the search, making the search invalid.\n\nB. The police did not have a search warrant.\n\nThis is a big one. If the police conducted a search without a warrant, the attorney would likely argue that this violates the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, unless the police can show an exception to the warrant requirement, like consent, exigent circumstances, or hot pursuit.\n\nC. The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.\n\nThis could be relevant because if the defendant instructed the neighbor not to let anyone in, especially not the police, it could suggest that the defendant did not want her privacy invaded. The attorney might argue that the neighbor should have respected her wishes and not allowed the police to search.\n\nD. The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.\n\nThis sounds like coercion or improper pressure from the police. If the neighbor felt threatened or intimidated into giving consent, the attorney could argue that the consent was not voluntarily given, making the search invalid.\n\nSo, considering all this, the attorney would likely want to prove that the search was illegal, either because the police didn't have a warrant, the neighbor didn't have the right to consent, or the consent was coerced.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the fact that the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove. So, among these options, which one doesn't directly help in proving that the search was illegal?\n\nLet me think again:\n\n- A: Defendant gave neighbor keys \u2013 this could be relevant to the neighbor's authority to consent.\n\n- B: Police had no warrant \u2013 this is directly relevant to the legality of the search.\n\n- C: Defendant told neighbor not to answer the door to anyone \u2013 this could show the defendant's expectation of privacy.\n\n- D: Police threatened neighbor with arrest if she didn't consent \u2013 this could show that the consent was not voluntary.\n\nSo, all of these, except maybe A, directly relate to the legality of the search. But let's consider A again.\n\nIf the defendant gave the neighbor keys, that might actually help the police's case by suggesting that the neighbor had some level of authority over the apartment. However, even if the neighbor had keys, that doesn't necessarily mean they can consent to a search that would incriminate the defendant. So, perhaps the attorney wouldn't want to emphasize that the defendant gave keys to the neighbor, because it might strengthen the police's position that the neighbor had the right to consent.\n\nOn the other hand, if the attorney can show that even though the neighbor had keys, the defendant didn't want the apartment searched by the police, that might help their case.\n\nBut comparing this to the other options:\n\n- B is directly about the absence of a warrant, which is a strong argument for suppression.\n\n- C shows the defendant's desire to maintain privacy.\n\n- D suggests that the consent was not voluntary.\n\nAll of these would be helpful in arguing that the search was illegal.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the one that the attorney would be least likely to try to prove, because it might imply that the neighbor had some authority to consent to the search, which could weaken the suppression argument.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attorney would still want to mention that the defendant gave keys to the neighbor to show that the neighbor had some level of access but not the authority to consent to a search that could incriminate the defendant. But overall, it seems that proving that the defendant gave keys to the neighbor might not be as beneficial to the suppression motion as the other facts.\n\nSo, my answer would be A: The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
