Incorporating a strength-based perspective\n\nB. Meeting legal guidelines for a comprehensive assessment\n\nC. Providing an accurate timeline of when a problem began and how it changed over time\n\nD. Establishing rapport to better understand the child's perspective on a problem\n\nHmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's a multimethod model of assessment? I think it's an approach that uses multiple ways to evaluate a child's development or mental health, like observations, tests, and talking to the child and their caregivers.\n\nNow, child interviews are specifically mentioned. So, why are they important in this context?\n\nOption A says incorporating a strength-based perspective. A strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes and resources a child has, rather than just their problems. Child interviews could help identify these strengths because the child can talk about their own abilities and interests. That makes sense.\n\nOption B is about meeting legal guidelines for a comprehensive assessment. I'm not as sure about this one. Maybe in some cases, laws require direct communication with the child for assessment, but I don't know if that's universal. It might vary by jurisdiction.\n\nOption C is providing an accurate timeline of when a problem began and how it changed over time. Children might not always remember when things started or how they've changed, especially if they're young. Parents or teachers might have a better sense of the timeline. So, maybe this isn't the primary benefit of child interviews.\n\nOption D is establishing rapport to better understand the child's perspective on a problem. This seems really important. Building a good relationship with the child can help them feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings, which is crucial for understanding their perspective.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the most helpful purpose. So, I need to think about which one is the most significant reason to conduct child interviews in this model.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\n- A: Strength-based perspective \u2013 definitely beneficial, but is it the most important reason?\n\n- B: Legal guidelines \u2013 might be necessary in some cases, but not sure if it's the primary purpose.\n\n- C: Timeline of problems \u2013 possibly not the strongest area for children to provide information, especially if they're young.\n\n- D: Establishing rapport to understand the child's perspective \u2013 seems very important for getting insightful information directly from the child.\n\nI think option D is the most helpful purpose. Establishing rapport helps in getting honest and open communication from the child, which is essential for understanding their perspective on any issues they might be facing.\n\nBut let me think about it differently. Maybe combining some options could be considered. For example, building rapport (D) could help in incorporating a strength-based perspective (A), since knowing the child well would allow the assessor to identify their strengths.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the most helpful purpose, not a combination of purposes. So, I need to choose one that stands out the most.\n\nAnother angle: in a multimethod assessment, combining different sources of information is key. Child interviews provide a unique perspective that others (like parents or teachers) might not fully capture. So, understanding the child's own view of the situation is invaluable.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to capture this essence best. Establishing rapport helps in uncovering the child's perspective, which is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.\n\nI should also consider the age of the child. If the child is very young, their ability to articulate their thoughts and feelings might be limited. In such cases, building rapport might be even more important to help them feel safe and express themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, for older children, they might be more articulate and able to provide detailed information about their experiences and feelings.\n\nSo, regardless of age, establishing rapport is key to getting meaningful information from the child.\n\nLet me see if there's any information that suggests otherwise. For example, maybe in some contexts, child interviews are primarily for legal reasons (option B). But I don't think that's generally the case.\n\nOption A, incorporating a strength-based perspective, is also important, but it seems more related to the overall approach of the assessment rather than the specific purpose of conducting child interviews.\n\nOption C, providing an accurate timeline, seems less reliable through child interviews, especially since children might not have a clear memory of when certain events occurred or how their feelings have changed over time.\n\nTherefore, I believe option D is the most accurate answer: establishing rapport to better understand the child's perspective on a problem.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check a psychology textbook or a reliable source to confirm.\n\n[Imagining searching for \"child interviews in multimethod assessment\"]\n\nOkay, found a source that says: \"Child interviews are essential in multimethod assessments as they allow the clinician to understand the child's perspective directly, building trust and rapport to facilitate open communication.\"\n\nAnother source mentions: \"Direct interviews with children contribute unique information that cannot be obtained from parents or teachers alone, particularly regarding the child's own experiences and feelings about the issues at hand.\"\n\nThis reinforces my thought that establishing rapport and understanding the child's perspective are crucial purposes of child interviews in this context.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
