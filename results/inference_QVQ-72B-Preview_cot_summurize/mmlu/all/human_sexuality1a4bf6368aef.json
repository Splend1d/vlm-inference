                    "text": "So I need to figure out which statements about gonorrhea are true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says it can be treated with antibiotics. I remember that gonorrhea is a bacterial infection, and bacteria can often be treated with antibiotics. But I've also heard that there's been an increase in antibiotic-resistant strains. Does that mean it's still treatable, or is that changing?\n\nLet me think about this. Even though there are resistant strains, I think that gonorrhea is still treatable with certain antibiotics, at least for now. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) probably have guidelines for the current treatment options. So, I'll assume that, generally, gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics, but it's becoming more challenging due to resistance.\n\nMoving on to option B: has a high risk of infection with a single exposure. I know that gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and it can be spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. But what's the likelihood of getting it from one exposure?\n\nI did some research once and found that the risk can vary based on factors like whether condoms are used, the type of sexual activity, and the infected partner's viral load or bacterial count. But generally, I think the transmission rate for gonorrhea is pretty high, especially during unprotected sex.\n\nI recall a study that said the per-act probability of transmitting gonorrhea can be around 20-50% without condom use. So, that suggests that even a single exposure without protection could lead to a significant risk of infection. Therefore, I would say that this statement is true.\n\nNow, option C: is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected. I know that many STIs can be asymptomatic, especially in women. For gonorrhea, I think a substantial number of people don't show any symptoms, which can make it hard to detect and treat early on.\n\nLet me try to recall some statistics. I think that about 10-20% of infected men might not have symptoms, whereas in women, it's higher, maybe around 40-80% can be asymptomatic. So, in reality, a large percentage of people with gonorrhea don't have symptoms, especially women.\n\nTherefore, the statement that it's asymptomatic in only a small percentage is incorrect because, in reality, a significant portion of infected individuals don't experience symptoms. So, I would say this is false.\n\nLastly, option D: infections are limited to genital areas. Gonorrhea is typically associated with the genital tract, but I've heard that it can affect other parts of the body as well, especially if left untreated.\n\nFor example, it can spread to the throat after oral sex or to the rectum after anal sex. Additionally, it can sometimes lead to infections in other areas like the eyes or joints, although these are less common.\n\nSo, gonorrhea isn't limited just to the genital areas; it can involve other sites in the body, particularly those exposed through certain types of sexual contact. Therefore, this statement is also false.\n\nIn summary, I believe that options A and B are true, while C and D are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A, B} \\]"
