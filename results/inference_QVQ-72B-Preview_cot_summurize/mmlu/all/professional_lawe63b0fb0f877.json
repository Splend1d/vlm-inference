                    "text": "Let's dive into this property law problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, we have a retiree who owns a 100-acre farm in fee simple absolute. In 1998, he devises the property to his daughter and his friend as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Okay, first things first, joint tenancy with right of survivorship means that if one of them dies, the other automatically gets their share. There's no right of alienation mentioned, so I assume they can't sell their share without the other's consent, but I might need to double-check that.\n\nNext, in 1999, the daughter deeds a portion of the farm to her co-worker. The deed says: \"I hereby convey all of my right, title, and interest in the northeast quarter of the farm to the co-worker and his heirs.\" So, the farm is 100 acres, divided into quarters, and she's conveying the northeast quarter to the co-worker. But wait, they hold the farm as joint tenants. Does that mean she can convey her interest in a part of the farm like that?\n\nI think in joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest in the whole property, not specific parts. So, when she tries to convey \"the northeast quarter,\" she's probably conveying her share of that quarter. But since they're joint tenants, the entire property is owned jointly, so conveying a specific part might be tricky.\n\nLet me think about this. If they're joint tenants, and she deeds her interest in the northeast quarter to the co-worker, does that mean the co-worker now holds that interest jointly with the friend? Or does it create a tenancy in common?\n\nI recall that generally, if a joint tenant conveys her interest, it can convert the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common. So, perhaps after this conveyance, the daughter and the friend are no longer joint tenants, and instead, there's a tenancy in common involving the co-worker.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Maybe I should look up the law on this specific point.\n\nAlright, moving on. In 2008, the daughter defaults on a $100,000 loan from a lender. The lender, as a judgment creditor, levies upon and sells to his nephew on execution sale all of \"the daughter's right, title, and interest in the south half of the farm.\"\n\nWait a minute, the farm is divided into quarters, right? So, the south half would be two quarters: the southeast and the southwest quarters.\n\nBut again, since they were originally joint tenants in the whole farm, the daughter's interest was an undivided share of the whole, not specific parts. So, when the lender sells \"the daughter's right, title, and interest in the south half of the farm,\" is that even possible?\n\nMaybe the court allows the sale of specific parts of the property based on the lender's description. So, perhaps the nephew now has the daughter's interest in the south half.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to map this out.\n\nInitially, the retiree owns the entire 100-acre farm in fee simple absolute.\n\nIn 1998, he devises the farm to his daughter and his friend as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nIn 1999, the daughter deeds her interest in the northeast quarter to the co-worker.\n\nThen, in 2008, the daughter defaults on a loan, and the lender sells her interest in the south half to his nephew.\n\nIn December 2009, the daughter dies intestate, and her husband is her sole surviving heir.\n\nNow, we need to figure out who owns what parts of the farm.\n\nFirst, let's consider the 1999 conveyance by the daughter to the co-worker.\n\nAs joint tenants, the daughter and the friend each had an undivided interest in the entire farm. When the daughter conveys her interest in the northeast quarter to the co-worker, it likely severs the joint tenancy as to that portion, creating a tenancy in common between the friend and the co-worker for that quarter.\n\nSo, after 1999, for the northeast quarter, the friend and the co-worker are tenants in common.\n\nFor the remaining three-quarters, the daughter and the friend remain joint tenants.\n\nIn 2008, the daughter defaults on her loan, and the lender sells her interest in the south half to his nephew.\n\nAgain, since they were joint tenants in the whole farm, her interest in the south half is probably her share of that portion.\n\nBut wait, the south half consists of two quarters: the southwest and the southeast.\n\nSo, perhaps her interest in each of those quarters is being sold to the nephew.\n\nBut, considering that in 1999, she already conveyed her interest in the northeast quarter to the co-worker, which severed that portion, leaving the remaining three-quarters still in joint tenancy between her and the friend.\n\nThen, in 2008, her interest in the south half is sold to the nephew.\n\nSo, for the southwest and southeast quarters, her interest is now owned by the nephew.\n\nBut, since she and the friend were joint tenants in those quarters, and her interest is now owned by the nephew, does that mean the nephew and the friend are now tenants in common in those quarters?\n\nWait, joint tenancy requires unity of title, interest, time, and possession. If the nephew acquires the daughter's interest through a forced sale, it likely converts that interest into a tenancy in common between the friend and the nephew for those quarters.\n\nSo, for the southwest and southeast quarters, the friend and the nephew are tenants in common.\n\nWhat about the northwest quarter? The daughter and the friend were joint tenants there until her death in 2009.\n\nBut in 2008, her interest in the south half was sold to the nephew, which includes the southwest and southeast quarters, but not the northwest quarter.\n\nSo, for the northwest quarter, her interest wasn't sold in 2008.\n\nThen, in 2009, the daughter dies intestate, and her husband is her sole surviving heir.\n\nSo, her interest in the northwest quarter now passes to her husband by intestate succession.\n\nTherefore, for the northwest quarter, the friend and the husband are now joint tenants or tenants in common? Wait, originally, it was a joint tenancy between the daughter and the friend. When the daughter dies, her interest passes to her husband, who is not a original joint tenant, so that likely severs the joint tenancy, making the friend and the husband tenants in common for that quarter.\n\nSimilarly, for the northeast quarter, the friend and the co-worker are tenants in common since 1999.\n\nFor the southwest and southeast quarters, the friend and the nephew are tenants in common since 2008.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Northeast quarter: friend and co-worker as tenants in common.\n\n- Northwest quarter: friend and husband as tenants in common.\n\n- Southwest quarter: friend and nephew as tenants in common.\n\n- Southeast quarter: friend and nephew as tenants in common.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The friend and the co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter of the farm; the friend and the husband are tenants in common of the northwest quarter of the farm; and the friend and the nephew are tenants in common of the south half of the farm.\n\nThis seems to match my conclusion.\n\nB. The friend and the co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter of the farm; the friend is the owner in fee of the northwest quarter of the farm; and the friend and the nephew are tenants in common of the south half of the farm.\n\nThis suggests that the friend owns the northwest quarter in fee simple, which isn't correct because the husband has an interest there.\n\nC. The friend and the co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter of the farm; the friend and the husband are tenants in common of the northwest quarter of the farm; and the nephew is the owner in fee of the south half of the farm.\n\nThis says the nephew owns the south half in fee simple, but actually, he shares it with the friend as tenants in common.\n\nD. The friend and the co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter of the farm; and the friend is the owner in fee of the remaining three-quarters of the farm.\n\nThis is incorrect because the friend doesn't own the northwest, southwest, or southeast quarters solely; he shares them with others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
