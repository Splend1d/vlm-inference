                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about NMR spectroscopy. It says that the 1H spectrum of a mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile (AN) has lines with relative intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, respectively. And I need to find the ratio of the two concentrations, [DMSO]:[AN]. The options are 1:1, 1:3, 1:6, and 2:3.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 1H NMR spectrum tells us. The 1H NMR spectrum shows the protons in a molecule and their relative concentrations based on the integrated areas of the peaks. So, the intensity of a peak is proportional to the number of protons giving rise to that peak.\n\nNow, DMSO has the formula (CH3)2SO. So, it has six protons in total, all of which are methyl protons. Acetonitrile has the formula CH3CN, so it has three protons, also methyl protons.\n\nThe problem mentions lines with relative intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1. I think \u03b1 here represents the intensity of one of the peaks, probably the DMSO peak, and 3\u03b1 is the intensity of the AN peak.\n\nWait, but DMSO has six protons per molecule, and AN has three protons per molecule. So, if I have one mole of DMSO, it contributes 6 moles of protons, and one mole of AN contributes 3 moles of protons.\n\nBut in the spectrum, the intensities are \u03b1 for DMSO and 3\u03b1 for AN. So, the ratio of intensities is \u03b1 : 3\u03b1, which simplifies to 1:3.\n\nBut this is the ratio of the peak areas, which corresponds to the ratio of the number of protons from each compound.\n\nWait, but DMSO has six protons per molecule, and AN has three protons per molecule. So, if the peak areas are in the ratio 1:3, that means the number of protons from DMSO to AN is 1:3.\n\nBut since DMSO has six protons per molecule and AN has three protons per molecule, the number of protons from DMSO is 6 times the number of moles of DMSO, and from AN is 3 times the number of moles of AN.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of moles of DMSO as n_DMSO and the number of moles of AN as n_AN.\n\nThe proton contribution from DMSO is 6 * n_DMSO, and from AN is 3 * n_AN.\n\nAccording to the peak areas, the ratio is 1:3, which means:\n\n(6 * n_DMSO) / (3 * n_AN) = 1/3\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(6 n_DMSO)/(3 n_AN) = 1/3\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n(2 n_DMSO)/n_AN = 1/3\n\nThen, multiply both sides by n_AN:\n\n2 n_DMSO = (1/3) n_AN\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 3:\n\n6 n_DMSO = n_AN\n\nSo, n_DMSO / n_AN = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the ratio of concentrations [DMSO]:[AN] is 1:6.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, 1:6 is one of them. But let me double-check if I did this correctly.\n\nStarting again:\n\n- DMSO: (CH3)2SO, 6 protons per molecule.\n\n- AN: CH3CN, 3 protons per molecule.\n\nThe peak areas are \u03b1 for DMSO and 3\u03b1 for AN, so the ratio is \u03b1 : 3\u03b1 = 1:3.\n\nThis means that the proton contribution from DMSO to the total proton count is 1 part, and from AN is 3 parts.\n\nSince DMSO contributes 6 protons per molecule and AN contributes 3 protons per molecule, the proton contributions are:\n\n- DMSO: 6 n_DMSO\n\n- AN: 3 n_AN\n\nThe ratio of their proton contributions is 1:3, so:\n\n6 n_DMSO / 3 n_AN = 1/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 n_DMSO = 1, 3 n_AN = 3\n\nWait, no, that seems wrong. Let's correct that.\n\nActually, setting up the ratio of proton contributions:\n\n(6 n_DMSO) / (3 n_AN) = 1/3\n\nThen, cross-multiplying:\n\n6 n_DMSO * 3 = 3 n_AN * 1\n\n18 n_DMSO = 3 n_AN\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n6 n_DMSO = n_AN\n\nSo, n_DMSO / n_AN = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the ratio [DMSO]:[AN] is 1:6.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to consider the molecular weights or something else. No, since it's about proton counts, and we're dealing with concentrations in terms of moles, this should be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the concentration in terms of molarity or mass percentage, but the problem specifies concentrations in terms of mole fractions or molar concentrations, I suppose.\n\nBut in any case, based on the proton contributions, the ratio should be 1:6.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1:6 is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 1:6\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
