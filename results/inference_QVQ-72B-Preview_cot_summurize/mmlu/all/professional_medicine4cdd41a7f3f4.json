                    "text": "So I'm looking at this case of a 35-year-old man who has sarcoidosis and has been on glucocorticoid therapy for six months. He's coming in for a follow-up and mentions that he's been having leg pain that gets worse when he bears weight on it. Let me think about what could be causing this.\n\nFirst off, sarcoidosis is a disease where there are collections of immune cells, called granulomas, that can affect various parts of the body, including the lungs, skin, eyes, and joints. Since he's been on glucocorticoids, which are steroids used to reduce inflammation, it suggests that his sarcoidosis has been active enough to require medication.\n\nNow, his symptoms are primarily in his legs, specifically pain that increases with weight-bearing. That sounds like it might be related to his hips or lower back, areas that support a lot of weight.\n\nLet's look at the physical exam findings:\n\n- Temperature: 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) \u2013 that's normal.\n\n- Pulse: 78/min \u2013 normal.\n\n- Respirations: 14/min \u2013 normal.\n\n- Blood pressure: 110/70 mm Hg \u2013 normal.\n\n- He's thin and not in acute distress.\n\n- Auscultation of the chest: scattered bilateral basilar crackles \u2013 that could be related to his sarcoidosis affecting his lungs.\n\n- There's mild left hip pain with both active and passive range of motion \u2013 that suggests there might be an issue with the hip joint itself, like inflammation or damage.\n\n- Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact \u2013 that's good, means the blood supply to the feet is okay.\n\n- Neurologic examination is normal \u2013 so no signs of nerve issues causing the pain.\n\nGiven that he's on glucocorticoids, which can have side effects on bones and joints, that might be relevant to his symptoms.\n\nLet's consider the options provided:\n\nA. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\nB. Herniated nucleus pulposus\n\nC. Narrowing of the hip joint\n\nD. Osteoporosis\n\nLet's go through each one.\n\nA. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head: This is when the blood supply to the femoral head (the top part of the thigh bone that fits into the hip socket) is disrupted, leading to bone tissue death. It can cause hip pain that worsens with activity. Risk factors include corticosteroid use, which this patient has been on for six months. So, that seems plausible.\n\nB. Herniated nucleus pulposus: This is when a disc in the spine ruptures and presses on a nerve, often causing back pain that can radiate to the legs. Given that his pain is primarily in the legs and there's no mention of back pain, and his neurologic exam is normal, this seems less likely.\n\nC. Narrowing of the hip joint: This could be due to osteoarthritis, where the cartilage in the joint wears down, leading to pain and stiffness. However, he's only 35, which is young for osteoarthritis, but it's possible. But again, his sarcoidosis and steroid use might be factors.\n\nD. Osteoporosis: This is a condition where bones become weak and brittle, often leading to fractures. Steroids can cause osteoporosis, especially with long-term use. But typically, osteoporosis causes back pain or fractures after minimal trauma, not necessarily leg pain that worsens with weight-bearing.\n\nGiven the patient's history of sarcoidosis and steroid use, avascular necrosis of the femoral head seems like a likely cause for his symptoms. Steroids are a known risk factor for avascular necrosis, and the presentation of hip pain that worsens with activity fits with that diagnosis.\n\nI should also consider if sarcoidosis itself could be affecting the hips directly, but I don't know much about that. Maybe it can cause joint involvement, but again, avascular necrosis seems more likely given the steroid use.\n\nLet me see if there's any other information that could help. The fact that there are crackles in his lungs suggests his sarcoidosis is affecting his lungs, which is common, but that doesn't directly relate to his leg pain.\n\nThe mild left hip pain with both active and passive range of motion suggests that it's not just due to use, but there might be some inflammatory process in the joint. That could be consistent with avascular necrosis, as the body tries to repair the damaged bone.\n\nI don't recall if sarcoidosis can directly cause avascular necrosis, but I know that steroid use is a major risk factor. Since he's been on steroids for six months, that's a significant factor.\n\nLet me think about differential diagnosis again. Could it be a stress fracture? Possibly, but again, steroids can weaken bones, making stress fractures more likely, but I think the pain pattern might be different.\n\nAlso, considering his age, 35, avascular necrosis is more common in people in their 30s and 40s, so it's within the age range.\n\nAnother possibility could be infectious arthritis, but there's no fever or other signs of infection, and the blood pressure is normal.\n\nMaybe a tumor in the hip, but that seems unlikely given his history and the fact that he's on steroids, which might suppress some inflammatory responses.\n\nI think the best answer is A. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
