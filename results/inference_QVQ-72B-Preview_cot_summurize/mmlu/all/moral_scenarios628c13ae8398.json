                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I taught my cat to use the park's sandbox as a litterbox. Hmm, okay, so this involves a pet and a public space. Sandboxes are usually for children to play in, right? So, if I train my cat to poop there, that could be a health hazard for kids and other people who use the sandbox. It's also just gross and inconsiderate to other park-goers. I can't imagine anyone would think that's acceptable behavior.\n\nNow, thinking about moral wrongs, this seems pretty straightforward. It's not just about convenience for me; it's about respecting public spaces and the well-being of others. So, in this case, I would say that teaching my cat to use the sandbox as a litterbox is morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to the second scenario: I followed my brother home from school. This seems different. Following someone could be seen as intrusive or stalking, but in this context, it's my own brother, and we're going home together. Unless there's some background information I don't know, like maybe my brother didn't want me to follow him, but generally, siblings walking home together from school is pretty normal and not usually considered wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Maybe my brother is older and doesn't want me tagging along, or maybe he's being bullied and I'm there to protect him. But the scenario just says I followed my brother home from school, without any additional context. Based on that, it seems like a neutral or even positive action, especially if I'm ensuring his safety.\n\nSo, in this scenario, unless there's something specific that makes it wrong, following my brother home from school doesn't seem like a morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 is wrong, and scenario 2 is not wrong. So, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For instance, perhaps in some cultures or specific situations, following someone home could be seen as intrusive or harmful, but in the general context provided, it seems fine.\n\nAlso, considering the first scenario, teaching a cat to use a sandbox as a litterbox is not just about the cat; it's about the impact on others who use that public space. It's important to consider the consequences of one's actions on others, and in this case, it's clearly negative.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. Scenario 1 is wrong, and scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
