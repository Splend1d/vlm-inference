                    "text": "Okay, so Mr. Gordon had damage to the back of his right frontal lobe, and now he's unable to do something. The options are:\n\nA. understand information he hears\n\nB. understand information he reads\n\nC. speak intelligibly\n\nD. move his left hand\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one makes sense based on what I know about the brain.\n\nFirst, the frontal lobe is generally involved in motor functions, like movement, and also in higher cognitive functions like problem-solving, planning, and personality. The right hemisphere is often associated with spatial abilities, recognition of patterns and faces, and processing music.\n\nBut specifically, the back of the right frontal lobe\u2014where exactly is that? Well, the frontal lobe is at the front of the brain, obviously, but the \"back\" of it might be closer to the temporal lobe or something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of brain regions. The frontal lobe is divided into different areas, like the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and so on.\n\nThe motor cortex is responsible for movement, and it's located towards the rear of the frontal lobe, near the central sulcus, which separates the frontal and parietal lobes.\n\nSo, if Mr. Gordon has damage to the back of his right frontal lobe, that could be near the motor cortex.\n\nNow, the motor cortex controls movement on the opposite side of the body. So, right hemisphere controls the left side, and vice versa.\n\nOption D is \"move his left hand,\" which would be controlled by the right hemisphere. So, that seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is \"understand information he hears.\" That sounds more related to language comprehension, which is typically handled by the temporal lobe, especially the left hemisphere for most people.\n\nOption B is \"understand information he reads.\" That involves visual processing and language comprehension, which again, more related to the temporal and parietal lobes, and likely the left hemisphere for reading comprehension.\n\nOption C is \"speak intelligibly.\" That's related to language production, which is typically managed by the left hemisphere, involving areas like Broca's area in the frontal lobe and Wernicke's area in the temporal lobe.\n\nGiven that the damage is to the right frontal lobe, it's less likely to affect language functions directly, since those are more localized to the left hemisphere in most people.\n\nSo, between the options, D seems the most straightforward choice, as the right frontal lobe controls movement of the left side of the body.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's some crossover or something I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about the connections in the brain. The corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres, allowing communication between them. If the damage is to the right frontal lobe, it might disrupt some of these connections, potentially affecting functions in other areas.\n\nHowever, generally, damage to one hemisphere doesn't directly cause significant language deficits if the language centers are in the other hemisphere.\n\nUnless, of course, there's something unique about Mr. Gordon's brain anatomy or function.\n\nAssuming he's right-handed, which most people are, his language functions are probably localized in the left hemisphere.\n\nTherefore, damage to the right frontal lobe would primarily affect motor functions on the left side of his body, spatial abilities, and possibly some aspects of personality or executive function.\n\nSo, again, option D seems the most directly related to the location of the damage.\n\nBut maybe there's an indirect effect on another function.\n\nFor example, if the damage affects the ability to process visual information for reading, but that seems more related to the occipital and parietal lobes, not the frontal lobe.\n\nSimilarly, understanding spoken language is more associated with the temporal lobe.\n\nSpeech production could be affected if there's bilateral damage or if there's disruption to the connections between the hemispheres, but again, that seems less likely with isolated right frontal lobe damage.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is option D: move his left hand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
