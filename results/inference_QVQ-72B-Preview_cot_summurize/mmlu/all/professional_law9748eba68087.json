A defendant wanted to receive the proceeds from her insurance policy on her home. After a careful examination of her policy, she decided that the best way for her to collect would be to stage a cooking accident in her own home and have the structure bum down. She decided that bacon would be the best way to do it because all of the extra grease in the pan could easily catch on fire. After cooking the bacon, the defendant left the flame on and left her home. Unbeknownst to the defendant, she left the window open and a breeze blew out the pilot. When the defendant returned home, she found that there was no fire. She was arrested and charged with attempted arson.\nB. A defendant was dancing with his girlfriend at a local club when she collapsed in his arms. The defendant then carried his girlfriend to his car and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Although the defendant believed that his girlfriend was intoxicated, she had, in fact, died of a heart attack while dancing. The defendant is charged with attempted rape.\nC. After a preliminary examination, a defendant informed a patient that she was two months pregnant. Although the defendant knew that abortions were illegal in this jurisdiction, he agreed to perform an abortion on the patient, anyway. During the operation, it was discovered that the patient was not pregnant. The defendant is charged with attempt to perform an illegal abortion.\nD. A defendant called his friend to obtain some marijuana. The friend told the defendant that he had some for sale. Believing that his friend had some high-quality marijuana, the defendant purchased an ounce of the substance, which he did not know was actually oregano. While the defendant was smoking the oregano on the street corner, a police officer arrested him and charged him with attempted illegal use of a controlled substance.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this question about when a defendant wouldn't be guilty of an attempted crime under common law. There are four scenarios here, and I need to pick which one doesn't amount to an attempt. Let me think through each one carefully.\n\nFirst, there's scenario A about the woman who wants to collect on her insurance by staging a cooking accident to burn down her house. She leaves the bacon cooking, expects it to catch fire, but the pilot light gets blown out by a breeze, so no fire happens. She's arrested for attempted arson. Now, for attempt crimes, generally, there needs to be both intent and some act towards committing the crime, but the crime itself isn't completed. Here, she had the intent to burn the house down and took steps towards it by leaving the bacon cooking. But the fire didn't happen because of the pilot going out. So, it seems like she took a substantial step towards committing the crime but was prevented by circumstances beyond her control. In common law, that's typically considered an attempt. So, probably not the answer.\n\nNext, scenario B: a man is dancing with his girlfriend at a club, she collapses, he thinks she's intoxicated, but she's actually dead from a heart attack. He has sex with her, thinking she's drunk, and now he's charged with attempted rape. Hmm, interesting. Rape is sexual intercourse without consent, and if she's dead, she can't consent. But in this case, he thought she was intoxicated, which might be relevant to his intent. However, since she's dead, there's no actual rape because you can't rape a corpse in the legal sense. So, is this attempted rape? Well, attempted rape would require that he intended to have sex without consent, which he did, thinking she was drunk and couldn't consent. But since she was already dead, maybe there's an argument that it's not an attempt because the act was completed\u2014 he had sex with her\u2014 even if it wasn't actually rape because she was dead. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nMoving on to scenario C: a doctor tells a patient she's two months pregnant and agrees to perform an abortion, not knowing that abortions are illegal in that jurisdiction. During the operation, they find out she's not pregnant. He's charged with attempting to perform an illegal abortion. So, here, the doctor intended to perform an abortion, which is illegal, but it turns out the patient wasn't pregnant. So, he took steps towards performing the abortion, but since she wasn't pregnant, no actual abortion could occur. In common law, if the attempted act is impossible to complete because of a factual mistake (like thinking she was pregnant when she wasn't), that's called impossibility, which can be a defense to attempt. So, maybe in this case, the doctor wouldn't be guilty of attempted illegal abortion because it was factually impossible to perform an abortion since she wasn't pregnant. That sounds promising as a possible answer.\n\nLastly, scenario D: a man buys what he thinks is marijuana from his friend, but it's actually oregano. He's smoking it on the street and gets arrested for attempted illegal use of a controlled substance. So, he intended to buy and use marijuana, which is a controlled substance, but it turned out to be oregano. Here, again, it's a case of him intending to commit a crime, but due to a factual mistake, the substance wasn't actually illegal. In common law, when someone intends to commit a crime but the object of their intent isn't actually criminal, that's often considered impossibility, which can negate the attempt. So, similar to scenario C, but with drugs instead of abortion.\n\nNow, comparing these scenarios:\n\n- In A, the attempt was foiled by an external factor (the pilot going out), which is typically not a defense to attempt.\n\n- In B, it's complicated because the act was completed, but it wasn't actually rape due to the victim's death.\n\n- In C, the doctor couldn't complete the abortion because the patient wasn't pregnant, which is a factual impossibility.\n\n- In D, the substance wasn't actually marijuana, another factual impossibility.\n\nI think the key here is understanding when an attempt fails because the desired result is factually impossible to achieve due to unknown circumstances. In scenario C and D, the defendants intended to commit a crime but couldn't because of a factual mistake: the patient wasn't pregnant, or the substance wasn't marijuana.\n\nBut between C and D, which one is the correct answer? Maybe I need to think about which one would not be guilty of the attempted crime at common law.\n\nIn scenario C, the doctor intended to perform an abortion, which is illegal, but couldn't because there was no pregnancy. In some jurisdictions, this could be seen as an attempt to perform an illegal abortion, even if the abortion couldn't be performed. However, in common law, if the impossibility is due to a factual mistake unknown to the defendant, it might negate the attempt.\n\nIn scenario D, the man intended to use a controlled substance but it was oregano. Again, his mistake was factual\u2014he didn't know it wasn't marijuana. So, similar to scenario C.\n\nPerhaps both C and D could be considered cases where the attempt fails due to impossibility, and thus the defendants might not be guilty of the attempted crime.\n\nBut the question asks for the situation where the defendant would NOT be guilty of the attempted crime at common law. So, maybe both C and D are possibilities.\n\nWait, but the question is to choose one option. Maybe I need to see which one is more clearly not guilty.\n\nLet me consider scenario C again: the doctor performs a procedure believing it's an abortion but it's not because the patient isn't pregnant. He's charged with attempting to perform an illegal abortion.\n\nIn common law, attempts require that the defendant took a substantial step towards committing the crime with the specific intent to commit it. Here, the doctor did take a substantial step (starting the procedure), and he had the intent to perform an abortion.\n\nHowever, since there was no pregnancy, the abortion couldn't have been completed. This is a case of factual impossibility.\n\nIn common law, factual impossibility is generally not a defense to attempt, meaning that the defendant can still be convicted of attempt even if the crime was factually impossible to complete.\n\nWait, I thought that in some cases, factual impossibility can be a defense, but it seems that in many jurisdictions, especially in common law, factual impossibility isn't a defense to attempt.\n\nSimilarly, in scenario D, the man intended to use a controlled substance but it was oregano. Again, this is factual impossibility.\n\nBut perhaps in scenario C, since the doctor actually started the procedure, it's closer to completion, and thus more likely to be considered an attempt.\n\nWhereas in scenario D, he just possessed oregano, thinking it was marijuana, but didn't actually use it yet. He was arrested while smoking it, but it's not clear if he had started smoking it or was just in possession.\n\nMaybe in scenario D, since he didn't actually use the substance, his attempt was less substantial, and he might not be guilty of attempted use of a controlled substance.\n\nIn contrast, in scenario C, the doctor had already started the procedure, which is a more substantial step towards completing the crime.\n\nSo, perhaps in scenario C, it's more likely that he would be guilty of attempted illegal abortion, whereas in scenario D, since he hadn't actually used the substance yet, he might not be guilty of attempted illegal use.\n\nBut the question is to identify which situation the defendant would NOT be guilty of the attempted crime.\n\nSo, if scenario C is more likely to be considered an attempt, and scenario D less so, then scenario D might be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the law views the possession and intended use as sufficient for an attempt charge in scenario D.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nLet me consider the principle of impossibility in attempt crimes.\n\nThere are two types of impossibility: factual and legal.\n\nFactual impossibility occurs when the defendant intends to commit a crime but is unable to do so because of a factual error.\n\nLegal impossibility occurs when the intended act isn't actually a crime.\n\nIn common law, legal impossibility is a defense to attempt, but factual impossibility generally isn't.\n\nSo, in scenario C, the doctor intended to perform an illegal abortion, which is a crime, but it was factually impossible because there was no pregnancy. That would be factual impossibility, which doesn't negate the attempt.\n\nSimilarly, in scenario D, the man intended to use a controlled substance, which is a crime, but it was factually impossible because it was oregano.\n\nSo, both C and D involve factual impossibility, which shouldn't affect the attempt charge.\n\nBut the question is to find the situation where the defendant would NOT be guilty of the attempted crime.\n\nSo, perhaps neither C nor D is the correct answer, or maybe one of them has a distinguishing feature that makes the attempt charge less likely.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider another angle.\n\nLooking back at scenario B: the man has sex with his girlfriend, thinking she's intoxicated but she's actually dead. He's charged with attempted rape.\n\nIn this case, rape requires lack of consent, and if she's dead, she can't consent. So, technically, having sex with a corpse without consent is not rape because rape requires a living person capable of consenting or not.\n\nBut attempted rape would require that he intended to have sex without consent, which he did, thinking she was drunk.\n\nHowever, since she was already dead, his act of having sex with her wasn't actually rape, because she couldn't consent due to death.\n\nSo, perhaps in this case, because the crime of rape requires a living person, and she was dead, his act couldn't constitute rape or attempted rape.\n\nWait, but attempted rape would require that he intended to have sex without consent, which he did, thinking she was drunk.\n\nBut since she was dead, maybe the law doesn't recognize attempted rape in this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the law views it as completed rape, but given that she was dead, it might not fit the definition.\n\nThis is complicated. Maybe in this situation, he wouldn't be guilty of attempted rape because the crime of rape requires a living victim capable of consenting, and she was already dead.\n\nWhereas in scenario C and D, the impossibility is more about the object of the crime not existing or not being what it seemed.\n\nSo, perhaps scenario B is the one where the defendant wouldn't be guilty of the attempted crime because the required elements of the crime weren't present due to the victim's death.\n\nIn contrast, in scenario C and D, the defendants intended to commit crimes that were impossible to complete due to factual mistakes about the objects involved.\n\nSo, maybe scenario B is the correct answer because the defendant's act didn't meet the elements needed for attempted rape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the law would still consider it attempted rape because he intended to have sex without consent, even if the victim was dead.\n\nBut given that rape requires a living person capable of consenting, and she was dead, maybe the attempt fails because the crime itself can't be completed with a dead person.\n\nSo, perhaps in this case, he wouldn't be guilty of attempted rape.\n\nTherefore, scenario B is the correct answer.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it again:\n\n- Scenario A: attempted arson foiled by pilot going out\u2014typically an attempt.\n\n- Scenario B: attempted rape of an intoxicated person who is actually dead\u2014may not qualify as attempted rape because rape requires a living victim capable of consenting.\n\n- Scenario C: attempted illegal abortion that couldn't be completed because no pregnancy\u2014factual impossibility doesn't negate attempt.\n\n- Scenario D: attempted use of a controlled substance that turned out to be oregano\u2014same principle as scenario C.\n\nTherefore, scenario B is the one where the defendant would NOT be guilty of the attempted crime at common law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
