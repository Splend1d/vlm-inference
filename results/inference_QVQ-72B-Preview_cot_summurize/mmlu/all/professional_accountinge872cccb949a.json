                    "text": "So I've got this question here about financial reporting, specifically about where to report a payable from Strut Co. to its parent company, Plane Co. The options are whether this payable should be reported separately in Strut's balance sheet, Plane's balance sheet, or the consolidated balance sheet. There are four options, each combining \"Yes\" or \"No\" for Strut's and Plane's balance sheets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a payable is. A payable is essentially money that one company owes to another. In this case, Strut Co. owes money to its parent company, Plane Co. So, from Strut's perspective, it's a liability, something they have to pay. For Plane Co., it's an asset because someone owes them money.\n\nNow, the question is about where this payable should be reported separately. \"Separately\" probably means explicitly listed or disclosed in the balance sheet.\n\nLet's consider Strut's balance sheet first. Since it's a liability for Strut, it should be reported on their balance sheet. But wait, is it always reported separately? Maybe not if it's immaterial or if it's part of a larger category. But generally, significant payables should be disclosed separately.\n\nFor Plane Co., this is an asset, specifically a receivable from Strut Co. So, similarly, it should be reported on Plane Co.'s balance sheet as a receivable.\n\nHowever, when we prepare a consolidated balance sheet, which combines the financial statements of both companies as if they were a single entity, things change. In consolidation, intercompany transactions\u2014that is, transactions between the parent and subsidiary\u2014are eliminated to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, in the consolidated balance sheet, this payable between Strut and Plane would be eliminated because it's an internal transaction within the same entity.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes Yes \u2013 meaning report separately in both Strut's and Plane's balance sheets, but not in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nWait, but the consolidated balance sheet is also mentioned, and option A seems to suggest reporting it separately in both individual balance sheets but not in the consolidated one.\n\nOption B. Yes No \u2013 report separately in Strut's balance sheet but not in Plane's.\n\nThat doesn't make sense because for Plane, it's a receivable, which should be reported on their balance sheet.\n\nOption C. No Yes \u2013 don't report in Strut's but report in Plane's.\n\nAgain, that doesn't seem right because Strut has a liability that should be reported.\n\nOption D. No No \u2013 don't report in either individual balance sheet.\n\nThat can't be correct because both companies are affected by this transaction.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking whether to report it separately in the individual balance sheets of Strut and Plane, and in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nGiven that, in individual balance sheets, both Strut and Plane should report it separately (Strut as a payable and Plane as a receivable), but in the consolidated balance sheet, it should be eliminated and not reported separately.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is option A: Yes Yes, meaning report it separately in both Strut's and Plane's balance sheets, but not in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is only asking about the individual balance sheets of Strut and Plane, and the consolidated balance sheet is just there to confuse.\n\nBut no, the question says \"in which of the following balance sheets should this payable be reported separately? Strut's Plane's consolidated balance sheet balance sheet\"\n\nSo, it's likely asking about Strut's and Plane's individual balance sheets, and the consolidated one.\n\nGiven that, in Strut's balance sheet, it should be reported as a payable.\n\nIn Plane's balance sheet, it should be reported as a receivable.\n\nIn the consolidated balance sheet, it should be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A: Yes Yes, meaning report it separately in both Strut's and Plane's balance sheets, but not in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nWait, but option A says \"Yes Yes,\" which would imply reporting it separately in both Strut's and Plane's balance sheets, but the question also mentions the consolidated balance sheet. Maybe the \"Yes Yes\" refers to Strut's and Plane's balance sheets, and the consolidated balance sheet is separate.\n\nLet me read the question again carefully:\n\n\"Strut Co. has a payable to its parent Plane Co. In which of the following balance sheets should this payable be reported separately? Strut's Plane's consolidated balance sheet balance sheet\"\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No Yes\n\nD. No No\n\nIt seems like the first \"Yes\" or \"No\" is for Strut's balance sheet, the second for Plane's balance sheet, and then there's a mention of the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nBut perhaps the format is confusing. Maybe the \"Yes Yes\" in option A refers to Strut's and Plane's balance sheets both reporting it separately, and the consolidated balance sheet doesn't report it separately because it's eliminated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Yes Yes\" means both Strut's and Plane's balance sheets should report it separately, and the consolidated balance sheet shouldn't.\n\nGiven that, I think option A is the correct choice: report it separately in both Strut's and Plane's balance sheets, but not in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nOption B: Yes No \u2013 report it separately in Strut's balance sheet but not in Plane's. That doesn't make sense because Plane has a corresponding receivable that should be reported.\n\nOption C: No Yes \u2013 don't report in Strut's but report in Plane's. Also doesn't make sense for the same reason.\n\nOption D: No No \u2013 don't report in either individual balance sheet. That's incorrect because both companies are affected by this payable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A: Yes Yes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
