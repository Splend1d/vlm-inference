                    "text": "So I have this question here about eye diseases. It's asking which disease causes a buildup of fluid pressure in the eyeball and damages the optic nerve at the back of the eye. The options are astigmatism, cataract, glaucoma, and retinitis. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these conditions is.\n\nFirst, astigmatism. I think it's related to the shape of the cornea or the lens in the eye. It causes blurred vision because the eye can't focus light correctly. But I don't remember it being about fluid pressure in the eye. So, probably not that one.\n\nNext, cataract. I know that a cataract is when the lens in the eye becomes cloudy, which can lead to vision loss. It's usually associated with aging. Again, doesn't sound like it involves fluid pressure in the eye.\n\nThen there's glaucoma. I've heard of this one before. I think it's related to high pressure inside the eye, which can damage the optic nerve. Yeah, that sounds promising. But let me make sure.\n\nLastly, retinitis. I believe this is an inflammation of the retina, which is the layer at the back of the eye that senses light. It can cause vision problems, but again, not sure about fluid pressure.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Astigmatism: issue with cornea or lens shape, causes blurred vision.\n\n- Cataract: cloudy lens, leads to vision loss.\n\n- Glaucoma: high fluid pressure in the eye, damages optic nerve.\n\n- Retinitis: inflammation of the retina, affects vision.\n\nGiven this, glaucoma seems to be the one that involves a buildup of fluid pressure in the eyeball and damages the optic nerve.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check this to be absolutely sure. Maybe think about the mechanisms involved.\n\nIn glaucoma, the drainage of fluid from the eye is blocked, which causes the fluid to build up and increase the pressure inside the eye. This increased pressure can damage the optic nerve, which is crucial for vision. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to blindness.\n\nAstigmatism, on the other hand, is a refractive error due to an irregularly shaped cornea or lens, leading to distorted vision.\n\nA cataract is when the clear lens of the eye becomes opaque, clouding vision.\n\nRetinitis is inflammation of the retina, which can be caused by various conditions and affects vision differently.\n\nTherefore, based on this, glaucoma is the condition that fits the description provided in the question.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of another answer. For example, could there be a type of retinitis that causes fluid pressure to build up in the eye? Well, some retinal diseases might involve fluid accumulation, but that's typically localized to the retina and may not necessarily involve increased intraocular pressure that affects the optic nerve in the same way glaucoma does.\n\nAlso, could cataracts be related to fluid pressure? While cataracts can sometimes be associated with glaucoma, they are distinct conditions. Cataracts involve the lens, whereas glaucoma involves the optic nerve and intraocular pressure.\n\nAstigmatism is clearly a different issue, related to the curvature of the cornea or lens, and doesn't involve fluid pressure.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that the correct answer is glaucoma.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. glaucoma}} \\]"
