Prior to her father's death, the woman had already taken over the operations on the father's farm due to his declining health. Recently, the woman had granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. Their agreement stipulated that the coal company would pay the woman a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted. In addition, the coal company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace top soil on the surface of the land. After the coal company commenced its strip-mining operations, the woman noticed that the company was not filling in the excavated area as previously agreed. However, because the company paid the woman all the coal royalties from the strip mining, she did not voice any objection regarding its failure to replace the top soil. Two years later, the coal company had now completed its strip-mining operation under its arrangement with the woman.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what kind of property interest the coal company has with regards to strip-mining coal from the woman's farm. The options are a profit-a-prendre, a license, an easement in gross, or voluntary waste. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Profit-a-prendre**: From what I recall, this is a type of property interest that gives someone the right to take something from another's land, like minerals or wood, for their own use or benefit.\n\n2. **License**: This is generally a personal right to use land of another for a specific purpose, but it's not a property interest in the land itself. It's more like a permission that can be revoked.\n\n3. **Easement in gross**: This is a non-possessory interest in land that allows someone who isn't the owner to use the land for a specific purpose. Unlike a license, it's a more formal and lasting right.\n\n4. **Voluntary waste**: This term seems out of place here. It refers to the intentional destruction or damage of property by the tenant, which doesn't seem to fit the context of mining coal.\n\nGiven that, I can probably eliminate \"voluntary waste\" right away because it doesn't relate to a right to mine coal; it's more about causing damage to the property.\n\nNow, between a profit-a-prendre, a license, and an easement in gross, I need to see which one fits best.\n\nLet's consider the details of the scenario:\n\n- The woman inherited the farm from her father.\n\n- She allowed a coal company to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm.\n\n- The agreement included paying a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted.\n\n- The coal company also agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace topsoil.\n\n- The company didn't fill in the area as agreed, but since they paid the royalties, the woman didn't object.\n\n- After two years, the strip-mining operation is completed.\n\nFrom this, it's clear that the coal company has a right to extract coal from the land in exchange for royalties. This sounds like a right to take something valuable from the land, which aligns with the definition of a profit-a-prendre.\n\nHowever, I should consider if it could be an easement in gross or a license.\n\nAn easement in gross typically allows someone to use another's land for a specific purpose, but it's usually for access or utility lines, not for extracting minerals. So, while it's possible, it seems less likely in this context.\n\nA license might be a possibility, but it's generally a more informal arrangement and can be revoked more easily. Given that there's a formal agreement with royalties and restoration obligations, it seems like a more formal arrangement than a simple license.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate classification seems to be a profit-a-prendre.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure. I remember that in some jurisdictions, a profit-a-prendre can be appurtenant, meaning it's tied to the land, or in gross, meaning it's personal to the holder. In this case, since the coal company is extracting coal for its own benefit, not for the benefit of another piece of land, it's probably a profit in gross.\n\nBut the question is asking for the type of right, and among the options, profit-a-prendre is listed separately from easement in gross, so I think they're distinct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of it being an easement in gross.\n\nAn easement in gross typically involves a right to use another's land for a specific purpose, but extracting minerals is more akin to taking something from the land rather than using it. So, while there might be some overlap, a profit-a-prendre is specifically about taking resources, which fits the situation better.\n\nAlso, licenses are generally revocable permissions, and given that there's a contractual agreement with financial terms and restoration obligations, it seems more binding than a typical license.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A. profit-a-prendre.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
