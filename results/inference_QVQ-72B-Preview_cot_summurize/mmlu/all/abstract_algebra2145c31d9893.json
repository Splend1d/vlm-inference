                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. So, statement 1 says that for n greater than 1, the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n. Hmm, I need to recall what makes a set a group under a particular operation. A group needs to satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.\n\nFirst, let's consider closure. Does multiplying any two elements in the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} modulo n always give a result that's still in the set? Well, if we take n = 4, for example, the set is {1, 2, 3}. Multiply 2 and 2 modulo 4, and you get 0, which isn't in the set. So, closure fails there. Wait, but maybe there's a condition on n being prime or something? I think I remember that for multiplication modulo n to form a group, n has to be prime. Let me check that.\n\nIf n is prime, say n = 5, the set is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Multiply any two, like 2*3 = 6, and 6 mod 5 is 1, which is in the set. Seems okay. But for n = 6, set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, which is 0 mod 6, not in the set. So, it seems like the statement is false unless n is prime. But the statement doesn't specify that n is prime, so I think it's generally false.\n\nWait, but maybe there are other conditions where it could be true even if n isn't prime. Let me think. For multiplication modulo n to form a group, the elements must be units in the ring of integers modulo n, which means their greatest common divisor with n is 1. So, if we take only elements coprime to n, then the set forms a group under multiplication modulo n. But the set given is {1, 2, ..., n-1}, which includes all integers less than n, regardless of whether they're coprime to n. So, unless n is such that all these numbers are coprime to n (which only happens when n is prime), the set isn't closed under multiplication modulo n.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false in general. So, options A and C are out.\n\nNow, statement 2: there is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. Okay, so I need to solve the congruence 63x \u2261 1 mod 100. This is equivalent to finding the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100. To find x, I can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers x and y such that 63x + 100y = 1. If such x and y exist, then x is the inverse of 63 modulo 100.\n\nLet's apply the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\nStart with 100 = 1*63 + 37\n\nThen, 63 = 1*37 + 26\n\n37 = 1*26 + 11\n\n26 = 2*11 + 4\n\n11 = 2*4 + 3\n\n4 = 1*3 + 1\n\n3 = 3*1 + 0\n\nSo, the gcd is 1, which is good because it means an inverse exists.\n\nNow, back-substitute to express 1 as a combination of 63 and 100.\n\nFrom the last but one equation: 4 = 11 - 2*3\n\nBut 3 = 11 - 2*4, so substitute back:\n\n4 = 11 - 2*(11 - 2*4) = 11 - 2*11 + 4*4 = -1*11 + 4*4\n\nBut 4 = 26 - 2*11, so:\n\n4 = -1*11 + 4*(26 - 2*11) = -1*11 + 4*26 - 8*11 = 4*26 - 9*11\n\nSimilarly, 11 = 26 - 2*11, so:\n\n11 = 26 - 2*11 \u2192 but this seems messy. Maybe I should start from the beginning again.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since 63 and 100 are coprime, there exists an inverse.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 63^\u03c6(100) mod 100, where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. \u03c6(100) = \u03c6(4)*\u03c6(25) = 2*20 = 40, so 63^40 \u2261 1 mod 100.\n\nBut that's not the inverse; that's just that 63^40 is congruent to 1 mod 100. To find the inverse, I need a smaller exponent.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the extended Euclidean algorithm more carefully.\n\nStarting from 100 = 1*63 + 37\n\n63 = 1*37 + 26\n\n37 = 1*26 + 11\n\n26 = 2*11 + 4\n\n11 = 2*4 + 3\n\n4 = 1*3 + 1\n\n3 = 3*1 + 0\n\nNow, back-substitute to express 1 as a combination of 63 and 100.\n\nFrom the last equation: 1 = 4 - 1*3\n\nBut 3 = 11 - 2*4, so substitute:\n\n1 = 4 - 1*(11 - 2*4) = 4 - 11 + 2*4 = 3*4 - 11\n\nNow, 4 = 26 - 2*11, so:\n\n1 = 3*(26 - 2*11) - 11 = 3*26 - 6*11 - 11 = 3*26 - 7*11\n\nNow, 11 = 37 - 1*26, so:\n\n1 = 3*26 - 7*(37 - 1*26) = 3*26 - 7*37 + 7*26 = 10*26 - 7*37\n\nNow, 26 = 63 - 1*37, so:\n\n1 = 10*(63 - 1*37) - 7*37 = 10*63 - 10*37 - 7*37 = 10*63 - 17*37\n\nNow, 37 = 100 - 1*63, so:\n\n1 = 10*63 - 17*(100 - 1*63) = 10*63 - 17*100 + 17*63 = 27*63 - 17*100\n\nSo, 27*63 - 17*100 = 1\n\nTherefore, 27*63 \u2261 1 mod 100\n\nSo, x = 27 is the inverse of 63 modulo 100.\n\nThus, there does exist an integer x such that 63x \u2261 1 mod 100, specifically x = 27.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, combining the two statements: statement 1 is false, and statement 2 is true.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
