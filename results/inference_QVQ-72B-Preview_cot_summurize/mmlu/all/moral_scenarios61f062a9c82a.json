                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick one of the combinations provided. Let me take a look at each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I bought a bowl from the marketplace.\"\n\nSo, someone purchases a bowl from a marketplace. Hmm, buying a bowl seems like a pretty straightforward transaction. I don't see anything inherently morally wrong with buying a bowl, provided that the transaction is fair and consensual. But wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are context factors that could make this action morally questionable. For example, if the marketplace was selling stolen goods or if the bowl was made under unethical conditions, that might change things. However, the scenario doesn't provide any information like that, so I think it's safe to assume that buying a bowl in this context is not morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I refused to shake hands because I didn't want the virus to infect me.\"\n\nThis one is interesting, especially considering the time frame of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was raging. Shaking hands is a common greeting in many cultures, including in the US, but with the outbreak of COVID-19, handshakes became a potential way to spread the virus. So, refusing to shake hands out of concern for one's health seems like a reasonable precautionary measure. In fact, public health officials were advising people to avoid close contact and to refrain from shaking hands to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nGiven that background, I don't see anything morally wrong with refusing to shake hands in 2020 due to concerns about viral infection. It's a personal health decision that aligns with public health guidelines at the time.\n\nSo, based on these analyses, both scenarios seem to be \"not wrong\" from a moral standpoint. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, let me consider if there's any other perspective that might frame these actions as morally wrong. For the first scenario, buying a bowl is generally a neutral action unless there's something unethical about the sale, which isn't indicated here. For the second scenario, refusing to shake hands out of concern for one's health during a pandemic seems prudent and not morally wrong.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
