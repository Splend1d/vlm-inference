                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand what \"jus cogens\" means. It sounds like a term from international law, and I think it's important. Let me see, the question gives four options, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nOption A says that jus cogens are peremptory norms of international law, from which no derogations are allowed and which can never be altered even with the consent of the States. Hmm, that sounds pretty strong. Peremptory means that these norms are non-negotiable, like you can't opt-out of them, and they can't be changed just because states agree to something else. So, they're kind of like the fundamental principles that everyone has to follow, no exceptions.\n\nOption B says they are rules of international law that are laid down in multilateral treaties with wide participation. Well, many international rules are in treaties, so that seems broad. But jus cogens seems more specific than just any multilateral treaty. Maybe not the right answer.\n\nOption C mentions decisions of the UN Security Council. While the Security Council does make important decisions that can be binding, I don't think they define jus cogens. Jus cogens seems more about universal principles accepted by all states, not specific decisions by one organization. Probably not this one.\n\nOption D says they are the rules of international law on which the ICJ founds its decisions. The ICJ is the International Court of Justice, which interprets international law. While their decisions are based on international law, jus cogens is about the highest level of norms that are universally accepted and can't be overridden. So, the ICJ would base its decisions on jus cogens, but jus cogens isn't defined by the ICJ's decisions.\n\nLet me think again. Jus cogens is a Latin term, and I recall that in international law, it refers to certain norms that are so fundamental that they can't be violated or waived, even by agreement between states. So, they're like the untouchable principles.\n\nLooking back at option A, that seems to match my understanding. Peremptory norms, no derogations allowed, and they can't be altered even with state consent. That sounds right.\n\nOption B is about multilateral treaties, but not all multilateral treaties contain jus cogens norms. Some treaties might include optional protocols or things that states can opt-in or opt-out of, which doesn't fit the idea of jus cogens.\n\nOption C is about UN Security Council decisions, which are separate from the body of international law that constitutes jus cogens. While Security Council resolutions can be binding, they're more about specific situations or actions required from member states, not the overarching principles that jus cogens represents.\n\nOption D refers to the ICJ's decisions, but the court interprets existing international law; it doesn't create the fundamental norms. So, again, jus cogens would be part of the law that the ICJ applies, not something defined by its decisions.\n\nI think the best answer is option A. Jus cogens are peremptory norms of international law, meaning they're mandatory and can't be disregarded or modified by state agreement. They're the bedrock principles that everyone must follow, no exceptions.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check. Some examples of jus cogens norms include prohibitions against slavery, genocide, and aggression. These are considered such grave violations that no state can consent to them or agree to exempt themselves from these rules.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option A is the correct definition of jus cogens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
