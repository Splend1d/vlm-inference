                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this auditing question. It's about selecting an appropriate sample for a substantive test, and it asks under which condition an auditor would most likely stratify the population. The options are:\n\nA. Auditor suspects that management fraud has occurred during the year.\n\nB. Desired assessed level of control risk is less than the prior year.\n\nC. Technique to be used is attribute sampling.\n\nD. Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what stratification means in auditing. Stratification is when an auditor divides the population into distinct subpopulations, or strata, based on certain characteristics. This can help in tailoring the audit approach to different segments of the population, potentially making the sampling more efficient or effective.\n\nNow, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Auditor suspects that management fraud has occurred during the year.\n\nIf the auditor suspects management fraud, that might influence the audit approach, but I'm not sure if stratification directly relates to fraud suspicion. Maybe the auditor would look for specific areas where fraud could occur, but I don't see an immediate connection to stratifying the population based solely on fraud suspicion.\n\nOption B: Desired assessed level of control risk is less than the prior year.\n\nAssessed level of control risk relates to the auditor's evaluation of how well the client's internal controls are preventing or detecting material misstatements. If the desired assessed level of control risk is lower than the previous year, that might indicate that the auditor has more confidence in the controls. But again, I'm not sure how this directly relates to stratifying the population for substantive testing.\n\nOption C: Technique to be used is attribute sampling.\n\nAttribute sampling is a method used to test controls, where the auditor is testing whether controls are operating effectively. Stratification might be useful in attribute sampling if certain strata have different expected rates of deviation. However, substantive testing typically involves variable sampling, like mean-per-unit or difference estimation, where stratification is more commonly used to improve precision.\n\nOption D: Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.\n\nThis seems plausible. In substantive testing, especially when testing accounts with large dollar amounts, auditors often stratify the population to give more emphasis to larger items because they pose a higher risk of material misstatement. This approach ensures that the audit focuses on areas that could have a significant impact on the financial statements.\n\nLet me think about this some more. If an auditor wants to give greater representation to large recorded amounts, stratifying the population would allow them to separately sample and test these larger items. This could be done by creating a stratum for amounts above a certain threshold and perhaps another stratum for smaller amounts.\n\nFor example, in testing accounts receivable, the auditor might separate the population into two strata: one for accounts above a significant value, say $100,000, and another for accounts below that amount. The auditor would then sample more extensively from the first stratum because those accounts are more likely to contain material misstatements.\n\nThis makes sense because substantive tests are designed to detect material misstatements, and larger accounts are more likely to contribute to such misstatements if they are misstated.\n\nGoing back to the options, option D seems to directly relate to why an auditor would stratify a population\u2014to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Suspecting management fraud might lead to different audit procedures, but not necessarily stratification of the population for substantive testing.\n\nOption B: A lower assessed level of control risk might lead to performing fewer substantive tests, but again, not directly related to stratifying the population.\n\nOption C: Attribute sampling is used for testing controls, while substantive testing typically involves variable sampling. Stratification can be used in both, but the question specifies substantive testing, which is usually associated with variable sampling.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer. Stratifying the population allows the auditor to give greater representation to large recorded amounts, which are of particular interest in substantive testing due to their potential impact on the financial statements.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other reason why stratification might be preferred in substantive testing.\n\nStratification can help in:\n\n- Increasing the efficiency of the sampling plan by reducing the variability within each stratum.\n\n- Allowing the auditor to apply different sampling rates to different strata based on risk assessments.\n\n- Ensuring that important subsets of the population are adequately represented in the sample.\n\nIn the context of substantive testing, where detecting material misstatements is key, stratifying to focus on larger accounts aligns well with these objectives.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
