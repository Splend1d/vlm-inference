                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about how issuing additional capital stock for cash affects certain financial measures. The options are about total debt to total assets and working capital. I need to figure out which one correctly describes the changes after the company issues more stock in exchange for cash.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens when a company issues additional capital stock for cash. Essentially, the company is selling more shares to investors and receiving cash in return. So, the company's equity should increase because more capital is coming in from new shareholders or existing ones buying more shares.\n\nNow, let's think about the total debt to total assets ratio. This ratio is a measure of leverage and shows how much of the company's assets are financed by debt. It's calculated as total liabilities divided by total assets. When the company issues stock for cash, the cash received increases total assets, and since it's equity financing, total liabilities remain the same unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, if total assets increase and total liabilities stay the same, the debt to assets ratio should decrease because the denominator (total assets) is larger, while the numerator (total debt) remains unchanged. That means option C or D could be possible, depending on the effect on working capital.\n\nNext, I need to consider working capital. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. It measures the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.\n\nWhen the company issues stock for cash, it receives cash, which is a current asset. Assuming the cash is not immediately used to pay off liabilities or other purposes, current assets should increase. Current liabilities might or might not change, but typically, issuing stock doesn't directly increase current liabilities.\n\nIf current assets increase more than current liabilities (or if liabilities don't change), working capital should increase. So, combining this with the earlier conclusion that debt to assets ratio decreases, the correct choice seems to be option C: decrease in debt to assets ratio and increase in working capital.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. Issuing stock for cash increases equity and total assets, while keeping total debt constant. Therefore, debt to assets ratio decreases. The cash received increases current assets, which likely increases working capital, unless the cash is used to pay off current liabilities, but the question doesn't indicate that.\n\nWait a minute, what if the company uses the cash from issuing stock to pay off some current liabilities? That could affect working capital differently. But the question says the company issued additional capital stock for cash, without specifying any further actions. So, assuming no other transactions, the cash received should increase current assets, thereby increasing working capital.\n\nAnother angle: if the company issues stock and receives cash, that cash increases current assets. Unless the company simultaneously takes on more current liabilities, which isn't mentioned, working capital should increase.\n\nSo, my final answer is option C: decrease in total debt to total assets ratio and increase in working capital.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
