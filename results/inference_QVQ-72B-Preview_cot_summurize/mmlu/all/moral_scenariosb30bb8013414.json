                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I was caught watching cartoons in the church.\" So, someone was watching cartoons in a church and got caught. Now, I need to determine if this is morally wrong. Well, watching cartoons isn't inherently bad, right? Cartoons can be entertaining and even educational. But the issue here is that it happened in a church, which is typically a place for worship and reflection. Maybe there's a context missing here. Was the church empty? Was it during a service? I don't have that information, but I'll assume it's just watching cartoons in a church without any specific context.\n\nIn general, watching cartoons in a church might be considered inappropriate or disrespectful because it's not aligning with the usual activities or the solemn atmosphere of the place. However, is it morally wrong? I'm not so sure. It might be more of a social norm violation rather than a moral transgression. Unless there's something specific about the cartoons that makes them inappropriate, like if they were offensive in some way, but again, I don't have that information.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"At the event, I served alcohol to the high school teachers.\" Okay, so someone served alcohol to high school teachers at an event. Now, serving alcohol to adults is generally acceptable, assuming the teachers are of legal drinking age. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21, so unless some of the teachers are under 21, which is possible but unlikely, serving alcohol to them shouldn't be a problem.\n\nHowever, there might be some considerations here. For instance, is the event related to the school? If it's a school function, some schools might have policies against serving alcohol, especially if students are present. But the scenario specifies \"high school teachers,\" so maybe it's an event just for them, like a staff party or something. Even then, serving alcohol to adults who are of legal age isn't morally wrong in itself.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a concern about teachers setting a bad example or something like that. Still, adults have the right to make their own choices about drinking alcohol, as long as they're of legal age and doing so responsibly.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves watching cartoons in a church, which might be seen as inappropriate but not necessarily morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves serving alcohol to adults who are likely of legal age, which is generally acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning neither scenario is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For Scenario 1, perhaps watching cartoons in a church could be seen as disrespectful to the sanctity of the place, but is that a moral wrong or just a breach of decorum? And in Scenario 2, serving alcohol to teachers could be problematic if they're driving afterward or if there are students around, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nOverall, I still think that neither scenario is clearly morally wrong based on the information provided. So, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
