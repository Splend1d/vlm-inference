                    "text": "So I have this problem about an airplane and its groundspeed. The airplane is pointing north with an airspeed of 40 km/h, and there's a crosswind blowing at 30 km/h at right angles. I need to find the groundspeed of the airplane. The options are 30 km/h, 40 km/h, 50 km/h, and 60 km/h.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what airspeed and groundspeed are. Airspeed is the speed of the airplane relative to the air around it, which is like how fast the plane is moving through the air. Groundspeed is the speed of the airplane relative to the ground, which is what we actually observe from the ground.\n\nSo, the airplane is flying north at 40 km/h through the air, but there's a crosswind blowing perpendicular to that direction, at 30 km/h. Since the crosswind is at right angles to the direction the plane is flying, I think this is a vector addition problem.\n\nLet me visualize this. The airplane's airspeed is north at 40 km/h, and the wind is blowing from east to west or west to east, but it says crosswind at right angles. Wait, it says crosswind at right angles to the airplane's direction, which is north. So if the airplane is flying north, a crosswind at right angles would be either from the east or the west.\n\nActually, the problem says \"crosswind (at right angles)\", but it doesn't specify the direction of the crosswind. Hmm, maybe it's coming from the east, so blowing towards the west. Or maybe it's from the west, blowing towards the east. I think it's safe to assume it's blowing perpendicular to the airplane's direction, either to the left or right.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the crosswind is blowing from the east towards the west, so it's affecting the airplane's movement to the west.\n\nNow, the airplane's airspeed is 40 km/h north, and the wind is 30 km/h west.\n\nTo find the groundspeed, I need to add these two vectors: the airplane's velocity relative to the air, and the air's velocity relative to the ground (which is the wind).\n\nSo, the airplane's velocity relative to the air is 40 km/h north.\n\nThe wind's velocity relative to the ground is 30 km/h west.\n\nTo find the airplane's velocity relative to the ground, I add these two vectors.\n\nSince they are perpendicular, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the resultant speed.\n\nSo, groundspeed = sqrt(airspeed^2 + wind speed^2) = sqrt(40^2 + 30^2) = sqrt(1600 + 900) = sqrt(2500) = 50 km/h.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the angle or use trigonometry.\n\nNo, since the vectors are at right angles, Pythagoras should apply directly.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nIf I draw the airplane's airspeed vector north and the wind vector west, the resultant groundspeed vector should be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides 40 km/h and 30 km/h.\n\nSo, yes, groundspeed = sqrt(40^2 + 30^2) = sqrt(1600 + 900) = sqrt(2500) = 50 km/h.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of vector components:\n\nThe airplane's velocity vector is 40 km/h north.\n\nThe wind's velocity vector is 30 km/h west.\n\nSo, the resultant velocity vector is the sum of these two.\n\nIn component form:\n\nNorth component: 40 km/h\n\nWest component: 30 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the resultant vector is sqrt(north component^2 + west component^2) = sqrt(40^2 + 30^2) = 50 km/h.\n\nSame result.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor I need to consider here, like the direction or anything else, since the question is only asking for the speed, not the direction.\n\nLet me see if maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the airplane's actual heading might be adjusted for the wind? For example, if the pilot adjusts the heading to compensate for the wind, but the problem doesn't mention that. It just says the nose is pointing north with an airspeed of 40 km/h, so I think we can assume the airplane is flying straight north relative to the air.\n\nTherefore, the groundspeed should indeed be 50 km/h.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 30 km/h\n\nB. 40 km/h\n\nC. 50 km/h\n\nD. 60 km/h\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 50 km/h.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this problem.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any reason it might not be 50 km/h.\n\nPerhaps if the wind direction wasn't perpendicular, or if there was some other force acting on the airplane, but the problem specifies that the crosswind is at right angles, so Pythagoras should apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a concept of groundspeed considering wind angle, but again, in this specific case with perpendicular vectors, it should be straightforward.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ km/h}} \\]"
