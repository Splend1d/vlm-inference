                    "text": "So I have this question about the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, specifically about the classic aging pattern and which subtests show a decline. The options are:\n\nA. All Verbal subtests\n\nB. All Performance subtests\n\nC. Vocabulary subtest only\n\nD. Block Design subtest only\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) is. It's a test used to measure intelligence in adults, and it has various subtests divided into Verbal and Performance sections.\n\nAs people age, their performance on certain subtests may decline. The question is asking about the classic aging pattern, meaning the typical pattern of decline seen in specific subtests as people get older.\n\nLet me think about this. Generally, as people age, their verbal abilities, like vocabulary and general knowledge, tend to remain stable or even improve up to certain points in life. On the other hand, performance-based tasks, especially those that require speed or visual-spatial reasoning, might show more decline with age.\n\nGiven that, option A suggests all Verbal subtests decline, but that seems counterintuitive because vocabulary, for example, often increases with age due to life experiences.\n\nOption B suggests all Performance subtests decline. This could be possible since performance tasks might be more affected by aging, especially those that rely on processing speed or motor skills.\n\nOption C mentions only the Vocabulary subtest declines. But as I thought earlier, vocabulary typically doesn't decline with age and may even improve.\n\nOption D mentions only the Block Design subtest declines. Block Design is a Performance subtest that assesses visual-spatial reasoning and organization. While it might decline with age, it seems unlikely that only this subtest would show decline, especially if there's a classic aging pattern.\n\nConsidering this, I need to recall specific information about the WAIS-R and aging patterns. I remember that in the WAIS-R, the Verbal subtests include Vocabulary, Comprehension, Arithmetic, Similarities, Digit Span, and Information. The Performance subtests include Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement, Block Design, Object Assembly, and Digit Symbol.\n\nIn terms of aging, research suggests that verbal comprehension and knowledge (like Vocabulary and General Information) tend to be well-preserved or even increase until later in life. In contrast, performance tasks that require speed, coordination, or visual-spatial abilities might show more decline with age.\n\nTherefore, if I had to choose between all Verbal subtests declining or all Performance subtests declining, the Performance subtests seem more likely to show decline with age.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions \"classic aging pattern\" and \"2 decline.\" It seems like there might be a typo or mis phrasing in the question. Typically, in the WAIS-R, not all Verbal or all Performance subtests decline uniformly with age.\n\nLet me consider what the question might be referring to. Perhaps it's asking about which two subtests show a decline in the classic aging pattern.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe it's referring to specific subtests within either Verbal or Performance sections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"2 decline\" refers to a specific pattern where two subtests show a different pattern of aging compared to others.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, if I had to pick which subtests decline with age, I would look towards the Performance subtests, particularly those that rely on processing speed and visual-spatial abilities.\n\nBut the question is phrased differently; it seems to suggest that the classic aging pattern is defined as \"2 decline\" on certain subtests, and it's asking on which subtest(s) this applies.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe \"2 decline\" refers to a specific scoring pattern or a categorization in the WAIS-R manual.\n\nI need to refer back to the WAIS-R manual or related literature to find the exact answer.\n\nUpon recalling, I think that in the WAIS-R, there is a concept of \"decline\" in certain subtests with age. Specifically, some subtests are more sensitive to the effects of aging than others.\n\nIn the Verbal section, while Vocabulary tends to remain stable or improve with age, other subtests like Arithmetic or Digit Span might show some decline, especially with increasing age.\n\nIn the Performance section, subtests like Block Design and Picture Arrangement might show more pronounced declines with age, whereas Picture Completion might remain relatively stable.\n\nHowever, the question mentions \"2 decline\" and asks on which subtest(s) this applies.\n\nWait, maybe \"2 decline\" refers to a specific profile or pattern in the WAIS-R where certain subtests show a decline, and the question is asking which subtests are involved in that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"2 decline\" is a mistranslation or a typo, and it should refer to a specific pattern or number of subtests declining.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that in the classic aging pattern, certain Performance subtests show a decline, hence option B.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the \"2 decline\" part of the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to two specific subtests declining, and the question is asking which subtests those are.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the answer is D, Block Design subtest only, but that doesn't make sense because it's only one subtest, not two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of two subtests, but the options don't specify combinations.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that the WAIS-R has both Verbal and Performance scales, each with several subtests.\n\nIf the classic aging pattern involves \"2 decline,\" perhaps it means that two of the subtests show a decline with age.\n\nGiven that, and considering that verbal abilities tend to remain stable or improve while performance abilities decline, the answer might be B, all Performance subtests.\n\nHowever, that would involve more than two subtests declining, which contradicts the \"2 decline\" part of the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"2 decline\" refers to a specific pattern where two subtests show a decline, and this pattern is observed in only one of the options.\n\nWait, maybe the question has a typo, and \"2 decline\" should be \"to decline\" or \"show decline.\"\n\nIf that's the case, then the question might be asking on which subtest(s) the classic aging pattern shows decline.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is that the classic aging pattern shows decline in Performance subtests, hence option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's specific to certain subtests like Block Design and Digit Symbol.\n\nBut again, the options don't include combinations.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best answer is B, all Performance subtests, assuming that in the classic aging pattern, Performance subtests show more decline compared to Verbal subtests.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure, and this is just a reasoned guess.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
