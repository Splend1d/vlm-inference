Typically less successful\n\nD. Most common among those who have never been married before\"\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. I need to think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"More frequent for women than men.\" Is that true? I think in many societies, including the United States, women tend to remarry at higher rates than men after a divorce or the death of a spouse. But I'm not entirely sure about the current statistics. Maybe it's changed over time? I should look that up.\n\nOption B: \"Typically more successful.\" Success in marriage can be subjective, but I think the success rate of remarriages compared to first marriages is something I should consider. I recall that second marriages have different dynamics and might face different challenges than first marriages. Maybe they're more successful because people have learned from their previous experiences, or maybe they're less successful due to issues like blending families or trust issues. I need to find some data on this.\n\nOption C: \"Typically less successful.\" This seems like the opposite of option B. Again, I need to find out which one is more accurate. Maybe the success rate is similar, or perhaps there's a trend one way or the other.\n\nOption D: \"Most common among those who have never been married before.\" This seems contradictory because remarriage, by definition, implies that someone has been married before. So, it can't be most common among those who have never been married. Maybe there's some confusion in the wording here. Perhaps it's a trick question.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that remarriage could include people who are widowed or divorced, but not those who have never been married. So, logically, option D doesn't make sense because you can't remarry if you've never been married before. Maybe it's a typo or something.\n\nAlright, let's set option D aside as it doesn't seem plausible.\n\nNow, between options A, B, and C, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nLet me think about remarriage rates first. According to some studies I've read, remarriage rates have been declining in recent years, especially for women. So, perhaps remarriages are not more frequent for women than men anymore. But I need more current data to confirm that.\n\nAs for the success of remarriages, I think the divorce rate for second marriages is slightly higher than for first marriages. That would suggest that remarriages are typically less successful, which would point towards option C.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"success\" can be defined differently. Maybe some consider a marriage successful if it lasts a certain number of years, or if it produces children, or if both partners are happy. So, perhaps in some contexts, remarriages are more successful.\n\nHowever, based on statistical data on divorce rates, it seems that second marriages have a higher likelihood of ending in divorce compared to first marriages. For example, according to the American Psychological Association, the divorce rate for first marriages is around 41%, for second marriages, it's about 60%, and for third marriages, it's about 73%. So, based on this, remarriages are less successful in terms of durability.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be supported by these statistics.\n\nBut is there more to it? Maybe remarriages are less successful in terms of longevity, but perhaps they are more fulfilling in other ways, like emotional satisfaction or financial stability. I don't have data on that off the top of my head, but it's something to consider.\n\nStill, the question is specifically about remarriages being \"typically more successful\" or \"typically less successful.\" Given that success often is measured by the duration of the marriage, and statistics show higher divorce rates in second marriages, option C seems the most accurate.\n\nOption A, about remarriages being more frequent for women than men, might have been true in the past, but I think trends are changing. According to recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, remarriage rates are actually higher for men than for women, especially as people age. For instance, among adults aged 45 to 54 who are currently married, about 54% of men and 42% of women are in their second or higher-order marriage. So, this suggests that remarriage is more common among men than women in that age group.\n\nSimilarly, for older adults, ages 65 and older, about 47% of men and 16% of women are remarried. This indicates that men are more likely to remarry after divorce or widowhood than women in these age groups.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect based on current demographic trends.\n\nOption D is logically flawed because remarriage requires a previous marriage, so it can't be most common among those who have never been married before.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: Typically less successful.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might make another option correct.\n\nFor example, perhaps in certain cultures or contexts, remarriages are more successful. However, the question is general and doesn't specify a particular context, so I think we have to consider general trends.\n\nAlso, maybe \"success\" is defined differently in some contexts, such as personal happiness or achieving certain life goals, but based on standard interpretations, especially in demographic studies, success often refers to the durability of the marriage.\n\nGiven all this, I believe option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
