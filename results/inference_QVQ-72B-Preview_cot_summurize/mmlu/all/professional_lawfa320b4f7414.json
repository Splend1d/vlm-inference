The grower's title to the lemon grove was subject to an unrecorded 20-year mortgage given to the mortgagee, a bank, in 1990 to secure repayment of a loan for $100,000. Beginning in November 1993, the following events occurred:November 1993: The grower died, leaving all of her real property to her husband. The grower's will was admitted to probate. No mention was made of the mortgage given to the bank. December 1993: Having heard about the grower's death, the bank recorded its mortgage to the lemon grove. August 1994: The husband executed and delivered to his sister a mortgage deed on the orange grove, which the sister immediately recorded. The mortgage instrument contained the following recitations: \"This mortgage is secured by the orange grove and all other real estate that I may own in the city or have an interest in. \" The husband defaulted on his mortgage obligation to the sister; the amount due on the debt was $100,000. February 2009: The bank brought suit against the husband to foreclose its mortgage on the lemon grove. The applicable recording statute provides in part:\"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, of any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"Judgment should be for\n\nA. the husband, if he was unaware of the existence of the mortgage at the time he acquired title to the lemon grove.\nB. the husband, only if the lemon grove was not subject to the mortgage when he acquired title.\nC. the bank, because the husband assumed the mortgage when he acquired title to the lemon grove.\nD. the bank, because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario about a citrus grower who owned two adjacent parcels of land: an orange grove and a lemon grove. The grower passed away in November 1993, and there's some complicated stuff going on with mortgages and recording of deeds. I need to figure out who should win in a foreclosure suit brought by a bank against the husband (who inherited the properties) regarding the lemon grove.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the timeline and the key events:\n\n1. **1990:** The grower gives an unrecorded 20-year mortgage on the lemon grove to a bank to secure a $100,000 loan.\n\n2. **November 1993:** The grower dies and leaves all her real property to her husband. Her will is probated, but the mortgage to the bank isn't mentioned.\n\n3. **December 1993:** The bank hears about the grower's death and records its mortgage on the lemon grove.\n\n4. **August 1994:** The husband mortgages the orange grove to his sister, who records it immediately. The mortgage says it's secured by the orange grove and \"all other real estate that I may own in the city or have an interest in.\"\n\n5. **February 2009:** The bank sues the husband to foreclose on the lemon grove mortgage.\n\nNow, the question is about the outcome of this foreclosure suit. The applicable recording statute says that an unrecorded deed or instrument won't affect the title or rights to real estate of a devisee or purchaser in good faith without knowledge of the unrecorded instrument.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- **Devises and Purchasers in Good Faith:** The statute protects people who inherit property (devisees) and buyers who purchase without knowing about any unrecorded claims.\n\n- **Knowledge Requirement:** If the husband didn't know about the mortgage when he inherited the lemon grove, he might be protected by this statute.\n\nBut there are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Inheritance vs. Purchase:** The husband inherited the property through a will, so he's a devisee. The statute specifically mentions devisees.\n\n2. **Recording of the Mortgage:** The bank recorded its mortgage in December 1993, after the grower's death but before the husband did anything with the property.\n\n3. **Subsequent Mortgage on the Orange Grove:** In August 1994, the husband mortgaged the orange grove to his sister, with a broad recital including \"all other real estate\" he owns in the city.\n\n4. **Foreclosure Attempt in 2009:** The bank is trying to foreclose on the lemon grove based on the mortgage from 1990.\n\nNow, let's think about the options:\n\nA. The husband wins if he didn't know about the mortgage when he acquired the lemon grove.\n\nB. The husband wins only if the lemon grove wasn't subject to the mortgage when he acquired title.\n\nC. The bank wins because the husband assumed the mortgage when he acquired the lemon grove.\n\nD. The bank wins because once property is mortgaged, it remains mortgaged against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:** The husband wins if he was unaware of the mortgage at the time he acquired title.\n\n- The recording statute protects devisees and purchasers in good faith without knowledge of unrecorded instruments.\n\n- The mortgage was unrecorded until December 1993, which was after the grower's death in November 1993.\n\n- The husband inherited the property through the will, which was probated, but the mortgage wasn't mentioned.\n\n- If the husband didn't know about the mortgage, and it wasn't recorded until after he inherited, this could be a valid defense.\n\nHowever, the bank recorded the mortgage in December 1993, which might have put the husband on notice.\n\n**Option B:** The husband wins only if the lemon grove wasn't subject to the mortgage when he acquired title.\n\n- This seems similar to Option A but emphasizes the status of the lemon grove at the time of inheritance.\n\n- If the mortgage was unrecorded when the husband inherited, and he didn't have knowledge of it, then perhaps the lemon grove wasn't subject to it.\n\n- But the mortgage was recorded in December 1993, shortly after the inheritance, which might have retroactive effects or put the husband on constructive notice.\n\n**Option C:** The bank wins because the husband assumed the mortgage when he acquired the lemon grove.\n\n- Generally, when someone inherits property, they take it subject to existing liens and mortgages unless otherwise provided in the will.\n\n- If the will didn't mention the mortgage, perhaps the husband didn't assume it.\n\n- However, typically, inheritance doesn't automatically extinguish existing mortgages or liens on the property.\n\n**Option D:** The bank wins because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n\n- This suggests that the mortgage is a continuing lien on the property, binding the husband as the successor in interest.\n\n- This is a common principle in real estate law: mortgages typically bind the grantor's heirs and successors.\n\nBut considering the recording statute, which protects devisees without knowledge of unrecorded instruments, there might be a conflict here.\n\nNow, let's consider the recording of the mortgage in December 1993. The grower died in November 1993, and the will was probated, but the mortgage wasn't mentioned. The husband inherited the property without knowledge of the mortgage, assuming he didn't know about it.\n\nThe bank recorded the mortgage in December 1993, after the grower's death but before the husband did anything with the property. Recording the mortgage would put subsequent purchasers on notice, but the husband already inherited the property.\n\nHowever, the recording statute says that unrecorded instruments don't affect the title or rights of devisees or purchasers in good faith without knowledge of such instruments.\n\nSo, if the husband was a devisee in good faith without knowledge of the mortgage when he inherited, the mortgage shouldn't affect his title.\n\nBut, the bank recorded the mortgage in December 1993, which might have retroactive effects or put the husband on constructive notice.\n\nWait, the bank recorded the mortgage after the grower's death but before the husband took any action with the property. Does the recording affect the husband's inherited interest?\n\nPerhaps not, because the husband already inherited the property via the will, and the recording was after the inheritance.\n\nSo, if the husband didn't have actual knowledge of the mortgage, and it was recorded after he inherited, maybe the mortgage doesn't bind him.\n\nBut, generally, mortgages bind the mortgagor's heirs and successors in interest, even if they inherit the property.\n\nMoreover, the recording of the mortgage would put subsequent purchasers on notice, but since the husband inherited before the recording, perhaps it doesn't affect him.\n\nHowever, I think the better view is that the mortgage binds the husband as the successor in interest, regardless of whether he had knowledge of it or not, especially since the mortgage was recorded shortly after his inheritance.\n\nAlso, the fact that the will didn't mention the mortgage doesn't necessarily mean that the husband didn't assume it.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, inheritance is subject to existing liens and mortgages on the property unless the will provides otherwise.\n\nUnless the will explicitly stated that the husband was to receive the property free of liens, which it didn't, the husband likely took the property subject to the existing mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the bank should prevail in the foreclosure suit because the mortgage binds the husband as the successor in interest.\n\nSo, the correct answer seems to be Option D: the bank wins because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nConsider that the recording statute protects devisees without knowledge of unrecorded instruments. The mortgage was unrecorded until December 1993, after the grower's death in November 1993.\n\nIf the husband inherited without knowledge of the mortgage, and it was recorded after his inheritance, perhaps he is protected.\n\nHowever, the mortgage was recorded before any action he took with the property, like selling or further mortgaging it.\n\nAlso, the husband mortgaged the orange grove in August 1994, which is a different property, so that shouldn't affect the lemon grove mortgage.\n\nBut the mortgage to the sister includes \"all other real estate that I may own in the city or have an interest in,\" which could potentially include the lemon grove.\n\nWait, does this complicate things?\n\nIf the husband mortgaged the orange grove and included \"all other real estate,\" does that affect the prior mortgage on the lemon grove?\n\nProbably not directly, because the lemon grove was already mortgaged to the bank.\n\nUnless the sister's mortgage somehow wraps around the bank's mortgage, which seems unlikely.\n\nSo, perhaps the sister's mortgage doesn't affect the bank's interest in the lemon grove.\n\nBack to the main issue: should the bank prevail in foreclosing on the lemon grove mortgage?\n\nGiven that the mortgage was recorded in December 1993, after the grower's death but before the husband did anything with the property, and considering that the recording statute protects devisees without knowledge of unrecorded instruments, there might be an argument that the husband is protected.\n\nHowever, generally, recording a mortgage puts subsequent purchasers on notice, and inheritance doesn't automatically extinguish existing liens.\n\nMoreover, the mortgage is a continuing lien on the property, binding the husband as the successor in interest.\n\nTherefore, despite the recording being after the inheritance, the mortgage should still bind the husband.\n\nThus, the bank should prevail in the foreclosure suit.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
