                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about rings and homomorphisms. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at Statement 1: \"A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}.\"\n\nOkay, so I remember that in group theory, for group homomorphisms, the kernel being trivial (i.e., containing only the identity element) is equivalent to the homomorphism being injective, or one to one. Since a ring is essentially a group under addition, maybe something similar applies here.\n\nLet me recall the definition of a ring homomorphism. A ring homomorphism f from ring R to ring S is a function that preserves both addition and multiplication: f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) and f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a, b in R.\n\nThe kernel of f is defined as the set of elements in R that map to the zero element of S, i.e., ker(f) = {r in R | f(r) = 0_S}.\n\nNow, in group theory, for additive groups, the kernel of a group homomorphism is the set of elements that map to the identity of the target group. So, in the context of rings, since addition is a group operation, maybe the same principle applies.\n\nLet me think about the kernel being {0}. If ker(f) = {0}, that means only the additive identity of R is mapped to the additive identity of S.\n\nSuppose f is one to one. Then, each element in R maps to a unique element in S, and since f is injective, different elements in R map to different elements in S. In particular, the only element that can map to 0_S is 0_R, because if there were another element r in R such that f(r) = 0_S, then f(r) = f(0_R), which would imply r = 0_R if f is injective. So, ker(f) = {0_R}.\n\nConversely, suppose ker(f) = {0_R}. We need to show that f is injective. Let r1, r2 be elements in R such that f(r1) = f(r2). Then, f(r1) - f(r2) = 0_S, which implies f(r1 - r2) = 0_S, since f is a homomorphism. But if ker(f) = {0_R}, then r1 - r2 = 0_R, which means r1 = r2. Hence, f is injective.\n\nSo, it seems that in rings, just like in groups, the homomorphism is one to one if and only if its kernel is trivial, i.e., {0_R}.\n\nWait a minute, is there any difference between rings with unity and without? I think this holds for both, but maybe I should check.\n\nIn rings with unity, the zero element is unique, and the kernel is well-defined. In rings without unity, the concept is similar, but perhaps there are some edge cases. However, for the sake of this problem, I'll assume we're dealing with rings that have a multiplicative identity.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"Q is an ideal in R.\"\n\nHmm, this seems incomplete. Q usually denotes the set of rational numbers, but in this context, it's written as Q, not necessarily with any subscript or additional information. R is likely a ring, possibly the ring of integers, but again, without context, it's hard to say.\n\nMaybe Q is intended to be the set of rational numbers, and R is the ring of integers. In that case, is Q an ideal in R?\n\nWait, the set of rational numbers is not an ideal in the ring of integers because ideals are subsets of the ring that are closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of the ring.\n\nThe rational numbers include fractions, but the integers only consist of whole numbers. So, if you take an element from Q, say 1/2, and multiply it by an element from Z, say 2, you get 1, which is in Z, but 1/2 is not in Z. Therefore, Q is not closed under multiplication by elements of Z, so it can't be an ideal of Z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Q is meant to represent something else in this context. Maybe it's a typo or missing context.\n\nWait, maybe Q refers to a quotient ring or something similar, but the statement is phrased as \"Q is an ideal in R,\" which suggests that Q is a subset of R intended to be an ideal.\n\nGiven that, and without more context, it's difficult to determine the truth of Statement 2. However, based on standard notations, Q (rational numbers) is not an ideal in R (integers), as explained earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Q is meant to represent the set of all multiples of some element in R, which would make it an ideal, but again, without clarification, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the standard interpretation, I would say that Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nStatement 1: True\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFor Statement 1, I've reasoned that a ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if its kernel is {0}, which seems correct based on standard group and ring theory.\n\nFor Statement 2, assuming Q is the set of rational numbers and R is the integers, Q is not an ideal in R because it's not a subset of R (since R consists only of integers).\n\nAlternatively, if Q is some other set, but without specification, I can't assume anything else.\n\nHence, the answer should be C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
