                    "text": "Let's tackle this step by step. So, we have a DNA molecule with the nucleotide sequence 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032. From this DNA, an mRNA molecule is transcribed, and then during protein synthesis, a tRNA pairs with the mRNA codon. We need to find out the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how transcription works. In transcription, the mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template following the base pairing rules: A pairs with U, C pairs with G, G pairs with C, and T pairs with A. Wait, but DNA has T instead of U. So, during transcription, T in DNA pairs with A in mRNA.\n\nSo, given the DNA sequence 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032, the mRNA sequence should be complementary to the template strand. But which strand is the template? In DNA, the coding strand is the one that has the same sequence as the mRNA, but with T instead of U.\n\nLet me think about it. The given sequence is probably the coding strand of DNA. So, the mRNA should have a sequence complementary to the template strand.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the mRNA sequence is transcribed from the DNA sequence provided, meaning the DNA sequence is the template strand.\n\nBut actually, in transcription, the mRNA is synthesized using the non-coding strand (the template strand) as a guide. So, if we have the coding strand, which is 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032, then the template strand would be 3\u2032-G-T-A-5\u2032, following A-T and C-G base pairing.\n\nThen, the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, so it would be 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032, where T in DNA is replaced by U in mRNA.\n\nNow, the tRNA has an anticodon that pairs with the mRNA codon. The anticodon and codon pairing follows the standard base pairing rules: A-U, U-A, G-C, C-G.\n\nSo, if the mRNA codon is 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032, then the tRNA anticodon should be complementary to this, which would be 3\u2032-G-U-A-5\u2032.\n\nBut wait, I think there's a convention about the direction of the anticodon. Anticodons are written from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction as well, but sometimes there's confusion because the pairing is between the first base of the codon and the third base of the anticodon.\n\nLet me double-check this. In the standard convention, the anticodon is written in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, and it pairs with the codon in an antiparallel manner, meaning the 5\u2032 end of the codon pairs with the 3\u2032 end of the anticodon.\n\nSo, for the mRNA codon 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032, the anticodon would pair as follows:\n\n- 5\u2032-C-3\u2032 in codon pairs with 3\u2032-G-5\u2032 in anticodon\n\n- 5\u2032-A-3\u2032 in codon pairs with 3\u2032-U-5\u2032 in anticodon\n\n- 5\u2032-U-3\u2032 in codon pairs with 3\u2032-A-5\u2032 in anticodon\n\nTherefore, the anticodon should be 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5\u2032-G-T-A-3\u2032\n\nB. 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032\n\nC. 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032\n\nD. 5-\u2032U-A-C-3\u2032\n\nSo, option B. 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with DNA 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032, which is probably the coding strand. The template strand would be 3\u2032-G-T-A-5\u2032. Transcribing this to mRNA would give 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032.\n\nThen, the tRNA anticodon would be complementary to this mRNA codon, so 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032, as I concluded.\n\nAlternatively, if the DNA sequence was the template strand, but I think it's the coding strand based on standard presentation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the DNA sequence is the coding strand, so the mRNA should be the same, just replacing T with U, which gives 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032.\n\nThen, the anticodon pairs with the codon in an antiparallel manner, so 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think it's option A, 5\u2032-G-T-A-3\u2032, because that would have a T in the anticodon, which shouldn't be there since tRNA has only RNA bases: A, U, C, G.\n\nOption C is 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032, which is the mRNA codon itself, not the anticodon.\n\nOption D is 5\u2032-U-A-C-3\u2032, which seems like it might be the reverse complement or something, but doesn't match the pairing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B. 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
