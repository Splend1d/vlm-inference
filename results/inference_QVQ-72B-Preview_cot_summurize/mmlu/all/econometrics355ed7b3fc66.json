                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand antithetic variates in the context of Monte Carlo simulations. From what I've read, antithetic variates are a variance reduction technique used to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo estimates. The idea is to generate pairs of random numbers that are negatively correlated in some way, so that the variability in the simulation results is reduced.\n\nLet's look at each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I:** \"Antithetic variates work by reducing the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space.\"\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure about this one. Antithetic variates aim to reduce variance by introducing negative correlation between samples, not necessarily by reducing the number of replications. In fact, the number of replications might stay the same, but the variance of the estimator is decreased, leading to more precise estimates. So, I think this statement might be misleading.\n\n**Statement II:** \"Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically.\"\n\nThis sounds interesting. Antithetic variates do involve using a related variable, but I'm not sure about the analytical properties part. The antithetic variable is typically derived from the same random draw but transformed in a way that it's negatively correlated with the original variable. For example, if you have a uniform random variable U, its antithetic counterpart would be 1 - U, which is negatively correlated with U. So, I don't think the analytical properties are the main point here. Maybe this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\n**Statement III:** \"Antithetic variates involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\"\n\nOkay, this seems plausible. In some cases, like for symmetric distributions, taking the negative of a random draw could produce a negatively correlated variable. However, I recall that for uniform variables, the typical antithetic transform is 1 - U, not -U. So, maybe this isn't universally applicable. But perhaps in certain contexts, using negatives can be effective.\n\n**Statement IV:** \"Antithetic variates involve taking one over each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\"\n\nWait a minute, taking the reciprocal (1/U) of a uniform random variable U would give another variable that is not uniformly distributed. In fact, if U is uniform on (0,1), then 1/U is distributed on (1, \u221e), which isn't helpful for variance reduction. I don't think this is a standard antithetic variate technique. Maybe this statement is incorrect.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think **Statement I** might be partially correct, but it's a bit confusing. **Statement II** seems off because antithetic variates aren't necessarily about using variables with known analytical properties. **Statement III** could be correct in some scenarios, but it's not general. **Statement IV** appears to be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is **B. (i) and (iii) only**, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.\n\nAntithetic variates primarily aim to reduce variance by introducing negative correlation between samples. This is achieved by generating pairs of random numbers where one is the \"antithesis\" of the other. For uniform random variables, the standard antithetic transform is 1 - U, not -U or 1/U.\n\nSo, **Statement III** suggests using the negative of each random draw, which might work for some distributions, like the normal distribution, but not for all. For example, in a uniform distribution on (0,1), taking negatives would give values in (-1,0), which might not be appropriate for the simulation.\n\n**Statement I** suggests that antithetic variates reduce the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space. While it's true that variance reduction techniques like antithetic variates can lead to more efficient estimates with the same number of replications, they don't necessarily reduce the number of replications required. Instead, they improve the precision of the estimate for a given number of replications.\n\n**Statement II** mentions using a similar variable with known analytical properties. This doesn't seem directly related to antithetic variates. Antithetic variates are about generating negatively correlated pairs of random variables to reduce variance, not about using variables with known analytical solutions.\n\n**Statement IV** involves taking the reciprocal of the random draws, which isn't a standard practice in antithetic variates. This seems incorrect.\n\nGiven this analysis, perhaps only **Statement I** is somewhat correct, but even that is not entirely accurate. Maybe none of the statements are completely correct, but since the question asks to select which statements are correct, and considering the options, **B. (i) and (iii) only** might be the intended answer, despite my reservations about **Statement III** being universally applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps none of the statements are entirely accurate, but that's not one of the options. So, I'll go with **B. (i) and (iii) only**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
