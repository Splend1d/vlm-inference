                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out how scientists know how old the Earth is. The options are:\n\nA. From the layering of materials within the Earth.\n\nB. From fossils of ancient life.\n\nC. From the cratering history of Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nD. From radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites.\n\nHmm, I think I remember something about radioactive dating in science class. That seems pretty relevant here.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: layering of materials within the Earth. I know that rocks can have layers, and generally, the older layers are deeper down. So, by looking at these layers, scientists can get an idea of the sequence of events, like which rocks were formed first. But does this directly tell us the age in years? Not really. It tells us the relative ages, but for absolute ages, I think they need something else.\n\nOption B: fossils of ancient life. Fossils are remains or traces of ancient organisms preserved in rocks. They're really important for understanding the history of life on Earth. Paleontologists can use fossils to track when different species lived and how they evolved over time. But again, while fossils can give us a sense of the sequence of events, they don't directly provide specific ages in years. So, probably not the main method for determining the Earth's exact age.\n\nOption C: cratering history of Earth\u2019s surface. This is interesting. I know that on the Moon, scientists use the number and size of craters to estimate the age of a surface. More craters generally mean an older surface. However, on Earth, erosion and plate tectonics have erased a lot of ancient craters. There are some preserved craters, but again, this seems more about relative ages based on crater densities rather than precise numerical ages.\n\nNow, option D: radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites. This sounds promising. I recall that radioactive elements decay over time at a consistent rate, which is called their half-life. By measuring the amount of a radioactive isotope and its decay products in a rock, scientists can calculate how old the rock is. For example, carbon dating is a type of radioactive dating used for younger samples, but there are other methods for older materials.\n\nBut wait, carbon dating isn't used for something as old as the Earth because carbon-14 has a half-life of only about 5,700 years. So, for the Earth's age, which is billions of years, other isotopes with longer half-lives are used, like uranium-238 to lead-206 or potassium-40 to argon-40.\n\nMoreover, scientists don't just look at terrestrial rocks; they also look at meteorites. Meteorites are pieces of space debris that have fallen to Earth, and some of them are believed to be remnants from the early solar system. By dating these meteorites, scientists can get an idea of when the solar system formed, which is also when the Earth was formed.\n\nIn fact, the current accepted age of the Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years, which is based on radiometric dating of both terrestrial rocks and meteorites.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that option D is the most accurate answer. Radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites provides a direct way to measure the age of the Earth in years.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about whether the other options could also contribute to determining the Earth's age.\n\nLayering of materials (option A) helps with relative dating, but without a way to assign specific ages to the layers, it's not sufficient on its own.\n\nFossils (option B) are similarly useful for relative dating. They can tell us that certain species lived before others, but to assign specific ages, we'd need to correlate fossil layers with absolute dating methods, like radioactive dating.\n\nCratering history (option C) is useful for estimating the relative ages of surfaces, especially on the Moon and other celestial bodies without active geology. On Earth, though, erosion and tectonic processes have erased most ancient craters, making it difficult to use this method for determining the overall age of the planet.\n\nTherefore, while all these methods provide valuable information about Earth's history, radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites is the primary method used to determine the absolute age of the Earth.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. From radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
