Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman?\n\nA. The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.\nB. The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.\nC. The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.\nD. Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a woman who wants to add a specific type of cymbidium, a plant native to Japan, to her Japanese-style garden. She finds a distributor who can get it for her, they agree on a price of $5,000, with $1,000 upfront and the remaining $4,000 upon planting. But then, something happens: the U.S. government bans the import of cymbidiums from foreign countries because of a beetle that could harm citrus crops. This means the distributor can't get the plant for her anymore. Now, I need to figure out what the legal relationship is between the distributor and the woman after this ban.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of \"impossibility\" and \"supervening illegality\" in contract law. Impossibility refers to situations where, after a contract is formed, circumstances change in such a way that performance of the contract becomes objectively impossible, not just difficult or more expensive. Supervening illegality is a type of impossibility where performance becomes illegal after the contract is formed.\n\nIn this case, the distributor agreed to acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan and plant it in the woman's garden for $5,000. After the contract was signed, the U.S. government imposed a ban on importing cymbidiums from foreign countries. This ban makes it illegal for the distributor to import the plant, which directly affects their ability to perform the contract as agreed.\n\nSo, because of this new law, the distributor can't legally import the plant anymore. That sounds like supervening illegality. Now, does this excuse the distributor from performing their part of the contract?\n\nI recall that generally, when performance becomes illegal due to a change in law after the contract is formed, the party who was supposed to perform that act is excused from performing it. This is because the law has made it impossible for them to carry out their contractual obligations without breaking the law.\n\nBut wait, there's more to it. What about the woman who already paid $1,000 upfront? Does she get that money back? And what about the remaining $4,000 she was supposed to pay upon planting? Since the planting can't happen now, does she still have to pay that?\n\nLet me look at the options provided:\n\nA. The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.\n\nB. The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.\n\nC. The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.\n\nD. Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.\n\nOption A says that the distributor is excused due to impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution. Restitution usually involves returning benefits received, so maybe she can get her $1,000 back.\n\nOption B says the distributor's performance is not excused because of supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages for the distributor's inability to perform.\n\nOption C is similar to B but adds that she has to wait until the performance was due to file a suit.\n\nOption D says both are excused, and neither can recover from the other.\n\nI think the key here is whether the supervening illegality excuses the distributor's performance. If it does, then the distributor doesn't have to perform, and the woman might be entitled to get her $1,000 back or seek some other remedy.\n\nBut option B and C say that the distributor's performance is not excused because of supervening illegality, meaning that the distributor is still responsible for performing, even if it's now illegal to do so, and the woman can seek damages for the distributor's inability to perform.\n\nThat seems contradictory. If performance is now illegal, how can the distributor be expected to perform it? It wouldn't make sense to force someone to do something that's against the law.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently. Perhaps the distributor is excused from performing because it's now illegal, but the woman is entitled to get her $1,000 back since the contract can't be performed.\n\nLooking back at option A, it says the distributor's performance is excused due to impossibility, which makes sense because of the new law making importation illegal. And the woman can seek restitution, which likely includes getting her $1,000 back.\n\nOption D says both are excused, but neither can recover from the other. That might not be accurate because the woman has already paid $1,000, and if the contract is excused, she should be able to get that money back.\n\nOptions B and C suggest that the distributor is not excused from performance due to supervening illegality, which contradicts the general principle that supervening illegality excuses performance.\n\nI think option A is the most accurate: the distributor's performance is excused because of impossibility (specifically, supervening illegality), and the woman can seek restitution for the $1,000 she already paid.\n\nBut let me double-check. In contract law, when performance becomes impossible due to supervening illegality, the affected party is generally excused from performing. The woman, having already paid $1,000, would be entitled to restitution of that amount since the consideration she was to receive (the cymbidium) can no longer be provided.\n\nSo, option A seems correct. Options B and C suggest that the distributor is not excused, which doesn't align with the principle of impossibility due to supervening illegality. Option D says neither can recover from the other, but in this case, the woman has a claim for restitution of her $1,000.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A: the distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
