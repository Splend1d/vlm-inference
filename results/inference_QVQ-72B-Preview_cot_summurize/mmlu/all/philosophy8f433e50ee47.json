The question says, \"According to Sartre, the first principle of existentialism is that _____.\" And the options are:\n\nA. God is dead\n\nB. man is all-powerful\n\nC. man is nothing else but what he makes of himself\n\nD. man is nothing\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that Sartre was a key figure in existentialism, and he had some pretty influential ideas about existence and freedom.\n\nFirst off, option A says \"God is dead.\" I know that Nietzsche famously said, \"God is dead,\" but I'm not sure if that's a core principle of existentialism as Sartre understood it. Sartre was an atheist, so he did believe that there was no God, but I think his starting point in existentialism is a bit different.\n\nOption B says \"man is all-powerful.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Existentialism emphasizes human freedom and responsibility, but it doesn't claim that humans are all-powerful. That seems a bit extreme. So, probably not the first principle.\n\nOption C says \"man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.\" This sounds familiar. I think Sartre emphasized that our existence precedes our essence, meaning that we create our own nature through our choices and actions. So, in a way, we are what we make ourselves to be. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D says \"man is nothing.\" That sounds too nihilistic. While Sartre did talk about the nothingness of existence in a philosophical sense, I don't think he believed that humans are nothing. In fact, his philosophy places a lot of emphasis on individual choice and existence.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, option C seems the most accurate. Let me double-check.\n\nI recall that Sartre's famous quote is, \"Existence precedes essence,\" which means that humans don't have a predetermined nature or purpose; they create their own essence through their choices. So, in that sense, \"man is nothing else but what he makes of himself\" aligns with that idea.\n\nOption A, \"God is dead,\" might be related to Sartre's atheism, but it's not the foundational principle of existentialism as he conceived it.\n\nOption B, \"man is all-powerful,\" doesn't align with Sartre's views because he recognized limitations imposed by reality, but emphasized that within those limitations, we have the freedom to choose our actions.\n\nOption D, \"man is nothing,\" contradicts Sartre's emphasis on human agency and the importance of individual choices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
