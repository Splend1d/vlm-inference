                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of these people was not alive in the 20th century? A. Mark Twain, B. Thomas Edison, C. Sigmund Freud, D. Ulysses S. Grant.\" Alright, I need to figure out which one of these famous people didn't live during the 20th century. The 20th century runs from January 1, 1901, to December 31, 2000. So, I need to check the birth and death years of each person to see who didn't make it into that timeframe.\n\nFirst up, Mark Twain. I remember he was an American author and humorist. I think he was born in the mid-1800s. Let me see... I believe he was born in 1835 and died in 1910. Wait, 1910 is still in the 20th century. So, he was alive during part of the 20th century. Maybe he does count as being alive in the 20th century.\n\nNext, Thomas Edison. He was an inventor and businessman, famous for inventing the light bulb and other things. I think he was born in the 1800s too. Let me recall... I think he was born in 1847 and died in 1931. Again, 1931 is in the 20th century. So, he was alive during a significant part of the 20th century.\n\nThen, Sigmund Freud. He was an Austrian psychoanalyst, known for founding psychoanalysis. I think he was born in the 1800s as well. Let me think... He was born in 1856 and died in 1939. So, he also lived well into the 20th century.\n\nLastly, Ulysses S. Grant. He was an American general and the 18th president of the United States. I think he was president in the late 19th century. Let me remember his birth and death years. I think he was born in 1822 and died in 1885. Wait, 1885 is before 1900, which means he died before the 20th century started in 1901. So, he wasn't alive in the 20th century.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and died in 1910, which means he lived through the early part of the 20th century. Thomas Edison was born in 1847 and died in 1931, covering even more of the 20th century. Sigmund Freud was born in 1856 and died in 1939, also spanning a large part of the 20th century. Ulysses S. Grant, however, was born in 1822 and died in 1885, which is entirely before the 20th century began.\n\nSo, based on this information, Ulysses S. Grant was not alive in the 20th century. I think the answer is D. Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly confirm the birth and death years for each:\n\n- Mark Twain: 1835-1910\n\n- Thomas Edison: 1847-1931\n\n- Sigmund Freud: 1856-1939\n\n- Ulysses S. Grant: 1822-1885\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is D. Ulysses S. Grant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
