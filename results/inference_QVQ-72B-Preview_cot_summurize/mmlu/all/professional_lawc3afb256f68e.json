                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about two brothers who own a piece of land as joint tenants. They both signed a deed to sell the land to a buyer. The first brother gave the deed to the second brother with instructions to take it to their lawyer for approval before giving it to the buyer. But the second brother, without permission, took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price. The question is, is this a good deed as to the first brother?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, what does it mean to own something as \"joint tenants\"? I remember that in joint tenancy, each owner has an equal share in the property, and there's a right of survivorship, meaning if one dies, the other automatically gets their share. But in this case, both are alive, so that might not be directly relevant here.\n\nBoth brothers signed the deed, so they both agreed to transfer the property. The issue seems to be with the delivery of the deed. The first brother wanted the deed to go to the lawyer for approval before going to the buyer, but the second brother bypassed that step and went straight to the buyer.\n\nIn property law, the delivery of the deed is crucial. It's not just about signing it; you have to intend to transfer ownership by delivering the deed to the buyer or making it accessible to them. Normally, both grantors must consent to the delivery if they both signed the deed.\n\nOption A says no, because the first brother didn't participate in the delivery to the buyer and didn't intend to deliver it at that time. That makes sense because the first brother wanted the lawyer to review it first.\n\nOption B says yes, because the second brother was the apparent agent for the first brother in delivering the deed. Hmm, apparent agency would require that the first brother somehow represented to the buyer that the second brother had authority to act on his behalf. But in this case, the first brother specifically instructed the second brother to take it to the lawyer first, not directly to the buyer. So, it's not clear if the buyer knew about this instruction. If the buyer didn't know about the instruction and reasonably believed that the second brother had the authority to deliver the deed, then apparent agency might apply.\n\nOption C says yes, because the deed was signed by both partners, showing their intent to sell, and delivery occurred at the time of signing by affixing their signatures. Wait, I thought that signing and delivering are separate acts. Signing expresses the intent to transfer, but delivery is the act that completes the transfer. So, just because they signed it doesn't mean it's automatically delivered at that moment.\n\nOption D says no, because the second brother exceeded his authority. This seems similar to Option A but applies to both grantors. But if the first brother didn't authorize the delivery, and the second brother acted beyond his authority, then perhaps the deed isn't valid as to the first brother.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully. In joint tenancy, both owners must consent to the transfer. If one owner acts without the other's consent, the transfer might be invalid. However, if the buyer is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the internal disagreements, the buyer might still get good title.\n\nBut in this scenario, the question is specifically about whether the deed is good as to the first brother. So, even if the buyer is a bona fide purchaser, if the first brother didn't consent to the delivery, his interest might not be transferred properly.\n\nLet me consider the concept of delivery in more detail. Delivery requires not only the physical transfer of the deed but also the grantor's intent to transfer title at that time. If the first brother intended for the deed to go to the lawyer first, and not directly to the buyer, then the delivery by the second brother without his consent might not be effective as to his interest.\n\nOn the other hand, if the second brother had apparent authority to deliver the deed, then the delivery might be effective. Apparent authority arises when a principal holds out an agent as having certain powers, and a third party relies on that representation.\n\nIn this case, did the first brother hold out the second brother as having the authority to deliver the deed directly to the buyer? It seems not, because he instructed the second brother to take it to the lawyer first. Unless the buyer was unaware of this instruction and reasonably believed that the second brother had the authority to deliver the deed directly, apparent agency might not apply.\n\nPerhaps the buyer knew about the lawyer's review but still accepted the deed from the second brother. If that's the case, then the buyer wasn't acting in good faith, and the delivery might be invalid as to the first brother's interest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the buyer was unaware of the lawyer's involvement and reasonably believed that the second brother had the authority to deliver the deed. In that scenario, apparent agency might make the delivery effective.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify whether the buyer knew about the lawyer's review or not. Without that information, it's hard to determine if apparent agency applies.\n\nLet me look back at the options.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that the first brother didn't intend to deliver the deed at that time, which aligns with the fact that he wanted it to go to the lawyer first. So, his intent was to have a review before finalizing the transfer.\n\nOption B suggests apparent agency, but given that the first brother didn't intend for the second brother to deliver the deed directly to the buyer, this might not hold up unless the buyer was unaware of the lawyer's involvement.\n\nOption C seems off because signing and delivering are distinct acts. Signing expresses the intent to transfer, but delivery is the act that completes the transfer. So, just because they signed it doesn't mean it's automatically delivered.\n\nOption D says the deed is invalid as to both grantors because the second brother exceeded his authority. But the first brother did sign the deed, indicating his intent to transfer, just not necessarily at the time and manner it was delivered.\n\nI think the key here is the first brother's intent regarding the delivery of the deed. He wanted the deed to go to the lawyer for approval first, implying that he didn't intend to deliver it to the buyer yet. Therefore, the delivery by the second brother without his consent might not be effective as to his interest.\n\nSo, Option A seems the most appropriate answer: no, the deed cannot bind the first brother because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.\n\nBut I should consider if there's any other doctrine that could make the delivery effective despite the first brother's instructions. For example, if the second brother had actual authority or if there was a partnership where one partner could bind the other, but in this case, they are brothers in joint tenancy, not necessarily partners in a business sense.\n\nAlso, if the first brother ratified the delivery after the fact, that could make it effective, but the problem doesn't mention any ratification.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time."
