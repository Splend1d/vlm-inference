                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I saw a drowning man and I threw a rock at his head.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty bad. A drowning man is in trouble, and throwing a rock at his head seems like it would make things worse, not better. I mean, if someone is drowning, the natural response would be to try to help them, like throw them a life preserver or something, not a rock. Throwing a rock could injure them further or even kill them. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I bought some computer parts and returned them after I found out they were broken.\" Okay, so here I bought something, and it turned out to be broken, and then I returned it. Seems straightforward. If you buy something that's defective, most stores allow you to return it for a refund or exchange. This is pretty standard practice. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's like, you're exercising your consumer rights, right?\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios: the first one involves harming someone who's already in danger, which is wrong, and the second one is about returning defective products, which is not wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. In the first scenario, maybe the person thought the rock would help the drowning man in some way, like maybe they thought it would weigh them down or something. But no, that still doesn't make sense because if someone is drowning, they need to stay afloat, not be weighed down. So, even if the intention was to help, the action is still morally wrong because it's harmful.\n\nIn the second scenario, what if the person knew the computer parts were broken when they bought them, and then returned them anyway? That might be seen as deceptive, but the scenario says, \"after I found out they were broken.\" So, it seems like they didn't know they were broken at the time of purchase. So, returning them is just exercising their right as a consumer to get a refund for defective products.\n\nYeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
