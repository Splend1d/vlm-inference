                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about using computerized test services for the MMPI-2, which is a personality test that psychologists often use. The psychologist in question wants to use a computerized service to help with scoring and interpreting the results, and there are four options provided. I need to choose the one that accurately reflects what the psychologist should be aware of.\n\nOption A says that using computerized interpretations is prohibited by ethical guidelines. Hmm, that seems pretty strong. I don't recall any ethical guidelines that specifically prohibit the use of computerized interpretations. In fact, with the advancement of technology, I think it's quite common to use computerized systems for scoring and interpretation, especially for complex tests like the MMPI-2. So, I doubt that it's prohibited.\n\nOption B states that computerized scoring and interpretation services are notoriously unreliable. Again, this doesn't align with what I know. While no system is perfect, computerized scoring can be very accurate and consistent, reducing the chance of human error in calculations. Interpretations provided by these services are often based on large databases and established norms, which can be quite reliable. So, I think this option is also misleading.\n\nOption C suggests that computerized interpretations should always be supplemented with other information obtained by the psychologist. This sounds reasonable. Psychological assessments are multifaceted, and while computerized interpretations can provide valuable insights, they might not capture the full picture of an individual's personality or circumstances. Psychologists are trained to integrate information from various sources, including test results, interviews, observations, and sometimes other assessments. Therefore, using computerized interpretations in conjunction with other data can offer a more comprehensive understanding of the client.\n\nOption D claims that because of their objectivity, computerized interpretations are preferable to subjective interpretations. While objectivity in scoring and interpretation is a benefit of computerized systems, it's important to remember that psychological assessments involve more than just numbers. Psychologists bring their expertise, clinical judgment, and understanding of the client's context to interpret test results. Computerized interpretations might lack the nuance and depth that a trained psychologist can provide. So, it's not necessarily true that they are always preferable.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the best answer is Option C: computerized interpretations should always be supplemented with other information obtained by the psychologist. This approach ensures that the assessment is thorough and takes into account all relevant factors beyond just the test scores.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll think about it a bit more. Is there any possibility that ethical guidelines prohibit the use of computerized interpretations? I don't think so. Ethical guidelines typically emphasize the need for psychologists to use assessment tools competently and to interpret results responsibly. They might require that psychologists validate the use of computerized systems and ensure that interpretations are appropriate for the population being tested, but I don't believe they prohibit their use outright.\n\nAs for the reliability of computerized scoring and interpretation services, while they can be highly accurate, it's possible that some services may have limitations or may not be updated with the latest research. However, the statement in Option B is too absolute and doesn't reflect the general usefulness of these services.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option C is the most accurate statement. It emphasizes the importance of integrating computerized interpretations with other forms of information, which is a best practice in psychological assessment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
