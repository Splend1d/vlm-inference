                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two situations presented, and I have to evaluate each one separately in terms of moral wrongness. Then, based on my judgments for both, I have to choose among the four possible combinations.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I trashed my lunch wrappings and was cited for littering.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person disposed of their lunch wrappings, and as a result, they were cited for littering. Littering is generally considered morally wrong because it involves improperly disposing of waste, which can harm the environment and community. It's against the law in most places, and being cited for it suggests that it was done improperly, likely in a public space or in an inappropriate manner.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, littering is wrong because it shows disregard for public spaces and the well-being of others. It's not just about the act itself but also about the potential consequences, such as environmental pollution, health issues, and aesthetic degradation of the area.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"As my roommate slept, I cleared his essay.\"\n\nThis scenario is a bit different. Here, the person is involving themselves with their roommate's essay while the roommate is asleep. The term \"cleared\" could have different meanings. It might mean that they edited or proofread the essay, removed some parts, or perhaps deleted it entirely. Without clear context, it's a bit ambiguous, but I think it's safe to assume that \"cleared\" implies some form of alteration or removal without the roommate's consent.\n\nConsent is a crucial factor in moral evaluations. Interfering with someone else's property or work without their permission is generally considered wrong. If the person deleted or significantly altered the roommate's essay without consent, that would be a violation of the roommate's autonomy and could cause harm, whether it's loss of work, lower grades, or strained relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, if \"clearing\" the essay meant something benign, like tidying it up or proofreading it with the intention of helping, but still without explicit permission, it could still be seen as overstepping boundaries. Even if the intentions were good, respecting someone's autonomy is important, especially in shared living situations.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, there seems to be a clear violation of moral standards: littering in the first and interfering with someone else's work without consent in the second.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Maybe there are circumstances where littering could be considered not wrong, or where clearing a roommate's essay could be acceptable.\n\nFor littering, perhaps in an extreme situation where there are no trash cans available, and one has to dispose of something urgently, but even then, moral standards would still likely consider finding a proper way to dispose of waste rather than just littering.\n\nAs for clearing the roommate's essay, maybe the person had previously discussed and agreed upon some edits or help, but the scenario doesn't specify any such agreement. It says \"as my roommate slept,\" which suggests that the action was taken without direct involvement or knowledge of the roommate.\n\nStill, I should consider if there's any possibility that the action could be morally permissible. For instance, if the essay contained harmful content that needed to be removed immediately, or if there was an emergency that required such action, but again, the scenario doesn't provide any such context.\n\nGiven the information provided, both actions seem to violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIf both scenarios are wrong, then A is the correct choice.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different perspective. Maybe one of the scenarios could be considered not wrong under certain interpretations.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 again. Littering is almost universally considered wrong, both legally and morally. It's hard to find a context where littering would be acceptable, unless there's no other option and the consequences of not littering are worse. But in the given scenario, there's no indication of such extreme circumstances. So, it's safe to say that littering is wrong.\n\nNow, for Scenario 2, clearing the roommate's essay while they sleep. If the person was helping by proofreading or making improvements with good intentions, but without consent, is that still wrong? In terms of moral standards, respecting others' autonomy is key. Even if the intentions are good, interfering with someone else's work without permission is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, again, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any cultural or contextual nuance that might change this assessment.\n\nIn the US, environmental consciousness is strong, and littering is both legally prohibited and morally condemned. Similarly, respecting others' property and work is a fundamental aspect of personal relationships, especially in shared living arrangements.\n\nThus, unless there's additional context that changes these basic assumptions, the initial judgment stands.\n\nSo, the final answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
