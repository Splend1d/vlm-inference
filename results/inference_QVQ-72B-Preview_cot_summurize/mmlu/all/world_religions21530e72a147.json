Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Buddhism has monastic orders for both men and women. The male monks are usually referred to as Bhikshus. So, maybe the female counterparts are called Bhikshunis? That sounds familiar. Yeah, I think that's right. Bhikshuni is the term used for ordained women in Buddhism.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that the Buddha established an order for nuns, which is known as the Bhikshuni Sangha. So, Bhikshuni seems to be the correct term for ordained women.\n\nNow, what about the other options? The Sangha is actually the community of Buddhist monks and nuns collectively. So, it's not specifically for women; it includes both males and females. Therefore, The Sangha isn't the right answer here.\n\nArhats are realized beings who have achieved enlightenment and are free from rebirth. While both male and female monks can attain Arhatship, the term doesn't specifically denote ordained women.\n\nBhikshus, as I mentioned earlier, are the ordained male monks. So, that leaves Bhikshunis as the correct answer for ordained women.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other terminology that might be used specifically for ordained women in Buddhism. For instance, in some traditions, nuns might be referred to by different titles, but I believe Bhikshuni is the most common and widely recognized term across different Buddhist traditions.\n\nI should also consider whether the term varies based on the school or tradition of Buddhism. For example, in Theravada Buddhism, nuns are called Bhikshunis, while in Mahayana traditions, they might be referred to as Bhikshunis as well, or sometimes by other names. However, Bhikshuni seems to be a universal term used across these traditions.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in some Buddhist countries, there might be different terms for different types of nuns, such as novice nuns or fully ordained nuns. But again, Bhikshuni is generally used for fully ordained nuns.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles here. Based on my knowledge, Bhikshuni is the correct term for ordained women in Buddhism. So, the answer should be B. Bhikshunis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
