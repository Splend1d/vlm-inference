                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Cicero's view on human nature. It says that according to Cicero, each person is invested by Nature with two characters, and I need to choose between universal and individual, virtuous and vicious, good and evil, or divine and beastly. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who lived in the 1st century BC. He was deeply influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly Stoicism, which emphasized reason, virtue, and the natural law governing the universe. So, his views on human nature are likely rooted in Stoic thought.\n\nLet me recall what I know about Stoic philosophy. Stoics believed that humans are rational beings and that reason is the foundation of morality and ethics. They also thought that all people are part of a cosmic order and that there is a universal aspect to human nature.\n\nNow, applying this to Cicero's view, I need to understand what he meant by \"two characters\" invested by Nature. It seems like he's suggesting that each person has dual aspects or natures that are inherent from birth.\n\nOption A is \"universal and individual.\" This resonates with Stoic ideas. Stoics believed in a universal reason or logos that connects all rational beings, which would be the universal character. At the same time, each person has individual characteristics and personalities. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B is \"virtuous and vicious.\" While Stoics emphasized virtue as the highest good and considered vice as something to be overcome, I don't recall them positing that every person is inherently both virtuous and vicious. Rather, they would say that people have the potential for virtue but may act viciously due to ignorance or bad habits. So, maybe not the primary way they'd characterize human nature.\n\nOption C is \"good and evil.\" Similar to the previous point, Stoics would likely see goodness as aligning with nature and reason, while evil is acting against nature. But again, I don't think they viewed people as inherently possessing both good and evil characters. Perhaps more as tendencies or choices rather than inherent natures.\n\nOption D is \"divine and beastly.\" This is interesting. Stoics believed in a divine spark or rational soul in humans, connecting them to the cosmic reason. However, they also recognized animalistic or base instincts in humans. But I'm not sure if Cicero specifically framed human nature in terms of divine and beastly characters.\n\nLet me think more deeply about this. Cicero was familiar with both Stoic and Epicurean philosophies, though he often critiqued both. In his work \"De Natura Deorum\" (On the Nature of the Gods), he discusses various views on human nature.\n\nIn that context, I recall that Cicero discussed the idea that humans have both a physical body (which could be seen as individual and particular) and a rational soul (which participates in the universal reason). This might suggest a division into universal and individual characters.\n\nAlternatively, in his moral and political writings, Cicero emphasizes the dual nature of humans as social and individual beings, again pointing towards a universal and individual dichotomy.\n\nConsidering this, option A seems the most fitting based on Cicero's philosophical leanings and the way he discusses human nature.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any direct evidence from Cicero's works that supports this view.\n\nIn his \"Tusculum Disputations,\" Cicero explores ethical topics, including the nature of the good life and the role of reason in achieving it. He often refers to the natural law and the universal reason that governs the cosmos, suggesting that humans share in this universal principle.\n\nMoreover, in \"De Officiis\" (On Duties), Cicero discusses the duties that arise from our nature as rational and social beings. He argues that our obligations stem from both our universal connection to all rational beings and our particular roles in society and family.\n\nThis further reinforces the idea that Cicero saw humans as possessing both universal and individual characters.\n\nNow, to make sure I'm not missing something, I'll consider if there's any other aspect of Cicero's thought that might suggest a different pairing.\n\nFor instance, in his treatise \"On the Republic,\" Cicero delves into the concept of the ideal state and the role of virtue in politics. He discusses the importance of balancing different interests and virtues, but again, this seems more about the expression of human nature rather than inherent characters.\n\nSimilarly, in his \"On the Laws,\" he explores the foundation of law in natural law and reason, again emphasizing the universal aspect of human nature.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether Cicero believed in the duality of human nature in terms of morality.\n\nSome philosophers, like Augustine, later spoke of the conflict between the flesh and the spirit, but Augustine was a Christian philosopher living several centuries after Cicero. So, perhaps not directly comparable.\n\nIn Cicero's time, the Stoics believed in the tension between our rational nature and our passions, but they didn't necessarily see this as a dual character invested by nature.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Cicero was influenced by Platonic thought, which often spoke of the soul having different parts, such as the rational and the appetitive.\n\nHowever, Plato's tripartite division of the soul into reason, spirit, and appetite doesn't directly correspond to the options given here.\n\nMoreover, Cicero was more aligned with Stoicism than Platonism, although he drew from multiple philosophical schools.\n\nGiven all this, I still think that option A, \"universal and individual,\" is the most accurate reflection of Cicero's view on the two characters invested by Nature in each person.\n\nTo wrap it up, Cicero, influenced by Stoic philosophy, likely saw humans as possessing both a universal character, derived from the rational and cosmic order, and an individual character, shaped by personal traits and circumstances. This dual aspect of human nature forms the basis for his ethical and political thought.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
