                    "text": "I've got this problem here about a cube with numbers on each face, and each vertex has a label that's the product of the three adjacent face numbers. The sum of all these vertex labels is 1001, and I need to find the sum of the numbers on the faces. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize a cube and its faces. A cube has six faces, each corresponding to one of the six directions: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Let's assign variables to these faces. Suppose:\n\n- Let \\( a \\) be the number on the front face.\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number on the back face.\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number on the left face.\n\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number on the right face.\n\n- Let \\( e \\) be the number on the top face.\n\n- Let \\( f \\) be the number on the bottom face.\n\nNow, each vertex is where three faces meet. For example, one vertex is where the front, left, and top faces meet, so its label would be \\( a \\times c \\times e \\). Similarly, another vertex where front, right, and top faces meet would have the label \\( a \\times d \\times e \\), and so on for all eight vertices.\n\nThe sum of all vertex labels is given as 1001. So, I need to sum up the products of the three face numbers for each vertex and set that equal to 1001.\n\nLet me list out the products for each vertex:\n\n1. Front-left-top: \\( a \\times c \\times e \\)\n\n2. Front-right-top: \\( a \\times d \\times e \\)\n\n3. Front-left-bottom: \\( a \\times c \\times f \\)\n\n4. Front-right-bottom: \\( a \\times d \\times f \\)\n\n5. Back-left-top: \\( b \\times c \\times e \\)\n\n6. Back-right-top: \\( b \\times d \\times e \\)\n\n7. Back-left-bottom: \\( b \\times c \\times f \\)\n\n8. Back-right-bottom: \\( b \\times d \\times f \\)\n\nNow, summing these up:\n\n\\( s = a c e + a d e + a c f + a d f + b c e + b d e + b c f + b d f = 1001 \\)\n\nI can factor this sum to simplify it. Let's group terms:\n\n\\( s = a (c e + d e + c f + d f) + b (c e + d e + c f + d f) = 1001 \\)\n\nNotice that \\( c e + d e + c f + d f \\) can be factored:\n\n\\( c e + d e + c f + d f = e (c + d) + f (c + d) = (c + d)(e + f) \\)\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n\\( s = a (c + d)(e + f) + b (c + d)(e + f) = (a + b)(c + d)(e + f) = 1001 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( (a + b)(c + d)(e + f) = 1001 \\)\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the numbers on the faces, which is \\( a + b + c + d + e + f \\). So, I need to express this sum in terms of the given information.\n\nI have \\( (a + b)(c + d)(e + f) = 1001 \\), and I need to find \\( a + b + c + d + e + f \\).\n\nLet me denote:\n\n\\( x = a + b \\)\n\n\\( y = c + d \\)\n\n\\( z = e + f \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes \\( x y z = 1001 \\), and I need to find \\( x + y + z \\).\n\nNow, I need to find positive integers \\( x, y, z \\) such that \\( x y z = 1001 \\), and all of \\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\) are positive integers.\n\nFirst, factorize 1001 to find possible values for \\( x, y, z \\).\n\n\\( 1001 \\div 7 = 143 \\), so \\( 1001 = 7 \\times 143 \\)\n\n\\( 143 \\div 11 = 13 \\), so \\( 143 = 11 \\times 13 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( 1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\)\n\nSo, the possible triplets \\( (x, y, z) \\) are permutations of \\( (7, 11, 13) \\), since all are prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, \\( x + y + z = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31 \\)\n\nBut wait, I need to ensure that such an assignment of \\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\) is possible with these sums.\n\nLet me assume \\( x = 7 \\), \\( y = 11 \\), \\( z = 13 \\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\( a + b = 7 \\)\n\n\\( c + d = 11 \\)\n\n\\( e + f = 13 \\)\n\nNow, I need to assign specific values to \\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\) such that these sums hold, and all are positive integers.\n\nBut actually, since the problem doesn't specify unique assignments, and only requires that the product of the sums is 1001, and the sum of all faces is \\( x + y + z = 31 \\), and given that 31 is one of the options, it seems plausible.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should check if there are other possible factorizations considering that the faces could have common factors, but since 7, 11, and 13 are all primes, the only triplet is \\( (7, 11, 13) \\) and its permutations.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the numbers on the faces is 31.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
