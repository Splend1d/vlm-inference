                    "text": "So I have this question about intention tremors. Let me see what an intention tremor is and which of these options is true.\n\nFirst off, I know that a tremor is an involuntary shaking movement. There are different types of tremors, like resting tremors, action tremors, and intention tremors. I think an intention tremor is a type of action tremor, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption A says it's worse at rest. Hmm, I don't think that's correct. I believe resting tremors are worse when you're not moving, like in Parkinson's disease, where your hand shakes when it's at rest. Intention tremors, I think, happen when you're trying to reach for something or move your limb towards a target. So, it's the opposite; it's worse when you're moving, not at rest. So, option A is probably false.\n\nOption B says it's caused by Parkinson's disease. I know that Parkinson's disease is associated with resting tremors, not intention tremors. So, again, that seems misleading. Parkinson's primarily affects the basal ganglia, which are involved in movement control, but intention tremors are more related to the cerebellum. So, I don't think Parkinson's disease causes intention tremors. Maybe it can co-occur, but it's not the primary cause. So, option B is likely false.\n\nOption C says it is indicative of a cerebellar lesion. Okay, this sounds familiar. The cerebellum is involved in coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining posture and balance, and fine-tuning motor movements. If there's a lesion in the cerebellum, it could lead to problems like ataxia, dysmetria, and intention tremors. So, yes, an intention tremor can be a sign of a cerebellar lesion. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says dyscalculia is a common association. Dyscalculia is a learning disability that affects a person's ability to understand numbers and learn math facts. I don't recall any direct link between intention tremors and dyscalculia. They seem unrelated. Intention tremors are more about motor control, while dyscalculia is about numerical cognition. So, I doubt that dyscalculia is a common association with intention tremors. Maybe it's a coincidence if someone has both conditions.\n\nBased on my understanding, option C seems to be the correct answer. An intention tremor is indicative of a cerebellar lesion. The other options don't seem to align with what I know about intention tremors.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Intention tremors are indeed associated with lesions in the cerebellum. The cerebellum plays a crucial role in motor control, and any damage to it can lead to various motor coordination issues, including intention tremors. So, yes, option C is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because intention tremors are worse during movement, not at rest. Option B is incorrect because Parkinson's disease is more associated with resting tremors, not intention tremors. Option D is incorrect as there doesn't seem to be a direct link between intention tremors and dyscalculia.\n\nTherefore, the true statement about an intention tremor is option C: it is indicative of a cerebellar lesion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
