                    "text": "So I have this question about radioactive decay. It's been a while since I studied this, but I think I remember some key points. The question is about three half-lives after an isotope is prepared, and there are four options to choose from. Let me try to understand what a half-life is first.\n\nA half-life is the time it takes for half of the amount of a substance to decay into another form, usually due to radioactivity. So, if I start with 100% of an isotope, after one half-life, I should have 50% left, after two half-lives, 25%, and so on.\n\nWait, but the options are a bit confusing. Option A says 25% is left, and option C says 12.5% is left. Option B says 25% decayed, and option D says 12.5% decayed. So, I need to figure out which one correctly describes the situation after three half-lives.\n\nLet me think in terms of percentages. If I start with 100%, after one half-life, 50% remains, which means 50% has decayed. After two half-lives, half of the remaining 50% decays, so that's 25% remaining, and 75% has decayed. After three half-lives, half of the 25% remains, which is 12.5%, and therefore, 87.5% has decayed.\n\nSo, according to this, after three half-lives, 12.5% is left, and 87.5% has decayed. That would make option C correct for what's left, and option D incorrect because it says 12.5% decayed, but according to my calculation, it's 87.5% decayed.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the decayed percentage. After one half-life, 50% decayed. After two, total decayed is 75% (50% + 25%). After three, it should be 75% + 12.5% = 87.5%, as I said.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of fractions. Starting with 1 (or 100%), after one half-life, 1/2 remains. After two, (1/2)^2 = 1/4 remains. After three, (1/2)^3 = 1/8 remains. So, 1/8 is 12.5%, which matches option C.\n\nBut option A says 25% is left, which would correspond to two half-lives, not three. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B says 25% decayed. Let's see: after one half-life, 50% decayed, after two, 75%, after three, 87.5%. So, 25% decayed would correspond to after one half-life, not three.\n\nOption D says 12.5% decayed, but as I calculated, after three half-lives, 87.5% has decayed, not 12.5%.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct answer: 12.5% of the isotope is left after three half-lives.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the question. The question says \"three half-lives after an isotope is prepared.\" It doesn't specify anything else, like any reactions or changes that might affect the isotope beyond its natural decay.\n\nSo, in standard radioactive decay, the amount left after n half-lives is (1/2)^n times the initial amount. So, three half-lives would be (1/2)^3 = 1/8 = 12.5% left. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nI think I might have overthought it initially by calculating the decayed percentage, but the main point is that after three half-lives, only 12.5% is left, which matches option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
