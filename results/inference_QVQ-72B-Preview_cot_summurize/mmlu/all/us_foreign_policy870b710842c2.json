The question is asking whether it's a proposal for reform of the US system of government, a proposal for the extension of democratic rule globally, a proposal for the extension of free markets, or both B and C.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"democratic enlargement\" refers to. The word \"democratic\" obviously points towards democracy, which is a system of government where the power is held by the people, typically through elected representatives. \"Enlargement\" suggests an expansion or increase in size or scope. So, putting these together, \"democratic enlargement\" likely refers to the expansion or promotion of democracy in some way.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. A proposal for reform of the US system of government\n\nThis could be a possibility, but the term \"democratic enlargement\" seems more geared towards expanding democracy beyond just reforming one specific country's system, especially since the US already has a democratic system.\n\nB. A proposal for the extension of democratic rule globally\n\nThis seems plausible. Many democratic nations promote democracy as a universal value and support its spread around the world. \"Democratic enlargement\" could be associated with efforts to encourage other countries to adopt democratic principles and practices.\n\nC. A proposal for the extension of free markets\n\nWhile free markets are often linked with democracy, they are not the same thing. Democracy relates to the political system, whereas free markets pertain to the economic system. It's possible that \"democratic enlargement\" could include aspects of economic freedom, but the primary focus seems to be on political democracy.\n\nD. Both B and C\n\nThis would suggest that \"democratic enlargement\" encompasses both the spread of democracy and the promotion of free markets. While these two concepts are often linked in practice, especially in Western ideologies, it's important to distinguish between them.\n\nAfter considering these options, I think the most accurate answer is B: a proposal for the extension of democratic rule globally. The term \"democratic enlargement\" directly suggests an expansion of democracy, which would likely involve promoting democratic values and systems in countries that do not currently have them.\n\nOption A seems less likely because the US already has a democratic system, so \"enlargement\" in this context would imply expanding democracy beyond the US borders rather than reforming its own system.\n\nOption C refers to free markets, which are related to economics rather than directly to democracy. While some may argue that free markets are an integral part of democratic societies, the term \"democratic enlargement\" primarily focuses on the political aspect of democracy.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: a proposal for the extension of democratic rule globally.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
