                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Ms. Gutierrez has 32 students, and each needs a piece of rope that's 5 feet 8 inches long. I need to find out the total length of rope she should order. The options are quite close, so I have to be precise.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the length of each piece into inches because inches are smaller units and might make addition easier. I know that one foot equals 12 inches. So, 5 feet would be 5 times 12 inches.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n5 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\n\nNow, each piece is 5 feet 8 inches, so that's 60 inches plus 8 inches.\n\n60 inches + 8 inches = 68 inches.\n\nSo, each student gets 68 inches of rope.\n\nNow, there are 32 students, so I need to multiply 68 inches by 32.\n\nHmm, 68 times 32.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 68 \u00d7 30 = 2040.\n\nThen, 68 \u00d7 2 = 136.\n\nAdding those together: 2040 + 136 = 2176 inches.\n\nSo, the total length needed is 2176 inches.\n\nNow, I should convert that back to feet and inches to see which option matches.\n\nI know that there are 12 inches in a foot.\n\nSo, I'll divide 2176 by 12.\n\nLet me do that division.\n\n2176 \u00f7 12.\n\nFirst, 12 \u00d7 180 = 2160.\n\nSubtract that from 2176: 2176 - 2160 = 16 inches.\n\nSo, that's 180 feet and 16 inches.\n\nBut let's double-check that.\n\n12 \u00d7 180 = 2160.\n\n2176 - 2160 = 16 inches.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 106 feet 8 inches\n\nB. 154 feet 8 inches\n\nC. 160 feet 8 inches\n\nD. 181 feet 4 inches\n\nHmm, none of these match exactly 180 feet 16 inches.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nEach piece is 5 feet 8 inches.\n\n5 feet is 60 inches.\n\nPlus 8 inches is 68 inches per student.\n\nTotal inches needed: 68 \u00d7 32.\n\nLet me recalculate that.\n\n68 \u00d7 32.\n\nI can break it down:\n\n60 \u00d7 32 = 1920 inches.\n\n8 \u00d7 32 = 256 inches.\n\nAdding up: 1920 + 256 = 2176 inches.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, converting 2176 inches to feet and inches.\n\nDivide by 12.\n\n12 \u00d7 180 = 2160 inches.\n\n2176 - 2160 = 16 inches.\n\nSo, 180 feet 16 inches.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options directly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to simplify 180 feet 16 inches.\n\nCan I simplify 16 inches into feet?\n\nWell, 16 inches is 1 foot 4 inches.\n\nSo, 180 feet + 1 foot 4 inches = 181 feet 4 inches.\n\nAh, so that's option D: 181 feet 4 inches.\n\nI see, I had the right number of inches but needed to convert them properly.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 181 feet 4 inches.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
