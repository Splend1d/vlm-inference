                    "text": "So I have this problem about the American flag's dimensions. It says that the width and length are in the ratio of 10 to 19, and I need to find which set of dimensions matches this ratio from the given options. The options are:\n\nA. 30 ft by 53 ft\n\nB. 27 ft by 53 ft\n\nC. 27 in. by 57 in.\n\nD. 30 in. by 57 in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ratio of 10 to 19 means for the width and length of the flag. This means that for every 10 units of width, there are 19 units of length. So, width divided by length should be 10/19.\n\nMy goal is to check each option and see if the width to length ratio matches this.\n\nLet's start with option A: 30 ft by 53 ft.\n\nHere, the width is 30 ft and the length is 53 ft.\n\nTo find the ratio, I can divide the width by the length:\n\n30 / 53 \u2248 0.566\n\nBut 10 divided by 19 is approximately 0.526.\n\nSo, 0.566 is not equal to 0.526. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nNext, option B: 27 ft by 53 ft.\n\nWidth is 27 ft, length is 53 ft.\n\nDivide width by length:\n\n27 / 53 \u2248 0.509\n\nStill not matching 0.526.\n\nMoving on to option C: 27 in. by 57 in.\n\nHere, the units are in inches. Maybe the units are different, but the ratio should still hold.\n\nWidth is 27 in., length is 57 in.\n\nDivide width by length:\n\n27 / 57 \u2248 0.474\n\nNot equal to 0.526.\n\nLastly, option D: 30 in. by 57 in.\n\nWidth is 30 in., length is 57 in.\n\nDivide width by length:\n\n30 / 57 \u2248 0.526\n\nThis matches the required ratio of 10/19, which is approximately 0.526.\n\nSo, among all the options, only option D has the correct ratio.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption D: 30 in. by 57 in.\n\nLet me confirm the division:\n\n30 divided by 57.\n\nWell, 57 times 0.5 is 28.5, and 30 minus 28.5 is 1.5, so it's a bit more than 0.5.\n\nActually, 57 times 0.526 is approximately 30.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me cross-verify with the other options again.\n\nOption A: 30 ft by 53 ft\n\n30 / 53 \u2248 0.566 \u2260 0.526\n\nOption B: 27 ft by 53 ft\n\n27 / 53 \u2248 0.509 \u2260 0.526\n\nOption C: 27 in. by 57 in.\n\n27 / 57 \u2248 0.474 \u2260 0.526\n\nOption D: 30 in. by 57 in.\n\n30 / 57 \u2248 0.526 = 0.526\n\nYes, option D is the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the inches to feet to see if the ratio remains consistent, but since both dimensions are in inches, and the ratio is unitless, it shouldn't matter as long as I'm comparing the same units.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct dimensions that match the ratio of 10 to 19 for the American flag are 30 inches by 57 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
