                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this scenario about James making a written offer to Fred for some land. James offers to sell the land for $100,000 and says that the offer won't be revocable for ten days. The offer was signed on April 1, mailed on April 3, and received by Fred on April 5. Now, I need to figure out which statement is true based on that information.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a revocable offer is. Generally, an offer can be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance, unless there's some agreement not to revoke it. Here, James has said that the offer won't be revocable for ten days. That means Fred has at least ten days from when he receives the offer to accept it without worrying that James will change his mind.\n\nThe offer was received on April 5, so the ten-day period starts from that date. But wait, the offer was signed on April 1 and mailed on April 3. Does the starting point matter? I think the important date is when Fred receives the offer because he can't accept something he hasn't received yet.\n\nSo, Fred receives the offer on April 5, and it says the offer won't be revocable for ten days. That means Fred has until April 15 to accept the offer without it being revoked. But does that mean he can accept it after April 15, or is that the absolute deadline?\n\nI think that after the ten days, James could revoke the offer if he wants to, but during those ten days, Fred has the assurance that the offer won't be revoked.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10 will not create a contract.\n\nHmm, April 10 is within the ten-day period from April 5 to April 15. If Fred accepts on April 10, and it's an unqualified acceptance, meaning he agrees to the terms as offered, then according to the revocability period, that should create a contract. So, this option says it won't create a contract, but I think it should, given that it's within the revocability period and it's an unqualified acceptance. Maybe there's something else at play here.\n\nB. Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.\n\nOkay, so April 5 is when Fred receives the offer, and the offer says it's irrevocable for ten days. But if James dies on April 4, which is before Fred receives the offer, does that affect the validity of the offer?\n\nI recall that generally, if the offeror dies before the offeree accepts, the offer is terminated, and acceptance after the offeror's death doesn't create a contract. But in this case, the offer was made on April 1 and mailed on April 3, and James died on April 4. So, the offer was made before James died, but Fred didn't receive it until after James died.\n\nWait, no. The offer was mailed on April 3, and James died on April 4. So, the offer was in transit when James died.\n\nBut Fred received it on April 5, after James died. Does that matter?\n\nI think that if the offeror dies before the offeree receives the offer, the offer is terminated, and acceptance after the offeror's death is\u65e0\u6548. So, even if Fred accepts on April 5, since James died on April 4, the offer is terminated by James's death, and no contract is formed.\n\nBut wait, the offer was irrevocable for ten days. Does that mean that even if James died, the offer still stands for those ten days?\n\nI need to check that. In contract law, revocability and termination by death are separate concepts. Generally, an offer can be terminated by the death of the offeror, regardless of any revocability period.\n\nBut maybe the revocability period changes that.\n\nI think that even with a specified revocability period, if the offeror dies before the offeree accepts, the offer is terminated.\n\nSo, in this case, since James died on April 4, before Fred accepted, Fred's acceptance on April 5 wouldn't create a contract because the offer was terminated by James's death.\n\nSo, option B seems to be true.\n\nC. Fred stating on April 5, \"I accept your offer, but will pay only $90,000\" creates a contract.\n\nWait, this is a counteroffer. By saying he'll pay only $90,000, Fred is changing the terms of the original offer. In contract law, proposing different terms constitutes a counteroffer, which rejects the original offer and proposes a new one.\n\nSo, Fred's statement on April 5 is a counteroffer, not an acceptance. Therefore, it doesn't create a contract; instead, it rejects James's offer and makes a new one.\n\nSo, this option is false.\n\nD. Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 15 will not create a contract.\n\nOkay, the revocability period is ten days from April 5, which would end on April 15. So, April 15 is the last day of the revocability period.\n\nIf Fred accepts unqualifiedly on April 15, does that create a contract?\n\nWell, the offer said it wouldn't be revocable for ten days, which ends on April 15. So, accepting on April 15 should still be valid because the offer can't be revoked during that period.\n\nBut maybe there's a rule that acceptance must be within a reasonable time, and if the offer specifies a time period, acceptance must be within that period.\n\nSo, since the offer specifies a ten-day period starting from April 5, acceptance on April 15 should be valid.\n\nTherefore, this option says it will not create a contract, but I think it should.\n\nSo, this option is false.\n\nGiven this analysis, the only true statement seems to be option B: Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.\n\nBecause, even though the offer was made on April 1 and mailed on April 3, James died on April 4, before Fred received the offer. Generally, if the offeror dies before the offeree receives the offer, the offer is terminated, and acceptance after the offeror's death does not create a contract.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
