The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Frederick Douglass's perspective from 1857, and I need to figure out which group would be most likely to support his views. The options are:\n\nA. Southern Democrats in the 1880s\n\nB. Western ranchers in the 1850s\n\nC. Southern farmers in the 1830s\n\nD. Northern Republicans in the 1860s\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Douglass was saying in 1857. He was talking about the advantages that slaveholders had in maintaining the institution of slavery. He mentioned that slaveholders had complete organization on their side, including state governments in slave states, churches in those states, and even the federal government, including its army, navy, and Supreme Court, all pledged to support and defend slavery. He also mentions that these powerful entities were united against \"the simple truth\" preached by humble people in obscure places, likely referring to abolitionists.\n\nSo, Douglass was critiquing the pro-slavery establishment and highlighting how deeply entrenched and organized it was. He was an abolitionist himself, fighting against slavery, so his perspective is anti-slavery.\n\nNow, I need to find which group would support this perspective. That means I need to find a group that would agree with Douglass's critique of slavery and the systems supporting it.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Southern Democrats in the 1880s: Southern Democrats during this time were generally supportive of slavery and white supremacy, especially given the post-Reconstruction era when there was a backlash against civil rights gains. They wouldn't support Douglass's anti-slavery views.\n\nB. Western ranchers in the 1850s: This is a bit trickier. Western ranchers in the 1850s were mostly in areas like Texas, which was a slave state, or in territories where slavery was a contentious issue. Many ranchers might have been indifferent to slavery or saw it as a Southern issue. It's unclear if they would strongly support Douglass's views.\n\nC. Southern farmers in the 1830s: Southern farmers during this time were part of the slaveholding society. While some small farmers might not have owned many slaves, the culture was heavily pro-slavery. It's unlikely they would support Douglass's critique.\n\nD. Northern Republicans in the 1860s: This seems the most promising. The Republican Party in the North was largely opposed to slavery, especially leading up to the Civil War. In the 1860s, during and after the Civil War, Northern Republicans were involved in the abolitionist movement and in reconstructing the South to end slavery.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Northern Republicans in the 1860s would be most likely to support Frederick Douglass's perspective, as they were actively working against slavery and its support systems.\n\nBut let me double-check. Was the Republican Party in the 1860s uniformly abolitionist? I think Abraham Lincoln, who was a Republican, had complex views on slavery. Initially, he may not have been in favor of immediate abolition, but during the Civil War, he did issue the Emancipation Proclamation. So, overall, the Northern Republican Party during the 1860s was moving towards stronger anti-slavery positions, culminating in the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery.\n\nComparatively, the other groups were either supportive of slavery or indifferent to it. Therefore, the answer should be D. Northern Republicans in the 1860s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
