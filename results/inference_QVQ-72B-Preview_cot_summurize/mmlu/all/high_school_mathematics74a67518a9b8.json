                    "text": "So I've got this infinite series to evaluate: \\(\\frac{1}{2^1} + \\frac{2}{2^2} + \\frac{3}{2^3} + \\cdots + \\frac{k}{2^k} + \\cdots\\). At first glance, it looks a bit tricky because it's not just a simple geometric series where each term is a constant multiple of the previous one. But maybe I can find a way to relate it to a geometric series or use some other technique to find its sum.\n\nFirst, let's write out the series again to get a better look:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\cdots + \\frac{k}{2^k} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nI notice that the denominator is a power of 2, and the numerator is the exponent itself. So, it's not immediately obvious what the common ratio is, since both numerator and denominator are changing.\n\nMaybe I can think of this as a sum where each term is of the form \\(\\frac{k}{2^k}\\). So, \\(S = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k}{2^k}\\).\n\nHmm, I recall that geometric series have the form \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} ar^k\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio. In this case, if I consider \\(a = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\), then the sum would be \\(\\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 1\\). But that's just the sum of \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots = 2\\). Wait, that's different from my original series.\n\nWait a minute, my original series has the numerator increasing by 1 each time, while in a standard geometric series, the numerator is constant. So, perhaps I need to manipulate my series to relate it to a geometric series.\n\nLet me consider differentiating or integrating a geometric series, since that sometimes helps in finding sums of series with linear numerators.\n\nFirst, let's recall the sum of a geometric series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^k = \\frac{1}{1 - x}, \\quad \\text{for } |x| < 1\n\\]\n\nNow, if I differentiate both sides with respect to \\(x\\), I get:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k x^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(x\\) to adjust the exponent:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k x^{k} = \\frac{x}{(1 - x)^2}\n\\]\n\nThis looks promising because my series is exactly of this form, with \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, plugging in \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k}{2^k} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 2\n\\]\n\nWait, so the sum is 2? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I recalled the sum of a geometric series and then differentiated it. That seems correct. Then, I substituted \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) into the derived formula, and the arithmetic checks out. So, the sum should be 2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's try another approach to confirm.\n\nLet me consider the series again:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nI can write this as:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k}{2^k}\n\\]\n\nAnother way to approach this is to write the series and then manipulate it algebraically.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k}{2^k} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{S}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{4}{32} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nIf I subtract \\(\\frac{S}{2}\\) from \\(S\\), I get:\n\n\\[\nS - \\frac{S}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{2}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{2}{8}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{16} - \\frac{3}{16}\\right) + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{S}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so its sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{S}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nS = 2\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's calculate the partial sums and see if they approach 2.\n\nLet's compute the first few partial sums:\n\n\\[\nS_1 = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_3 = 1.0 + \\frac{3}{8} = 1.0 + 0.375 = 1.375\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_4 = 1.375 + \\frac{4}{16} = 1.375 + 0.25 = 1.625\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_5 = 1.625 + \\frac{5}{32} = 1.625 + 0.15625 = 1.78125\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_6 = 1.78125 + \\frac{6}{64} = 1.78125 + 0.09375 = 1.875\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_7 = 1.875 + \\frac{7}{128} = 1.875 + 0.0546875 = 1.9296875\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_8 = 1.9296875 + \\frac{8}{256} = 1.9296875 + 0.03125 = 1.9609375\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_9 = 1.9609375 + \\frac{9}{512} = 1.9609375 + 0.017578125 = 1.978515625\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_{10} = 1.978515625 + \\frac{10}{1024} = 1.978515625 + 0.009765625 = 1.98828125\n\\]\n\nAs we can see, the partial sums are approaching 2, which aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the series is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
