                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this expression: 5(4x + 3) - 2x. I need to find out which of these options is equivalent to it. The options are:\n\nA. 18x + 15\n\nB. 18x + 3\n\nC. 7x + 8\n\nD. 2x + 8\n\nOkay, so first thing I should do is simplify the expression I have. It's 5 times (4x + 3) minus 2x. Hmm, distributive property should be my first step here.\n\nSo, distributive property says that a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, 5 multiplied by 4x is 20x, and 5 multiplied by 3 is 15. So, 5(4x + 3) becomes 20x + 15.\n\nThen, I have to subtract 2x from that. So, 20x + 15 - 2x. Now, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. So, 20x and -2x are like terms.\n\n20x minus 2x is 18x. And then there's +15, which doesn't have any x, so it stays as +15.\n\nSo, the simplified expression should be 18x + 15.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 18x + 15\n\nB. 18x + 3\n\nC. 7x + 8\n\nD. 2x + 8\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct one.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again: 5(4x + 3) - 2x.\n\nDistribute 5: 5*4x = 20x, and 5*3 = 15.\n\nSo, 20x + 15 - 2x.\n\nCombine like terms: 20x - 2x = 18x, and +15.\n\nYes, that still gives me 18x + 15.\n\nLooking at option A, it says 18x + 15, which matches exactly.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's another way to approach this problem, just to verify.\n\nAnother way could be to plug in a value for x and see which option gives the same result as the original expression.\n\nLet's try x = 1.\n\nSo, original expression: 5(4*1 + 3) - 2*1 = 5(4 + 3) - 2 = 5*7 - 2 = 35 - 2 = 33.\n\nNow, plug x = 1 into each option:\n\nA. 18*1 + 15 = 33.\n\nB. 18*1 + 3 = 21.\n\nC. 7*1 + 8 = 15.\n\nD. 2*1 + 8 = 10.\n\nOnly option A gives 33, which matches the original expression.\n\nI think that's sufficient to confirm that option A is the correct one.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll try another value for x, say x = 2.\n\nOriginal expression: 5(4*2 + 3) - 2*2 = 5(8 + 3) - 4 = 5*11 - 4 = 55 - 4 = 51.\n\nNow, plug x = 2 into option A: 18*2 + 15 = 36 + 15 = 51.\n\nYes, it matches again.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option A is the correct equivalent expression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
