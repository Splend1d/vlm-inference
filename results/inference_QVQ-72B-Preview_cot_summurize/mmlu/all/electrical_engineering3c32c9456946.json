                    "text": "So I have this question about binary numbers. It says that in the binary number system, the first digit from right to left is called:\n\nA. LSB, Least Significant Bit\n\nB. MSB, Most Significant Bit\n\nC. First Bit\n\nD. Last Bit\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about binary numbers first.\n\nBinary numbers are made up of bits, and each bit can be either 0 or 1. The way they're written, the rightmost bit is usually the least significant, and as you move to the left, the bits become more significant.\n\nSo, the \"least significant bit\" (LSB) is the one on the far right, and the \"most significant bit\" (MSB) is the one on the far left.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. LSB, Least Significant Bit\n\nB. MSB, Most Significant Bit\n\nC. First Bit\n\nD. Last Bit\n\nGiven that the first digit from the right is the least significant bit, I think option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. If I have a binary number like 1011, the bits from right to left are:\n\n- 1 (2^0 = 1)\n\n- 1 (2^1 = 2)\n\n- 0 (2^2 = 4)\n\n- 1 (2^3 = 8)\n\nSo, the rightmost bit is the least significant, and the leftmost is the most significant.\n\nTherefore, the first digit from the right is the least significant bit, which is option A.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe there's some confusion with the terms \"first\" and \"last\" bit.\n\nIn binary, when we say \"first bit\", it's often ambiguous because in transmission, the first bit might be sent first, but in representation, it's usually the leftmost bit.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nIn binary representation, the bits are ordered from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), from right to left.\n\nSo, for the number 1011:\n\n- The rightmost bit is 1, which is 2^0 = 1.\n\n- Next is 1, which is 2^1 = 2.\n\n- Then 0, which is 2^2 = 4.\n\n- And finally 1, which is 2^3 = 8.\n\nSo, the first bit from the right is indeed the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nOption C says \"First Bit\", which might be confusing. In some contexts, \"first bit\" could refer to the most significant bit, but in standard binary representation, the rightmost bit is the first bit in terms of significance.\n\nOption D says \"Last Bit\", which could be interpreted as the leftmost bit, but that's not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. LSB, Least Significant Bit.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check an example.\n\nTake the binary number 1011.\n\n- The bits are: 1 (rightmost), 1, 0, 1 (leftmost).\n\n- The first bit from the right is 1, which is the LSB.\n\nSimilarly, in binary 1101:\n\n- The bits are: 1 (rightmost), 0, 1, 1 (leftmost).\n\n- The first bit from the right is 1, which is the LSB.\n\nSo, in both cases, the first digit from the right is the LSB.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. LSB, Least Significant Bit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
