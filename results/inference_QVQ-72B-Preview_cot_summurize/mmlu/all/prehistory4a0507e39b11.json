                    "text": "So I have this question here about how animals move through trees by swinging arm over arm. The options are bipedal locomotion, brachiation, quadrupedal locomotion, and a savanna niche. Hmm, let's see which one makes sense.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each term means. Starting with bipedal locomotion: bipedal means moving on two feet, like humans do when we walk or run. But in this case, we're talking about moving through trees using arms, so I don't think bipedal is the right choice here.\n\nNext is brachiation. I've heard this term before, but I'm not entirely sure what it means. Let me think... Brachiation is a type of locomotion where an animal swings from branch to branch using its arms. It's commonly associated with primates, like monkeys and apes, especially those that live in trees. They use their strong arms to grip branches and propel themselves forward. That sounds a lot like swinging arm over arm, which matches the description in the question. So, brachiation seems like a plausible answer.\n\nNow, quadrupedal locomotion. Quadrupedal refers to movement on four limbs, which is typical for many mammals, cats, dogs, etc. While some tree-dwelling animals do move quadrupedally in trees, climbing up and down or walking along branches on all fours, this isn't the same as swinging arm over arm. So, again, this doesn't seem to fit the description provided.\n\nLastly, a savanna niche. A savanna is a type of ecosystem characterized by grasslands with scattered trees and woods. It's more about the environment where certain animals live rather than how they move. So, this doesn't relate to the method of movement described in the question.\n\nAfter considering all the options, brachiation seems to be the correct answer. It specifically refers to the method of swinging from arm to arm through trees, which matches the description given.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. If bipedal is walking on two legs, quadrupedal is walking on four legs, and a savanna niche is about the environment, then brachiation is indeed the term for arm-over-arm swinging in trees. So, I'm confident that B. brachiation is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ brachiation}} \\]"
