                    "text": "So I have this question about GDP, and I need to figure out which event doesn't affect GDP. The options are:\n\nA. You buy a 1957 Chevy from a friend.\n\nB. The Department of Transportation repaves a road.\n\nC. Your friends make a music CD that doesn't sell any copies.\n\nD. A college buys computers.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what GDP is. GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced by a country in a given year. So, any transaction that involves producing or selling new goods or services should affect GDP, right?\n\nBut wait, there are some nuances here. For example, secondary sales might not always affect GDP. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: You buy a 1957 Chevy from a friend.\n\nSo, this is a second-hand sale. The car was produced in 1957, which was probably a long time ago. When it was first sold in 1957, that would have been counted in that year's GDP. But now, when you're buying it from a friend, is that affecting current production or services? Probably not, because you're just transferring ownership of an existing asset, not generating new production. So, this might not affect current GDP.\n\nOption B: The Department of Transportation repaves a road.\n\nThis seems like a government service or investment. Repaving a road is a construction activity, which is typically included in GDP. The government is paying for materials and labor, which are all part of the economy's production. So, this should affect GDP, right?\n\nOption C: Your friends make a music CD that doesn't sell any copies.\n\nHmm, so they produce a music CD, but it doesn't sell. Does this still count in GDP? I think that in GDP accounting, when goods are produced but not sold, their value is still included in GDP because they represent production for that year. So, even if it's not sold, the production of the CD would be counted in GDP. But since it's not sold, maybe there's an inventory buildup, which is also counted in GDP. So, this does affect GDP.\n\nOption D: A college buys computers.\n\nThis seems straightforward. The college is purchasing goods, which is part of consumption or investment spending, depending on how the college classifies it. Either way, it should be counted in GDP because it's part of current spending on goods and services.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Option A, buying a 1957 Chevy from a friend, might be the one that doesn't affect GDP because it's just a transfer of ownership of an existing asset, not new production.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nWait, in some cases, the sale of second-hand goods might be taxed or involve some services that could be counted in GDP, like if a broker is involved or if there are registration fees. But in this scenario, it's a direct sale between friends, so probably minimal services involved.\n\nAlso, I recall that in GDP calculations, only new goods and services are included. Second-hand sales are generally excluded because the production was already counted in the year it occurred.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is A. Buying a 1957 Chevy from a friend does not affect current GDP.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any way that this transaction could affect GDP. Suppose the friends are restoring the car or something, but no, the question says you're buying it from a friend, no mention of restoration work.\n\nAlso, if the car was imported, maybe there could be some implications for net exports, but that seems like overcomplicating it.\n\nNo, I think the straightforward answer is that buying a used car from a friend doesn't affect GDP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
