                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's asking which statement is true. There are four options, each about different shapes. I need to think carefully about each one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"All hexagons are triangles because they have at least 3 sides.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. A hexagon has six sides, right? And a triangle has three sides. So, how can a hexagon be a triangle? They're different shapes. Maybe the reasoning is flawed here. Perhaps it's trying to say that hexagons have triangles as their faces or something, but that doesn't make sense in the context of polygons. I think this statement is false.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides.\" Okay, an octagon has eight sides. And a polygon is defined as a closed shape with at least three sides, made up of straight lines. So, yes, an octagon is a polygon because it has eight sides, which is more than three. But the statement says \"because they have at least 3 sides.\" That seems a bit vague. Is there a better way to phrase it? Maybe. But technically, it's correct because octagons do have at least three sides, even though they have eight. But maybe there's a more precise reason. Anyway, for now, I'll consider it true.\n\nOption C: \"All parallelograms are rectangles because they have 2 sets of parallel sides.\" Wait a minute, parallelograms do have two sets of parallel sides, that's true. But not all parallelograms are rectangles. Rectangles are a specific type of parallelogram where all angles are right angles. So, while all rectangles are parallelograms, not all parallelograms are rectangles. For example, a rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal, but unless it's a square, it's not a rectangle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nLastly, option D: \"All rhombi are squares because they have 4 sides that are all the same length.\" A rhombus is defined as a quadrilateral with all sides equal. A square is a special type of rhombus where all angles are right angles. So, while all squares are rhombi, not all rhombi are squares. For instance, a diamond shape is a rhombus but not a square because its angles aren't 90 degrees. So, this statement is also false.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems like option B is the correct one, even though the reasoning might not be perfect, it's still true that octagons are polygons because they have at least three sides.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should double-check. Is there a better way to phrase why octagons are polygons? Perhaps emphasizing that they are closed figures with straight sides. But the statement does mention they have at least three sides, which is a defining characteristic of polygons. So, I think it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is trying to say that octagons are polygons because they are made up of at least three sides, but in this case, it's more than three. But since the definition requires at least three sides, having eight sides still qualifies them as polygons.\n\nSo, I conclude that option B is the true statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
