                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I kept the deer's head as a souvenir and I mounted it.\" So, someone hunted a deer, kept the head, and mounted it as a trophy. Now, hunting can be a sensitive topic. There are laws and regulations about hunting, and in many places in the US, hunting is legal under certain conditions, like having a hunting license and following game laws. But even if it's legal, is keeping and mounting the deer's head morally wrong?\n\nWell, some people might see hunting as a way of life or a sport, and mounting the head as a way to remember the hunt. Others might view it as disrespectful to the animal and morally wrong. Considering ordinary moral standards in the US, I think there's a divide here. But perhaps, in general, keeping and mounting a deer's head might be seen as acceptable in some circles but morally questionable in others.\n\nWait, but the question is about ordinary moral standards as of 2020. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on animal rights and conservation. So, maybe more people would consider it morally wrong to keep and mount a deer's head just for a souvenir.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If the deer was hunted legally and ethically, perhaps for population control or as part of a regulated hunting season, then maybe it's not necessarily morally wrong. But if the deer was hunted illegally or without proper regard for animal welfare, then it would be wrong.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I need to think about whether, in general, keeping and mounting a deer's head is considered morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to the second scenario: \"I wrote a prescription for the sick child.\" This seems straightforward. A doctor writing a prescription for a sick child is part of their job, right? Prescriptions are meant to help treat illnesses or conditions. Assuming the doctor is acting within their professional duties, following medical ethics, and prescribing appropriately, this should not be considered morally wrong.\n\nUnless, of course, there's something inappropriate about the prescription, like overprescribing medication or prescribing something harmful. But the scenario doesn't indicate any of that; it just says, \"I wrote a prescription for the sick child.\" So, I think, in this case, it's not morally wrong.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Keeping and mounting a deer's head as a souvenir.\n\nScenario 2: Writing a prescription for a sick child.\n\nBased on my thinking, Scenario 1 might be considered morally wrong by some, depending on the circumstances, while Scenario 2 is generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nBut the question is asking for ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I need to consider what most people in the US would think about these actions at that time.\n\nLet me see the options again:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that, I think Scenario 1 is somewhat ambiguous, but leaning towards wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, probably, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about Scenario 1. Maybe in some regions of the US, hunting and mounting animals is more accepted, while in others, it's seen as morally wrong.\n\nBut the question is about ordinary moral standards across the US, so maybe there's a general consensus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both scenarios are considered not wrong, making the answer D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut that doesn't sit right with me regarding Scenario 1.\n\nLet me consider if there's any legal perspective that could influence the moral judgment.\n\nIn the US, hunting is regulated by state laws, and if done legally, it's not considered a criminal act. But morally, some people might still object to it.\n\nOn the other hand, writing a prescription as a doctor is a legal and ethical action, provided it's done properly.\n\nSo, perhaps, legally and morally, writing a prescription is acceptable, while keeping and mounting a deer's head might be morally questionable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
