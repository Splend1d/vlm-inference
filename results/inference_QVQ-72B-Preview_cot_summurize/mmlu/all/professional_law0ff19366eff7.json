                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this situation where both the plaintiff and the defendant have filed motions for summary judgment after the pleadings are closed. I need to figure out which of these statements is correct regarding summary judgment. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst statement: \"Summary judgment can be entered only after all discovery has been completed.\" Hmm, I thought that summary judgment could be requested at any time before trial, as long as it's after the pleadings are closed. But maybe there are rules about when exactly it can be filed. Let me think. I recall that in some jurisdictions, summary judgment motions can be filed after the pleadings are closed but before discovery is finished, whereas in others, it might be preferable to wait until discovery is complete to make a stronger case. But generally, I don't think it's required that all discovery be completed before filing for summary judgment. So, I'm leaning towards this statement being incorrect.\n\nSecond statement: \"Motion for summary judgment is the proper motion on the ground that plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action.\" Wait a minute, that sounds familiar, but I think there's a difference between a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment. A motion to dismiss, often called a demurrer in some states, is used to argue that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, meaning that even if all the allegations are true, there's no legal basis for the lawsuit. On the other hand, a motion for summary judgment is used when there's no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. So, they're different things. A summary judgment motion isn't the proper way to attack the sufficiency of the complaint; that's what a motion to dismiss is for. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nThird statement: \"Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\" Okay, so both sides are saying there are no genuine issues of material fact, and each is asking for judgment in their favor. Does that mean that summary judgment will automatically be granted for one of them? I don't think so. The fact that both parties move for summary judgment doesn't necessarily mean that the court will grant it to either side. The court still has to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact. If there are disputes over facts that are important to the case, summary judgment won't be appropriate. So, I don't think this statement is necessarily correct.\n\nFourth statement: \"If plaintiff's proofs submitted in support of his motion for summary judgment are not contradicted and if plaintiff's proofs show that no genuine issue of material fact exists, summary judgment will be granted even if defendant's answer denied plaintiff's complaint.\" This seems more accurate. If the plaintiff presents evidence that supports their claim and there's no contradictory evidence from the defendant, and if this evidence shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact, then the court may grant summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The fact that the defendant denied the complaint in their answer isn't sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact if there's no evidence to back up their denial. So, this seems like a correct statement.\n\nLet me double-check. In summary judgment proceedings, the key is whether there's a genuine dispute as to any material fact. If one party presents evidence that resolves all material facts in their favor and the opposing party fails to present any evidence to the contrary, then summary judgment is appropriate. So, even if the defendant denies the plaintiff's claims in their answer, if they don't provide any evidence to support that denial in response to the summary judgment motion, the court can still grant summary judgment to the plaintiff.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. If plaintiff's proofs submitted in support of his motion for summary judgment are not contradicted and if plaintiff's proofs show that no genuine issue of material fact exists, summary judgment will be granted even if defendant's answer denied plaintiff's complaint.\n\nTo make sure, let's quickly recap why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA: Summary judgment doesn't require that all discovery be completed; it can be filed after pleadings are closed.\n\nB: Motion for summary judgment isn't the proper way to challenge the sufficiency of the complaint; that's what a motion to dismiss is for.\n\nC: Just because both parties file summary judgment motions doesn't guarantee that summary judgment will be granted; the court still needs to evaluate whether there are genuine issues of material fact.\n\nD: Seems accurate, as explained earlier.\n\nSo, D is the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
