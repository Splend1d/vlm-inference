                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"36 less than a number, y, is equal to 13.\" And there are four options to choose from. I need to figure out which equation correctly represents this statement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"36 less than a number, y\" means. Does it mean I subtract 36 from y or subtract y from 36? Hmm, the phrase \"less than\" can be a bit confusing sometimes, but I think it's about subtracting 36 from y.\n\nLet me rephrase it in my mind. If I have a number y and I take away 36 from it, that result should be equal to 13. So, y minus 36 equals 13. That seems straightforward.\n\nLooking at option A: y - 36 = 13. That matches what I just thought. So, that could be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the statement. Maybe \"36 less than a number\" could be interpreted as y being 36 more than 13, but that doesn't seem right because the statement says \"36 less than a number is equal to 13.\"\n\nOption B: 36 - y = 13. This would mean that if I subtract y from 36, I get 13. That's different from what the problem states. The problem says \"36 less than a number,\" which I think is y - 36, not 36 - y.\n\nOption C: 13 - y = 36. That would mean that subtracting y from 13 gives me 36, which doesn't align with the original statement.\n\nOption D: 36 + y = \u201313. This suggests that adding y to 36 equals negative 13, which again doesn't match the original statement.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option A seems to be the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check by solving the equation to see if it makes sense.\n\nLet's take y - 36 = 13. To solve for y, I can add 36 to both sides.\n\ny - 36 + 36 = 13 + 36\n\nSo, y = 49.\n\nDoes that make sense? If y is 49 and I subtract 36, I get 13. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider option B: 36 - y = 13.\n\nSolving for y: 36 - y = 13 \u2192 -y = 13 - 36 \u2192 -y = -23 \u2192 y = 23.\n\nBut according to the original statement, y should be 49, not 23. So, option B is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option C: 13 - y = 36.\n\nSolving for y: 13 - y = 36 \u2192 -y = 36 - 13 \u2192 -y = 23 \u2192 y = -23.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match the expected value of y being 49.\n\nOption D: 36 + y = -13.\n\nSolving for y: 36 + y = -13 \u2192 y = -13 - 36 \u2192 y = -49.\n\nThis also doesn't match the expected value of y being 49.\n\nTherefore, the only equation that correctly represents the statement \"36 less than a number, y, is equal to 13\" is y - 36 = 13.\n\nI think I've got it right. Sometimes, these wordings can be tricky, but in this case, it seems pretty clear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
