                    "text": "So I've got this case here, and I need to figure out whether the court will grant the buyer's motion to dismiss based on the statute of frauds. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, the buyer asked the manufacturer to make 100,000 widgets for $1,000,000. These widgets needed to have the buyer's logo on them, so they're custom-made, right? The manufacturer agreed and ordered the raw materials and even made a new mold specifically for these widgets with the buyer's logo.\n\nThe buyer wanted at least 10,000 widgets right away, so the manufacturer rushed the order and sent those 10,000 widgets two days later. The buyer paid for those 10,000 widgets but then rejected the remaining 90,000 widgets. After that, the manufacturer sued the buyer for breach of contract, claiming damages.\n\nNow, the buyer is responding with a motion to dismiss, arguing that the statute of frauds was violated because the contract was for over $500 and wasn't in writing, making it unenforceable under state law.\n\nOkay, so the issue here is whether the statute of frauds applies and, if it does, whether there are any exceptions that would allow the contract to be enforceable despite not having a written agreement.\n\nI remember that the statute of frauds generally requires that contracts for the sale of goods priced at or above a certain amount, usually $500, must be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the contract is for $1,000,000, which is way above $500, so it should fall under the statute of frauds.\n\nBut, there are exceptions to this rule. One exception that comes to mind is for goods that are specially manufactured for a particular buyer, especially if they're not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business.\n\nIn this scenario, the widgets have the buyer's logo on them, which means they're custom-made and probably not something the manufacturer can just sell to someone else easily. So, that might be an exception that applies here.\n\nAlso, the buyer accepted and paid for 10,000 widgets, which could be considered partial performance of the contract. Maybe that partial performance can be used to enforce the rest of the contract.\n\nLet me think about this. If the buyer accepted and paid for part of the goods, doesn't that show some level of acknowledgment of the contract? Maybe that partial performance can take the place of a written contract.\n\nOn the other hand, the buyer is arguing that the statute of frauds wasn't satisfied, and therefore the contract is unenforceable. But, if there are exceptions that apply, perhaps the court won't grant the motion to dismiss.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, the statute of frauds must be enforced when it involves goods over $500.\n\nWell, that seems too absolute. While it's true that the statute of frauds generally requires written contracts for goods over $500, there are exceptions, as I thought earlier.\n\nB. Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract and it must pay for its bad business practices.\n\nThis seems harsh. The manufacturer might have relied on the buyer's promise and incurred costs to produce the widgets, like ordering raw materials and making a new mold. Also, the buyer accepted and paid for part of the order, which might indicate some level of commitment.\n\nC. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\nThis seems plausible. The widgets have the buyer's logo, making them custom-made and likely not suitable for resale to others. This could be a valid exception to the statute of frauds.\n\nD. No, the law will enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. The \"benefit of the bargain\" principle is generally about what the parties intended to achieve from the contract. But in the context of the statute of frauds, it might not be enough on its own to enforce an oral contract for the sale of goods over $500.\n\nI think option C is the most accurate here because the widgets are specially made for the buyer, which is a recognized exception to the statute of frauds.\n\nWait, but the question says the buyer filed a motion to dismiss based on the statute of frauds violation. So, if there's an exception that applies, the motion to dismiss should be denied, right?\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, if the court recognizes that the goods are specially manufactured and not suitable for resale, then the statute of frauds wouldn't apply in this case, and the motion to dismiss should be denied.\n\nLet me double-check. In contract law, especially under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs the sale of goods, there is an exception to the statute of frauds for goods that are specially manufactured and not suitable for resale. This is to prevent injustice in cases where the seller has relied on the buyer's promise and incurred significant costs.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer made a new mold and ordered raw materials specifically for these widgets, which have the buyer's logo. So, these widgets are likely not something that can be sold to other buyers easily.\n\nAdditionally, the buyer accepted and paid for 10,000 widgets, which could be seen as partial performance, further supporting the existence of a contract.\n\nTherefore, considering these points, it's likely that the court will not grant the motion to dismiss because of the exception for specially manufactured goods.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
