                    "text": "So I've got this question about correlation here. It says that a correlation of 0.6 indicates that the percentage of variation in y explained by the variation in x is how many times the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3. And the options are 2, 3, 4, or 6. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient, usually denoted as r, can range from -1 to 1. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, and a negative correlation means that as one increases, the other decreases.\n\nBut in this question, we're dealing with the explained variation. I recall that in regression analysis, the coefficient of determination, which is r-squared, tells us the percentage of variation in y that's explained by the variation in x.\n\nSo, if I have a correlation of 0.6, then r-squared would be 0.6 squared, which is 0.36. Similarly, for a correlation of 0.3, r-squared would be 0.3 squared, which is 0.09.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many times 0.09 is 0.36. In other words, what number do I multiply 0.09 by to get 0.36?\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.36 divided by 0.09 equals... let's see, 0.36 \u00f7 0.09. Well, 0.09 times 4 is 0.36. So, 0.36 \u00f7 0.09 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of variation explained by a correlation of 0.6 is 4 times the percentage explained by a correlation of 0.3.\n\nWait a minute, is there more to this? Let me double-check. The coefficient of determination is r-squared, and it indeed measures the proportion of variance in y explained by x. So, with r = 0.6, r-squared = 0.36, and with r = 0.3, r-squared = 0.09. So, 0.36 is 4 times 0.09.\n\nI think the answer is 4.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this. For example, does the sign of the correlation matter here? Well, no, because correlation is symmetric in terms of its absolute value when squaring.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 4.\n\nWait, but let's see if maybe there's a different approach. Maybe using the formula for correlation or something else.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose we have two correlations, 0.6 and 0.3. The explained variation is r-squared for each, which are 0.36 and 0.09, respectively.\n\nTo find out how many times 0.09 goes into 0.36, we can just divide 0.36 by 0.09, which is indeed 4.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of percentages, 0.36 is 36%, and 0.09 is 9%. So, 36% is 4 times 9%.\n\nYes, that matches as well.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
