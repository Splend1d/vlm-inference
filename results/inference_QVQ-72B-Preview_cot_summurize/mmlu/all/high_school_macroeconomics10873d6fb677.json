                    "text": "So I've got this question here about what would likely contribute to faster rates of economic growth. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that would help grow the economy faster. Let me think through each one.\n\nOption A is \"A more restrictive immigration policy.\" Hmm, immigration can be a touchy subject, but from an economic perspective, I recall that immigrants often contribute to the labor force, fill jobs that might otherwise go unfilled, and can drive innovation and entrepreneurship. So, if we make immigration policies more restrictive, that might mean fewer immigrants coming in. Fewer immigrants could mean a smaller labor force, which might not be good for economic growth, right? So, this seems like it might slow down economic growth rather than speed it up.\n\nNext is Option B, \"Negative net investment.\" Let me remember what net investment is. Net investment is basically total investment minus depreciation of capital. So, negative net investment would mean that the wear and tear on existing capital is greater than the new investment being made. That sounds bad because it means the capital stock is declining. A declining capital stock would likely lead to lower production capacity, which in turn would slow down economic growth. So, this also doesn't seem like a contributor to faster economic growth.\n\nOption C is \"Higher taxes on households and firms.\" Taxes are interesting because they can have multiple effects. Higher taxes on households might reduce consumer spending, which is a big part of economic activity. Higher taxes on firms could reduce their profitability, which might dampen their incentive to invest or expand. Both of these could lead to slower economic growth. However, taxes also fund government services and investments, which can sometimes promote growth. But generally, increasing taxes might not directly lead to faster economic growth, especially if the additional revenue isn't invested in productive ways. So, I'm leaning towards thinking that higher taxes wouldn't contribute to faster growth.\n\nNow, Option D is \"Higher government funding of research on clean energy supplies.\" This sounds promising. Investment in research and development, especially in areas like clean energy, can lead to technological advancements and innovations that can boost productivity and create new industries. Clean energy is a growing sector, and investing in it could lead to new jobs, increased efficiency, and potentially reduce dependence on fossil fuels, which can be subject to price volatility. Also, such investments can have spillover effects, meaning that knowledge and technologies developed in one area can be applied in others, further stimulating economic activity.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that higher government funding for clean energy research would likely contribute to faster rates of economic growth. It's about investing in the future, building capacity, and fostering innovation, all of which are key drivers of long-term economic growth.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. Higher government funding of research on clean energy supplies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
