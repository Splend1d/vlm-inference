                    "text": "So Abby drives 18 miles round trip between home and work each day. The problem says that her daily round trip is rounded to the nearest 5 miles, and then we need to find the best estimate of the total number of miles driven in 5 days. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to round her daily round trip to the nearest 5 miles. The distance she drives each day is 18 miles. If we round 18 to the nearest 5 miles, what do we get?\n\nWell, multiples of 5 near 18 are 15 and 20. 18 is closer to 20 than it is to 15, so I think it would be rounded up to 20 miles. But wait, let's make sure about that.\n\nIn standard rounding rules, if the number is exactly halfway between two multiples of 5, you round up. But 18 is closer to 20 than to 15, so it should definitely be rounded to 20 miles.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the best estimate of the total number of miles driven in 5 days. So, if each day is rounded to 20 miles, then over 5 days, it would be 20 miles per day times 5 days, which is 100 miles.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 75 miles\n\nB. 100 miles\n\nC. 125 miles\n\nD. 180 miles\n\n100 miles seems to be the straightforward answer based on rounding 18 to 20 and then multiplying by 5.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe there's more to it. The problem says \"the daily round trip is rounded to the nearest 5 miles.\" Does that mean that the rounded distance is used each day, or is the total for 5 days rounded somehow?\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully: \"If her daily round trip is rounded to the nearest 5 miles, which of the following is the best estimate of the total number of miles driven in 5 days?\"\n\nIt seems like first, we round the daily distance to the nearest 5 miles, and then we sum that up over 5 days.\n\nSo, as I thought, rounding 18 to the nearest 5 gives 20 miles, and then 20 miles times 5 days gives 100 miles.\n\nBut perhaps there's some consideration about the actual total without rounding, which is 18 miles per day times 5 days equals 90 miles. Then, maybe we need to see which of the options is closest to 90 miles.\n\nWait, but the problem says to round the daily distance first and then sum it up, not to calculate the total miles without rounding and then round that.\n\nSo, according to the instructions, it's 20 miles per day times 5 days, which is 100 miles.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any trick here. Is there a possibility that rounding to the nearest 5 miles could affect the total differently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether we understand that rounding first and then summing isn't the same as summing and then rounding.\n\nBut in this case, since the problem specifically says to round the daily trip first, I think we should follow that instruction.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the \"best estimate\" implies considering the actual total miles without rounding, which is 90 miles, and then seeing which option is closest to that. But that seems contradictory to the instruction to round the daily trip to the nearest 5 miles.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The straightforward approach is to round 18 miles to 20 miles, and then multiply by 5 days to get 100 miles.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 100 miles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 100 \\ \\text{miles}} \\]"
