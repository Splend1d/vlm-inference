                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept from social psychology, and I came across this scenario about groups of children competing against each other. The idea is that when these groups are given tasks that require everyone's effort, it helps reduce intergroup hostility. The question is asking what this approach is an example of, and the options are integrative demands, superordinate goals, threat reduction, and intergroup contact.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what each of these terms means in the context of group relations and conflict resolution.\n\nStarting with \"integrative demands,\" I'm not entirely sure what that refers to. Maybe it's about finding solutions that satisfy the interests of all parties involved, but I'm not certain if that's the exact term used in social psychology.\n\n\"Superordinate goals\" sounds familiar. I think it refers to objectives that are important to all groups involved and require cooperation to achieve. So, if all the children are working towards a common goal that benefits everyone, it might help bridge the divide between different groups.\n\n\"Threat reduction\" seems straightforward\u2014it's about decreasing the perceived threats between groups. But I need to see how that fits into this scenario.\n\n\"Intergroup contact\" is another option. This is when members of different groups interact with each other, which can help reduce prejudice and improve relations.\n\nGiven the scenario, where tasks require the efforts of all children, it seems like these tasks are designed to make the children work together towards a common objective. This sounds a lot like superordinate goals because they're shared goals that transcend the interests of individual groups and necessitate collaboration.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. If the children are competing in groups, their natural inclination might be to see the other groups as rivals. However, if they're given tasks that can only be accomplished by combining their efforts, it forces them to cooperate and see each other as partners rather than enemies.\n\nThis aligns well with the concept of superordinate goals. In fact, this approach is a key element in reducing intergroup conflict, as proposed by Muzafer Sherif in his Robbers Cave Experiment. In that study, Sherif introduced superordinate goals to reduce conflict between competing groups of boys.\n\nIntegrative demands might be related to finding mutually beneficial solutions, but that seems more aligned with conflict resolution techniques like win-win strategies, not directly with the idea of shared goals that require collective effort.\n\nThreat reduction is a broader concept that could encompass various strategies to lessen tensions between groups. While introducing superordinate goals is one way to reduce threats by fostering cooperation, it's not the only method, and the term itself is more about the outcome rather than the approach taken.\n\nIntergroup contact is another important concept in reducing prejudice and improving relations between groups. However, simply having contact isn't always sufficient; the contact needs to be under certain conditions, such as equal status, common goals, and support from authorities or the community. In this scenario, the tasks require the efforts of all children, which implies cooperative intergroup contact, but the emphasis seems to be on the shared objectives rather than just the interaction itself.\n\nConsidering all this, I believe that \"superordinate goals\" is the most accurate answer here. It directly refers to the idea of having common objectives that necessitate collaboration among all groups, which in turn reduces hostility between them.\n\nTo sum it up, when groups of children compete against each other, intergroup hostility can be lessened by finding tasks that require the efforts of all the children. This approach is an example of superordinate goals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
