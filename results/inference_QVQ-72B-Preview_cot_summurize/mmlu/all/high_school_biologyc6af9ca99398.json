                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about safety precautions for using acetone in a chromatography experiment. The experiment involves separating plant pigments using a closed chromatography chamber with some acetone at the bottom. Acetone is known to be an eye and skin irritant, and it has flammable vapors. So, I need to figure out which safety precaution is most appropriate for the students to take during this exercise.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A suggests putting on fire-retardant gloves to carry the chamber to a fume hood if the acetone catches fire. Hmm, this seems relevant because acetone is flammable. But, waiting until the acetone catches fire to take action might not be the best approach. Prevention is key, right? So, maybe there's a better way to ensure safety before something goes wrong.\n\nOption B says to place the chamber in a closed, darkened cabinet for the duration of the pigment separation. Now, chromatography usually requires a dark environment to prevent light from affecting the results, but I'm not sure about putting it in a closed cabinet. The chamber is already closed, and acetone vapors can be hazardous if they build up in an enclosed space. Maybe this isn't the best idea because it could trap fumes.\n\nOption C recommends wearing leather gloves and covering the nose and mouth with a particle mask. Leather gloves might provide some protection against skin irritation, but I'm not sure how effective they are against acetone. Also, a particle mask is typically used for dust and particles, not for vapors like acetone. Maybe this isn't sufficient for protecting against acetone vapors.\n\nOption D suggests wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed. Goggles are important because acetone is an eye irritant, so that makes sense. Nitrile gloves are known for their resistance to chemicals like acetone, so that's a good choice for protecting the skin. And keeping containers closed helps prevent vapors from escaping, which is important because acetone vapors are flammable.\n\nLet me think about this again. The question is about safety precautions while conducting the exercise. So, it's about preventing accidents and protecting oneself from the hazards of acetone.\n\nFirst, since acetone is a skin and eye irritant, it's crucial to protect those areas. Goggles will shield the eyes, and nitrile gloves will protect the skin on the hands. Leather gloves might not be as effective against acetone, as it can seep through some materials.\n\nSecond, acetone vapors are flammable, so minimizing their exposure to ignition sources is important. Keeping containers closed reduces the amount of vapors in the air, which helps prevent fires.\n\nAlso, working in a well-ventilated area or using a fume hood is generally a good practice when dealing with volatile organic compounds like acetone. However, the options don't explicitly mention using a fume hood, but since the experiment requires a closed chromatography chamber, it might not be feasible to perform it in a fume hood.\n\nWait, option B mentions placing the chamber in a closed, darkened cabinet. But as I thought earlier, this might trap vapors, which could be dangerous if the cabinet isn't properly vented.\n\nOption A talks about using fire-retardant gloves to carry the chamber if the acetone catches fire. While it's important to have a plan in case of fire, it's even more important to take preventive measures to avoid a fire in the first place.\n\nOption C suggests wearing leather gloves and a particle mask. Leather gloves might offer some protection against skin contact, but they might not be the best choice for handling acetone. Nitrile gloves are known for their resistance to acetone, so they would be a better option. Also, a particle mask isn't designed to protect against vapors; it's meant for particles like dust and pollen. For protection against acetone vapors, a respirator with the appropriate cartridge would be necessary.\n\nSo, considering all this, option D seems to be the most appropriate choice. It addresses both the eye and skin irritation risks with goggles and nitrile gloves and emphasizes keeping containers closed to prevent vapors from escaping, which helps mitigate the fire hazard.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about any additional precautions that might be necessary. For example, using a fume hood would be ideal for ventilating the area, but since the experiment involves a closed chamber, it might not be feasible to perform it inside a fume hood. Maybe opening a window or using a fan to ventilate the room would be helpful, but that's not one of the options.\n\nAlso, having a fire extinguisher nearby would be a good safety measure, but again, that's not among the choices.\n\nSo, based on the given options, I would say that option D is the best choice: wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
