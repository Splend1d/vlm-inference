                    "text": "So I have this question here about urban planning or geography, I think. It says: \"The theory that the main purpose of a settlement or market town is to furnish goods and services to the surrounding market area is called the... \" and then there are four options: A. urban hierarchy theory, B. central place theory, C. concentric zone model, D. multiplier effect.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these describes the idea that a town's main function is to provide stuff like goods and services to the areas around it.\n\nLet me think about what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with option A: urban hierarchy theory. I recall that this has to do with how cities are ranked based on their size and the services they offer. Like, bigger cities have more services and smaller towns have fewer, more basic services. So, in this case, the town is providing services to people in the surrounding areas, but it's more about the ranking and the type of services rather than just furnishing goods and services in general.\n\nOption B: central place theory. I think this is about places that serve as centers for surrounding areas. They provide goods and services to the regions around them, and there's some kind of spacing or distance factor involved. Maybe there's a threshold population that needs to be reached for a town to provide certain services, and there's a distance decay effect where people are less likely to travel far for services.\n\nOption C: concentric zone model. I believe this is a model of urban structure where different uses of land spread out in circles from the city center. Like, the central business district is in the middle, then residential areas, maybe industrial zones further out. This seems more about the layout of a single city rather than how a town serves a wider area.\n\nOption D: multiplier effect. I think this is an economic concept where an initial spending generates additional income and further spending, like when a company invests in a town and that leads to more jobs and more money circulating in the area. It's more about economic impact rather than the function of a town in providing goods and services.\n\nSo, going back to the question, it's about a theory that says a town's main purpose is to provide goods and services to its surrounding market area. That sounds a lot like the central place theory, which focuses on places that serve as centers for surrounding areas, providing goods and services.\n\nLet me double-check. Central place theory was developed by Walter Christaller, and it proposes that settlements exist because they serve as centers where people come to obtain goods and services. These centers are spaced out in a way that each one has its own trade area or market area.\n\nYeah, that seems to align perfectly with the description in the question. So, I think the correct answer is B. central place theory.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly consider why the other options aren't fitting.\n\nA. urban hierarchy theory: While it does involve cities providing services to surrounding areas, it's more about the classification of cities based on their size and the types of services they offer, not specifically about furnishing goods and services to the immediate surrounding area.\n\nC. concentric zone model: This is about the internal structure of a city, not about how a town relates to its surrounding area.\n\nD. multiplier effect: This is an economic concept about how initial spending can lead to increased economic activity, not about the function of a town in providing goods and services to a surrounding area.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. central place theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
