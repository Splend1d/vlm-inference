                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem using indirect truth tables. The goal is to determine whether the given set of propositions is consistent. If it is consistent, I need to select an option that represents a consistent valuation of the variables.\n\nThe propositions given are:\n\n1. ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P)\n\n2. ~O \u2283 Q\n\n3. N \u00b7 ~Q\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these symbols mean:\n\n- ~ denotes negation (not)\n\n- \u2261 denotes logical equivalence (if and only if)\n\n- \u00b7 denotes conjunction (and)\n\n- \u2283 denotes implication (if, then)\n\nSo, the first proposition says that not N is logically equivalent to O and P. The second says that not O implies Q. The third says that N and not Q are both true.\n\nMy task is to see if all three can be true at the same time. If they can, the set is consistent; if not, it's inconsistent.\n\nTo use the indirect truth table method, I'll assume that the set is inconsistent and look for a contradiction. If I can't find a way for all propositions to be true simultaneously, then the set is inconsistent. Otherwise, it's consistent.\n\nLet's start by assuming that all three propositions are true.\n\nFirst, consider ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P). This means that ~N and (O \u00b7 P) are either both true or both false.\n\nSecond, ~O \u2283 Q. This is an implication, so if ~O is true, then Q must be true. If ~O is false, Q can be either true or false.\n\nThird, N \u00b7 ~Q. This means N is true and ~Q is true, so Q is false.\n\nNow, from N \u00b7 ~Q, we have:\n\n- N is true\n\n- Q is false\n\nFrom N being true, ~N is false.\n\nNow, from ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P), since ~N is false, (O \u00b7 P) must also be false for the equivalence to hold.\n\nSo, (O \u00b7 P) is false. This means that at least one of O or P is false.\n\nFrom ~O \u2283 Q, and knowing that Q is false, let's see what this implies.\n\nThe implication ~O \u2283 Q is false only when ~O is true and Q is false. But Q is false, so for the implication to be true, ~O must be false. Therefore, O must be true.\n\nSo, O is true, and since (O \u00b7 P) is false, P must be false.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- N = true\n\n- O = true\n\n- P = false\n\n- Q = false\n\nNow, let's check if all three original propositions are true with these values.\n\nFirst proposition: ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P)\n\n- ~N = false\n\n- (O \u00b7 P) = true \u00b7 false = false\n\nSo, false \u2261 false, which is true.\n\nSecond proposition: ~O \u2283 Q\n\n- ~O = false\n\n- Q = false\n\nSo, false \u2283 false, which is true.\n\nThird proposition: N \u00b7 ~Q\n\n- N = true\n\n- ~Q = true\n\nSo, true \u00b7 true = true.\n\nTherefore, all three propositions are true with N = true, O = true, P = false, Q = false.\n\nThis means the set is consistent, and one consistent valuation is N and O are true, and P and Q are false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Inconsistent\n\nB. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O, and P are true and Q is false\n\nC. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false\n\nD. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false\n\nOur valuation matches option C: N and O are true, and P and Q are false.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there are other possible valuations.\n\nSuppose N is true, O is true, P is true, Q is false.\n\nThen:\n\n- ~N = false\n\n- (O \u00b7 P) = true \u00b7 true = true\n\nSo, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is false \u2261 true, which is false.\n\nThis makes the first proposition false, so this valuation is inconsistent.\n\nAnother valuation: N true, O false, P false, Q false.\n\nThen:\n\n- ~N = false\n\n- (O \u00b7 P) = false \u00b7 false = false\n\nSo, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is false \u2261 false, which is true.\n\nSecond proposition: ~O \u2283 Q\n\n- ~O = true\n\n- Q = false\n\nSo, true \u2283 false, which is false.\n\nThis makes the second proposition false, so inconsistent.\n\nAnother valuation: N true, O true, P true, Q false.\n\nAs seen earlier, this makes the first proposition false.\n\nAnother valuation: N true, O true, P false, Q false.\n\nAs before, this works.\n\nAnother valuation: N true, O false, P false, Q false.\n\nThis makes the second proposition false.\n\nN true, O false, P true, Q false.\n\n- ~N = false\n\n- (O \u00b7 P) = false \u00b7 true = false\n\nSo, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is false \u2261 false, which is true.\n\nSecond proposition: ~O \u2283 Q\n\n- ~O = true\n\n- Q = false\n\nSo, true \u2283 false, which is false.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nN true, O true, P false, Q false.\n\nAs before, consistent.\n\nN false, O true, P false, Q false.\n\nWait, but N is false.\n\n- ~N = true\n\n- (O \u00b7 P) = true \u00b7 false = false\n\nSo, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is true \u2261 false, which is false.\n\nThis makes the first proposition false.\n\nN false, O true, P true, Q false.\n\n- ~N = true\n\n- (O \u00b7 P) = true \u00b7 true = true\n\nSo, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is true \u2261 true, which is true.\n\nSecond proposition: ~O \u2283 Q\n\n- ~O = false\n\n- Q = false\n\nSo, false \u2283 false, which is true.\n\nThird proposition: N \u00b7 ~Q\n\n- N = false\n\n- ~Q = true\n\nSo, false \u00b7 true = false.\n\nThis makes the third proposition false.\n\nN false, O false, P false, Q false.\n\n- ~N = true\n\n- (O \u00b7 P) = false \u00b7 false = false\n\nSo, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is true \u2261 false, which is false.\n\nThis makes the first proposition false.\n\nN false, O false, P true, Q false.\n\n- ~N = true\n\n- (O \u00b7 P) = false \u00b7 true = false\n\nSo, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is true \u2261 false, which is false.\n\nFirst proposition false.\n\nN false, O true, P false, Q false.\n\nAs before, first proposition false.\n\nN true, O true, P false, Q false.\n\nThis is the only valuation that makes all three propositions true.\n\nTherefore, the consistent valuation is N and O true, P and Q false, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let's check option B: N, O, and P true, Q false.\n\nAs we saw earlier, this makes the first proposition false, so it's inconsistent.\n\nOption D: N and P true, O and Q false.\n\nSo, N true, O false, P true, Q false.\n\nThis makes the second proposition false, so inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
