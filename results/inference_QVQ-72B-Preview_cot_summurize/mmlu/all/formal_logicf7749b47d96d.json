                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, the sentence is: \"If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll.\" I need to find which of the given formulas best symbolizes this sentence in propositional logic (PL).\n\nFirst, I should understand what the sentence is saying. It's a conditional statement: if one thing happens (either George or Harry enrolls), then another thing follows (Ira does not enroll).\n\nIn logic, \"if A, then B\" is typically symbolized as A \u2283 B. So, in this case, \"if either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll\" should be symbolized accordingly.\n\nLet's define the propositions:\n\n- G: George enrolls\n\n- H: Harry enrolls\n\n- I: Ira enrolls\n\nNow, \"either George enrolls or Harry enrolls\" is a disjunction: G \u2228 H.\n\nAnd \"Ira does not enroll\" is the negation of I: ~I.\n\nSo, putting it together, the conditional is (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (G \u2283 H) \u2228 I\n\nThis is a disjunction between (G \u2283 H) and I. That doesn't match our formulation.\n\nB. (G \u2228 H) \u2283 I\n\nThis suggests that if either George or Harry enrolls, then Ira enrolls. But according to the original sentence, it should be that Ira does not enroll. So, this is the opposite of what we need.\n\nC. (G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~I\n\nAgain, this is a disjunction involving (G \u2283 H) and ~I, which doesn't capture the conditional relationship properly.\n\nD. (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I\n\nThis matches exactly with what we derived earlier. It says that if either George or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option D seems to be the correct symbolization of the given sentence.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure there isn't any trick here.\n\nLet me consider the truth table approach. I'll list all possible truth values for G, H, and I, and see what the conditional (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I should evaluate to.\n\nPossible truth value combinations:\n\n1. G: T, H: T, I: T\n\n2. G: T, H: T, I: F\n\n3. G: T, H: F, I: T\n\n4. G: T, H: F, I: F\n\n5. G: F, H: T, I: T\n\n6. G: F, H: T, I: F\n\n7. G: F, H: F, I: T\n\n8. G: F, H: F, I: F\n\nNow, compute (G \u2228 H) and ~I for each:\n\n1. T \u2228 T = T; ~T = F \u2192 T \u2283 F = F\n\n2. T \u2228 T = T; ~F = T \u2192 T \u2283 T = T\n\n3. T \u2228 F = T; ~T = F \u2192 T \u2283 F = F\n\n4. T \u2228 F = T; ~F = T \u2192 T \u2283 T = T\n\n5. F \u2228 T = T; ~T = F \u2192 T \u2283 F = F\n\n6. F \u2228 T = T; ~F = T \u2192 T \u2283 T = T\n\n7. F \u2228 F = F; ~T = F \u2192 F \u2283 F = T\n\n8. F \u2228 F = F; ~F = T \u2192 F \u2283 T = T\n\nSo, the conditional (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I is false only in cases where G or H is true and I is true. That makes sense because if either George or Harry enrolls, then Ira should not enroll.\n\nNow, let's see what the other options would mean in terms of truth tables.\n\nOption A: (G \u2283 H) \u2228 I\n\nCompute G \u2283 H:\n\n1. T \u2283 T = T\n\n2. T \u2283 T = T\n\n3. T \u2283 F = F\n\n4. T \u2283 F = F\n\n5. F \u2283 T = T\n\n6. F \u2283 T = T\n\n7. F \u2283 F = T\n\n8. F \u2283 F = T\n\nThen, (G \u2283 H) \u2228 I:\n\n1. T \u2228 T = T\n\n2. T \u2228 F = T\n\n3. F \u2228 T = T\n\n4. F \u2228 T = T\n\n5. T \u2228 T = T\n\n6. T \u2228 T = T\n\n7. T \u2228 T = T\n\n8. T \u2228 T = T\n\nSo, this option is always true, which doesn't match our conditional statement, as that had cases where it was false.\n\nOption B: (G \u2228 H) \u2283 I\n\nCompute (G \u2228 H):\n\nSame as before:\n\n1. T\n\n2. T\n\n3. T\n\n4. T\n\n5. T\n\n6. T\n\n7. F\n\n8. F\n\nThen, (G \u2228 H) \u2283 I:\n\n1. T \u2283 T = T\n\n2. T \u2283 F = F\n\n3. T \u2283 T = T\n\n4. T \u2283 F = F\n\n5. T \u2283 T = T\n\n6. T \u2283 F = F\n\n7. F \u2283 T = T\n\n8. F \u2283 F = T\n\nSo, this is false when G or H is true and I is false, which is the opposite of what we need. According to the original sentence, if G or H is true, then I should be false, not true.\n\nOption C: (G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~I\n\nCompute G \u2283 H:\n\nSame as above:\n\n1. T\n\n2. T\n\n3. F\n\n4. F\n\n5. T\n\n6. T\n\n7. T\n\n8. T\n\nThen, ~I:\n\n1. F\n\n2. T\n\n3. F\n\n4. T\n\n5. F\n\n6. T\n\n7. F\n\n8. T\n\nNow, (G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~I:\n\n1. T \u2228 F = T\n\n2. T \u2228 T = T\n\n3. F \u2228 F = F\n\n4. F \u2228 T = T\n\n5. T \u2228 F = T\n\n6. T \u2228 T = T\n\n7. T \u2228 F = T\n\n8. T \u2228 T = T\n\nSo, this option is false only when (G \u2283 H) is false and ~I is false, which occurs in cases where G is true and H is false, and I is true.\n\nThis doesn't align with our original conditional, which is false in cases where G or H is true and I is true.\n\nOption D: (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I\n\nWe already computed this, and it matches our original conditional.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's any alternative interpretation.\n\nIs there any way that another option could be considered correct?\n\nFor example, perhaps someone might think that the sentence implies that if George enrolls, then Harry enrolls, or something like that, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's ambiguity in the phrase \"either...or\", but in standard logical usage, \"either George or Harry enrolls\" means G \u2228 H.\n\nAlso, the \"if...then\" construction seems straightforward: if G \u2228 H, then ~I.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any reason to choose any option other than D.\n\nI think the answer is D. (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I"
