                    "text": "So I've got this contract dispute between a restaurant and a bakery. They signed a written contract on December 30 for the bakery to supply bread to the restaurant for the whole next calendar year. The contract said the restaurant would buy a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 per loaf. There was also a clause that any changes to the contract had to be in writing, and both parties signed each sheet.\n\nFor the first four months, everything went smoothly. Both sides did what they agreed to. But on May 1, the bakery's president called the restaurant manager and said that due to higher wheat costs, they had to raise the price to $1.20 per loaf. The manager said okay and agreed to the price increase. So, the bakery shipped 100 loaves to the restaurant and sent a bill for $120. But then, the restaurant sent a check for only $100 and refused to pay the extra $20.\n\nNow, the question is whether the restaurant has to pay the additional $20. There are four options:\n\nA. Yes, because the May 1 modification was enforceable even though it wasn't supported by new consideration.\n\nB. Yes, because the bakery relied on the modification by making the May shipment to the restaurant.\n\nC. No, because there was no consideration to support the modification.\n\nD. No, because the modifying contract wasn't in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, there's an original contract with specific terms, including a price of $1 per loaf and a clause that any modifications must be in writing. Both parties signed this contract, so it's binding.\n\nIn May, there's a phone call where the bakery says they need to raise the price to $1.20 per loaf due to increased wheat costs. The restaurant manager agrees to this new price. However, this modification was\u53e3\u5934\u4e0a\u7684, not in writing. The contract explicitly states that any modifications must be in writing. So, does this oral agreement bind the restaurant?\n\nLet me think about the parol evidence rule. Generally, when there's a written contract, oral agreements that contradict or modify it aren't enforceable unless they fall under specific exceptions. Here, the contract has a clause requiring modifications to be in writing, which is likely intended to prevent exactly this kind of oral disagreements.\n\nBut, sometimes, if both parties act in accordance with the oral modification, it might be enforceable. In this case, the bakery shipped the bread at the new price, and the restaurant received it but didn't pay the full amount. So, the restaurant partially acted in accordance with the modification by accepting the shipment but didn't fully comply with the new price.\n\nOption A says yes, because the modification is enforceable even without new consideration. But I thought that for a contract modification to be enforceable, there needs to be additional consideration or some other legal basis like promissory estoppel. Here, it was just a phone call with no new consideration provided by either side. So, I'm not sure about this option.\n\nOption B says yes, because the bakery relied on the modification by making the May shipment. This sounds a bit like promissory estoppel, where if one party relies on the other's promise to their detriment, the promise might be enforceable even without consideration. But in this case, the bakery was already contracted to supply the bread; it's not clear that relying on the oral modification caused them any additional detriment beyond what was already part of the contract.\n\nOption C says no, because there was no consideration to support the modification. This seems relevant because in contract law, modifications generally require consideration to be enforceable. Since there was no new consideration provided for the price increase, the modification might not be enforceable.\n\nOption D says no, because the modifying contract wasn't in writing and is therefore unenforceable under the UCC. The UCC stands for the Uniform Commercial Code, which governs sales of goods. Bread would likely be considered a good, so the UCC would apply. The UCC generally requires contracts for the sale of goods over a certain amount to be in writing, which is the statute of frauds.\n\nBut, in this case, the original contract was in writing, but the modification was oral. So, would the UCC require that modifications also be in writing? I think the UCC has provisions about modifying contracts, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me look this up. According to the UCC, specifically UCC 2-209, modifications of contract for the sale of goods can be made without consideration, but if the original contract is in writing and requires modifications to be in writing, then any modification must indeed be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nIn this scenario, the original contract had a clause stating that modifications must be in writing, and both parties signed each sheet, so that clause is part of the contract. Therefore, any modification, like the price increase, must be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nGiven that, the oral agreement to raise the price isn't enforceable because it violates the writing requirement in the contract. So, the restaurant isn't obligated to pay the extra $20.\n\nWait, but option D says \"no, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.\" That seems to align with what I just thought. So, option D suggests that the restaurant doesn't have to pay the extra $20 because the modification wasn't in writing, as required by the UCC.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there are any exceptions that might make the oral modification enforceable. For example, if the restaurant manager accepted the shipment at the new price and didn't object, could that imply acceptance of the new terms?\n\nBut, in this scenario, the restaurant did accept the shipment but only paid $100, indicating that they accepted the quantity but not the price increase. So, their actions are mixed.\n\nAlso, considering that the contract required modifications to be in writing, and the modification wasn't in writing, it shouldn't be enforceable.\n\nBut, perhaps there's something about the performance of the contract that could make the modification enforceable. For instance, if the bakery relied on the oral agreement and acted upon it, could that make a difference?\n\nWell, the bakery shipped the bread at the new price, but they were already contracted to ship the bread anyway. It's not clear that the oral agreement caused them to act differently than they would have otherwise.\n\nMoreover, the restaurant only paid $100, which matches the original contract price, suggesting that they didn't agree to the price increase.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, it seems that the restaurant is not obligated to pay the extra $20 because the modifying agreement wasn't in writing, as required by the contract and the UCC.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait a minute, but option A also says yes, because the modification is enforceable even without new consideration. Is that possible?\n\nWell, under common law, modifications generally require consideration to be enforceable. However, under the UCC, specifically UCC 2-209, modifications can be made without consideration, but only if they're made in good faith and within a reasonable time. But, if the contract requires modifications to be in writing, then they must be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nIn this case, since the contract had a clause requiring written modifications, and the modification wasn't in writing, it shouldn't be enforceable under the UCC.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect, and option D is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other angle that might make the modification enforceable.\n\nIs there any possibility of promissory estoppel applying here? Promissory estoppel can make a promise enforceable without consideration if the promisee relies on it to their detriment.\n\nIn this case, did the bakery rely on the restaurant's agreement to the price increase to their detriment? The bakery shipped the bread, but they were already under contract to do so. It's not clear that their reliance was specifically based on the price increase.\n\nMoreover, the restaurant didn't agree to the price increase in writing, and their payment was only $100, indicating they didn't accept the new price.\n\nTherefore, promissory estoppel doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nAnother consideration: if the price increase was due to increased costs, and the contract didn't have a clause addressing cost increases, might there be some doctrine that allows for price adjustments in such cases?\n\nHowever, without a specific clause in the contract allowing for price adjustments based on cost increases, it's unlikely that such an adjustment would be enforceable.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
