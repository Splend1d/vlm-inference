                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"What is the price of a five-year bond (face value $100) that pays no coupons, if its yield is 4%?\" And the options are $100, $85, $82, and $75. Okay, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on bonds, but I remember that a bond that pays no coupons is like a zero-coupon bond. So, it doesn't pay any interest periodically; instead, it's sold at a discount and pays the face value at maturity.\n\nSo, if it's a zero-coupon bond with a face value of $100 and a yield of 4%, I need to find out what price today would make that yield 4%. I think I need to use the present value formula for a single future cash flow.\n\nThe formula for the present value (PV) is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- PV is the present value,\n\n- FV is the future value,\n\n- r is the interest rate per period,\n\n- n is the number of periods.\n\nIn this case, the future value (FV) is $100, the yield (r) is 4% per year, and the time to maturity (n) is 5 years.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{100}{(1 + 0.04)^5} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (1 + 0.04)^5 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.04)^5 = 1.216652902 \\]\n\nNow, divide the FV by this amount:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{100}{1.216652902} \\approx 82.22 \\]\n\nLooking back at the options, $82 is the closest to this calculation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is the yield given per annum? Yes, it says 4% yield, so I assume it's an annual yield, and since it's a zero-coupon bond, no need to adjust for compounding periods within the year.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes bonds compound semi-annually, but in this case, since it's a zero-coupon bond, it's likely just compounded annually.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using the formula for the price of a zero-coupon bond.\n\nThe price of a zero-coupon bond is indeed:\n\n\\[ Price = \\frac{Par}{(1 + y)^t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- Par is the par value ($100),\n\n- y is the yield (0.04),\n\n- t is the time to maturity in years (5).\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n\\[ Price = \\frac{100}{(1 + 0.04)^5} = \\frac{100}{1.216652902} \\approx 82.22 \\]\n\nAgain, that points to option C, $82.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if the yield is effective annual yield or nominal yield. If it's nominal yield, we might need to adjust based on the compounding frequency, but since it's a zero-coupon bond, it's likely compounded annually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the yield is given in continuous compounding terms. Let's see.\n\nIf the yield is continuous compounding, the formula would be:\n\n\\[ PV = FV \\cdot e^{-r \\cdot t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm,\n\n- r is the continuous compounding rate,\n\n- t is the time in years.\n\nBut the problem states \"yield is 4%,\" which likely refers to the annual yield, not necessarily continuous compounding. Moreover, the options suggest it's not continuous compounding, as e^{-0.04*5} is approximately 0.8167, which would correspond to $81.67, and none of the options match that exactly.\n\nTherefore, it's safer to assume it's annual compounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the yield is given in terms of bond equivalent yield (BEY), which is often used in bond markets.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating it. The straightforward approach should suffice.\n\nGiven that, the present value calculation seems correct, pointing to $82.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any premium or discount to par value.\n\nA zero-coupon bond should trade at a discount to its face value, which aligns with our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if the yield were equal to the coupon rate, the bond would trade at par, but since it's a zero-coupon bond, it doesn't have coupon payments.\n\nWait, but in this case, there are no coupons, so it's only paying the face value at maturity, hence the discount.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the bond's price is the present value of its future cash flows, which in this case is just the single cash flow of $100 in five years, discounted at 4% per year.\n\nYes, that reinforces the initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be $82.\n\nBut let's check the other options to ensure there's no alternative interpretation.\n\nOption A is $100, which would imply the bond is trading at par, which isn't the case for a zero-coupon bond with positive yield.\n\nOption B is $85, which is higher than our calculation.\n\nOption D is $75, which is lower than our calculation.\n\nHence, option C, $82, is the closest to our calculated present value of approximately $82.22.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. $82.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
