                    "text": "So I have this polynomial: 2x^5 + 8x - 7. And I need to figure out how many real roots it has. The options are none, one, two, or three. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what a real root is. A real root is a value of x that makes the polynomial equal to zero, and it's a real number, not imaginary.\n\nFirst, I should probably graph this function to get an idea of what it looks like. But since it's a fifth-degree polynomial, it might have multiple real roots. Wait, actually, odd-degree polynomials always have at least one real root because their end behaviors are different. Like, as x approaches positive infinity, the polynomial will go to positive infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, it will go to negative infinity. So, there has to be at least one real root.\n\nBut the question gives options up to three, so maybe it has more than one real root. How can I determine the exact number?\n\nMaybe I can try to find the derivative and see where it's increasing or decreasing. The derivative of 2x^5 + 8x - 7 is 10x^4 + 8. Setting that equal to zero: 10x^4 + 8 = 0 \u2192 10x^4 = -8 \u2192 x^4 = -8/10 = -0.8. But x^4 can't be negative, right? Because any real number raised to an even power is positive. So, there are no real roots for the derivative equation. That means the function is either always increasing or always decreasing.\n\nLet me check the second derivative to see if it has any inflection points. The second derivative is 40x^3. Setting that to zero: 40x^3 = 0 \u2192 x = 0. So, there's an inflection point at x = 0.\n\nWait, but since the first derivative has no real roots, the function is always increasing or always decreasing. Let's see: the leading term is 2x^5, which means that for large positive x, the function goes to positive infinity, and for large negative x, it goes to negative infinity. So, it must cross the x-axis at least once.\n\nBut does it cross more than once? Well, if it's always increasing, then it can only cross once. But if it has extrema, it could cross multiple times. But since the first derivative has no real roots, the function is always increasing. So, it should only cross the x-axis once.\n\nWait, but let's think about it again. If the derivative is always positive or always negative, depending on the value, the function is monotonic. Since the derivative is 10x^4 + 8, and x^4 is always non-negative, 10x^4 is always non-negative, so 10x^4 + 8 is always positive. Therefore, the function is always increasing.\n\nSo, since it's always increasing, it can only cross the x-axis once. Therefore, there should be only one real root.\n\nBut let's check the value of the function at x = 0 and maybe x = 1 to see.\n\nAt x = 0: 2(0)^5 + 8(0) - 7 = -7.\n\nAt x = 1: 2(1)^5 + 8(1) - 7 = 2 + 8 - 7 = 3.\n\nSince it's continuous and goes from -7 to 3, it must cross the x-axis somewhere between 0 and 1.\n\nLet me try x = 0.5: 2(0.5)^5 + 8(0.5) - 7 = 2*(0.03125) + 4 - 7 = 0.0625 + 4 - 7 = -2.9375.\n\nStill negative at x = 0.5. So, between x = 0.5 and x = 1, it must cross the x-axis once.\n\nTherefore, there is only one real root.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there could be more than one. If the function was not monotonic, there might be more than one root, but in this case, since the derivative has no real roots and is always positive, the function is strictly increasing, so only one real root.\n\nI think the answer is one real root.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
