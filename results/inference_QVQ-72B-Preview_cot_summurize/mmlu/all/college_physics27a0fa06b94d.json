                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two spaceships approaching Earth with equal speeds, but from opposite directions. An observer on Earth measures their speeds, and a meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by someone on the other spaceship. I need to find the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth. The options are 0.4c, 0.5c, 0.6c, and 0.7c.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. There are two spaceships moving towards Earth from opposite directions at the same speed, say v, according to an observer on Earth. Now, from the perspective of someone on one spaceship looking at the other spaceship, they measure a meterstick on the other spaceship to be 60 cm long.\n\nSo, the meterstick is contracted from its original length of 1 meter to 60 cm due to relativistic length contraction. The formula for length contraction is:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( L \\) is the contracted length (60 cm)\n\n- \\( L_0 \\) is the proper length (1 meter)\n\n- \\( v \\) is the relative speed between the two spaceships\n\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light\n\nBut wait, the relative speed between the two spaceships isn't directly v, because both are moving towards Earth with speed v, but from opposite directions. So, their relative speed should be v + v = 2v, since they're moving towards each other.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = 1 \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(2v)^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.36 = 1 - \\frac{4v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.36 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4v^2}{c^2} = 0.64 \\]\n\n\\[ 4v^2 = 0.64c^2 \\]\n\n\\[ v^2 = \\frac{0.64c^2}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ v^2 = 0.16c^2 \\]\n\n\\[ v = 0.4c \\]\n\nSo, the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth is 0.4c.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this. The question says \"as measured by an observer on Earth,\" and the options include 0.4c, which matches option A. But I should confirm if my approach is correct.\n\nI considered the relative speed between the two spaceships to be 2v, since they're moving towards each other with speeds v relative to Earth. Is that accurate in relativistic terms?\n\nActually, in special relativity, the relativistic addition of velocities is used when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. The formula for relative speed when two objects are moving towards each other is:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nIn this case, since both spaceships have the same speed v, and they're moving towards each other, it would be:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSo, the length contraction formula should use this relative speed:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{\\text{rel}}^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nGiven that L = 0.6 meters and L0 = 1 meter, we have:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = 1 \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nLet's denote \\( \\beta = \\frac{v}{c} \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2\\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.36 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{2\\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{2\\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\right)^2 = 1 - 0.36 \\]\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{2\\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\right)^2 = 0.64 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4\\beta^2}{(1 + \\beta^2)^2} = 0.64 \\]\n\n\\[ 4\\beta^2 = 0.64(1 + \\beta^2)^2 \\]\n\nLet's expand the right side:\n\n\\[ 4\\beta^2 = 0.64(1 + 2\\beta^2 + \\beta^4) \\]\n\n\\[ 4\\beta^2 = 0.64 + 1.28\\beta^2 + 0.64\\beta^4 \\]\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ 0 = 0.64\\beta^4 + 1.28\\beta^2 - 4\\beta^2 + 0.64 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 = 0.64\\beta^4 - 2.72\\beta^2 + 0.64 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 100 to eliminate decimals:\n\n\\[ 0 = 64\\beta^4 - 272\\beta^2 + 64 \\]\n\nDivide the entire equation by 8:\n\n\\[ 0 = 8\\beta^4 - 34\\beta^2 + 8 \\]\n\nLet's set \\( x = \\beta^2 \\), so:\n\n\\[ 8x^2 - 34x + 8 = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{34^2 - 4 \\times 8 \\times 8}}{2 \\times 8} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{1156 - 256}}{16} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{900}}{16} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{34 \\pm 30}{16} \\]\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{34 + 30}{16} = \\frac{64}{16} = 4 \\)\n\n2. \\( x = \\frac{34 - 30}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = 0.25 \\)\n\nSince \\( x = \\beta^2 \\), and \\( \\beta = \\frac{v}{c} \\), we have:\n\n1. \\( \\beta^2 = 4 \\) which implies \\( \\beta = 2 \\), but this is impossible since \\( \\beta \\) cannot be greater than 1.\n\n2. \\( \\beta^2 = 0.25 \\) which implies \\( \\beta = 0.5 \\), so \\( v = 0.5c \\)\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought the relative speed was 2v, which led me to \\( v = 0.4c \\), but now using the relativistic velocity addition, I get \\( v = 0.5c \\). Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the relativistic velocity addition formula again. The formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nGiven both spaceships have speed v, moving towards each other:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nAnd the length contraction formula is:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{\\text{rel}}^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nPlugging in \\( L = 0.6 \\) m and \\( L_0 = 1 \\) m:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2v}{c(1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2})} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. The formula should be:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{\\text{rel}}^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nLet me correct that:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2v}{c(1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2})} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nActually, no. The formula is \\( v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\), and it should be divided by \\( c \\) in the denominator? Wait, no. The formula for relativistic velocity addition is:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSo, if both spaceships have speed v, then:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nThen, the length contraction formula should be:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{\\text{rel}}^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = 1 \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2v}{c(1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2})} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nWait, but in the velocity addition formula, it's \\( v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} \\), which is \\( \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\), and this is the relative speed between the two spaceships.\n\nSo, plugging into the length contraction formula:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2v}{c(1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2})} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nWait, but the denominator in the velocity addition formula is \\( 1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\), not involving c in the denominator. So, it's \\( \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\).\n\nLet me set \\( \\beta = \\frac{v}{c} \\), so:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{2v}{1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{2 \\beta c}{1 + \\beta^2} \\]\n\nThen, the length contraction formula becomes:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2 \\beta c}{c(1 + \\beta^2)} \\right)^2 } = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2 \\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\right)^2 } \\]\n\nSo, same as before:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2 \\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\right)^2 } \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.36 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{2 \\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{2 \\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\right)^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4 \\beta^2}{(1 + \\beta^2)^2} = 0.64 \\]\n\n\\[ 4 \\beta^2 = 0.64 (1 + \\beta^2)^2 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s expand the right side:\n\n\\[ 0.64 (1 + 2 \\beta^2 + \\beta^4) = 0.64 + 1.28 \\beta^2 + 0.64 \\beta^4 \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 4 \\beta^2 = 0.64 + 1.28 \\beta^2 + 0.64 \\beta^4 \\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ 0.64 \\beta^4 + 1.28 \\beta^2 - 4 \\beta^2 + 0.64 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.64 \\beta^4 - 2.72 \\beta^2 + 0.64 = 0 \\]\n\nMultiply by 100 to eliminate decimals:\n\n\\[ 64 \\beta^4 - 272 \\beta^2 + 64 = 0 \\]\n\nDivide by 8:\n\n\\[ 8 \\beta^4 - 34 \\beta^2 + 8 = 0 \\]\n\nLet \\( x = \\beta^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 8x^2 - 34x + 8 = 0 \\]\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{34^2 - 4 \\times 8 \\times 8}}{2 \\times 8} = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{1156 - 256}}{16} = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{900}}{16} = \\frac{34 \\pm 30}{16} \\]\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{34 + 30}{16} = \\frac{64}{16} = 4 \\)\n\n2. \\( x = \\frac{34 - 30}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = 0.25 \\)\n\nSince \\( x = \\beta^2 \\), and \\( \\beta \\leq 1 \\), \\( x = 4 \\) is invalid. Therefore, \\( x = 0.25 \\), so \\( \\beta = 0.5 \\), meaning \\( v = 0.5c \\).\n\nBut earlier, I thought the relative speed was 2v, leading to \\( v = 0.4c \\), but that was incorrect because I didn't use the relativistic velocity addition formula correctly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \\( v = 0.5c \\), which corresponds to option B.\n\nTo confirm, let's plug \\( v = 0.5c \\) back into the formula:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.5c}{1 + \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{c}{1 + 0.25} = \\frac{c}{1.25} = 0.8c \\]\n\nThen, the length contraction formula:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{\\text{rel}}^2}{c^2}} = 1 \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.8c)^2}{c^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.64} = \\sqrt{0.36} = 0.6 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nWhich matches the given 60 cm. So, the answer is indeed \\( v = 0.5c \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5c} \\]"
