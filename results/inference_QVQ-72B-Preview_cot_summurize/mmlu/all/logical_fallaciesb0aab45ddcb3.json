                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this logical fallacy question. It says that applying irrelevant standards to the subject of the argument is the fallacy of... and then gives me four options: A. ad crumenam, B. ad antiquitatem, C. false criteria, and D. hasty generalization. I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a fallacy is. A fallacy is a mistake in reasoning or argumentation. There are many types of fallacies, and some have specific names like \"ad hominem\" or \"straw man.\"\n\nThe question is about applying irrelevant standards to the subject of the argument. So, if someone is using criteria that don't actually relate to the topic being discussed, that's the issue here.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. ad crumenam \u2013 I'm not super familiar with this one. I know that \"ad\" in Latin means \"to\" or \"toward,\" and \"crumenam\" might refer to wealth or something like that. Maybe it's about appealing to wealth or prosperity as a reason for something being true.\n\nB. ad antiquitatem \u2013 Again, \"ad\" means \"to,\" and \"antiquitatem\" suggests antiquity or age. This might be appealing to tradition or age as a reason for something being correct.\n\nC. false criteria \u2013 This seems straightforward. It's about using criteria that are not valid or relevant to the argument.\n\nD. hasty generalization \u2013 This is when someone makes a broad conclusion based on too little evidence.\n\nGiven that the question is about applying irrelevant standards to the subject of the argument, it seems like \"false criteria\" would be the most direct description of that situation. Using criteria that don't actually apply or are irrelevant to the topic at hand would be considered a fallacy of false criteria.\n\nLet me double-check. If someone is evaluating an argument based on standards that have nothing to do with its validity, that's indeed a problem in reasoning. For example, judging the quality of a scientific theory based on how popular it is rather than on empirical evidence would be using false criteria.\n\nAd crumenam seems more about appealing to wealth or prosperity as a justification, which is different from using irrelevant criteria in general.\n\nAd antiquitatem is about appealing to tradition or age as a reason for something being true, which is also a specific type of irrelevant criterion, but again, more specific than the general concept of false criteria.\n\nHasty generalization is about drawing conclusions prematurely, which isn't directly about using irrelevant criteria.\n\nSo, among the given options, C. false criteria seems to be the most accurate description of applying irrelevant standards to the subject of the argument.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's a specific Latin term for this fallacy. Sometimes, fallacies have traditional names in Latin, like ad hominem or ad populum.\n\nLet me see: ad crumenam \u2013 a quick search in my mind tells me that crumenam refers to a fold or crease, possibly metaphorical for wealth, since money can be folded. So, ad crumenam might be appealing to wealth or prosperity as a reason for something being good or true. Not exactly about irrelevant criteria.\n\nAd antiquitatem \u2013 this one is appealing to tradition or age as a justification for something being correct. Again, it's a specific type of irrelevant criterion, but the question seems to be asking about the general concept of using irrelevant criteria.\n\nFalse criteria \u2013 this seems to directly mean using criteria that are not valid or relevant to the argument, which matches the description in the question.\n\nHasty generalization \u2013 this is about making broad statements based on insufficient data, which is different from using irrelevant criteria.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. false criteria.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another example. Suppose someone argues that a particular policy is good because it's been in place for a long time (ad antiquitatem). That's using the age of the policy as a criterion for its quality, which is a specific type of false criterion. So, ad antiquitatem is a subset of false criteria.\n\nSimilarly, ad crumenam would be another specific type of false criterion, where wealth is used as an irrelevant standard.\n\nBut the question is about the general concept of applying irrelevant standards, not a specific type.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C. false criteria.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. false criteria}} \\]"
