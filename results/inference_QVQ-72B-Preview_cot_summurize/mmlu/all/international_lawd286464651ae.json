                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this thing called the \"Lotus principle.\" It seems like it's an important concept in international law, especially related to the sovereignty of states and their actions. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst off, I know that in international law, states are considered sovereign entities. That means they have the power to govern themselves without any external interference, right? So, unless there's a specific rule or treaty that limits their behavior, they can pretty much do what they want.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law.'\n\nB. The so-called Lotus principle is that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes.\n\nC. The so-called Lotus principle is that States are not prohibited to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas.\n\nD. The so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris.\n\nLet me evaluate each one.\n\nOption A seems to capture the essence of the Lotus principle. It suggests that unless there's a clear restriction, states can act freely. This aligns with the idea that sovereignty grants them the right to do anything that isn't explicitly forbidden by international law.\n\nOption B talks about states choosing which court to submit their disputes to. While that's an interesting point, I don't recall the Lotus principle being directly related to dispute resolution mechanisms. Maybe it's related to some other principle, but not Lotus.\n\nOption C mentions states asserting their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. Again, while there are rules about maritime law and the high seas, I don't think that's directly connected to the Lotus principle.\n\nOption D defines customary international law as deriving from state practice and opinio juris. That's actually correct; customary law is based on how states behave consistently over time and their belief that such behavior is legally required. However, that's not what the Lotus principle is about.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Option A is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me recall what the Lotus case was about.\n\nThe Lotus case, also known as the Collisions Case, was a 1923 incident where a Turkish vessel, the Lotu(s), collided with a French vessel in the Mediterranean Sea. The case revolved around the question of whether Turkey could exercise jurisdiction over the French captain involved in the collision, even though the incident occurred in international waters.\n\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), predecessor to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), ruled that unless there's a specific international norm prohibiting an action, states have the freedom to regulate it. This led to the famous statement that \"sovereign states do not become internationally liable for merely causing damage outside their territory, unless they have violated some international obligation.\"\n\nThis principle, often referred to as the Lotus principle, essentially means that states are free to act unless their actions are constrained by international law. So, in line with Option A, it's about presuming that restrictions on state independence cannot be presumed, and that whatever isn't prohibited is permitted.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check if any of the other options could possibly be related to the Lotus principle.\n\nOption B: States choosing which court to submit their disputes to. While states do have the freedom to choose dispute resolution mechanisms, this isn't directly connected to the Lotus principle, which is more about jurisdiction and state sovereignty in regulatory matters.\n\nOption C: States asserting their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. While the Lotus case did involve an incident on the high seas, the principle that emerged wasn't specifically about high seas jurisdiction but rather about the general freedom of states to regulate absent specific international restrictions.\n\nOption D: Customary law deriving from state practice and opinio juris. This is a fundamental principle of international law, but it's not directly related to the Lotus principle, which is about the limits of state regulatory power.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option A: The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law.'\n\nTo wrap it up, the Lotus principle underscores the sovereignty of states and the need for clear international legal constraints to limit their regulatory powers. It's a foundational concept in international law, emphasizing that states are free to act unless their actions are specifically restricted by international norms or treaties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
