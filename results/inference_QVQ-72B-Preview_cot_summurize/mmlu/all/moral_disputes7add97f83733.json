                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about moral theory, and it's asking what corresponds to the theoretical aim of moral theory. The options are explanatory power, parsimony, practical guidance, or none of the above. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what the \"theoretical aim\" of moral theory is. Moral theory, I think, is basically about understanding what makes actions right or wrong, or what kinds of lives are good or bad. So, the theoretical aim is probably about explaining or understanding these concepts in a systematic way.\n\nOption A is \"explanatory power.\" That sounds plausible. Moral theory should be able to explain why certain actions are considered moral or immoral. It should provide a framework that makes sense of moral phenomena.\n\nOption B is \"parsimony.\" Parsimony is like simplicity or economy in explanations. So, maybe a good moral theory is one that's not overly complicated and doesn't introduce unnecessary concepts. That also seems important.\n\nOption C is \"practical guidance.\" This seems different from the other two. While moral theories might provide practical guidance on how to act, the question is about the theoretical aim, which seems more about understanding and explaining rather than prescribing.\n\nGiven that, maybe practical guidance is more of a practical aim rather than a theoretical one. So, perhaps the answer isn't C.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe both explanatory power and parsimony are important for the theoretical aim. But the question is asking for what corresponds to the theoretical aim, and it might be more than one thing. However, since it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer, I need to pick the one that best fits.\n\nLet me consider what the theoretical aim of moral theory is primarily concerned with. Is it mainly about explaining why certain actions are moral or immoral, or is it about providing rules for people to follow?\n\nI think it's primarily about explanation and understanding. So, explanatory power seems crucial. Parsimony might be a desirable feature, but it's more about the efficiency of the theory rather than its core explanatory function.\n\nPractical guidance, on the other hand, seems more related to the applied aspect of moral theory, like in ethics or normative theory, rather than the theoretical foundation.\n\nSo, if I had to choose one, I'd go with A, explanatory power.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe parsimony is also a key aspect of the theoretical aim. After all, having a simple and elegant theory is often seen as desirable in science and philosophy.\n\nBut is parsimony unique to moral theory's theoretical aim, or is it a general desideratum for theories in general? Maybe it's more of a general principle rather than something specific to moral theory's aim.\n\nOn the other hand, practical guidance seems very specific to moral theory, as it's about guiding actions and decisions.\n\nBut again, the question is about the theoretical aim, which might be more about understanding and explanation rather than direct guidance.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the question. If the theoretical aim of moral theory is to understand the nature of morality, then explanatory power would be central to that aim. Parsimony might make the theory more elegant, but it's not essential to the aim of explanation.\n\nPractical guidance, while important, might be more of a consequence or application of the theory rather than part of its theoretical aim.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is A, explanatory power.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the theoretical aim is to provide a foundation for practical moral decisions, which would make practical guidance part of the theoretical aim. But that seems a bit circular.\n\nI think I'll stick with A, explanatory power, as the primary correspondence to the theoretical aim of moral theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
