                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. Jones is arrested for driving under the influence of marijuana, and the prosecution wants to use a videotape from a party where Jones was smoking and saying stuff about the weed being great. Then, Jones testifies that he's an honest person and didn't drive erratically. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asks if it's true that Jones lied in his divorce trial last year. Jones's lawyer objects, and I need to figure out how the court will likely rule on this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules about impeaching a witness's credibility. I remember that a witness's credibility can be attacked by showing they've made prior inconsistent statements or by showing they have a character trait for untruthfulness. But there are limits to how you can do that.\n\nOption A says the question is admissible because it goes to Jones's credibility as a witness. But I need to think about whether specific instances of conduct can be used to attack credibility.\n\nOption B mentions that it's admissible if the prosecutor produces a certified copy of the conviction. Wait, but this is about lying in a divorce trial. Is that a criminal conviction? I don't think lying in a divorce trial is necessarily a crime, at least not in the same way as perjury in a criminal case. So, maybe that's not directly applicable here.\n\nOption C says it's not admissible because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence. Hmm, I think there's a rule that you generally can't introduce specific acts of conduct to prove character, but there are exceptions, especially when it comes to impeaching a witness.\n\nOption D says it's not admissible because it's irrelevant. But I think it's relevant to his credibility since he's testifying about his honesty.\n\nLet me look up the rule on impeaching a witness with specific instances of conduct.\n\nI recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 608, you can attack a witness's character for truthfulness by evidence of specific instances of the witness's conduct, but only if they are probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness. However, this evidence must be in the form of testimony about the conduct, not through introducing evidence of the conduct itself.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at Rule 608 more carefully.\n\nRule 608 states:\n\n(a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character.\n\n(1) In general. The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of an opinion or inference about the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. But the evidence may not take the form of testimony about the witness\u2019s reputation.\n\n(2) Limitations on using evidence of specific instances of conduct.\n\n(a) Prohibited uses. Evidence of a witness\u2019s character may not be introduced by evidence of specific instances of the witness\u2019s conduct.\n\n(b) Permitted uses. This paragraph does not limit:\n\n(i) evidence of a witness\u2019s bias, prejudice, or interest;\n\n(ii) evidence of a witness\u2019s capacity to perceive, recall, or communicate; or\n\n(iii) questions about the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, as provided in Rule 608(b).\n\nSo, Rule 608(b) allows questions about the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, but not evidence of specific instances of conduct to prove character.\n\nWait, but there's more to it. Let me check Rule 608(b):\n\nA party may not attack a witness\u2019s character for truthfulness by offering evidence of specific instances of the witness\u2019s conduct, except for witnesses other than a defendant in a criminal case. This rule does not limit:\n\n(1) the right of a party to examine the witness about the witness\u2019s conduct;\n\n(2) the right of the prosecutor in a criminal case to attack the character for truthfulness of the defendant by offering evidence of the defendant\u2019s conviction of a crime; or\n\n(3) the right of a party to offer evidence of the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness by means of an opinion or reputation witness, subject to the limitations in Rule 608(a).\n\nSo, for witnesses other than a defendant in a criminal case, you can't introduce evidence of specific instances of conduct to attack their character for truthfulness, but you can ask them about it on cross-examination.\n\nWait, but Jones is testifying on his own behalf in a criminal case against him for DUI. So, he's a defendant testifying in his own defense.\n\nRule 608(b) says that for witnesses other than a defendant in a criminal case, you can't introduce evidence of specific instances of conduct to attack their character for truthfulness. But for a defendant in a criminal case, the prosecutor can attack the character for truthfulness by offering evidence of the defendant's conviction of a crime, per Rule 608(b)(2).\n\nBut in this scenario, the prosecutor is asking about lying in a divorce trial last year. Is that a criminal conviction?\n\nI think lying in a divorce trial might not be a criminal offense; it might be perjury if it was under oath, but I'm not sure about the specifics.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the prosecutor wants to ask Jones about lying in his divorce trial to impeach his credibility. Under Rule 608(b), for a defendant in a criminal case, the prosecutor can attack the character for truthfulness by offering evidence of the defendant's conviction of a crime.\n\nBut in this case, it's about lying in a divorce trial, which may not be a criminal conviction. So, perhaps the prosecutor can't use that specific instance to impeach Jones's credibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prosecutor can ask Jones about it, and if Jones denies it, then the prosecutor can introduce evidence to contradict him.\n\nWait, Rule 608(b)(1) says that a party may not attack a witness's character for truthfulness by offering evidence of specific instances of the witness's conduct, except for witnesses other than a defendant in a criminal case.\n\nBut then it says this rule doesn't limit the right of a party to examine the witness about the witness's conduct.\n\nSo, the prosecutor can ask Jones about lying in his divorce trial, but can't introduce evidence of that conduct to prove his untruthfulness, unless it's a criminal conviction.\n\nGiven that, in this scenario, the prosecutor is asking the question, and Jones's lawyer objects. The court will likely rule that the question is admissible to attack Jones's credibility, but any evidence to prove that he did lie in the divorce trial would require further justification, perhaps under exceptions for prior inconsistent statements or other rules.\n\nBut in the options provided, Option A says it's admissible because it goes to Jones's credibility as a witness. That seems plausible, but I need to make sure.\n\nOption B says it's admissible if the prosecutor produces a certified copy of the conviction. But again, lying in a divorce trial may not be a criminal conviction, so this might not apply.\n\nOption C says it's not admissible because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence. That seems to align with Rule 608(b), but in this case, it's a question being asked, not evidence being presented.\n\nOption D says it's not admissible because it's irrelevant. But I think it's relevant to his credibility.\n\nGiven that, I think the court will likely hold that the prosecutor's question is admissible to attack Jones's credibility, as per Option A.\n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe look at some case law or further explanations of Rule 608.\n\nI found that under Rule 608(b), a party may not attack a witness's character for truthfulness by evidence of specific instances of conduct, except for witnesses other than a defendant in a criminal case. However, the party can still ask the witness about those instances on cross-examination.\n\nIn this case, since Jones is the defendant testifying in his own defense, the prosecutor can ask him about specific instances of untruthfulness, such as lying in his divorce trial, to test his credibility.\n\nIf Jones admits to lying in the divorce trial, that admission can be used to impeach his current testimony. If he denies it, then the prosecutor may be allowed to introduce evidence to contradict him, but only under certain circumstances, such as if the lie in the divorce trial was under oath and pertained to material facts.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the question is only about the admissibility of the prosecutor's question, not about introducing evidence to prove the lie in the divorce trial.\n\nTherefore, the court will likely hold that the prosecutor's question is admissible to attack Jones's credibility, as per Option A.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
