                    "text": "Let's dive into this property law scenario. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, we have a series of conveyances of an orchard, and we need to figure out who ends up with the property based on a pure race statute.\n\nFirst off, a pure race statute means that the first party to record their deed has priority, regardless of whether they had notice of any previous unrecorded conveyances. So, it's all about who gets to the recorder's office first.\n\nLet's map out the timeline of events:\n\n1. February 1: The man conveys the orchard to the gardener, and the gardener records the conveyance.\n\n2. February 2: The gardener conveys the property to the landscaper but does not record it.\n\n3. February 4: The gardener conveys the property again, this time to a friend, who gives $100,000 and records the conveyance, even though he knows about the prior conveyance to the landscaper.\n\n4. February 4: The landscaper records her deed.\n\n5. February 5: The friend conveys his interest to an investor for $115,000. The investor buys without notice of the landscaper's conveyance and records the deed.\n\n6. February 6: The landscaper records her deed.\n\nWait a minute, it seems like there might be a confusion here. Both the friend and the landscaper are recording their deeds on February 4 and 6, respectively, but the friend recorded on February 4, and the landscaper on February 6. But let's confirm:\n\n- Friend records on February 4.\n\n- Landscaper records on February 6.\n\n- Investor records on February 5.\n\nOkay, so the sequence is:\n\n- February 1: Gardener records his deed from the man.\n\n- February 2: Gardener conveys to landscaper (unrecorded).\n\n- February 4: Gardener conveys to friend, who records.\n\n- February 5: Friend conveys to investor, who records.\n\n- February 6: Landscaper records her deed from gardener.\n\nNow, under a pure race statute, the first to record has priority.\n\nBut wait, the gardener recorded his deed from the man on February 1, which is the initial conveyance.\n\nDoes this affect subsequent conveyances?\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, the man conveys to the gardener, and the gardener records it. So, the gardener is now the owner on record.\n\nThen, the gardener conveys to the landscaper on February 2 but doesn't record it.\n\nOn February 4, the gardener conveys again to a friend, who records it.\n\nUnder pure race, since the friend recorded before the landscaper, the friend should have priority over the landscaper.\n\nBut then, on February 5, the friend conveys to an investor, who records the deed.\n\nThe investor records on February 5, which is before the landscaper records on February 6.\n\nSo, between the friend and the investor, who has priority?\n\nWell, the investor bought from the friend and recorded after the friend, but the investor didn't have notice of the landscaper's conveyance.\n\nBut in pure race, it's all about who records first, regardless of notice.\n\nSo, the investor recorded on February 5, and the landscaper on February 6.\n\nBut the friend recorded his deed on February 4.\n\nSo, the sequence of recordings is:\n\n- Gardener: February 1\n\n- Friend: February 4\n\n- Investor: February 5\n\n- Landscaper: February 6\n\nNow, the investor is buying from the friend, who recorded on February 4.\n\nDoes the investor's recording on February 5 affect the friend's priority?\n\nI don't think so. The friend recorded his deed on February 4, which is before the investor's conveyance.\n\nSo, the friend has a recorded deed as of February 4.\n\nThen, the friend conveys to the investor, who records on February 5.\n\nBut the friend already recorded his deed on February 4, so the investor is essentially stepping into the friend's shoes.\n\nBut in terms of priority, the friend's recording on February 4 is prior to the investor's recording on February 5.\n\nHowever, since the investor is buying from the friend, and the friend's deed is already recorded, the investor's recording on February 5 is likely just perfecting their interest.\n\nBut in pure race, as long as the conveyance is recorded before another conveyance is recorded, it has priority.\n\nSo, the friend recorded on February 4, landscaper on February 6, and investor on February 5.\n\nBut the investor bought from the friend, who already recorded.\n\nSo, the investor has a valid conveyance from the friend, who had recorded his deed.\n\nTherefore, the investor should have priority over the landscaper, who recorded later on February 6.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the friend has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper when he records his deed on February 4.\n\nDoes that matter under pure race?\n\nIn pure race jurisdictions, actual knowledge doesn't matter; it's all about the recording order.\n\nSo, even if the friend knew about the landscaper's unrecorded deed, as long as he records first, his deed prevails.\n\nSimilarly, the investor buys from the friend without notice of the landscaper's conveyance and records on February 5.\n\nSo, between the friend and the investor, the investor is recording after the friend, but since the friend already recorded his deed, the investor is protected.\n\nNow, the landscaper records on February 6, which is after both the friend and the investor have recorded their deeds.\n\nTherefore, under pure race, the investor should have the best claim to the property.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nPure race statute means that the first to record without notice of prior deeds has priority.\n\nWait, actually, in pure race jurisdictions, it's the first to record, regardless of notice.\n\nWhereas, in some jurisdictions, it's the first to record without notice.\n\nBut in this case, it's specified that it's a pure race statute, so it's strictly about the recording date.\n\nTherefore, the investor, who recorded on February 5, has priority over the landscaper, who recorded on February 6.\n\nMoreover, the friend recorded on February 4, which is before the investor's recording, but since the investor is buying from the friend, and the friend's deed is already recorded, the investor's recording is likely just to ensure his interest is protected.\n\nTherefore, the investor should be the prevailing party.\n\nWait, but the question mentions that the friend has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper.\n\nDoes that affect anything under pure race?\n\nNo, because in pure race, knowledge doesn't matter; it's all about who records first.\n\nSo, even if the friend knew about the landscaper's deed, as long as he recorded first, his deed prevails.\n\nSimilarly, the investor buys from the friend without notice of the landscaper's conveyance and records on February 5.\n\nTherefore, the investor should have the best claim.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. The investor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
