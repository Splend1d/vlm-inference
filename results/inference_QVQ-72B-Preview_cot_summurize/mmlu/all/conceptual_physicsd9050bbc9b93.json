                    "text": "So I have this problem about beat frequency. There are two sound sources, one with a frequency of 500 Hz and the other with 504 Hz. When these two waves interfere with each other, I need to find out what the beat frequency will be. The options are 2 Hz, 4 Hz, 8 Hz, and 16 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what beat frequency is. I recall that when two sound waves of slightly different frequencies are played together, they create a fluctuating sound intensity that we perceive as a pulsing or throbbing sound. This pulsing is called a beat, and its frequency is the difference between the two frequencies.\n\nSo, if I have one sound at 500 Hz and another at 504 Hz, the beat frequency should be the difference between these two frequencies. Let me calculate that:\n\n504 Hz - 500 Hz = 4 Hz\n\nSo, according to this, the beat frequency should be 4 Hz. Looking at the options, B. 4 Hz seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's more to it than just subtracting the two frequencies. Let me think about the physics behind it.\n\nWhen two sound waves of frequencies f1 and f2 are superimposed, the resulting pressure variation can be expressed using the principle of superposition. The combined wave is the sum of the individual waves:\n\np(t) = p1(t) + p2(t)\n\nwhere p1(t) = A1 * cos(2\u03c0f1 t) and p2(t) = A2 * cos(2\u03c0f2 t)\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\np(t) = A1 cos(2\u03c0f1 t) + A2 cos(2\u03c0f2 t)\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity for the sum of cosines:\n\ncos(a) + cos(b) = 2 cos((a + b)/2) cos((a - b)/2)\n\nSo, p(t) = 2 cos(2\u03c0(f1 + f2)/2 t) cos(2\u03c0(f1 - f2)/2 t)\n\nThis shows that the resulting wave has an amplitude that modulates at a frequency of (f1 - f2)/2, and a carrier frequency of (f1 + f2)/2.\n\nWait a minute, according to this formula, the frequency of the amplitude modulation, which is the beat frequency, is actually (f1 - f2)/2. In my earlier calculation, I just did f2 - f1, which is 4 Hz, but according to this formula, it should be (f1 - f2)/2, which would be (500 - 504)/2 = -4/2 = -2 Hz. But frequency can't be negative, so it would be 2 Hz.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought the beat frequency is simply the difference between the two frequencies, which is 4 Hz, but according to this formula, it's 2 Hz. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The formula for the beat frequency is indeed (f1 - f2)/2, which would give 2 Hz in this case. But why does it seem counterintuitive? If one frequency is 500 Hz and the other is 504 Hz, shouldn't the number of beats per second be 4 Hz?\n\nI think I might be missing something here. Let me consider the physical phenomenon again. When two waves of slightly different frequencies are combined, the resulting sound has a fluctuating loudness at a rate equal to the difference in their frequencies. So, in this case, the loudness would fluctuate 4 times per second, which would be 4 Hz.\n\nBut according to the mathematical derivation, the amplitude modulation frequency is (f1 - f2)/2, which would be 2 Hz. This discrepancy is confusing. Maybe I need to look up the exact expression for beat frequency.\n\nUpon checking, I find that the beat frequency is indeed given by the absolute value of the difference between the two frequencies, i.e., |f1 - f2|. So, in this case, it would be |504 Hz - 500 Hz| = 4 Hz.\n\nI think the confusion arose from misremembering the formula. The formula I initially used, (f1 - f2)/2, might be related to the amplitude modulation depth or something else, but for beat frequency, it's simply the difference between the two frequencies.\n\nTherefore, the correct beat frequency is 4 Hz, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier step, if I consider the formula (f1 - f2)/2, and plug in the values, (500 - 504)/2 = -2 Hz, which is absolute value 2 Hz, matching option A. So, which one is right?\n\nI need to resolve this confusion. Let me search for the exact expression for beat frequency.\n\nUpon researching, I find that the beat frequency is indeed the absolute value of the difference between the two frequencies, i.e., fb = |f2 - f1|. So, fb = |504 Hz - 500 Hz| = 4 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 4 Hz.\n\nBut to ensure there's no misunderstanding, let's consider another perspective. Suppose we have two sine waves: s1(t) = sin(2\u03c0f1 t) and s2(t) = sin(2\u03c0f2 t). Their sum is:\n\ns(t) = sin(2\u03c0f1 t) + sin(2\u03c0f2 t)\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(a) + sin(b) = 2 sin((a + b)/2) cos((a - b)/2)\n\nSo, s(t) = 2 sin(2\u03c0(f1 + f2)/2 t) cos(2\u03c0(f1 - f2)/2 t)\n\nHere, the cosine term represents the amplitude modulation, which oscillates at a frequency of (f1 - f2)/2. However, the perceived beat frequency is actually the rate at which the amplitude goes through zero crossings or peaks, which corresponds to twice this modulation frequency, i.e., |f1 - f2|.\n\nWait, perhaps that's where the confusion lies. In some contexts, the modulation frequency is (f1 - f2)/2, but the number of beats per second, i.e., the frequency at which we perceive the loudness fluctuations, is |f1 - f2|.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, the beat frequency is indeed |504 Hz - 500 Hz| = 4 Hz.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 4 Hz.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider an example. If one tuning fork has 500 Hz and another has 504 Hz, the number of beats heard per second would be 4 Hz, meaning the loudness fluctuates 4 times per second.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 4 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
