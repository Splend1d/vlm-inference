                    "text": "So I have this question about cost concepts in economics, and I need to figure out which of the given options is true. Let's start by recalling what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, TC stands for Total Cost, which is the sum of all costs incurred in the production of a good or service. It's basically how much it costs to produce a certain quantity of output.\n\nAVC is Average Variable Cost, which is the variable cost per unit of output. Variable costs are those that change with the level of production, like raw materials or labor.\n\nAFC is Average Fixed Cost, which is the fixed cost per unit of output. Fixed costs are those that remain constant regardless of the level of production, like rent or machinery depreciation.\n\nTFC is Total Fixed Cost, which is the total cost that does not change with the level of production.\n\nMC is Marginal Cost, which is the cost of producing one additional unit of output.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: TC = (AVC + AFC)Q.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. AVC is the variable cost per unit, and AFC is the fixed cost per unit. So, if I add AVC and AFC, that should give me the total cost per unit. Then, multiplying by Q (quantity produced) should give me the total cost. Wait, but AFC decreases as Q increases because fixed costs are spread over more units. So, AVC + AFC is indeed the total cost per unit, and multiplying by Q gives total cost. This seems plausible, but let's verify it with a formula.\n\nWe know that:\n\nTC = TFC + TVC\n\nWhere TFC is total fixed cost and TVC is total variable cost.\n\nAlso, AVC = TVC / Q\n\nAnd AFC = TFC / Q\n\nSo, AVC + AFC = (TVC / Q) + (TFC / Q) = (TVC + TFC) / Q = TC / Q\n\nTherefore, TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nOption B says: TFC = TC at all levels of output.\n\nWell, TFC is total fixed cost, which doesn't change with the level of output, whereas TC is total cost, which includes both fixed and variable costs. So, TC = TFC + TVC\n\nUnless TVC is zero, which it isn't in normal production scenarios, TC won't equal TFC. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C says: AVC + AFC = TC.\n\nWait a minute, AVC + AFC gives the total cost per unit, not the total cost itself. As we saw earlier, AVC + AFC = TC / Q, so this is not generally equal to TC unless Q is 1, which isn't true for all levels of output. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D says: MC = TC - TFC.\n\nMC is the change in total cost divided by the change in quantity, which is typically expressed as MC = \u0394TC / \u0394Q. However, TC - TFC equals TVC, which is total variable cost. MC is not equal to TVC; rather, MC can be thought of as the additional cost of producing one more unit, which might or might not equal TVC depending on the context, but generally, they are not equal. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A: TC = (AVC + AFC)Q.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose TFC is $100, and TVC is $50 at Q=10. Then:\n\nAFC = TFC / Q = 100 / 10 = $10\n\nAVC = TVC / Q = 50 / 10 = $5\n\nSo, AVC + AFC = $15\n\nTherefore, TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q = 15 * 10 = $150\n\nAlternatively, TC = TFC + TVC = 100 + 50 = $150\n\nBoth methods give the same result, confirming that option A is correct.\n\nI think that's solid reasoning. So, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
