                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: 4 \u00f7 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4. I need to find out what it equals, and there are some options given: A. -12, B. 12, C. 8, D. 16. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I remember that in math problems like this, there's an order to do things called the order of operations. My teacher always told me to use PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Okay, so let's apply that here.\n\nLooking at the problem: 4 \u00f7 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nThere are no parentheses or exponents here, so I need to start with multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst operation is division: 4 \u00f7 2 equals 2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes: 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nNext, multiplication: 2 \u2022 2 equals 4.\n\nSo now it's: 4 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nThen, addition: 4 + 8 equals 12.\n\nFinally, subtraction: 12 \u2212 4 equals 8.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be 8.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nStarting again:\n\n4 \u00f7 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nFirst, division: 4 \u00f7 2 is 2.\n\nThen, multiplication: 2 \u2022 2 is 4.\n\nAddition: 4 + 8 is 12.\n\nSubtraction: 12 \u2212 4 is 8.\n\nYeah, I get 8 again. So, the answer should be C. 8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nI've heard sometimes people get confused with the order of operations, especially when there are multiple operations of the same precedence. But according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division are done from left to right.\n\nLet me try calculating it differently.\n\nMaybe if I rearrange the terms or group them differently, but no, that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the entire expression step by step.\n\n4 \u00f7 2 is 2.\n\nThen, 2 \u2022 2 is 4.\n\nThen, 4 + 8 is 12.\n\nFinally, 12 \u2212 4 is 8.\n\nYeah, consistent results.\n\nWait, maybe someone would think that multiplication should be done before division, but actually, in PEMDAS, multiplication and division are at the same level and are performed left to right.\n\nSo, in this case, division comes before multiplication because it's to the left.\n\n4 \u00f7 2 is 2, then 2 \u2022 2 is 4, then 4 + 8 is 12, then 12 \u2212 4 is 8.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as per the order of operations, it should be straightforward.\n\nLet me try plugging it into a calculator to confirm.\n\nCalculating 4 \u00f7 2 \u2022 2 + 8 \u2212 4.\n\nFirst, division: 4 \u00f7 2 = 2.\n\nThen, multiplication: 2 \u2022 2 = 4.\n\nThen, addition: 4 + 8 = 12.\n\nThen, subtraction: 12 \u2212 4 = 8.\n\nYep, matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the answer is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
