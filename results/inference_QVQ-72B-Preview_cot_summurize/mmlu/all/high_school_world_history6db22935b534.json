When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, it's about the Rig Veda, which is this ancient text from India, like really old, from 1500-1000 BCE. The passage is about \"Purusa-Sukta,\" which seems to be a hymn or a song about this being called Purusa. It talks about how Purusa is the lord of the immortals and how the gods sacrificed Purusa, and from that sacrifice, different things and social classes emerged.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is saying. It describes a cosmic sacrifice of Purusa, and from this sacrifice, various elements of the world and society were created. It mentions the creation of different animals and also the emergence of the four varnas or castes: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras. These castes are like the priestly class, the warrior class, the merchant class, and the laborer class, respectively.\n\nSo, the passage is linking the creation of the social hierarchy to this cosmic event described in the Rig Veda. Now, the question is asking which statement is supported by this information.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The caste system was a purely social construct that reflected its time period.\"\n\nHmm, but the passage seems to suggest that the caste system has a divine origin, based on this cosmic sacrifice of Purusa. It's presented as part of a sacred text, which would imply that it's not just a social construct of a particular time period, but something with religious significance and perhaps seen as eternal or divinely ordained.\n\nOption B: \"The caste system was encouraged by regional princes to reinforce social stability.\"\n\nWell, the passage doesn't mention regional princes or any political figures. It's more about the religious or cosmological origin of the caste system. So, this option doesn't seem to be supported by the information given.\n\nOption C: \"The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders.\"\n\nAgain, the passage doesn't mention any specific historical events or invaders. It's from a much earlier period, 1500-1000 BCE, and Muslim invaders didn't come to India until much later, around the medieval period. So, this option isn't supported by the passage.\n\nOption D: \"The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.\"\n\nThis seems the most plausible. The Rig Veda is one of the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism, and it's describing the origin of the caste system in a cosmic sacrifice. This suggests that the caste system is deeply rooted in Hindu religious thought and practice, and has been part of it from very early on. The fact that it's mentioned in such an ancient text implies that it was seen as a fundamental aspect of the religion, possibly intended to be enduring and transcending specific historical contexts.\n\nSo, based on the information in the passage, option D seems to be the best answer. The other options either don't align with what's described or refer to historical contexts not mentioned in the passage.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think a bit more. The passage clearly links the caste system to the sacrifice of Purusa, which is a central part of Hindu cosmology. This suggests that the caste system isn't just a social arrangement, but something that's part of the religious belief system, possibly seen as divinely established and eternal.\n\nTherefore, the statement that the caste system was integral to the Hindu religion and transcended historical eras is supported by the information provided in the passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
