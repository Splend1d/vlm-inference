The idea is that this group can decide who joins them, but they can't stop others from using the park. The question is, what's the point of this example? Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Central Park qualifies as a state.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit of a stretch. A state is usually a political entity with sovereignty, boundaries, and a population. Central Park is a public park in New York City, governed by the city's policies, not its own separate state. So, I don't think this is the main point.\n\nB. There is a difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory.\n\nThis sounds interesting. The yoga group can control who joins their group, which is about membership. But they can't control who else uses the park, which is about settlement in the physical space. So, maybe the point is that these are two different things: one is about joining a group, and the other is about being present in a place.\n\nC. Territorial rights only belong to individuals.\n\nWell, the example is about a group, the yoga group, and their ability to control membership versus controlling the territory. It doesn't seem to suggest that only individuals have territorial rights. In fact, it shows that the group can't control the park, which is a territorial space. So, maybe not.\n\nD. Wellman is committed to an absurd theory of group membership.\n\nI don't know who Wellman is, but this seems to be referring to a theorist's ideas on group membership. Without context, it's hard to see how this example directly criticizes Wellman's theory as absurd. Maybe it's related, but I need more information to understand this option.\n\nGiven the options, I think B is the most straightforward interpretation. The example illustrates that there's a distinction between regulating who joins a group (membership) and regulating who can be present in a physical space (settlement). The yoga group can do the former but not the latter, which highlights that these are different concepts.\n\nSo, my answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
