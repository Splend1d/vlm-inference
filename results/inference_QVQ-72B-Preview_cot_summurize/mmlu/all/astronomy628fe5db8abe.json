                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the distance between the Earth and the Sun is something I should probably know. I think it's about 150 million kilometers. But wait, the question is asking for the distance to Altair, which is one million times farther than the Earth-Sun distance. Hmm.\n\nFirst things first, I need to make sure I have the correct distance from Earth to the Sun. I recall that the average distance is approximately 150 million kilometers. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, a quick search in my memory tells me that the average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 150 million kilometers. That's what we call an astronomical unit (AU), but since the question is in meters, I should convert that.\n\n1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, so 150 million kilometers would be 150,000,000 km \u00d7 1,000 = 150,000,000,000 meters. That's 1.5 \u00d7 10^11 meters.\n\nNow, the distance to Altair is one million times greater than that. So, I need to multiply 1.5 \u00d7 10^11 meters by 1,000,000.\n\nWait, actually, one million is 10^6, right? So, multiplying 1.5 \u00d7 10^11 by 10^6 should give me 1.5 \u00d7 10^17 meters.\n\nLet me double-check that. When you multiply two exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So, 10^11 \u00d7 10^6 = 10^17. And 1.5 remains the same, so 1.5 \u00d7 10^17 meters.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 9.3 \u00d7 10^13 meters\n\nB. 9.3 \u00d7 10^10 meters\n\nC. 1.5 \u00d7 10^14 meters\n\nD. 1.5 \u00d7 10^17 meters\n\nSo, option D seems to match my calculation.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect this distance. For example, does the distance between stars vary significantly based on their positions in the galaxy? Probably, but in this problem, it's straightforward: Altair is one million times farther than the Sun.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the distance to Altair isn't actually one million times the Earth-Sun distance. Maybe that's just a hypothetical scenario, or perhaps it's an outdated figure. But since it's given in the problem, I should take it at face value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing my understanding of astronomical units and conversions. If that's the case, then I think I've handled the units correctly by converting kilometers to meters and performing the multiplication properly.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using light-years instead of meters. I know that one light-year is about 9.461 \u00d7 10^12 kilometers, or 9.461 \u00d7 10^15 meters. But again, the question specifies distances in meters, not light-years, so sticking with meters seems appropriate.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the distance to Altair is commonly expressed in light-years and see if that matches any of the options. But no, the problem states that the distance is one million times greater than the Earth-Sun distance, so I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the distance between the Earth and the Sun isn't exactly 150 million kilometers; maybe it's an average value. Actually, yes, the Earth's orbit is elliptical, so the distance varies, but for practical purposes, 150 million kilometers is a standard value used for the astronomical unit.\n\nGiven that, I think my approach is sound. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. 1.5 \u00d7 10^17 meters.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's look at the other options to see why they might be incorrect:\n\nA. 9.3 \u00d7 10^13 meters: This seems much smaller than my calculation. Maybe this is the distance to the Sun in meters, but that's not consistent with the standard value.\n\nB. 9.3 \u00d7 10^10 meters: This is even smaller, possibly the distance to the Sun in meters divided by 100 or something. Doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nC. 1.5 \u00d7 10^14 meters: This is ten times smaller than my calculation. Maybe a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nD. 1.5 \u00d7 10^17 meters: Matches my calculation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
