The options are advertising, exchange, sponsorship, and public relations. Hmm, I need to figure out which one fits this description.\n\nFirst, let's think about advertising. Advertising is when a company pays to promote their product or service directly to the public, right? Like TV commercials or billboards. But in this scenario, it's more about one party giving another party a chance to exploit an association with a target audience. That sounds a bit different from direct advertising. Maybe advertising isn't the best fit here.\n\nNext, exchange. An exchange is generally when two parties swap something of value, like goods or services. But in this case, it's not just a straightforward swap; it's about providing an opportunity to exploit an association with a target audience. That seems a bit more complex than a simple exchange. Maybe not exchange.\n\nThen there's sponsorship. Sponsorship often involves a company providing funds or resources to an event, organization, or individual in return for some form of promotion or association. For example, a sports team might have a sponsor's logo on their jerseys, and in return, the sponsor gets brand exposure to the team's fans. That sounds a lot like what's being described in the question: one party (the sponsor) gives funds or resources to another party (the event or organization) in return for access to their target audience.\n\nLastly, public relations (PR). PR is about managing the image and reputation of a company or individual in the public eye, often through media coverage and events. While PR can involve relationships with target audiences, it's not primarily about providing opportunities for exploitation of those audiences in exchange for funds or resources.\n\nSo, comparing all the options:\n\n- Advertising: Direct promotion to the public, not exactly matching the description.\n\n- Exchange: A straightforward swap, which doesn't capture the essence of providing opportunities for audience exploitation.\n\n- Sponsorship: Perfectly aligns with the description of providing opportunities to exploit an association with a target audience in exchange for funds or resources.\n\n- Public relations: Focuses on image and reputation management, not specifically on providing audience access for funds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Sponsorship.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any way that advertising could be interpreted as providing an opportunity to exploit an association with a target audience? Well, advertising does aim to reach a target audience, but it's the advertiser themselves who is reaching out, not necessarily through another party. In sponsorship, one party (the sponsor) uses another party's platform or association to reach the target audience. So, while advertising involves direct communication, sponsorship involves a mediated relationship through a third party.\n\nExchange seems too simplistic for the scenario described, and PR is more about managing perceptions and relationships rather than providing direct access to an audience in exchange for funds.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that sponsorship is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Sponsorship}} \\]"
