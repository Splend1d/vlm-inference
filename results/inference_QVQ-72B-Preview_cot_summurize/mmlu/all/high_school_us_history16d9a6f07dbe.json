Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing\u2026the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message.

                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about President Franklin D. Roosevelt's radio address on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan. The excerpt is from his famous speech where he declares that December 7, 1941, will \"live in infamy\" because of the surprise attack by Japan. The question is asking for the most immediate consequence of the events described in this excerpt.\n\nLet me first make sure I understand what's being asked. \"Immediate consequence\" probably means the direct and quickest result of the attack and the speech. So, I need to think about what happened right after this speech and the attack.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Trade embargoes with Japan extending up through the 1980s.\n\nHmm, trade embargoes sound like a response to the attack, but I thought that after World War II, relations between the U.S. and Japan gradually improved, especially during the Cold War when Japan became an ally of the U.S. I don't recall there being trade embargoes up through the 1980s. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nB. The Battle of Normandy.\n\nNormandy was a major D-Day invasion in World War II, but that was in June 1944, almost three years after the attack on Pearl Harbor. That seems too far away in time to be considered the most immediate consequence.\n\nC. The internment of Japanese-Americans.\n\nThis I've heard about. After Pearl Harbor, there was a lot of fear and suspicion towards Japanese-Americans living in the United States, especially on the West Coast. I think there was an executive order signed by President Roosevelt that led to the internment of many Japanese-Americans in camps during the war. This was a direct response to the attack and the fears of sabotage or espionage.\n\nD. The bombing of Nagasaki.\n\nNagasaki was bombed in August 1945, which was the second atomic bomb dropped on Japan during World War II. Again, that's almost four years after the attack on Pearl Harbor. While it's a significant event, it's not the most immediate consequence of the 1941 attack.\n\nGiven these options, C. The internment of Japanese-Americans seems to be the most immediate consequence of the events described in the excerpt. The internment started shortly after Pearl Harbor, as I recall, with Executive Order 9066 being signed in February 1942, which authorized the forced relocation and incarceration of Japanese-Americans.\n\nLet me double-check this. If the attack was on December 7, 1941, and the executive order was in February 1942, that's about two months later. Compared to the other options, which are years later, it seems like the internment was a much more immediate response.\n\nMoreover, the attack on Pearl Harbor fueled a lot of panic and prejudice against Japanese-Americans, leading to this drastic action by the government. It was a direct consequence of the events of December 7th and the ensuing fears of additional attacks or fifth-column activities.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. The internment of Japanese-Americans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
