                    "text": "So I have this problem here about electric forces between two particles, A and B. Particle A has a net charge of 2Q, and particle B has a net charge of Q. They're separated by a distance of 4 meters. The question is asking for the ratio of the electric force on A to that on B. The options are 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how electric forces between charged particles are calculated. I remember that Coulomb's law gives the magnitude of the electric force between two point charges. The formula is:\n\n\\[F = k \\cdot \\frac{|q_1| \\cdot |q_2|}{r^2}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(F\\) is the magnitude of the electric force,\n\n- \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant,\n\n- \\(|q_1|\\) and \\(|q_2|\\) are the magnitudes of the charges,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance between the centers of the charges.\n\nIn this problem, particle A has a charge of 2Q, and particle B has a charge of Q. The distance between them is 4 meters.\n\nSo, the force on A due to B would be:\n\n\\[F_A = k \\cdot \\frac{|2Q| \\cdot |Q|}{4^2} = k \\cdot \\frac{2Q \\cdot Q}{16} = k \\cdot \\frac{2Q^2}{16} = k \\cdot \\frac{Q^2}{8}\\]\n\nSimilarly, the force on B due to A would be:\n\n\\[F_B = k \\cdot \\frac{|Q| \\cdot |2Q|}{4^2} = k \\cdot \\frac{Q \\cdot 2Q}{16} = k \\cdot \\frac{2Q^2}{16} = k \\cdot \\frac{Q^2}{8}\\]\n\nSo, both forces are equal in magnitude, which makes sense because according to Newton's third law, forces come in equal and opposite pairs.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is 1:1.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nThe problem mentions that the particles are isolated, so there are no other charges around that could be affecting the forces. Also, the charges are static, so we don't have to consider any magnetic forces.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the force on A is due to B, and the force on B is due to A. Since the charges are fixed and there are no other charges, the forces should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nSo, the magnitude of both forces should be the same, which would make the ratio 1:1.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any scenario where this might not be the case. For example, if the charges were moving, there might be additional relativistic effects, but since they're isolated particles and presumably at rest, that shouldn't be an issue here.\n\nAlso, if the particles were not point charges, the distance between them might not be straightforward, but the problem states they're particles, so I assume they're point particles.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the sign of the charges. If both are positive or both are negative, the force is repulsive; if one is positive and one is negative, it's attractive. But since the problem doesn't specify the signs, and just uses |q1| and |q2| in Coulomb's law, it's safe to use the magnitudes.\n\nMoreover, the question is about the ratio of their magnitudes, so the direction shouldn't affect the ratio.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 1:1.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possible misinterpretation of the question.\n\nThe question says: \"The ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is\"\n\nSo, it's asking for FA : FB, where FA and FB are the magnitudes of the forces on A and B, respectively.\n\nAs calculated, both FA and FB are equal, so their ratio is 1:1.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a mistake in the calculation, perhaps if I had miscalculated the force.\n\nLet me recalculate FA and FB again.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Charge of A: 2Q\n\n- Charge of B: Q\n\n- Distance between them: 4 meters\n\nThen,\n\n\\[F_A = k \\cdot \\frac{|2Q| \\cdot |Q|}{4^2} = k \\cdot \\frac{2Q \\cdot Q}{16} = k \\cdot \\frac{2Q^2}{16} = k \\cdot \\frac{Q^2}{8}\\]\n\n\\[F_B = k \\cdot \\frac{|Q| \\cdot |2Q|}{4^2} = k \\cdot \\frac{Q \\cdot 2Q}{16} = k \\cdot \\frac{2Q^2}{16} = k \\cdot \\frac{Q^2}{8}\\]\n\nYes, both forces are equal.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 1:1.\n\nI think the answer is indeed C. 1:1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
