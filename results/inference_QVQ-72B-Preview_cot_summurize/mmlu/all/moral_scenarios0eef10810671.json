                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: When I checked out from the hotel, I turned in the dirty towels.\n\nScenario 2: I always kept my whiskey bottles out of reach of my 3-year-old son.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is checking out of a hotel and turning in dirty towels. Is there something morally wrong with that? Well, typically, when you stay at a hotel, you use towels, and when you're done, you leave them behind for cleaning staff to handle. Turning in dirty towels seems like the responsible thing to do, right? It's not like you're supposed to take them home or anything. So, I don't see anything morally wrong with that.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Keeping whiskey bottles out of reach of a 3-year-old son. That sounds like a responsible parental action. Children, especially young ones like a 3-year-old, shouldn't have access to alcoholic beverages. It's dangerous and can be harmful. So, keeping them out of reach is actually a good thing, from a safety and parental responsibility perspective.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are not morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. But let me double-check. Maybe there's some context I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, maybe if the person damaged the towels intentionally or something, but the scenario just says they turned in dirty towels, which is normal. Dirty towels are expected in hotels; that's why they provide fresh ones and clean the room after guests check out.\n\nIn Scenario 2, keeping hazardous items out of a child's reach is generally considered good practice. It's part of childproofing your home, ensuring that kids don't accidentally harm themselves by accessing things they shouldn't.\n\nSo, both actions seem morally acceptable and responsible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to trick me by presenting scenarios that seem innocent but have some underlying moral issue. But I don't see it here. Turning in dirty towels is just part of standard hotel procedure, and keeping alcohol out of a child's reach is a safety measure.\n\nLet me consider if there's any cultural or legal aspect that might make these actions morally questionable. In the US, hotels expect guests to handle linens appropriately, and there are regulations about child safety and hazardous substances.\n\nPerhaps the key is understanding what \"morally wrong\" means in this context. Morality can be subjective, but in general terms, it involves distinguishing between right and wrong based on societal norms and ethical principles.\n\nIn Scenario 1, turning in dirty towels doesn't harm anyone or go against ethical principles. It's a routine action that helps maintain hygiene and order.\n\nIn Scenario 2, keeping alcohol out of a child's reach prevents potential harm and aligns with parental duties and child safety guidelines.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any interpretation where one of these scenarios could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps if the person was staying in the hotel for an extended period and not replacing the towels regularly could be seen as inconsiderate, but even then, it's more of a hygiene or housekeeping issue rather than a moral one.\n\nFor Scenario 2, maybe if the parent was hiding the alcohol because they didn't want to share it with the child, which seems like a no-brainer\u2014of course, you don't give alcohol to a child. But that's not what's being said here. It's about keeping it out of reach, which is a preventive measure.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The scenarios are straightforward, and both actions are morally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
