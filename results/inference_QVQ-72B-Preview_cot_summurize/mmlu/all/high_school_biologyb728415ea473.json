                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about an African butterfly species that exists in two strikingly different color patterns. The options are artificial selection, directional selection, stabilizing selection, and disruptive selection. I need to pick which one best describes this scenario.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each type of selection means.\n\nArtificial selection is when humans breed plants or animals for specific traits. Like, breeding dogs for different characteristics or selecting crops that grow better in certain conditions. But in this case, we're talking about a wild African butterfly species, so artificial selection doesn't seem to apply because it's not being influenced by human breeding practices.\n\nDirectional selection is when there's a continuous change in a trait over time, usually in response to environmental pressures. For example, if predators are more likely to eat lighter-colored butterflies, then over time, darker butterflies might be favored because they blend in better with the environment. But here, it says there are two strikingly different color patterns, not a continuous range of colors moving in one direction.\n\nStabilizing selection occurs when the intermediate traits are favored, and extremes are selected against. So, if most butterflies have a certain color, and variations away from that color are disadvantaged, maybe because they're more visible to predators, then stabilizing selection would maintain that color. Again, this doesn't match the description of two distinct color patterns.\n\nDisruptive selection is when extreme traits are favored over the intermediate ones. This can lead to the population splitting into two distinct forms. This seems the closest to the scenario described, where there are two strikingly different color patterns in the butterfly species.\n\nLet me think about this more. If there are two distinct color patterns, it suggests that there might be two peaks of fitness, one for each color pattern, and perhaps a disadvantage for butterflies that have intermediate colors. This would be consistent with disruptive selection, where selection favors individuals at both ends of the spectrum.\n\nMaybe there are environmental factors that benefit each color pattern. For instance, one color might provide better camouflage in one type of habitat, and the other color provides better camouflage in a different type of habitat. Butterflies with intermediate colors might not fit well into either environment, making them more vulnerable to predators.\n\nSo, in this case, disruptive selection would be favoring the two distinct color patterns, leading to the existence of two strikingly different forms within the species.\n\nI don't think it's artificial selection because there's no human involvement. Directional selection would involve a shift towards one color pattern, not two. Stabilizing selection would keep the color within a certain range, reducing variation towards the extremes.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is disruptive selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. disruptive selection}} \\]"
