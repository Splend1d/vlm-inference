                    "text": "So I've got this question here about perception, and it's related to Michelle watching David Letterman on TV but not recognizing him when she walks past him in Manhattan. The options are A. convergence, B. context, C. proximity, and D. closure. I need to figure out which one best illustrates the effect happening here.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means in the context of perception.\n\nStarting with convergence: I think convergence in vision refers to the ability of the eyes to turn inward when looking at close objects. Like when you're reading a book, your eyes cross a bit to focus on the text. So, that seems more about how the eyes work together to focus on nearby objects. Not sure if that directly relates to recognizing someone on TV versus in person.\n\nNext, context: This sounds like it has to do with the surroundings or the environment in which perception occurs. Maybe how the setting influences our interpretation of what we see. So, seeing David Letterman on TV is one context, and seeing him on the streets of Manhattan is another.\n\nProximity: This might refer to how close or far away something is. Maybe it's about depth perception or judging distances. But in this case, it's about recognizing someone on TV versus in person, which might not be directly related to proximity in that sense.\n\nClosure: This term is often used in gestalt psychology, where we tend to fill in missing parts of a picture or pattern to make it complete. Like when you see a circle with a slice missing, you still perceive it as a whole circle. Doesn't seem directly related to recognizing a person in different settings.\n\nGiven that, maybe context is the most fitting answer here. Because on TV, David Letterman is presented in a specific setting\u2014the late-night show studio\u2014with certain lighting, attire, and so on. Whereas in Manhattan, he's just another person on the street, possibly dressed casually, without the same backdrop that makes him recognizable from TV.\n\nAdditionally, on TV, he's in a controlled environment where his appearance is consistent with what viewers expect. In real life, variables like lighting, attire, and even his hairstyle could be different, which might make it harder to recognize him.\n\nSo, the context in which he's seen changes how Michelle perceives him. On TV, he's in his usual setting as the host, making him easily recognizable. On the street, without those contextual cues, he blends in more with the environment, and his identity isn't as immediately clear.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
