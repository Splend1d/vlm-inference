                    "text": "So I have this question here about the external marketing environment. It's asking which of the following is not considered one of the six dimensions that usually make up this environment. The options are:\n\nA. Political considerations.\n\nB. Global factors.\n\nC. Socio-cultural aspects.\n\nD. Economics issues.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what the six dimensions of the external marketing environment are. I think I learned about this in my marketing class. Let me see...\n\nI remember that the external marketing environment is often analyzed using something called PESTEL analysis, which looks at Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors. That's six dimensions right there: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Political considerations.\n\nB. Global factors.\n\nC. Socio-cultural aspects.\n\nD. Economics issues.\n\nI can see that Political considerations would correspond to the Political factor in PESTEL.\n\nEconomics issues would relate to the Economic factor.\n\nSocio-cultural aspects would align with the Social factor.\n\nBut Global factors isn't one of the PESTEL categories. Wait, maybe it's subsumed under one of the other categories.\n\nLet me think about what Global factors entail. Global factors could include things like international trade, global economic trends, cultural diversity, technological advancements, environmental concerns, and legal regulations across different countries.\n\nHmm, many of these seem to overlap with the PESTEL factors. For example, global economic trends would be part of the Economic factor, cultural diversity relates to the Social factor, technological advancements are part of the Technological factor, and so on.\n\nBut is Global factors considered a separate dimension in its own right? I don't think so. I believe that global aspects are considered within each of the PESTEL categories rather than being a separate dimension.\n\nFor instance, when analyzing the Political environment, we consider both domestic and international political influences. Similarly, Economic analysis includes both local and global economic conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps Global factors aren't a distinct dimension but are instead integrated into each of the PESTEL factors.\n\nLet me check a reliable source to confirm this. I recall that the PESTEL analysis is a framework used to analyze these external factors that can affect a business's operations and decisions.\n\nIf I look up PESTEL analysis, I find that the six dimensions are:\n\n1. Political factors (e.g., government policy, political stability)\n\n2. Economic factors (e.g., economic growth, interest rates, exchange rates)\n\n3. Social factors (also known as Socio-cultural factors, e.g., demographics, cultural trends)\n\n4. Technological factors (e.g., innovations, automation)\n\n5. Environmental factors (e.g., climate change, sustainability)\n\n6. Legal factors (e.g., laws, regulations)\n\nNow, none of these explicitly mention Global factors as a separate dimension. Instead, global aspects are likely considered within each of these categories.\n\nFor example, exchange rates and trade agreements would be part of the Economic factor, while international environmental agreements would be part of the Environmental factor.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Global factors aren't a distinct dimension of the external marketing environment but are instead aspects that are incorporated into the existing PESTEL categories.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the answer to the question should be B. Global factors.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\nThe question says, \"The six dimensions usually considered to constitute the external marketing environment include all of the following except:\n\nA. Political considerations.\n\nB. Global factors.\n\nC. Socio-cultural aspects.\n\nD. Economics issues.\"\n\nGiven that PESTEL analysis includes Political, Economic, Social (which can include cultural aspects), Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors, it's clear that Global factors aren't part of this standard framework.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Global factors are considered under the Environmental factor, but that seems unlikely since Environmental typically refers to natural environment and sustainability issues.\n\nWait, maybe in some frameworks, Global factors are considered under the Economic factor, given that economics is increasingly globalized.\n\nBut even then, it's not a separate dimension in the standard PESTEL analysis.\n\nAnother possibility is that Global factors are seen as influencing all of the PESTEL factors, but again, that doesn't make them a separate dimension.\n\nTherefore, I think it's safe to conclude that Global factors aren't one of the six dimensions of the external marketing environment.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Global factors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
