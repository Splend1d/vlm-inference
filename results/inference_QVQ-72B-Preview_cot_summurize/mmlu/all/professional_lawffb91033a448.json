                    "text": "Alright, I've got this problem here about property conveyances and Remainder Interests. Let me try to wrap my head around it. So, the homeowner conveyed his property to his cousin \"for life, with remainder to (the homeowner's) heirs.\" Then, the cousin conveyed the property to a farmer \"for as long as he would continue to farm the property.\" After the cousin's death, the homeowner's heirs are suing the farmer to quiet title. I need to figure out which common law doctrine would be most applicable in determining who owns the property now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial conveyance. The homeowner gave the property to his cousin for life, and after that, to the homeowner's heirs. So, the cousin has a life estate, and the homeowner's heirs have a remainder interest. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut then, the cousin conveys the property to a farmer \"for as long as he would continue to farm the property.\" This sounds like a fee simple determinable because it's for as long as a certain condition is met\u2014farming the property. If the farmer stops farming, the estate would revert to the grantor, which in this case would be the cousin or his heirs.\n\nWait a minute, the cousin has a life estate, and he's conveying something to the farmer. But he can't convey more than his life estate, right? So, maybe the conveyance to the farmer is limited to the cousin's life estate.\n\nNow, the cousin dies, and the homeowner's heirs want to assert their remainder interest against the farmer. The question is, does the farmer still have rights to the property, or do the heirs get it now?\n\nI need to consider the different doctrines mentioned:\n\nA. Rule in Wild's Case.\n\nI'm not super familiar with this, but I think it relates to the destruction of a future interest when the estate preceding it is destroyed. Maybe not directly applicable here.\n\nB. Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders.\n\nThis might be about whether a remainder interest can be destroyed under certain circumstances. Perhaps relevant.\n\nC. Doctrine of Worthier Title.\n\nThis doctrine generally favors the grantor's estate over the grantee's heirs when there's ambiguity in the conveyance. Not sure if that fits here.\n\nD. Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs.\n\nThis might be about restrictions on creating remainders in the heirs of the grantee. Could be relevant.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of events:\n\n1. Homeowner conveys to cousin for life, with remainder to homeowner's heirs.\n\n2. Cousin conveys to farmer \"for as long as he would continue to farm the property.\"\n\n3. Cousin dies.\n\nNow, the farmer is in possession, but the homeowner's heirs claim they should own the property because the cousin's life estate has terminated upon his death, and their remainder interest should now vest.\n\nBut the farmer might argue that his interest continues as long as he farms the property, regardless of the cousin's death.\n\nI need to see how these doctrines apply.\n\nFirst, consider the cousin's conveyance to the farmer. Since the cousin had only a life estate, his conveyance to the farmer is likely a life estate as well, with a condition that the farmer farms the property.\n\nWhen the cousin died, his life estate terminated, but the farmer might still have rights based on the condition he's farming.\n\nHowever, since the cousin's life estate was the only estate before the remainder to the homeowner's heirs, and the cousin has died, the remainder should vest in the heirs.\n\nBut the farmer's interest complicates things. If the farmer is still farming, does his interest continue?\n\nI think the key here is that the cousin could not convey more than his life estate, so the farmer only has rights during the cousin's life, subject to the condition of farming.\n\nSince the cousin has died, the life estate has terminated, and the farmer's interest, which was dependent on the life estate, also terminates.\n\nTherefore, the remainder interest in the homeowner's heirs should now vest.\n\nBut the farmer might argue that his interest is separate and continues as long as he farms.\n\nThis is where the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders comes in. Perhaps the remainder to the homeowner's heirs was contingent on the cousin's life estate terminating, and the farmer's interest was a competing interest.\n\nWait, maybe not. I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule against remainders in the grantees' heirs applies here. That doctrine generally prevents a grantor from creating a remainder in the grantees' heirs, perhaps on the grounds that it's too remote or uncertain.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner created a remainder in his own heirs, which seems permissible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the farmer's interest is a determinable fee, which would terminate upon violation of the condition but would otherwise continue forever.\n\nBut the cousin only had a life estate, so he couldn't convey a fee simple determinable; he could only convey a life estate with conditions.\n\nSo, the farmer likely has a life estate with conditions, and upon the cousin's death, the life estate terminated, ending the farmer's interest as well.\n\nTherefore, the remainder interest in the homeowner's heirs should now vest.\n\nI think the most applicable doctrine here is the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders, which might deal with situations where a remainder interest can be destroyed by intervening events, like the creation of another interest by the life tenant.\n\nSo, answer B seems the most relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the doctrine of worthier title might apply if there's a conflict between the grantor's and grantee's interests, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nThe rule in Wild's Case seems less relevant, as it pertains to the destruction of future interests in certain circumstances, perhaps not directly applicable to this scenario.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders is the most applicable doctrine in determining the ownership of the property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
