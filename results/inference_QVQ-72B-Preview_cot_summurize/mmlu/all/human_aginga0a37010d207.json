Tao.\" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which religion traditionally buries or disposes of their deceased before sunset on the day of death.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall or research the burial practices of each religion listed. Let's start with Islam. I know that in Islam, it's customary to bury the deceased as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours of death. But does it have to be before sundown on the same day? I think the sooner the better in Islam, but maybe not necessarily before sundown.\n\nNext, Hinduism. Hindus typically cremate their deceased, and I believe they try to do it as soon as possible after death, often within a day. Again, is there a specific timeline like before sundown?\n\nJewish tradition comes to mind next. I recall that Jews bury their dead as soon as possible, preferably on the same day as death. In fact, I think it's a custom to bury the deceased before sunset on the day of death. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nTaoism is the last option. I'm less familiar with Taoist burial practices. I know that Taoism is a philosophical and religious tradition from China, and their practices might vary depending on the region and culture. Some practices might involve burial or cremation, but I'm not sure about the specific timing.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about very rapid disposal, specifically before sundown on the day of death. So, which of these religions emphasizes burial or cremation before sunset on the day of death?\n\nIslam: While they bury soon, maybe not necessarily before sundown.\n\nHinduism: Cremation is typical, and it's usually done soon, but again, not sure about the exact timing.\n\nJewish: I have a stronger recollection that in Judaism, the burial should take place on the same day as death, preferably before sunset. This seems to align closely with the question's description.\n\nTaoism: Not sure, but I think practices can vary widely, and I don't recall a specific emphasis on burial before sundown.\n\nGiven this information, I'm leaning towards Judaism as the answer. But to be thorough, I should double-check.\n\nLet me consider some key principles of each religion regarding death and burial.\n\nIn Islam, the burial is simple and swift, with the body washed, shrouded, and buried facing Mecca. The goal is to bury the deceased as soon as possible, but I don't think it's strictly before sundown.\n\nIn Hinduism, cremation is the norm, and it's usually performed within 24 hours of death. However, the exact timing might not be before sundown on the same day.\n\nIn Judaism, burial is preferred over cremation, and it should take place on the day of death or as soon as possible thereafter. The tradition is to bury before sunset on the day of death, which matches the question's description.\n\nIn Taoism, burial practices can vary, and while respect for ancestors is important, specific burial timing might not be as strictly defined as in Judaism.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I believe the correct answer is C. Jewish.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Jewish}} \\]"
