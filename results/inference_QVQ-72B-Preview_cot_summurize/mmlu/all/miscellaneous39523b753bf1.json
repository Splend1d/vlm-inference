                    "text": "So I have this question about plate tectonics, specifically about stress types at divergent boundaries. The options are compressional, left-lateral shear, right-lateral shear, and tensional stress. I need to figure out which one dominates at divergent boundaries.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what a divergent boundary is. From my geology class, I remember that divergent boundaries are places where tectonic plates are moving apart from each other. This movement causes the Earth's crust to stretch and thin out. Now, thinking about the types of stress:\n\nA. Compressional stress is when forces are squeezing or pressing together the crust, kind of like squeezing a sponge. This should lead to folding and thrust faulting, and it's typically associated with convergent boundaries where plates are colliding.\n\nB. Left-lateral shear stress involves horizontal movement where one block of rock moves to the left relative to another across a fault. This seems more related to transform boundaries, where plates slide past each other without creating or destroying much crust.\n\nC. Right-lateral shear stress is similar to left-lateral but with movement to the right. Again, this is about horizontal sliding, which isn't the main activity at divergent boundaries.\n\nD. Tensional stress is when forces are pulling the crust apart, causing it to stretch and thin. This sounds a lot like what happens at divergent boundaries.\n\nSo, if plates are moving away from each other at divergent boundaries, the dominant stress should be tensional, right? Let me double-check this.\n\nI think of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is a classic example of a divergent boundary. Here, the Eurasian and North American plates are moving apart, and new oceanic crust is being formed through volcanic activity as magma rises to fill the gap created by the separating plates.\n\nThis process of plate separation and stretching definitely seems like tensional stress in action. Compressional stress would be the opposite, pushing plates together, which isn't what's happening here.\n\nShear stresses, both left-lateral and right-lateral, involve lateral sliding along faults, which are more characteristic of transform boundaries, like the San Andreas Fault in California.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Tensional.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Could there be some shear stress involved at divergent boundaries as well? For example, as plates move apart, there might be some sideways movement too, especially if the plates aren't moving directly away from each other in a perfectly straight line.\n\nBut, in general terms, the primary stress at divergent boundaries is tensional because the plates are being pulled apart. Shear stresses might be secondary effects due to the geometry of the plate boundaries or the direction of plate movement.\n\nSo, for the purpose of this question, I think D. Tensional is the best answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options again:\n\nA. Compressional: This is incorrect because compressional stress occurs where plates are being pushed together, not pulled apart.\n\nB. Left-lateral shear: This involves lateral sliding to the left, which is more associated with transform boundaries.\n\nC. Right-lateral shear: Similar to left-lateral, but with rightward sliding, again related to transform boundaries.\n\nD. Tensional: Matches the description of stress at divergent boundaries.\n\nYes, I'm confident that tensional stress is the dominant type at divergent boundaries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
