                    "text": "So I have this question here about the formation of the solar system. It says that astronomers propose the solar system formed from a vast rotating cloud of gas and dust, and it asks what this explanation is known as. The options are:\n\nA. Kepler's laws\n\nB. Big bang theory\n\nC. Cosmic string theory\n\nD. Nebular hypothesis\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to recall which of these theories or hypotheses relates to the formation of the solar system from a rotating cloud of gas and dust.\n\nFirst, let's consider Kepler's laws. I remember that Kepler's laws are about the motion of planets around the sun. Specifically, they describe the elliptical orbits of planets, the way they speed up and slow down in their orbits, and the relationship between their orbital periods and distances from the sun. So, this seems more about the movement and behavior of planets once the solar system is formed, not about how the solar system formed in the first place. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nNext, the Big Bang theory. I know that the Big Bang theory is the prevailing explanation for the origin of the universe. It suggests that the universe began as a single, extremely dense and hot point and has been expanding ever since. While this is a fundamental theory in cosmology, it doesn't directly address the formation of our solar system. The solar system is a part of the Milky Way galaxy, which formed after the Big Bang, but the Big Bang theory doesn't go into the specifics of how solar systems form. So, this is likely not the correct choice either.\n\nNow, cosmic string theory. I'm a bit fuzzier on this one. I think cosmic strings are hypothesized defects in spacetime that might have formed during phase transitions in the early universe. They're kind of like one-dimensional filaments that could potentially influence the structure of the universe on large scales. However, this doesn't seem directly related to the formation of our solar system from a rotating cloud of gas and dust. It feels more connected to the large-scale structure of the universe rather than the formation of planetary systems. So, probably not the answer here.\n\nLastly, the nebular hypothesis. This sounds familiar in the context of solar system formation. I recall that the nebular hypothesis proposes that the solar system formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust, which is sometimes called a solar nebula. As this nebula rotated, it flattened into a disk, and densities increased, leading to the formation of the sun in the center and the planets orbiting around it from the remaining material. This seems to match exactly with the description given in the question: a vast rotating cloud of gas and dust forming the solar system.\n\nTo make sure, let me just double-check each option:\n\nA. Kepler's laws: Relate to planetary motion, not formation.\n\nB. Big bang theory: Explains the origin of the universe, not the formation of the solar system.\n\nC. Cosmic string theory: Deals with defects in spacetime, not solar system formation.\n\nD. Nebular hypothesis: Proposes that the solar system formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust.\n\nYes, the nebular hypothesis is the one that fits the description provided in the question.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Nebular hypothesis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
