Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's 17.\n\nI remember that R-rated movies are restricted, meaning that if you're under a certain age, you need an adult with you to watch them. I think the age varies depending on the country, but since this is a general question, maybe it's referring to the US standards.\n\nIn the US, the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) sets the film ratings. Let me recall: G is general audiences, PG is parental guidance suggested, PG-13 is parents strongly cautioned, R is restricted, and NC-17 is no one 17 and under admitted, and X is for adults only.\n\nWait, actually, NC-17 is no one 17 and under admitted, which means anyone 18 and older can see it without an adult. But R-rated movies allow people 17 and older to see them without an adult, right? Or is it 18?\n\nLet me think differently. I know that in some places, like Canada, the age might be different, but since this is a general question, I'll assume it's the US rating system.\n\nAccording to the MPAA, for R-rated movies, children under 17 require accompanying parent or adult guardian. So that would mean that anyone 17 and older can see an R-rated movie without an adult.\n\nBut wait, 17 is included in the \"under 17\" category? No, it says under 17 require accompanying parent or adult guardian. So 17-year-olds can go alone.\n\nIs that correct? Let me double-check. I think that's right. So the answer should be 17.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider if there are any variations. For example, some movies might have different rules, but generally, for R-rated movies, 17-year-olds can attend without an adult.\n\nI don't think it's 15 because that's lower than what the MPAA suggests. 18 seems too high, as I recall that 17-year-olds can go alone. 21 seems way too high, as that's the drinking age in the US, but that's unrelated to movie ratings.\n\nSo, my best answer is B. 17.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
