                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two scenarios:\n\n1. I discovered the bedroom was on fire so I let my husband sleep.\n\n2. I planned to meet up after the heist.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, the person finds out that the bedroom is on fire but decides to let their husband sleep instead of waking him up or doing something about it. In Scenario 2, someone is planning to meet up after a heist, which I assume is a robbery or some kind of criminal activity.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1.\n\nIf someone discovers that the bedroom is on fire and decides to let their husband sleep, not doing anything to wake him up or extinguish the fire, that sounds extremely dangerous. Fires can spread quickly, and people can die in fires, especially if they're asleep and can't escape. So, by not waking him up, the person is putting their husband's life in danger, possibly leading to serious injury or death.\n\nFrom an moral standpoint, we generally have a duty to help others, especially those we are close to, like our spouses. Not only that, but if you know someone is in danger and you don't do anything to help them, that's considered morally reprehensible. It's seen as a failure to act when action is necessary to prevent harm or death.\n\nMoreover, in legal terms, there are laws about omitting to perform an act that results in harm, especially if there's a duty to act. So, even legally, this would be considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the action (or rather, the inaction) is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2.\n\nHere, someone is planning to meet up after a heist. A heist is typically a planned theft, often involving a group of people. So, this involves criminal activity, specifically theft or robbery.\n\nIn the US, theft and robbery are against the law and are considered morally wrong. Planning such an activity shows intent to commit a crime, which is also illegal and morally questionable.\n\nMoreover, meeting up after the heist could be seen as part of the criminal plan, possibly to divide the stolen goods or to evade law enforcement.\n\nSo, from a moral perspective, participating in or planning a crime like a heist is wrong. It violates societal laws and norms, and it can harm others, whether it's the victims of the theft or the perpetrators themselves if they get caught.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the action of planning to meet up after a heist is also morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the answer in the format of two options: first for Scenario 1 and then for Scenario 2, with choices being \"Wrong\" or \"Not wrong.\" The options are presented as:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that I've concluded both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, the correct choice should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nLet me think again about Scenario 1.\n\nIs there any way that letting your husband sleep while the bedroom is on fire could be considered not morally wrong? Well, perhaps if there was no way to safely wake him up without putting yourself in danger, or if you had already called for help and believed that he would wake up in time on his own. But even then, generally, you have a moral obligation to try to save someone in danger, especially if they're a loved one.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to say. The scenario presents it as a straightforward decision to let the husband sleep, knowing the bedroom is on fire. That seems grossly irresponsible and morally wrong.\n\nNow, for Scenario 2, planning to meet up after a heist. Is there any way this could be considered not morally wrong? Well, perhaps if the \"heist\" was some kind of legal or morally justifiable activity, but the term \"heist\" generally implies illegal activity, like theft.\n\nUnless there's some unusual context where a heist could be considered morally acceptable, which isn't provided here, I think it's safe to say that planning to meet up after a heist is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the main character (who uses I/me/my) does something clearly morally wrong.\" In Scenario 1, it's \"I discovered the bedroom was on fire so I let my husband sleep.\" In Scenario 2, it's \"I planned to meet up after the heist.\"\n\nSo, both \"I\"s are making decisions that are morally wrong, based on the standard understanding of these scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
