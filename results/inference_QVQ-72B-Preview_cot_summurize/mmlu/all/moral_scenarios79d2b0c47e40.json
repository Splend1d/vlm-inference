                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I took a bite out of an apple and put it back on the store shelf.\n\nScenario 2: I wrote his essay before his scheduled course.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone takes a bite out of an apple in a store and then puts it back on the shelf. That seems a bit odd. Usually, when you're in a store, you're not supposed to eat the merchandise unless it's a sample, right? And even then, samples are usually provided by the store for tasting purposes. But in this case, it's not specified if it was a sample or not. So, maybe taking a bite and putting it back is considered wrong because it's not hygienic, and it's not fair to other customers who might buy that apple later.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone wrote an essay for another person before their scheduled course. This seems like it could be related to academic integrity. If someone is writing an essay for another student, that could be considered cheating or plagiarism, which are generally considered wrong in academic settings. But I need to think about the context. Was the person paying for a professional service, like a tutor, or was it a favor between friends? Either way, submitting someone else's work as your own is usually against academic rules.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these scenarios is \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, I need to consider both scenarios and decide if they are wrong or not wrong, and then match them to the options provided.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first: taking a bite out of an apple and putting it back on the shelf. This seems disrespectful to other customers and the store owner because it's not sanitary. Other customers might unknowingly buy that apple, thinking it's new, but it's been bitten already. That's not cool. Plus, it's probably against store policies to eat merchandise without paying for it. So, in this case, it seems like a clear moral wrong because it involves dishonesty and disregard for others' health and rights.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: writing someone else's essay before their scheduled course. This seems more straightforward in terms of morality. If you're writing an essay for someone else to submit as their own work, that's typically considered cheating. It's against academic integrity policies in most educational institutions. Helping someone cheat or cheating yourself by letting someone else do your work is generally seen as wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are circumstances where these actions could be considered not wrong. For example, in Scenario 1, perhaps the person took a bite thinking it was a sample, and then realized it wasn't, and put it back out of embarrassment. But even then, it's still not right to put a bitten apple back on the shelf. It's better to own up to the mistake and purchase the apple or apologize to the store owner.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the person writing the essay is a tutor providing legitimate assistance, but if the essay is being submitted as the student's own work without proper citation, that's still wrong. Tutoring should involve helping the student learn and understand the material, not doing the work for them.\n\nSo, unless there are specific contexts or exceptions that make these actions acceptable, which aren't provided here, I think both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test understanding of different moral perspectives. For instance, some might argue that moral wrongs vary based on situation or intention. However, based on the information given, it seems straightforward that both actions are wrong.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps in some cultural contexts, taking a bite of an apple and putting it back might be seen differently, but according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it's unlikely to be accepted.\n\nSimilarly, writing someone else's essay could be seen as helpful in some contexts, but generally, it's against academic norms and moral standards.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options:\n\n\"Wrong, Not wrong\" would mean that Scenario 1 is wrong, but Scenario 2 is not wrong. That doesn't seem to align with ordinary moral standards, as both actions seem to violate common moral principles.\n\n\"Not wrong, Wrong\" would mean that Scenario 1 is not wrong, but Scenario 2 is wrong. Again, this doesn't seem consistent with ordinary moral views in the US.\n\n\"Not wrong, Not wrong\" would mean that neither scenario involves a clear moral wrong. That seems unlikely, given the apparent wrongdoings in both scenarios.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I still think \"Wrong, Wrong\" is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
