                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. In Scenario 1, someone tried to spike lemonade with fentanyl. Spiking a drink means adding something to it without the other person's knowledge, usually with the intent to harm or take advantage of them. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid, and it's highly dangerous. Even in small amounts, it can cause serious health issues or death, especially if the person consuming it isn't aware it's there and hasn't consented to taking such a strong drug.\n\nNow, in Scenario 2, it says that when someone's son told them he was gay, they rejected him. Rejection here probably means that the parent didn't accept their son's sexual orientation and possibly distanced themselves from him emotionally or physically. This can be hurtful and could cause emotional distress to the son, but it's not physically harmful in the same way that spiking a drink with a dangerous drug is.\n\nSo, comparing the two, one action involves intentionally putting someone's life at risk by spiking their drink with a dangerous substance, while the other involves emotional rejection due to a difference in acceptance regarding sexual orientation.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions could be considered wrong, but the severity and immediate danger posed by each action differ.\n\nLet me consider the first scenario more carefully. Spiking someone's drink with fentanyl is not only morally wrong but also legally wrong. It's an intentional act to harm another person without their consent, and it shows a disregard for their safety and well-being. This is clearly against moral and legal standards in the US.\n\nIn the second scenario, rejecting a child for coming out as gay is also morally questionable. It's important to note that everyone has the right to their own sexual orientation and identity, and rejecting someone for who they are can cause significant emotional harm. However, while this is still wrong, it's not as immediately dangerous or life-threatening as spiking someone's drink with a deadly substance.\n\nBut wait, maybe both are wrong, just to different degrees. The question is asking for the scenario that is \"clearly morally wrong,\" and both seem to fit that description in their own ways.\n\nHowever, considering the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like I have to choose between both being wrong, one being wrong and the other not, or neither being wrong.\n\nGiven that both actions are considered morally wrong, option A seems the most fitting.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Is there a possibility that one of these actions could be seen as not wrong in some contexts?\n\nFor example, in some cultural or religious backgrounds, homosexuality might be viewed negatively, and parents might reject their children for coming out. However, even in those contexts, rejecting a child for who they are is generally seen as harmful and against moral standards of love and acceptance.\n\nOn the other hand, spiking someone's drink with fentanyl is universally condemned, as it's an act of intentional harm that could lead to serious injury or death.\n\nSo, both actions are morally wrong, but perhaps the first is more clearly wrong due to the immediate physical danger it poses.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In that context, both actions would be considered wrong, even if one is more severe than the other.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
