                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about sources of obligations, according to someone named Cohen. The options are rights, freely made commitments, special relations, or all of the above. I need to pick which one is a possible source of obligations according to Cohen.\n\nFirst off, I'm not entirely sure who Cohen is. Maybe he's a philosopher or a legal theorist? I think obligations are like duties or responsibilities that we have towards others or to certain actions. So, I need to think about where these obligations come from, based on what Cohen might be arguing.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Rights: If someone has a right, does that impose an obligation on someone else? For example, if I have a right to free speech, does that mean others have an obligation not to interfere with my speech? That makes sense. So, rights can generate obligations in others to respect those rights.\n\nB. Freely made commitments: This sounds like promises or agreements that people enter into voluntarily. If I promise to do something, like repay a loan or show up somewhere, that creates an obligation on my part to fulfill that promise. So, freely made commitments seem like another source of obligations.\n\nC. Special relations: This could refer to relationships where there's a closer connection or dependency, like parent-child, doctor-patient, or teacher-student. In these relationships, there might be specific obligations that arise because of the nature of the relationship. For example, parents have obligations to care for their children, and doctors have obligations to provide care to their patients.\n\nD. All of the above: This would mean that all three\u2014rights, freely made commitments, and special relations\u2014are sources of obligations.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether Cohen would consider all three as sources of obligations. Since I don't know much about Cohen's specific views, maybe I should consider if there's a common understanding or a standard theory that includes these as sources of obligations.\n\nIn moral philosophy, there are various theories about the sources of obligations. Some philosophers argue that obligations arise from social contracts or agreements, while others might say they come from divine command, or from the consequences of actions, or from the character of the moral agent.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Cohen is referring to a particular theory or is proposing his own view. If I had to guess, I'd say that in many philosophical discussions, rights, freely made commitments, and special relations are all considered sources of obligations.\n\nFor instance, in legal terms, contracts (freely made commitments) create legal obligations. In ethics, particular relationships can generate specific duties, like the duty to help family members or to act with professionalism towards clients.\n\nSimilarly, rights are often correlated with duties; if someone has a right, it typically implies that someone else has a corresponding duty or obligation.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that all three\u2014rights, freely made commitments, and special relations\u2014can be sources of obligations.\n\nBut wait, maybe Cohen has a different view. Perhaps he argues that only some of these are sources of obligations, or maybe he prioritizes one over the others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in his theory, obligations only arise from certain sources, and not all of the above.\n\nBut the question says \"a possible source,\" and it's multiple choice, so perhaps the answer is D, all of the above, because each can be a source in different contexts.\n\nAnother thought: maybe Cohen is discussing these options in a specific context, like moral obligations versus legal obligations. Depending on the context, different sources might apply.\n\nFor example, legal obligations might arise from freely made commitments (contracts), while moral obligations might arise from special relations or rights.\n\nBut again, without knowing Cohen's specific arguments, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nMaybe I should look up Cohen to see who he is and what his views are. But since this is a hypothetical scenario, I'll have to rely on my own knowledge.\n\nAssuming that Cohen is a philosopher who has written about obligations, and considering the options provided, I think the best answer is D, all of the above.\n\nThis is because each of these\u2014rights, freely made commitments, and special relations\u2014can give rise to obligations in different scenarios.\n\nRights can impose duties on others not to interfere or to act in certain ways.\n\nFreely made commitments, like promises, can create personal obligations to fulfill those promises.\n\nSpecial relations can generate obligations based on the nature of the relationship, such as duties of care or loyalty.\n\nTherefore, all three are possible sources of obligations according to Cohen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
