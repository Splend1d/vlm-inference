                    "text": "So I need to figure out what percentage of adults aged 18 years or older were obese in 2016. The options are 6%, 13%, 27%, and 46%. Hmm, that seems like a pretty important health statistic. I think I've heard something about obesity rates before, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFirst, I should probably look up some reliable sources to find the exact percentage. Maybe I can check official health organization websites or recent studies from that year. Since it's 2016, data from that time should be available.\n\nLet me recall if there are any prominent reports or articles about obesity rates in 2016. I think the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States often release statistics on this topic. Maybe I can start there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about trends over the years. I remember that obesity rates have been increasing over time in many countries, especially in more developed nations. So, if I can recall data from earlier years, I might be able to estimate what it was in 2016.\n\nLet me try to recall some numbers. I think in the early 2000s, the global obesity rate was around 10% to 15%, but I'm not sure. For the United States specifically, I believe the obesity rate was over 30% by 2010. So, if that's the case, maybe by 2016, it would be slightly higher, perhaps around 35% or so. But wait, the options here are 6%, 13%, 27%, and 46%. None of these match my rough estimate.\n\nMaybe I'm misremembering. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps I should consider the definition of obesity. Obesity is typically defined using Body Mass Index (BMI), where a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. So, if I can find data on the percentage of adults with a BMI of 30 or above in 2016, that would give me the answer.\n\nI think I saw a graph once that showed obesity trends over the decades. Let me see if I can visualize that. Starting from the 1960s, obesity rates were around 13-14% in the U.S., then they gradually increased to about 20% in the 1990s, and kept rising to around 30-35% in the 2010s. So, for 2016, I would guess somewhere in the mid-30% range.\n\nBut again, the options provided are 6%, 13%, 27%, and 46%. None of these align with my estimation. Maybe the question is referring to a different region or only certain countries. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to a specific gender or another subgroup.\n\nWait a minute, the question specifies adults aged 18 years or older. So, it's not limited to any particular subgroup beyond that. That suggests it's referring to the general adult population.\n\nLet me consider global obesity rates, in case the question is referring to worldwide statistics. According to some reports I've read, global obesity rates have been rising, but they might not be as high as in some specific countries like the U.S.\n\nFor example, in 2014, the WHO reported that around 13% of adults worldwide were obese. So, if that trend continued, by 2016, it might have been slightly higher, perhaps around 15% or so. But again, that doesn't match any of the options given.\n\nMaybe the question is specifically about the United States. Often, health statistics are provided for the U.S. due to the availability of detailed data. If that's the case, then based on my earlier estimation, it should be around 35%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 46% seems quite high. Is that possible? Let me think about it. If the rate was around 30% in 2010 and increased by about 0.5% per year, by 2016, it might be around 33%. Still, that's far from 46%.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in my assumption. Maybe obesity rates increased more rapidly than I thought. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different definition of obesity, but that seems unlikely since BMI standards are pretty universal.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the question is including both overweight and obese categories. Overweight is defined as BMI 25-29.9, and obese is BMI 30 and above. If that's the case, then the combined rate would be higher.\n\nHowever, the way the question is phrased\u2014\u201cobese adults aged 18 years or older\u201d\u2014suggests it's only including those in the obese category, not the overweight category.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a specific gender or race, but that seems unlikely given the general phrasing.\n\nLet me try to recall any specific studies or reports from 2016 that might have highlighted obesity rates. I think there was a report from the CDC in 2016 that stated about 36.5% of American adults were obese. That would put the percentage in the mid-30s, which is still lower than 46%.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to a different country or region where obesity rates are higher. For example, in some Pacific Island nations, obesity rates can be over 50%. But that seems unlikely, as typically, such statistics are provided for the U.S. or globally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the data. Maybe the 46% includes both overweight and obese categories, but as I thought earlier, the question specifies obese adults, which should only include those with BMI >=30.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe I should look at the trends in obesity rates over time. According to the CDC, from 2000 to 2015, the obesity rate in the U.S. increased from about 30.5% to around 36.5%. If that trend continued, by 2016, it might have been slightly higher, perhaps 37-38%, but still not close to 46%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different measure, like the prevalence of severe obesity, which is BMI >=40. However, that seems unlikely, as severe obesity rates are generally lower, around 9% in 2016 according to some sources.\n\nThis is confusing. All my estimations point to a percentage in the mid-30s for obesity rates in 2016, yet the options provided are 6%, 13%, 27%, and 46%. None of these seem to match.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question. Let me read it again: \u201cAs of 2016, about what percentage of adults aged 18 years or older were obese?\u201d\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6%\n\nB. 13%\n\nC. 27%\n\nD. 46%\n\nGiven that, and based on my knowledge of obesity trends, I would have expected the answer to be around 35-37%, but that's not among the options. So, maybe the question is referring to a different context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge of a specific study or report that provided a different percentage. If that's the case, I might need to recall that particular study.\n\nLet me think about possible famous studies or reports related to obesity in 2016. I recall that there was a study that showed a significant increase in obesity rates in certain populations, but I don't remember the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the projected obesity rates rather than the actual measured rates. Sometimes, projections can be higher based on current trends.\n\nHowever, that seems speculative. I should stick to actual data rather than projections.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is referring to the prevalence of obesity in a specific state or region rather than nationally. But that seems unlikely, as the phrasing is quite general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to the percentage of the population that is at risk of obesity, which could include overweight individuals as well. But again, the question specifies obese adults.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. All my attempts to recall or estimate the correct percentage aren't aligning with the provided options.\n\nLet me try a different strategy. Maybe I can eliminate some options that seem clearly incorrect.\n\nOption A is 6%. That seems too low. In the early 2000s, obesity rates were already above 10% globally, and in the U.S., they were around 30%. So, 6% is unlikely for 2016.\n\nOption B is 13%. That might be possible, but according to my earlier recall, global obesity rates were around 13% in 2014, and they've been increasing since then. So, by 2016, it might have been slightly higher, perhaps 14-15%. Still, 13% seems plausible enough to consider.\n\nOption C is 27%. That seems a bit high for global obesity rates but possible for certain regions or countries.\n\nOption D is 46%, which seems excessively high for global obesity rates. Even in countries with very high obesity rates, like the U.S., the rates weren't that high in 2016.\n\nGiven that, perhaps 27% is a reasonable estimate for the U.S., but again, based on my earlier calculations, it should be around 35-37%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the combined percentage of overweight and obese individuals. In that case, the percentage would be higher, but I still don't think it would reach 46%.\n\nIn the U.S., the combined overweight and obese rate was around 70% in 2016, according to some reports. But that's not what the question is asking; it specifies obese adults only.\n\nWait a second, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the data. Perhaps the 46% includes both overweight and obese categories, but as I said, the question specifies obese adults only.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different age group. For example, obesity rates in children and adolescents can be different from those in adults.\n\nBut no, the question clearly states adults aged 18 years or older.\n\nThis is really perplexing. All my efforts to recall or estimate the correct percentage aren't yielding a match with the provided options.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the question might have a typo or that one of the options is intended to be a different number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing general knowledge rather than precise statistics. In that case, choosing the closest option based on general trends might be acceptable.\n\nGiven that, and considering that global obesity rates were around 13% in 2014 and likely slightly higher in 2016, I might lean towards option B, 13%.\n\nHowever, I still have doubts because I know that in many developed countries, obesity rates are higher than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a specific country where obesity rates are relatively low. For example, in some Asian countries, obesity rates can be around 5-10%. But again, the question is phrased in a general manner, without specifying a particular country.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. I need to make a decision based on the information I have.\n\nGiven that global obesity rates were around 13% in 2014 and likely increased slightly by 2016, I will go with option B, 13%.\n\nI acknowledge that this might not be the exact figure, but based on my knowledge and the options provided, it seems like the most plausible choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
