                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out why we use t instead of z for inference procedures for means. The options are a bit confusing, but let me think through each one.\n\nOption A says that the Central Limit Theorem applies to proportions but not means. Wait, that doesn't sound right. The Central Limit Theorem actually applies to both proportions and means. It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean or the sample proportion will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough. So, I think this option is incorrect because the CLT does apply to means.\n\nOption B says we use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal, but means are not. Again, this seems misleading. We use z for proportions when certain conditions are met, like np and n(1-p) being greater than 5, which makes the sampling distribution of proportions approximately normal. The same logic applies to means via the CLT. So, this doesn't seem to be the right reason.\n\nOption C says we use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that's not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means. This seems similar to option B. I think this is also incorrect because the sampling distribution of sample means can also be approximately normal under the CLT.\n\nOption D says that when using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic. Hmm, this sounds interesting. I remember that when we know the population standard deviation, we use the z-distribution for means. But when we don't know the population standard deviation and estimate it with the sample standard deviation, we use the t-distribution, which accounts for this added uncertainty.\n\nSo, in inference procedures for means, if we know \u03c3, we use z, but if we don't know \u03c3 and have to estimate it with s, we use t. The t-distribution has heavier tails, which reflect the increased variability in our estimate of the standard deviation.\n\nI think option D is the correct explanation because it directly addresses why we use t instead of z when estimating the population standard deviation from the sample.\n\nLet me just double-check. The t-distribution is specifically designed for situations where the population standard deviation is unknown and is estimated from the sample. It provides a more conservative approach to estimating the confidence intervals and testing hypotheses about the population mean.\n\nTherefore, the reason we use t instead of z for inference procedures for means is indeed because we're using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, which introduces more variability into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
