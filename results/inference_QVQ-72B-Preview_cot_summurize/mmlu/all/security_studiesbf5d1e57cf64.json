                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements isn't applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century. Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Within peace studies, one of the later developments was a major interest in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping.\" This seems plausible. As peace studies evolved, it makes sense that researchers and practitioners would focus more on preventing conflicts from starting, resolving ongoing conflicts, and keeping the peace after conflicts end. This aligns with the general progression of the field, especially as the world faced numerous conflicts throughout the twentieth century.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"At the height of the Cold War, peace studies was frequently labelled 'appeasement studies' and was bitterly opposed by critics.\" Hmm, this one sounds a bit tricky. The Cold War was a period of intense geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, characterized by arms races, proxy wars, and ideological confrontations. During this time, any field that focused on peace might have been seen as soft on communism or as advocating for appeasement, which was a strategy famously criticized for allowing aggression by not standing up to it. So, it's possible that peace studies was met with skepticism or opposition from certain quarters. However, I need to verify if this characterization is accurate and if it was indeed bitterly opposed during that period.\n\nOption C: \"By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts.\" This seems like a significant claim. The 1970s were a time when many academic disciplines were expanding their scope and incorporating new perspectives. If peace researchers were advocating for a broader approach but didn't succeed, that would suggest that the field was resistant to change at that time. I need to check whether these efforts were indeed unsuccessful or if there was some progress made in broadening the field's focus.\n\nLastly, option D: \"Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict.\" This statement aligns with what I know about peace studies. Traditional international relations theory often focuses on states as the primary actors in global politics. Peace studies, on the other hand, tends to adopt a more holistic approach, considering non-state actors, transnational issues, and the root causes of conflict beyond just interstate relations. So, this seems accurate.\n\nNow, to determine which of these statements is not applicable, I need to cross-reference them with reliable sources on the history of peace studies in the twentieth century.\n\nFirst, let's confirm option A. Conflict prevention, resolution, and peacekeeping are indeed central concerns in contemporary peace studies. The United Nations, for example, has been increasingly involved in these areas since the end of the Cold War. Scholars in peace studies have developed theories and practices related to these areas, such as early warning systems for conflict prevention, mediation techniques for resolution, and multidimensional peacekeeping operations. Therefore, this option seems applicable.\n\nFor option B, I need to look into the reception of peace studies during the Cold War era. The Cold War was marked by a polarized political climate, where discussions of peace could be seen as sympathetic to one side or the other. Some peace researchers and activists were accused of being pacifists or even communists, which led to criticism and sometimes marginalization of the field. However, it's also worth noting that peace studies emerged in part as a response to the nuclear arms race and the fear of global annihilation, which transcended political ideologies. So, while there was opposition, it may not have been uniformly bitter, and the field did manage to establish itself in academic circles despite the challenges.\n\nOption C requires some research into the history of peace studies in the 1970s. By that time, peace studies had been evolving since its inception in the 1950s and 1960s. Scholars like Johan Galtung introduced the concepts of positive and negative peace, broadening the understanding of peace beyond just the absence of war. Others began to incorporate issues like environmental sustainability, social justice, and human rights into the field. It seems that while there were calls for further broadening, the field did experience significant expansion in its scope during this period. Therefore, the statement that efforts to broaden the field were largely unsuccessful might be an overstatement.\n\nFinally, option D aligns with the general direction of peace studies. The field has indeed emphasized a more global perspective that goes beyond state-centric views. It has considered the roles of international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and individual actors in promoting peace and resolving conflicts. This approach is consistent with the field's development over the past century.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C seems to be the most questionable. While there were indeed calls for broadening the remit of peace studies in the 1970s, it appears that the field did respond to some extent, incorporating new areas of study and adopting interdisciplinary methods. Therefore, the statement that these efforts were largely unsuccessful may not accurately reflect the actual development of the field.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement that is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century is option C: \"By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts.\" This is because, contrary to this statement, the field did see significant broadening in its scope during that period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
