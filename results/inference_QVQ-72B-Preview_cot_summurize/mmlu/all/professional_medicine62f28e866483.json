                    "text": "So I've got this case to figure out. It's about a 14-year-old boy who's been feeling pretty unwell lately. He's been having a sore throat and fever that seems to be worse in the late afternoon. On top of that, he's been feeling increasingly tired over the past week. He also mentioned that he recently started having unprotected sex with one partner. When the doctor saw him, he looked sick, and his temperature was quite high at 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). The doctor also noticed that he had swollen lymph nodes in his neck and his throat was red with some creamy stuff coming out.\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to consider what these symptoms might point to. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Sore throat\n\n2. Fever peaking in the late afternoon\n\n3. Progressive fatigue over a week\n\n4. Cervical lymphadenopathy (which means swollen lymph nodes in the neck)\n\n5. Pharyngeal erythema (red throat)\n\n6. Creamy exudate (some kind of discharge in the throat)\n\nAlso, there's a recent history of starting unprotected sexual activity with one partner.\n\nOkay, so these symptoms are pretty common to a few different conditions, but the combination might help narrow it down. Let's think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A is candidiasis. I know that candidiasis is a fungal infection usually caused by Candida albicans. It's common in the mouth and throat, especially in people with weakened immune systems or who are taking antibiotics. Symptoms can include sore throat, white patches in the mouth and throat, and possibly fever. But in this case, the patient has a creamy exudate in the throat, which could be consistent with candidiasis, but I'm not entirely sure if it's typically described that way. Also, candidiasis isn't usually associated with significant lymphadenopathy or high fevers like 39\u00b0C. Maybe it's possible, but it seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nOption B is herpangina. This is a viral infection caused by coxsackievirus, and it's common in children. Symptoms include sore throat, fever, and sometimes ulcers in the back of the throat. But I don't recall herpangina being associated with significant lymphadenopathy or such a high fever. It's usually a milder illness. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption C is infectious mononucleosis. This is often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is common in teenagers and young adults. The classic symptoms are sore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy, which all match up with what this patient has. The fever can be high and may peak in the afternoon. Pharyngeal erythema is common, and sometimes there can be exudates in the throat. Also, mononucleosis is known for causing significant fatigue, which has been progressive over a week in this patient. Additionally, recent onset of sexual activity might be relevant, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to mononucleosis. Still, this seems like a strong possibility.\n\nOption D is mumps. This is a viral infection that often affects the salivary glands, causing swelling in the cheeks and jaw. Symptoms include fever, headache, and sore throat. But typically, mumps is more known for the salivary gland swelling, which wasn't mentioned here. Lymphadenopathy can occur, but again, it's not as prominent as in mononucleosis. The fever in mumps is usually moderate, not as high as 39\u00b0C. So, this seems less likely.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other possibilities. Streptococcal pharyngitis comes to mind, which is a bacterial infection causing sore throat, fever, and sometimes lymphadenopathy. It can also present with pharyngeal exudate. However, the fever in strep throat is usually not as high as 39\u00b0C, and the fatigue might not be as profound as described here. But it's still a possibility.\n\nAnother consideration could be HIV acute seroconversion illness. This can present with flu-like symptoms, including fever, sore throat, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. Exudative pharyngitis can occasionally occur in early HIV infection. Given the recent onset of unprotected sexual activity, this is something to think about. However, HIV acute seroconversion is generally less common than mononucleosis in teenagers, and the symptoms can be similar, but perhaps not as severe.\n\nWait a minute, another possibility is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is the primary cause of infectious mononucleosis. So, that brings me back to option C. EBV is known for causing a triad of symptoms: pharyngitis, fever, and adenopathy, which perfectly match the patient's presentation.\n\nLet me think about the laboratory tests that could help confirm the diagnosis. For mononucleosis, a heterophile antibody test (Monospot test) is commonly used, which detects antibodies produced in response to EBV infection. Additionally, specific EBV serology can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nGiven the patient's age, sexual activity might be a risk factor for certain infections, but mononucleosis is primarily spread through saliva, not sexual intercourse, although sexual transmission is possible. So, the sexual activity might be more of a red herring in this context, or it could be relevant if considering other sexually transmitted infections that might present similarly.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that could present with similar symptoms. For example, gonorrhea can cause pharyngitis in people who have oral sex without protection, which could lead to sore throat and possibly lymphadenopathy. However, gonorrheal pharyngitis is typically not associated with high fevers or significant fatigue. Also, the creamy exudate might not be typical for gonorrhea in the throat.\n\nSyphilis is another STI that can cause sore throat and lymphadenopathy, but again, it's not usually associated with high fevers or pharyngeal exudates. Primary syphilis might present with a sore or ulcer, but not necessarily the symptoms described here.\n\nChlamydia can also cause pharyngitis, but it's generally mild and not associated with high fevers or significant exudates.\n\nSo, considering all this, infectious mononucleosis seems like the most likely diagnosis based on the symptom complex presented: sore throat, high fever peaking in the afternoon, progressive fatigue, cervical lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal erythema with exudate, and the patient's age and recent sexual activity, which might be a coincidental factor.\n\nI should also consider that the patient's recent sexual activity could be unrelated to his current symptoms, and that mononucleosis is a common infection in this age group, often spread through close personal contact, including kissing, which could be related to his new sexual activity if it involved kissing.\n\nIn summary, based on the clinical presentation, infectious mononucleosis is the most plausible diagnosis among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
