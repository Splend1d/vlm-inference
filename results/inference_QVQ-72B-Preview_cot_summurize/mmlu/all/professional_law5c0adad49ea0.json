                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out who owns the 30-acre tract of land after a series of events. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the professor owns the 30-acre tract in fee simple absolute. That means the professor has complete ownership of the land, with no restrictions or conditions attached to it.\n\nThen, the professor conveys the land to both his friend and his co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Joint tenancy with right of survivorship is a way of holding property where each owner has an undivided interest in the whole property, and when one owner dies, their interest passes directly to the surviving joint tenant(s), bypassing probate.\n\nSo, initially, the friend and the co-worker each have an undivided interest in the entire 30-acre tract. That means they both own the whole property together, not separate parts.\n\nTwo years after this conveyance, the friend executes a mortgage on the 30-acre tract to secure a loan from a bank. A mortgage is a lien on the property that secures the repayment of the loan. In most jurisdictions, when you mortgage a property held in joint tenancy, you're essentially pledging your interest in the property as security for the loan.\n\nNow, the jurisdiction recognizes a \"title theory\" of mortgages. I need to understand what that means. In title theory jurisdictions, the lender actually holds title to the property during the period of the loan. The borrower retains only a right of redemption, meaning they can repay the loan and get the title back. So, in this case, the bank holds the title to the property, but the borrower has the right to pay off the loan and reacquire the property.\n\nOne year after executing the mortgage, the friend dies intestate, meaning without a will. The only heir is his uncle. Since the friend and the co-worker were joint tenants with right of survivorship, when the friend dies, his interest in the property should pass to the surviving joint tenant, which is the co-worker.\n\nHowever, there's a mortgage involved, and the bank has a lien on the property. So, the question is, how does the death of the friend affect the mortgage, and who holds title to the property now?\n\nLet me think about this. In joint tenancy, the right of survivorship typically means that the surviving joint tenant inherits the deceased's interest. But since there was a mortgage involved, does that affect the transfer?\n\nIn title theory jurisdictions, the bank holds the title during the loan period. So, perhaps the bank's interest is prior to the joint tenancy interest.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look into how mortgages affect joint tenancies.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, mortgaging your interest in a joint tenancy can sever the joint tenancy as to your interest, turning it into a tenancy in common. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, and the right of survivorship still applies.\n\nGiven that the jurisdiction follows the title theory of mortgages, perhaps the bank's interest is superior to the joint tenancy rights.\n\nLet me consider the sequence again:\n\n1. Professor conveys the land to friend and co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\n2. Friend mortgages his interest to the bank.\n\n3. Friend dies intestate, with his uncle as the only heir.\n\nIn title theory jurisdictions, the bank holds the title, but the borrowers have a right of redemption.\n\nWhen the friend dies, his interest passes to his heir, the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut since the friend and co-worker were joint tenants, and the friend dies, the right of survivorship should pass his interest to the co-worker.\n\nHowever, the friend had mortgaged his interest, so the bank has a claim on that interest.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider that the co-worker, as the surviving joint tenant, now owns the entire property, subject to the mortgage that the friend had taken out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the uncle inherits the friend's interest, but since the co-worker has the right of survivorship, the uncle's interest is extinguished.\n\nI think the general rule is that in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the surviving joint tenant inherits the deceased's interest, regardless of any claims against the deceased's estate.\n\nBut in this case, there's a mortgage involved, which complicates things.\n\nLet me see if I can find a principle that applies here.\n\nIn property law, when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, it may sever the joint tenancy as to that interest, turning it into a tenancy in common.\n\nIf that's the case, then after the mortgage, the co-worker would still have his undivided interest, and the friend would have his mortgaged interest.\n\nUpon the friend's death, his interest would pass to his heir, the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut the co-worker would still have his undivided interest.\n\nSo, perhaps the property is now owned as tenants in common, with the co-worker owning his share and the uncle owning the friend's share, subject to the mortgage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the right of survivorship overrides the mortgage, and the co-worker inherits the entire property, subject to the mortgage.\n\nI need to consider the effect of the mortgage on the joint tenancy.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, mortgaging a joint tenancy interest severs the joint tenancy as to that interest, creating a tenancy in common.\n\nIf that's the case here, then after the mortgage, the friend and the co-worker would be tenants in common, with the friend's interest being mortgaged.\n\nUpon the friend's death, his interest would pass to his heir, the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nSo, in that scenario, the co-worker would own his share, and the uncle would own the friend's share, subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut another view is that the right of survivorship prevails, and the co-worker inherits the entire property, subject to the mortgage.\n\nI need to think about which approach the court is likely to take.\n\nGiven that the jurisdiction recognizes the title theory of mortgages, perhaps the bank's interest is paramount, and the joint tenancy is effectively severed by the mortgage.\n\nIn that case, the friend's interest would be a tenancy in common interest, and upon his death, it would pass to his heir, the uncle.\n\nTherefore, the property would now be owned by the co-worker and the uncle as tenants in common, with the uncle's interest being subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the jurisdiction recognizes a title theory of mortgages. In title theory jurisdictions, the lender holds the title during the loan period, and the borrower has a right of redemption.\n\nSo, perhaps the bank holds the title, and the friend had a right of redemption, which passed to his heir, the uncle.\n\nIn that case, the uncle would have the right to redeem the property by paying off the loan, but the co-worker still has his undivided interest.\n\nSo, the property is now owned by the co-worker and the uncle, with the uncle's interest being subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nIn title theory jurisdictions, the bank holds the title, and the borrower has a right of equity in the property.\n\nWhen the friend died, his right of equity passed to his heir, the uncle.\n\nMeanwhile, the co-worker still has his undivided interest in the property.\n\nSo, perhaps the property is now owned by the co-worker and the uncle as tenants in common, with the uncle's interest being subject to the mortgage.\n\nWait, but the co-worker has an undivided interest in the whole property, and the uncle has an interest subject to the mortgage.\n\nSo, in that case, the co-worker owns his share free and clear, and the uncle owns his share subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut if they are tenants in common, then the co-worker's share is separate from the uncle's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the co-worker, as the surviving joint tenant, inherits the entire property, subject to the mortgage.\n\nI think the key here is whether the mortgage severed the joint tenancy.\n\nIf the mortgage severed the joint tenancy, then the friend and co-worker became tenants in common, with the friend's interest being mortgaged.\n\nUpon the friend's death, his interest passes to his heir, the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the property is now owned half by the co-worker, free and clear, and half by the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nOption D seems to reflect this scenario.\n\nHowever, perhaps the right of survivorship prevails, and the co-worker inherits the entire property, subject to the mortgage.\n\nIn that case, the uncle would have no interest, and the co-worker would own the whole property, but it's still subject to the mortgage that the friend had executed.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's how it works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the co-worker inherits the entire property, but the uncle has a claim against the property due to the mortgage.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nIn joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the surviving joint tenant inherits the deceased's interest.\n\nBut if the deceased had mortgaged his interest, does that affect the survivor's interest?\n\nI think that the mortgage would attach to the deceased's interest, which then passes to the heir, but the survivor still gets the property, subject to the mortgage.\n\nSo, in this case, the co-worker inherits the entire property, but it's subject to the mortgage that the friend had taken out.\n\nTherefore, the co-worker now owns the whole property, but the bank has a claim against it due to the unpaid loan.\n\nIn that case, option A would apply: title is vested in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\n\nOption B says the co-worker owns it free and clear of the mortgage, which doesn't seem right because the mortgage was executed by the friend before his death.\n\nOption C says half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, both subject to the mortgage, which might be the case if the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage.\n\nOption D says half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nGiven that, I think option A is the most accurate: the co-worker owns the entire property, subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because of the title theory of mortgages.\n\nLet me see if I can find a case or a principle that applies here.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, when a joint tenant mortgages his interest, it severs the joint tenancy as to his interest, turning it into a tenancy in common.\n\nIf that's the case here, then after the mortgage, the friend and co-worker would be tenants in common, with the friend's interest being mortgaged.\n\nUpon the friend's death, his interest would pass to his heir, the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nSo, in that scenario, the property would be owned half by the co-worker, free and clear, and half by the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nThat would correspond to option D.\n\nAlternatively, if the joint tenancy wasn't severed by the mortgage, then the co-worker would inherit the entire property, subject to the mortgage, which would be option A.\n\nI need to find out whether mortgaging a joint tenancy interest severs the joint tenancy.\n\nUpon checking, I find that in many jurisdictions, mortgaging a joint tenancy interest does indeed sever the joint tenancy as to that interest, turning it into a tenancy in common.\n\nAssuming that's the case here, then after the friend mortgaged his interest, the joint tenancy was severed, and they became tenants in common.\n\nUpon the friend's death, his tenancy in common interest passed to his heir, the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the property is now owned half by the co-worker, free and clear, and half by the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the jurisdiction recognizes a title theory of mortgages. Does that change anything?\n\nIn title theory jurisdictions, the lender holds the title, and the borrower has a right of redemption.\n\nSo, perhaps the bank holds the title, and the friend had the right of redemption, which passed to his heir, the uncle.\n\nIn that case, the uncle would have the right to redeem the property by paying off the loan, but the co-worker still has his undivided interest.\n\nSo, the property is now owned by the co-worker and the uncle as tenants in common, with the uncle's interest being subject to the mortgage.\n\nThat again points to option D: half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in title theory jurisdictions, the bank holds the title, so perhaps the uncle's interest is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the co-worker inherits the entire property, subject to the mortgage, meaning the bank has a claim against the whole property.\n\nIn that case, option A would apply.\n\nI think the better answer is option D, because the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage, turning the friend's interest into a tenancy in common interest, which then passed to his heir, the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the co-worker owns half, free and clear, and the uncle owns half, subject to the mortgage.\n\nSo, the answer is D. half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
