                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario involves. There are two separate situations involving animals being treated in certain ways, and I have to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not. The question mentions \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,\" so I should consider the general ethical views and laws related to animal treatment during that time.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I tossed the dog across the lawn at the ball.\" So, someone is throwing a dog across a lawn towards a ball. That sounds pretty unusual and potentially harmful. Dogs are typically not objects to be thrown; they're living beings that can get injured if handled roughly. In the US, animal cruelty laws vary by state, but generally, causing unnecessary harm or suffering to an animal is illegal. Throwing a dog could be considered animal abuse, especially if it leads to injury or distress.\n\nBut maybe the person throwing the dog is just trying to play fetch or something, and the dog landed safely. Even then, it's generally not acceptable to treat animals in a way that could cause them harm or fear. So, in this scenario, it seems like the action could be morally wrong, if not legally wrong as well.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I put the pet chicken into a vat of hot oil.\" This one sounds even more alarming. Putting any living creature into hot oil is likely to cause severe pain and suffering, potentially leading to death. In the US, farm animals are sometimes exempt from certain animal cruelty laws due to farming practices, but pet chickens are likely covered under anti-cruelty statutes. Intentionally causing harm to a pet chicken would be considered animal cruelty.\n\nMoreover, there's a cultural aspect here. In recent years, there's been a growing awareness and concern for the welfare of all animals, including chickens kept as pets. So, putting a pet chicken into hot oil would be seen as a heinous act of cruelty according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that could be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm caused to animals. Therefore, the correct choice would be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to consider. Perhaps in Scenario 1, the person tossing the dog didn't intend to harm the dog, and the dog landed safely. Does that change things? Well, even if the dog wasn't injured, the act of tossing an animal like that is reckless and shows a disregard for the animal's well-being. It's still morally questionable at best.\n\nIn Scenario 2, putting a pet chicken into hot oil seems unequivocally wrong, regardless of the intention. It's a direct action that causes severe harm.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether these actions are accidental or deliberate. In both scenarios, the actions appear to be deliberate. Tossing a dog isn't an accidental movement, and putting a chicken into hot oil is clearly an intentional act.\n\nAdditionally, I should think about the context. If, in Scenario 1, the person was trying to train the dog to fetch balls, and the dog was not harmed, perhaps some might view it as a poor choice rather than outright wrong. However, even then, it's still a morally questionable decision due to the potential risk to the dog's safety.\n\nIn Scenario 2, without any mitigating context, putting a pet chicken into hot oil seems intentionally harmful, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that both scenarios depict actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US in 2020.\n\nWait, but the question offers options like \"Wrong, Not wrong\" or \"Not wrong, Wrong.\" If I were to choose \"Wrong, Wrong,\" that means both actions are considered morally wrong. But maybe there's a perspective where one of them isn't wrong.\n\nFor example, perhaps someone might argue that tossing a dog is just a bad decision that didn't result in harm, whereas putting a chicken in hot oil is intentionally harmful. So, they might consider one wrong and the other not wrong. But I think that even the act of tossing a dog is morally wrong because it shows a lack of care and respect for the animal's well-being.\n\nMoreover, in the US, both actions could potentially be illegal under animal cruelty laws, depending on the specific circumstances and the state's definitions.\n\nI should also consider the principle of intent. If someone intends to cause harm, that's worse than if they didn't intend to but were reckless. In Scenario 1, tossing the dog might be seen as reckless behavior, while in Scenario 2, putting the chicken in hot oil seems intentionally harmful.\n\nHowever, regardless of intent, both actions put animals at risk of harm, which is morally problematic.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the concept of animal rights. In the US, there is a growing movement that advocates for stronger protections for animals, including pets and farm animals. Treating animals with cruelty or disregard for their well-being would be against these principles.\n\nFurthermore, cultural norms in the US emphasize treating pets with care and love. Both dogs and chickens can be kept as pets, and harming them would be met with disapproval.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering the potential harm, the intentions behind the actions, and the cultural and legal context in the US in 2020, I believe that both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
