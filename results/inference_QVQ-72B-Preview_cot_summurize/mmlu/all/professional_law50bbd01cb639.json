                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a contractor and an owner of a building, and there's some back and forth about bids and contracts. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, there's an owner who has a three-story office building and wants to renovate it. He asks several contractors to submit bids for the job. One of those contractors then asks subcontractors for their bids to help determine the total cost. An electrician gives a bid to the contractor for the electrical work, and the contractor uses that in his own bid to the owner.\n\nThe contractor tells the electrician that he's using their bid in his own bid to the owner. Then, two weeks later, the contractor submits his bid to the owner, offering to do the renovation for $75,000. The next day, the electrician says they can't do the work after all. So, the contractor finds another electrician who will do the job for $5,000 more than the original bid.\n\nThe owner then sends a confirmation letter saying she accepts the contractor's offer of $75,000. After that, the contractor tells the owner that the cost has gone up to $80,000 because of the higher cost for the electrical work. The owner says no, she's only paying $75,000, and won't be responsible for any extra costs.\n\nThe contractor goes ahead and does the work, but the owner hasn't paid him yet. Now, in a lawsuit by the contractor against the owner, the question is, how much can the contractor recover?\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between the contractor and the owner for $75,000 to renovate the building. The owner accepted the contractor's bid of $75,000 with a confirmation letter, which seems like a binding contract.\n\nBut then, the electrician backs out, and the contractor has to find another electrician who charges $5,000 more. The contractor tries to pass that extra cost to the owner, but the owner refuses, saying she's only paying $75,000.\n\nSo, the contractor did the work for $80,000, but the contract was for $75,000. Now, in a lawsuit, what can the contractor recover?\n\nOption A says only in quantum meruit because of the doctrine of commercial frustration. Quantum meruit means \"as much as he deserved,\" which is a principle where a person can recover the reasonable value of services provided when there's no contract or the contract is invalid. But here, there is a contract for $75,000, so I'm not sure if quantum meruit applies. As for commercial frustration, that might be relevant if the basis of the contract has changed in a way that makes performance impossible or radically different, but I don't think that's the case here. The electrician backing out is a risk that the contractor probably should have accounted for.\n\nOption B says only in quantum meruit because demanding $80,000 repudiated the contract. Repudiation is when one party indicates they won't perform their obligations under the contract. If the contractor demanded $80,000, that might be seen as repudiating the original contract for $75,000. But again, quantum meruit seems unlikely because there's a contract in place.\n\nOption C says $75,000 only, because that was the contract price. This seems straightforward. The contractor and the owner agreed on $75,000, and the owner should pay that amount. The fact that the contractor ended up spending $80,000 is unfortunate, but that's a risk they take when they bid on a job.\n\nOption D says $80,000, because the contractor relied detrimentally on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate. This sounds like a reliance argument, maybe similar to promissory estoppel. The idea is that the contractor relied on the electrician's bid and suffered a loss when the electrician backed out.\n\nBut, in the context of a binding contract, I'm not sure how that would play out. The contractor and the owner have a clear agreement for $75,000. The contractor's reliance on the electrician's bid is between the contractor and the electrician, not directly between the contractor and the owner.\n\nWait, but the contractor did the work for $80,000, which is more than the contract price. If the contractor is seeking $80,000 from the owner, that's more than the agreed price. But did the contractor exceed the scope of work or incur extra costs that weren't part of the original contract?\n\nIt seems like the extra $5,000 was due to the electrician backing out and the contractor having to find a more expensive replacement. That's a risk that the contractor should have accounted for in their bid. Maybe they should have included a contingency for such possibilities.\n\nBut in this scenario, the contractor didn't do that. They submitted a bid of $75,000 based on the electrician's bid, and then when the electrician backed out, they were stuck with higher costs.\n\nIn contract law, generally, once a contract is formed, the parties are bound by its terms unless there's a valid reason to modify it. Here, the owner accepted the $75,000 bid, and the contractor agreed to perform the work for that amount. The fact that the contractor's costs increased due to the electrician backing out is likely the contractor's problem, not the owner's.\n\nThe owner has a right to expect the work to be done for the agreed price, provided that the scope of work remains the same. If the scope changed, that might be different, but in this case, it seems like the scope remained the same; only the costs to the contractor increased.\n\nTherefore, the contractor is probably entitled to $75,000, as per the contract. The extra $5,000 is a loss that the contractor has to bear unless they can recover it from the electrician for backing out.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer: $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the contractor can recover the extra $5,000 from the owner? Well, if the contractor can show that the owner was aware of the increased costs and agreed to pay them, then maybe. But in this scenario, the owner explicitly said she would hold the contractor to the original bid of $75,000 and wouldn't be responsible for any additional costs.\n\nSo, without the owner's agreement to pay the extra $5,000, the contractor is stuck with that loss.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the contractor can sue the electrician for breach of contract or something similar, to recover the $5,000 difference, but that's a separate issue from the current lawsuit between the contractor and the owner.\n\nIn conclusion, in this action by the contractor against the owner, the contractor will probably be able to recover $75,000 only, as that was the contract price.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
