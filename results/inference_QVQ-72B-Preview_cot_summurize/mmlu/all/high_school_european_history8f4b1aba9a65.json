His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nA nineteenth-century Russian historian evaluating this passage would probably be most interested in\n\nA. the Russian interest in French culture\nB. the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners\nC. the sense of continual class struggle\nD. the need for noblesse oblige\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from \u00c9mile Zola's \"Germinal,\" and it's about some Russian context, I think. Let me try to understand what's going on here. There's a character named Souvarine, who seems to be from Russia, and he's feeling despairing about the situation in Russia. He mentions that his old companions are turning to politicians, and the famous Nihilists, who are scaring Europe, are mostly from lower middle class backgrounds and can't seem to get past the idea of national liberation. He thinks they believe that killing their despot will solve everything, but he calls it \"foolery\" and says they'll never get out of their situation with that approach.\n\nThen he talks about his own experiences. He gave up his rank and fortune, lived among workers, and tried to help build a new society based on labor in common. But it didn't work out; there was no fusion between the classes. He seems disappointed that even the workers he tried to help are selfish and just want to hoard money for themselves, like the hatworkers in Marseilles who won a lottery and invested it to live without working, instead of sharing it with the poor.\n\nHe criticizes French workers for wanting to be bourgeois themselves and hating the rich only because they want to take their place. He says they're not worthy of happiness as long as they own anything and that their hatred is just fueled by a desire to be in the bourgeoisie's position.\n\nNow, the question is about how a nineteenth-century Russian historian would view this passage. The options are:\n\nA. the Russian interest in French culture\n\nB. the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners\n\nC. the sense of continual class struggle\n\nD. the need for noblesse oblige\n\nFirst, let's understand what each option means.\n\nA. Russian interest in French culture: This would involve the admiration or study of French art, literature, philosophy, etc., by Russians during that time.\n\nB. Spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners: This refers to a sense of brotherhood or friendship among the miners, possibly suggesting unity and cooperation.\n\nC. Sense of continual class struggle: This is a Marxist concept where there's a constant conflict between different social classes, like the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.\n\nD. Need for noblesse oblige: This is a principle that people of high social standing have a moral obligation to act responsibly and generously towards those less fortunate.\n\nGiven that the passage is from \"Germinal,\" which is a novel about the lives of coal miners in France and their struggles against poor working conditions and capitalist exploitation, it's deeply rooted in the theme of class struggle.\n\nSouvarine's criticism of both the Russian Nihilists and the French workers suggests that he sees flaws in their approaches to social and political change. He disparages the Nihilists for focusing on national liberation and assassinations as solutions, calling it \"foolery.\" He also criticizes the French workers for their selfishness and desire to become bourgeois rather than working towards a more equal society.\n\nA Russian historian from the nineteenth century would likely be aware of the Nihilist movement in Russia, which was a radical movement that advocated for the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and traditional values. Many Nihilists were involved in revolutionary activities, including assassinations, in an attempt to bring about social and political change.\n\nSouvarine's disappointment with the Nihilists' approach might resonate with a historian who saw the limitations of such tactics. The historian might agree that while the Nihilists' actions caused fear in Europe, they didn't lead to fundamental social transformation.\n\nSimilarly, the criticism of French workers for their individualistic tendencies and desire for bourgeois status might align with observations of workers' movements in other countries. The historian might see this as a reflection of the challenges faced by workers' movements everywhere, not just in Russia.\n\nGiven that, option C, the sense of continual class struggle, seems particularly relevant. The passage highlights the tensions and conflicts between different social classes, both in Russia and France. Souvarine's despair over the news from Russia and his disappointment with the French workers' behavior point to a broader theme of class conflict and the difficulties in achieving social harmony.\n\nOption A, Russian interest in French culture, might be relevant in a broader context, but the passage itself doesn't directly address this. While Souvarine is critical of French workers, it doesn't necessarily indicate a wider Russian interest in French culture.\n\nOption B, the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners, is somewhat contradicted by Souvarine's experience. He tried to foster a sense of brotherhood among the colliers but found that the fusion didn't occur. His criticism of the hatworkers in Marseilles also suggests a lack of solidarity and camaraderie.\n\nOption D, the need for noblesse oblige, isn't directly addressed in the passage. Souvarine gave up his rank and fortune, but his criticism is aimed more at the workers' selfishness and the intellectuals' limited visions rather than calling for the nobility to fulfill their obligations.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is option C: the sense of continual class struggle. This is because the passage vividly illustrates the ongoing conflicts and tensions between different social classes, both in Russia and France, and the difficulties in resolving these conflicts through the approaches taken by the Nihilists and the workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
