                    "text": "So I have this function, y equals ln(x) over x, and I need to find its relative maximum value. The options are 1, e, 2 over e, and 1 over e. Hmm, I remember that to find relative maxima, I should probably look at the derivative of the function and set it to zero to find critical points. Then, I can determine if those points are maxima, minima, or neither.\n\nAlright, first things first, let's find the derivative of y with respect to x. y is ln(x)/x. I need to use the quotient rule for this. The quotient rule says that if you have a function that's u/v, then its derivative is (v*u' - u*v')/v\u00b2.\n\nSo, here, u is ln(x), and v is x.\n\nFirst, find u': the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x.\n\nThen, find v': the derivative of x is 1.\n\nPlugging into the quotient rule, y' = (x*(1/x) - ln(x)*1)/x\u00b2.\n\nSimplify that: x*(1/x) is 1, so it's (1 - ln(x))/x\u00b2.\n\nOkay, now to find the critical points, I need to set y' equal to zero.\n\nSo, (1 - ln(x))/x\u00b2 = 0.\n\nFor this fraction to be zero, the numerator must be zero because the denominator is x\u00b2, which is always positive for x greater than zero (since ln(x) is only defined for x > 0).\n\nSo, 1 - ln(x) = 0 \u21d2 ln(x) = 1 \u21d2 x = e.\n\nAlright, so there's a critical point at x = e.\n\nNow, to determine if this is a maximum or minimum, I can use the second derivative test or just analyze the sign of the first derivative around x = e.\n\nLet me try the second derivative test.\n\nFirst, find y''.\n\nI have y' = (1 - ln(x))/x\u00b2.\n\nTo find y'', I need to differentiate this.\n\nThis is a quotient again: u = 1 - ln(x), v = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, y'' = (v*u' - u*v')/v\u00b2.\n\nFirst, u' = derivative of 1 - ln(x) is -1/x.\n\nv' = derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x.\n\nSo, y'' = (x\u00b2*(-1/x) - (1 - ln(x))*2x)/(x\u00b2)\u00b2 = (-x - 2x(1 - ln(x)))/x\u2074.\n\nSimplify numerator: -x - 2x + 2x*ln(x) = -3x + 2x*ln(x).\n\nFactor x: x(-3 + 2ln(x)).\n\nSo, y'' = x(-3 + 2ln(x))/x\u2074 = (-3 + 2ln(x))/x\u00b3.\n\nNow, at x = e, y'' = (-3 + 2ln(e))/e\u00b3 = (-3 + 2*1)/e\u00b3 = (-3 + 2)/e\u00b3 = -1/e\u00b3.\n\nSince y'' at x = e is negative, this indicates a local maximum.\n\nSo, x = e is a relative maximum.\n\nNow, I need to find the value of y at x = e.\n\ny = ln(e)/e = 1/e.\n\nSo, the relative maximum value is 1/e.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's D. 1/e.\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check if there are any other critical points or if I missed something.\n\nWe found y' = (1 - ln(x))/x\u00b2, and setting it to zero gave us x = e.\n\nAre there any other points where y' is zero? Well, ln(x) is only zero when x = 1, and ln(x) increases as x increases beyond that. So, ln(x) = 1 only when x = e, as I found.\n\nAlso, checking the endpoints isn't applicable here since the domain of ln(x) is (0, \u221e), and the function approaches negative infinity as x approaches zero from the right, and increases without bound as x increases.\n\nTherefore, the only critical point is at x = e, and at that point, y has a relative maximum of 1/e.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 1/e.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should also consider if there are any inflection points or other features, but the question is specifically asking for the relative maximum value, so I think that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could sketch the graph to confirm.\n\nLet me think about the behavior of y = ln(x)/x.\n\nAs x approaches 0 from the right, ln(x) approaches negative infinity, so y approaches negative infinity.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, ln(x) grows without bound, but x grows faster, so y approaches 0.\n\nAt x = e, y = 1/e, which matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the second derivative again.\n\nWe have y'' = (-3 + 2ln(x))/x\u00b3.\n\nAt x = e, y'' = -1/e\u00b3, which is negative, confirming it's a maximum.\n\nIf I consider x approaching 0, y approaches negative infinity.\n\nAt x = 1, y = ln(1)/1 = 0.\n\nBetween x = 1 and x = e, y is increasing because y' > 0 (since 1 - ln(x) > 0 for x < e).\n\nAfter x = e, y starts decreasing because y' < 0 (1 - ln(x) < 0 for x > e).\n\nSo, yes, x = e is the peak.\n\nTherefore, the relative maximum value is indeed 1/e.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{e}} \\]"
