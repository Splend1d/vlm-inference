Hmm, I need to figure out which one fits the description.\n\nFirst, let's break down the question. It's about a system where religion and government are combined. So, basically, the religious leaders have power in the government, or the government is based on religious laws. That sounds like a specific type of government structure.\n\nLet me recall what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Dictatorship: This is a form of government where one person or a small group holds all the power, usually without any legal limits. It's often associated with authoritarian rule and suppression of opposition.\n\nB. Theocracy: This is a government in which priests rule in the name of God or a god. Essentially, the state is governed by religious authorities, and the laws are based on religious teachings or scriptures.\n\nC. Democracy: This is a system where the power is held by the people, typically through elected representatives. It's based on the principle of majority rule and respects minority rights.\n\nD. Autocracy: This is similar to a dictatorship, where one person has unlimited authority and excludes others from participating in government.\n\nGiven these definitions, theocracy seems to be the one that fits the description of combining religion and government. In a theocracy, the religious and governmental powers are intertwined, with religious leaders often holding key positions in the government and making decisions based on religious doctrines.\n\nLet me think of some examples to confirm this. For instance, in some Middle Eastern countries, Islamic law, or Sharia, forms the basis of the legal system. Religious courts and clerics play a significant role in governance. Another example could be the Vatican City, where the Pope is both the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the state.\n\nComparing this to the other options:\n\n- Dictatorship: This is more about personal or small-group control, not necessarily tied to religion.\n\n- Democracy: This involves elected representatives and is designed to separate church and state to prevent any one religion from dominating the government.\n\n- Autocracy: Again, similar to dictatorship, it's about one person's rule, not specifically the combination of religion and government.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, B. theocracy seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that there isn't any confusion between these terms. For example, could a dictatorship also be a theocracy? Well, theoretically, yes, but the primary characteristic of a dictatorship is the concentration of power in the hands of a few, not the combination of religion and government. Similarly, an autocracy might have religious influences, but that's not its defining feature.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that some democracies have official state religions or incorporate religious elements into their legal systems, but that's different from a full-blown theocracy where the government is directly controlled by religious authorities.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the best answer is B. theocracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. theocracy}} \\]"
