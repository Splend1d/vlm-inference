                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a cannonball's trajectory. The height of the cannonball at any time \\( t \\) is given by the equation \\( h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 \\), and I need to find out for how long the cannonball is above 6 meters. The answer should be in the form of an improper fraction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The cannonball is shot up, reaches a peak, and then comes back down. I need to find the total time during which its height is above 6 meters.\n\nSo, I should set up the inequality \\( h(t) > 6 \\) and solve for \\( t \\). That means:\n\n\\[\n-4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 > 6\n\\]\n\nI can rearrange this inequality to make it easier to solve. Let's move all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n-4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 - 6 > 0 \\\\\n-4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 > 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, I can first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n-4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 = 0\n\\]\n\nI can use the quadratic formula for this:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = -4.9 \\), \\( b = 14 \\), and \\( c = -6.4 \\). Plugging these values in:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2 - 4(-4.9)(-6.4)}}{2(-4.9)}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant first:\n\n\\[\n14^2 - 4(-4.9)(-6.4) = 196 - 4 \\times 4.9 \\times 6.4\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( 4 \\times 4.9 = 19.6 \\), then \\( 19.6 \\times 6.4 \\):\n\n\\[\n19.6 \\times 6 = 117.6 \\\\\n19.6 \\times 0.4 = 7.84 \\\\\nSo, 117.6 + 7.84 = 125.44\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract this from 196:\n\n\\[\n196 - 125.44 = 70.56\n\\]\n\nSo, the square root of the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{70.56} = 8.4 \\quad (\\text{since } 8.4^2 = 70.56)\n\\]\n\nNow, plugging back into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{-14 \\pm 8.4}{-9.8}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute both possibilities:\n\nFirst, \\( t = \\frac{-14 + 8.4}{-9.8} \\):\n\n\\[\n-14 + 8.4 = -5.6 \\\\\n-5.6 / -9.8 = 5.6 / 9.8\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( 5.6 / 9.8 \\):\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1.4:\n\n\\[\n5.6 / 1.4 = 4 \\\\\n9.8 / 1.4 = 7 \\\\\nSo, t = \\frac{4}{7}\n\\]\n\nSecond, \\( t = \\frac{-14 - 8.4}{-9.8} \\):\n\n\\[\n-14 - 8.4 = -22.4 \\\\\n-22.4 / -9.8 = 22.4 / 9.8\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( 22.4 / 9.8 \\):\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1.4:\n\n\\[\n22.4 / 1.4 = 16 \\\\\n9.8 / 1.4 = 7 \\\\\nSo, t = \\frac{16}{7}\n\\]\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\( t^2 \\) is negative, the quadratic is greater than zero between its roots. Therefore, the cannonball is above 6 meters between \\( t = \\frac{4}{7} \\) and \\( t = \\frac{16}{7} \\) seconds.\n\nTo find the total time it's above 6 meters, I need to subtract the smaller time from the larger one:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{12}{7}\n\\]\n\nLooking at the options, C. \\( \\frac{12}{7} \\) seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I set up the inequality correctly: \\( h(t) > 6 \\).\n\nThen, I rearranged it to \\( -4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 > 0 \\).\n\nI solved the equation \\( -4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula, and got the roots \\( t = \\frac{4}{7} \\) and \\( t = \\frac{16}{7} \\).\n\nSubtracting these gives \\( \\frac{12}{7} \\), which is one of the options.\n\nHowever, I should confirm if the quadratic is indeed greater than zero between the roots.\n\nSince the coefficient of \\( t^2 \\) is negative (-4.9), the quadratic opens downwards, meaning it's positive between the roots and negative outside.\n\nTherefore, the cannonball is above 6 meters between \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) and \\( \\frac{16}{7} \\) seconds, inclusive.\n\nThe duration above 6 meters is \\( \\frac{16}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{12}{7} \\) seconds.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. \\( \\frac{12}{7} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{12}{7}} \\]"
