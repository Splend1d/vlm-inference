                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about Teotihuac\u00e1n, the ancient city in Mexico. The question is asking who gave the city its name. The options are:\n\nA. The Aztecs, who continued to make pilgrimages there long after its collapse.\n\nB. The Spanish invaders, who largely destroyed it.\n\nC. The city's first king, who named it after his favorite deity.\n\nD. Olmec traders, who were impressed with its grandeur.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what I learned about Teotihuac\u00e1n. I remember that Teotihuac\u00e1n was an ancient Mesoamerican city, one of the largest in pre-Columbian America. It's famous for its massive pyramids, like the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon.\n\nNow, about the name. Teotihuac\u00e1n is a Nahuatl word, and Nahuatl was the language spoken by the Aztecs. So, that makes me think that the Aztecs might have been the ones to name it Teotihuac\u00e1n.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The name Teotihuac\u00e1n translates to \"place where the gods were created\" or \"place of the creation of the gods.\" That sounds like a name that would be given by a people who revered the site as sacred.\n\nThe Aztecs, also known as the Mexica, rose to prominence centuries after Teotihuac\u00e1n had declined and was abandoned. They considered Teotihuac\u00e1n to be a sacred place and made pilgrimages there, believing it was the place where the gods created the sun and the moon.\n\nOn the other hand, the Spanish invaders arrived much later, after the Aztecs had been ruling the region. The Spanish did cause significant destruction to many Mesoamerican sites, including Teotihuac\u00e1n, but I don't recall them renaming it.\n\nThe city's first king, option C, might have given it an original name, but I don't think it was Teotihuac\u00e1n. That seems more like a name that would have been applied later by the Aztecs.\n\nAs for the Olmec traders, they were from the Gulf Coast region and were active before the time of Teotihuac\u00e1n. They were known for their advanced civilization and massive stone heads, but I don't remember them being involved with Teotihuac\u00e1n directly.\n\nSo, based on what I know, option A seems the most plausible. The Aztecs gave the city the name Teotihuac\u00e1n, and they continued to make pilgrimages there even after its collapse.\n\nLet me just double-check this. I recall that the original name of the city is unknown; the Aztecs called it Teotihuac\u00e1n, which means \"place of the gods\" or something similar. Modern scholars use this name as well, even though it's not the original name.\n\nSo, yes, it was the Aztecs who named it Teotihuac\u00e1n, long after the city had been abandoned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. the Aztecs, who continued to make pilgrimages there long after its collapse.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
