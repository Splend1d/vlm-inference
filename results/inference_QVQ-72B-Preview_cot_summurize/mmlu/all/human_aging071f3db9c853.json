The question is asking about a problem in comparing these two types of memories, specifically focusing on recent events. The options are:\n\nA. May be very well rehearsed\n\nB. Are far more meaningful\n\nC. Have no denominator to help in computing an average\n\nD. Can be verified while older events often cannot\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is getting at. It's about comparing older adults' memory for recent events versus events that happened a long time ago. The focus is on recent events and why they might pose a problem in this comparison.\n\nOption A says recent events may be very well rehearsed. That makes sense because recent events are fresher in mind, and people might think about them more often, which could lead to better recall. But is this a problem for comparison? Maybe, because if recent events are better rehearsed, their memory might seem better even if the actual memory isn't inherently better.\n\nOption B says recent events are far more meaningful. Hmm, that could be a factor. If recent events are more meaningful, they might be easier to remember. But is this necessarily true? Not all recent events are meaningful, and some older events might be very meaningful. So, I'm not sure if this is a universal truth.\n\nOption C mentions having no denominator to help in computing an average. This one is a bit confusing. In the context of memory, I'm not sure what a \"denominator\" would refer to. Maybe it's about the number of events or something, but that doesn't seem directly applicable here. Perhaps this option is a bit of a stretch.\n\nOption D says recent events can be verified while older events often cannot. This seems relevant. Recent events might be easier to verify because the context is still clear, and there might be more evidence or witnesses available. Older events, on the other hand, might be harder to verify due to fading memories or unavailable evidence. This could be a significant problem in comparing memory accuracy over time.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this more carefully. If recent events can be verified, that might actually help in assessing the accuracy of memory, not pose a problem. Unless, perhaps, the verifiability leads to overconfidence in the memory's accuracy, but that seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that older events cannot be verified, which makes it difficult to assess whether the memory is accurate or not. But again, if recent events can be verified, that seems advantageous for studying memory.\n\nI think I need to consider the context more carefully. The question is about comparing older adults' memory for recent events and events that happened a long time ago. The issue is likely related to the reliability or validity of recalling these events.\n\nLet me consider each option again in this light.\n\nOption A: Recent events may be very well rehearsed. If recent events are rehearsed more, their memory might appear better, which could lead to an overestimation of memory capabilities for recent events compared to older ones. This could be a problem in comparing the two.\n\nOption B: Recent events are far more meaningful. If this were the case, it could lead to better recall, but as I thought earlier, not all recent events are necessarily more meaningful than older ones. So, this might not be a universal problem.\n\nOption C: Have no denominator to help in computing an average. I'm still not sure about this one. Maybe it's referring to the lack of a baseline or a standard to measure against. But that seems too abstract for this context.\n\nOption D: Can be verified while older events often cannot. This seems like it could be a double-edged sword. On one hand, verifiability helps in assessing memory accuracy for recent events. On the other hand, the inability to verify older events makes it harder to assess their accuracy. So, in comparison, this could be a problem because you can't directly compare verified recent memories with unverified older ones.\n\nBut perhaps the key issue here is that recent events can be verified, which might lead to overconfidence in their recall, whereas older events, being harder to verify, might be recalled with less certainty. This discrepancy could complicate comparisons of memory abilities over time.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem is that recent events can be verified, leading researchers or individuals to have more confidence in those memories, even if that confidence isn't warranted. Conversely, older events cannot be verified, leading to doubts about their accuracy. This difference in verifiability could introduce bias in comparing memory performance for recent versus older events.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check. Option A suggests that recent events are better rehearsed, which could lead to better recall, potentially masking any age-related declines in memory. This could also be a problem in comparing memory abilities, as it might make recent memory seem better than it actually is.\n\nOption B, about meaningfulness, seems less likely, as not all recent events are inherently more meaningful than older ones.\n\nOption C is still unclear, so I'll set it aside.\n\nBetween options A and D, both seem plausible, but perhaps option D is more directly related to the problem of verification, which affects the assessment of memory accuracy.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose an older adult recalls a recent event with high detail and it can be verified as accurate. They also recall an event from 30 years ago with similar detail, but there's no way to verify its accuracy. In this case, the recent event's memory seems better because it's verifiable, but the older event might be just as well remembered, even if it can't be verified.\n\nThis suggests that the ability to verify recent events could lead to an overestimation of recent memory capabilities compared to older memories, which might not be verifiable. Therefore, this could be a problem in comparing the two.\n\nOn the other hand, if recent events are better rehearsed, that could also lead to an overestimation of recent memory abilities, as the frequent rehearsal makes them easier to recall.\n\nHowever, I think option D is more directly related to the issue of verifying memory accuracy, which is crucial in comparing memory performances over time.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option D as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
