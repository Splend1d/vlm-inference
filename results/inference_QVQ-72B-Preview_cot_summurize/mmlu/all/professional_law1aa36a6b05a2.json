Record-keeping and inspection procedures were required to assure accurate reporting by the vehicle owner. The promotion was widely publicized. A female customer purchased a hybrid model during the promotion period, followed all the rules, and recorded only 42 mpg in the first 60 days. She demanded the rebate but the company stalled for months and then stopped responding to her inquiries. Does she have a contractual right to collect the $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.\nB. No, this was merely puffing, was not an offer to contract with any particular person and was without consideration.\nC. Yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.\nD.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there's this auto retailer that advertised a promo for their new hybrid car. They said that if you buy the car in 2013 and don't get at least 50 miles per gallon in the first 60 days, they'll give you $10,000 cash. The customer bought the car, followed all the rules, and only got 42 mpg in the first 60 days. Now, she's trying to get her $10,000, but the company is stalling and not responding. The question is, does she have a contractual right to collect the $10,000?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of contract this is. The options are bilateral and unilateral contracts. From what I remember, a bilateral contract is when both parties exchange promises. For example, one party promises to do something if the other party promises to do something else in return. On the other hand, a unilateral contract is when one party makes an offer that can be accepted by performing an act. So, in this case, the retailer made an offer: if you buy the car and don't get 50 mpg in the first 60 days, you get $10,000. The customer accepted this offer by buying the car and following the rules, and she performed the act of recording the mileage.\n\nOption A says yes, it's a bilateral contract, and the company has to live up to its promises. But wait, in a bilateral contract, both sides exchange promises. Here, the customer didn't promise anything; she just performed the act of buying the car and recording the mileage. So, maybe it's not a bilateral contract.\n\nOption B says no, it was just puffing, which is exaggerated advertising, and it wasn't a real offer to contract with anyone, and there was no consideration. Hmm, puffing is when companies make exaggerated claims in their ads that aren't meant to be taken literally. But in this case, the retailer specified a clear condition: if you don't get 50 mpg in the first 60 days, you get $10,000. That sounds pretty specific and measurable. Also, there is consideration from the customer's side\u2014she bought the car and followed the rules. So, maybe this isn't just puffing.\n\nOption C says yes, it's a unilateral contract because the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms, thus creating a binding contract. This seems to align with what I thought earlier. The retailer made an offer that could be accepted by performing the act of buying the car and recording the mileage. Since the customer did that, and the conditions were met (she got less than 50 mpg), then the company should be bound to pay the $10,000.\n\nOption D says no, because she didn't formally notify the company that she was accepting the offer before she started performing. But in unilateral contracts, acceptance is typically by performance, not by separate acceptance communication. So, as long as she performed the act (buying the car and recording the mileage), that should be sufficient acceptance.\n\nLet me think about this again. The retailer made a public offer: buy the car in 2013, follow the rules, and if you don't get 50 mpg in the first 60 days, you get $10,000. The customer did all that. In unilateral contracts, the offer is accepted by performing the act specified in the offer. Here, the act was buying the car and recording the mileage. She did both, and the conditions were met (42 mpg is less than 50 mpg). Therefore, the contract should be binding, and the company should have to pay her the $10,000.\n\nBut wait, option A mentions a bilateral contract, which seems similar, but I think it's more accurate to categorize this as a unilateral contract because the offer was to pay money upon the customer performing a specific act, not exchanging promises.\n\nAlso, considering that the offer was widely publicized and open to anyone who bought the car in 2013, it's similar to a unilateral offer that can be accepted by anyone who performs the specified act.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C: yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other angle. Maybe the company could argue that the offer was revocable before performance, but in this case, the customer has already performed the act, and the conditions were met. Also, the company might claim that the record-keeping and inspection procedures were not adequately followed, but the problem states that she followed all the rules and recorded only 42 mpg.\n\nMoreover, the promotion was widely publicized, and the terms were clear and specific, so it's not just puffing. There was a clear offer with specific conditions that were met by the customer.\n\nTherefore, the customer has a contractual right to collect the $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
