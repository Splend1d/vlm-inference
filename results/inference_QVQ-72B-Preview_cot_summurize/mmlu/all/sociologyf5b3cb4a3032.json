It involves working remotely, often from home, and using information technology to communicate and collaborate with colleagues and clients.\n\nLet's look at each option to see which one best describes telework:\n\nA. Running one's own business through telephone helplines or hotlines.\n\nWhile this involves working from home and using technology like telephones, telework is typically associated with working for an employer rather than running one's own business. Helplines and hotlines are specific types of services, whereas telework can encompass a wide range of jobs.\n\nB. Working at home for an outside employer, using information technology.\n\nThis seems to align closely with the definition of telework. It involves working remotely from home for an employer and utilizing information technology to perform job duties.\n\nC. Babysitting and other jobs within a local network, through the informal economy.\n\nThis option refers to informal work, such as babysitting, which is not typically considered telework. Telework is generally associated with formal employment arrangements, often involving the use of technology to work remotely.\n\nD. Combining non-manual work with the leisure activity of watching television.\n\nThis option suggests combining work with leisure activities, which is not accurate. Telework is about performing job responsibilities remotely, not combining work with leisure time.\n\nBased on the definitions and common understanding of telework, option B seems to be the most accurate description.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, let's consider some key characteristics of telework:\n\n1. **Remote Work:** Telework involves working from a location away from the employer's office, often from home.\n\n2. **Use of Technology:** Information and communication technology (ICT) is essential for telework, enabling tasks such as video conferencing, email, and access to shared documents.\n\n3. **Employment Relationship:** Telework is typically part of a formal employment arrangement between an employer and employee.\n\nGiven these points, option B directly corresponds to these characteristics: working at home for an outside employer using information technology.\n\nOption A, while involving working from home and using technology, describes running one's own business, which is different from being employed by someone else.\n\nOption C refers to informal economy activities, which are generally not considered telework, as they lack the formal employment structure and typically do not involve the use of information technology in the same way.\n\nOption D misrepresents telework by suggesting it involves combining work with leisure activities, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: working at home for an outside employer, using information technology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
