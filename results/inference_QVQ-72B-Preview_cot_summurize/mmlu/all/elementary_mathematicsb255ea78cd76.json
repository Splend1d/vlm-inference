                    "text": "So Westview School is buying new basketball uniforms, and each uniform costs $46. They're going to buy 12 of these uniforms, and I need to find out the total cost. The problem gives me four equations and asks which one shows a way to find the total cost correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the total cost is simply the cost per uniform multiplied by the number of uniforms. So, total cost = cost per uniform \u00d7 number of uniforms. Plugging in the numbers, that should be $46 \u00d7 12.\n\nNow, $46 can be broken down into $40 + $6, right? So, if I think about multiplying $46 by 12, I can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. That means I can multiply $40 by 12 and then $6 by 12, and add those two results together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal cost = ($40 + $6) \u00d7 12\n\nUsing the distributive property:\n\nTotal cost = ($40 \u00d7 12) + ($6 \u00d7 12)\n\nNow, let's calculate each part:\n\n$40 \u00d7 12 = $480\n\n$6 \u00d7 12 = $72\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n$480 + $72 = $552\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. (40 \u00d7 10) + (6 \u00d7 2) = 400 + 12\n\nB. (40 \u00d7 6) + (10 \u00d7 2) = 240 + 20\n\nC. (40 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 72\n\nD. (40 \u00d7 12) + (60 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 720\n\nOption C matches exactly what I just calculated: ($40 \u00d7 12) + ($6 \u00d7 12) = $480 + $72.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check option D. It says (40 \u00d7 12) + (60 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 720. Hmm, that seems off because $46 is $40 + $6, not $40 + $60. So, why would they have $60 there? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me see, maybe they're breaking it down differently. But no, $46 is $40 + $6, not $40 + $60. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nOption A is (40 \u00d7 10) + (6 \u00d7 2) = 400 + 12. Wait, that doesn't seem right. If I break $46 into $40 and $6, and 12 uniforms into, say, 10 and 2, then it would be ($40 \u00d7 10) + ($40 \u00d7 2) + ($6 \u00d7 10) + ($6 \u00d7 2). But option A only has two terms: (40 \u00d7 10) + (6 \u00d7 2). That doesn't account for all parts of $46 and 12 uniforms.\n\nOption B is (40 \u00d7 6) + (10 \u00d7 2) = 240 + 20. Again, this doesn't seem to correctly represent the total cost. It's missing parts of the total calculation.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the correct way to calculate the total cost by breaking $46 into $40 and $6 and multiplying each by 12, then adding the results.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check another way to approach this. Maybe breaking down 12 uniforms into smaller numbers. For example, 12 uniforms can be thought of as 10 uniforms plus 2 uniforms. So, total cost = (46 \u00d7 10) + (46 \u00d7 2).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n46 \u00d7 10 = 460\n\n46 \u00d7 2 = 92\n\nSo, 460 + 92 = 552\n\nThis matches the previous total of $552.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply 46 \u00d7 12 directly, but since the problem is asking for an equation that shows a way to find the total cost, and all options involve breaking down the multiplication, I think the best answer is option C.\n\nMoreover, option C directly applies the distributive property, which is a standard method for simplifying multiplication, especially with larger numbers.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation that shows a way to find the total cost of the uniforms is:\n\n(40 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 72\n\nWhich is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
