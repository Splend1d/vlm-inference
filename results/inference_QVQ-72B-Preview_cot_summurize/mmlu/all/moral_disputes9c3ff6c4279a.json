                    "text": " So I'm reading this question about Macedo's views on the duties societies have toward nonmembers. There are four options: A. duties of fair dealing (like not exploiting people), B. cosmopolitan egalitarian duties (making sure everyone has equal wealth), C. duties of rectification and redress (fixing things for people who were oppressed), and D. humanitarian duties (stopping really bad things like human rights violations). The question is asking which one of these Macedo doesn't mention as a duty societies have toward nonmembers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Macedo is saying about duties to nonmembers. From the options, it seems like he's discussing different types of responsibilities that societies might have towards people who are not part of their own society. So, nonmembers are basically people from other societies or maybe individuals who aren't citizens of that particular country.\n\nOption A talks about duties of fair dealing, like not exploiting people. That sounds pretty basic. I would think that most ethical theories would include not taking advantage of others, whether they're members of your society or not.\n\nOption B is about cosmopolitan egalitarian duties, which seem to be about making sure that everyone, regardless of where they live, has equal wealth. That's a pretty ambitious goal. It's about distributing resources equally across the world.\n\nOption C mentions duties of rectification and redress, meaning fixing things for people who have been oppressed. This could be about making amends for past wrongs or helping those who are currently being oppressed.\n\nOption D is about humanitarian duties, which involve preventing systematic violations of human rights. This is about intervening when basic human rights are being violated somewhere in the world.\n\nNow, the question is to identify which of these duties Macedo does not mention as something societies have toward nonmembers.\n\nI need to recall what Macedo has said about this. I remember that Macedo is a political philosopher who has written about international justice and the obligations of states to each other and to noncitizens.\n\nLet me think about his position. He might argue that societies have certain duties to nonmembers based on different theoretical approaches. For example, he might accept some duties but reject others.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Duties of fair dealing: This seems quite fundamental. It's about basic moral principles like not exploiting others. I doubt Macedo would disagree with this.\n\nB. Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties: This is more controversial. Some philosophers argue for a global distribution of resources, while others think that primary obligations are to one's own society.\n\nC. Duties of rectification and redress: This is about addressing historical injustices or current oppression. It's a significant commitment but one that many would consider important.\n\nD. Humanitarian duties: This is about preventing ongoing human rights abuses. It's a duty that is widely recognized in international law and ethics.\n\nGiven that, I need to figure out which of these Macedo does not include in his list of duties to nonmembers.\n\nPerhaps he doesn't accept the idea of cosmopolitan egalitarian duties, meaning ensuring equal wealth for everyone. That seems like a strong position, and it might not be universally accepted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he thinks that duties of fair dealing and humanitarian duties are sufficient, and additional duties like rectification and redress or cosmopolitan egalitarianism are not necessary.\n\nWait, but the question specifies \"nonmembers.\" That could refer to noncitizens or people from other societies.\n\nI should consider the context in which Macedo is discussing these duties. If he's talking about international obligations, then duties to nonmembers would be duties to other states or to individuals in other states.\n\nLet me consider his stance on distributive justice. Does he advocate for a global distribution of resources or does he think that distribution should primarily be within states?\n\nI think Macedo is more inclined towards the idea that primary obligations are to one's own society, but there are still some duties to nonmembers.\n\nGiven that, he might accept duties of fair dealing and humanitarian duties, but not necessarily cosmopolitan egalitarian duties or duties of rectification and redress.\n\nBut that's just a guess. I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA. Duties of fair dealing: This is about not exploiting others. It's a minimal moral requirement. I can't see Macedo disagreeing with this.\n\nB. Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties: This is about equalizing wealth globally. This is a much stronger commitment and might not be part of Macedo's view.\n\nC. Duties of rectification and redress: This involves making amends for past wrongs. This could be seen as a form of restorative justice, which Macedo might support, depending on the context.\n\nD. Humanitarian duties: Preventing human rights violations is a widely accepted duty, especially in international law.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B. Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties. Macedo likely does not include ensuring that everyone has equal wealth as a duty that societies have toward nonmembers.\n\nBut to be sure, I should think about whether there's any other option that Macedo might also not mention.\n\nOption C, duties of rectification and redress, seems important for addressing historical injustices. Macedo might support this, especially if the injustices were a result of actions by his own society.\n\nOption D, humanitarian duties, is about preventing ongoing suffering and rights violations. This seems like a duty that many would accept.\n\nOption A, duties of fair dealing, is so basic that it's hard to imagine anyone disagreeing with it.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is B. Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties. Macedo does not mention ensuring equal wealth for everyone as a duty that societies have toward nonmembers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
