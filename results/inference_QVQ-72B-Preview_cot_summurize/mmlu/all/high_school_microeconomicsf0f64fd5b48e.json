                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about who pays the burden of an excise tax placed on a producer. It's asking which scenario would result in consumers paying the largest burden, given different combinations of demand and supply elasticity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an excise tax is. An excise tax is a tax levied on the production or sale of a good, usually paid by the producer. But often, the burden of this tax can be shifted to consumers in the form of higher prices. So, depending on the elasticities of demand and supply, the burden can be shared between producers and consumers.\n\nI recall that elasticity measures how much quantity demanded or supplied responds to a change in price. If demand is elastic, a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded. If demand is inelastic, a change in price doesn't affect quantity demanded much. The same logic applies to supply elasticity.\n\nNow, the question is about the largest burden on consumers. That means consumers are bearing most of the tax burden, either through higher prices or reduced consumption.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Demand is price elastic, and supply is price inelastic.\n\nIf demand is elastic, consumers are sensitive to price changes. If the price goes up because of the tax, they'll buy much less. So, the quantity sold decreases significantly, and the tax burden is shared between producers and consumers, but possibly more on producers because supply is inelastic, meaning producers can't easily adjust their supply in response to the tax.\n\nWait, if supply is inelastic, producers can't easily increase supply even if the price goes up due to the tax. So, they might have to absorb more of the tax rather than pass it on to consumers. So, in this case, consumers might not bear the largest burden.\n\nB. Demand is price elastic, and supply is perfectly elastic.\n\nPerfectly elastic supply means that suppliers will supply any amount at a given price. If demand is elastic, consumers are sensitive to price changes. If the producer passes on the tax to consumers by raising prices, consumers will buy much less. So, again, the burden is shared, but with perfectly elastic supply, producers can't pass on the entire tax to consumers because consumers will leave at the slightest price increase.\n\nSo, in this scenario, producers might have to absorb more of the tax to prevent consumers from drastically reducing their purchases.\n\nC. Demand is price inelastic, and supply is price elastic.\n\nIf demand is inelastic, consumers are not very sensitive to price changes. So, if producers pass on the tax by raising prices, consumers won't reduce their quantity demanded much. They'll still buy almost the same amount even at higher prices.\n\nOn the other hand, supply is elastic, meaning suppliers can adjust their supply in response to price changes. If the price goes up due to the tax, suppliers might supply more, but since demand is inelastic, consumers won't buy much more despite the higher supply.\n\nIn this case, because consumers don't reduce their demand much when prices go up, they end up paying more for the product without significantly reducing their consumption. So, they bear a larger portion of the tax burden.\n\nD. Demand is perfectly inelastic, and supply is price elastic.\n\nPerfectly inelastic demand means that no matter how much the price changes, the quantity demanded remains the same. So, if the producer passes on the entire tax by raising prices, consumers will still buy the same amount.\n\nIn this case, consumers are completely insensitive to the price increase, so they end up paying the full amount of the tax through higher prices.\n\nSo, comparing options C and D:\n\nIn option C, demand is inelastic but not perfectly inelastic. So, there might be some slight reduction in quantity demanded if the price increases due to the tax. Whereas in option D, demand is perfectly inelastic, meaning quantity demanded doesn't change at all with price changes.\n\nTherefore, in option D, consumers would bear the entire tax burden because they won't reduce their consumption even if prices go up.\n\nIn option C, there would be some reduction in quantity demanded, so producers might have to absorb part of the tax to prevent a larger drop in sales.\n\nSo, it seems like option D would result in consumers paying the largest burden of the tax.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers will pay whatever price is charged for the same quantity. So, if the producer passes on the entire tax through higher prices, consumers have no choice but to pay it.\n\nIn contrast, if demand is just inelastic (not perfectly), there is still some, though limited, responsiveness to price changes. So, consumers might slightly reduce their quantity demanded if prices go up, meaning producers would have to consider absorbing some of the tax to prevent losing those customers.\n\nTherefore, in option D, with perfectly inelastic demand, consumers would bear the entire tax burden, whereas in option C, with inelastic but not perfectly inelastic demand, consumers would bear a significant but not the entire tax burden.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the largest burden,\" not \"the entire burden.\" So, could there be a scenario where consumers bear a larger burden than in option D?\n\nNo, in option D, consumers bear the entire burden, which is the maximum possible.\n\nIn option C, they bear a significant burden but not the entire one.\n\nIn options A and B, with elastic demand, consumers are more responsive to price changes, so they would bear a smaller portion of the tax burden.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
