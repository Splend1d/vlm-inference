                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about Ross's prima facie duties. The options are fidelity, beneficence, non-maleficence, and legality. I need to figure out which one of these isn't considered one of Ross's prima facie duties.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a prima facie duty is. From what I recall, prima facie duties are duties that appear to be obligatory at first glance, but which might be overridden by more important duties in certain situations. So, they're not absolute duties, but they're still important moral guidelines.\n\nNow, Ross is known for his theory of pluralistic deontology, where he identifies several prima facie duties that can come into conflict with one another. Some of the duties he lists include fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, and self-improvement.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Fidelity \u2013 that sounds like keeping promises or being loyal. I think Ross considers this a prima facie duty.\n\nB. Beneficence \u2013 which is about doing good to others. I remember this being one of his duties.\n\nC. Non-maleficence \u2013 this is about not harming others. Also, I think, a prima facie duty according to Ross.\n\nD. Legality \u2013 this is about following laws and regulations. But I don't recall Ross listing obedience to law as a prima facie duty.\n\nWait a minute, maybe legality isn't one of his primary duties. Let me think again. Ross's list doesn't include legality as a separate prima facie duty. Instead, his duties are more focused on moral obligations like keeping promises, repaying debts, expressing gratitude, acting justly, helping others, avoiding harm, and improving oneself.\n\nLegality, on the other hand, seems more related to following the law, which can vary from society to society and might not always align with moral duties. In fact, Ross might argue that sometimes, moral duties conflict with legal requirements, and in such cases, the moral duty takes precedence.\n\nSo, perhaps legality isn't considered a prima facie duty by Ross. That would make sense because his focus is on moral duties rather than legal ones.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I look back at Ross's list of prima facie duties, which includes fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, and self-improvement, legality isn't among them. So, that seems to confirm my thought.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Legality, as it's not one of Ross's prima facie duties.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any way legality could be interpreted as a prima facie duty in Ross's framework. For example, perhaps following the law is seen as a derivative of other duties, like justice or non-maleficence. But I don't think that's the case. Ross doesn't equate legality with morality; he acknowledges that laws can be immoral.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D. Legality is not one of Ross's prima facie duties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
