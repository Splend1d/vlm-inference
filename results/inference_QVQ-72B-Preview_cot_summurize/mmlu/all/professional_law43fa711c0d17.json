                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a business that bought a computer from a seller's website, and now there's a dispute about whether the purchaser has to go to arbitration instead of going to court. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the business bought a computer from the seller's website. On the purchase form, there was a prominent hyperlink to another page that had \"important additional terms and conditions of sale.\" But the purchaser didn't look at that page. So, they probably didn't read those additional terms.\n\nThen, when the product was delivered, it came with the additional terms in writing, and there was a bold-lettered notice saying that if the purchaser didn't accept those terms and conditions, they had to return the product within 30 days. But the purchaser didn't return it; instead, after 35 days, they decided they were dissatisfied with the computer and sued the seller for breach of contract.\n\nNow, the seller is saying, \"Wait a minute, there's a term in those additional conditions that says any dispute has to be resolved by private arbitration.\" So, the seller is demanding that the dispute be arbitrated, not litigated in court.\n\nThe question is, is the purchaser legally bound to participate in arbitration?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.\n\nB. Yes, because federal law requires that arbitration must be used to attempt an initial resolution with respect to sales that take place on the internet.\n\nC. No, because there was no contract formed due to the purchaser's lack of assent to the additional terms and conditions.\n\nD. No, because federal law requires that a company give 90 days for return and the 30-day provision was null and void.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: It says that by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions. So, the idea here is that the purchaser had a chance to reject the terms by returning the product within 30 days, but since they didn't, they accepted the terms by their actions.\n\nThat seems plausible. It's like an implied acceptance. If someone sends you goods and says, \"If you don't return them within a certain time, you're agreeing to buy them,\" that can be a way to create a contract.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the terms were presented both online and with the delivered product. Did the purchaser have actual notice of these terms? They might argue that they didn't see the hyperlink on the purchase form and didn't read the terms when the product was delivered.\n\nHowever, the notice was in bold letters, and generally, if terms are presented in a conspicuous manner, the purchaser has a duty to read them, especially if there's a condition about returning the product if they don't agree.\n\nSo, by not returning the product within 30 days, the purchaser may have waived their right to object to the terms and are therefore bound by them, including the arbitration clause.\n\nMoving on to option B: It says yes, because federal law requires that arbitration must be used to attempt an initial resolution with respect to sales that take place on the internet.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about this one. There are laws that promote arbitration, like the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which generally enforces arbitration agreements in contracts involving interstate commerce. But I don't think there's a federal law that specifically requires arbitration for internet sales.\n\nMaybe the person who wrote this option was thinking of the FAA, which favors enforcement of arbitration clauses, but that's not the same as saying federal law requires arbitration for internet sales.\n\nSo, I think option B is incorrect because it's based on a misunderstanding of federal law.\n\nOption C: No, because there was no contract formed due to the purchaser's lack of assent to the additional terms and conditions.\n\nThis is an interesting point. If the purchaser didn't agree to the additional terms, then maybe there's no valid contract, and therefore the arbitration clause isn't enforceable.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, the purchaser was given clear notice of the terms both online and with the delivered product, and had an opportunity to reject them by returning the product within 30 days. Since they didn't return it within that period, it could be argued that they accepted the terms by their failure to reject them.\n\nHowever, there might be an argument that the purchaser didn't have actual knowledge of the terms, especially if they didn't see the hyperlink or read the terms when the product was delivered. Without actual knowledge, there might not be a meeting of the minds, which is necessary for a contract.\n\nBut, in practice, courts often hold that if terms are presented in a reasonable manner, the purchaser has a duty to know them, and by proceeding without objection, they accept them.\n\nSo, while there's some merit to option C, I think the better view is that the purchaser did assent to the terms by not returning the product within the specified time.\n\nOption D: No, because federal law requires that a company give 90 days for return and the 30-day provision was null and void.\n\nThis seems like another misunderstanding. There's no federal law that I know of that requires a 90-day return period for all internet sales. Some consumer protection laws might set minimum standards for returns, but they vary by state and type of product.\n\nMoreover, even if there were such a law, it wouldn't necessarily invalidate the 30-day provision; it might just extend the return period.\n\nBut since I don't think there's a federal law mandating a 90-day return period, this option seems incorrect.\n\nSo, between options A, B, C, and D, option A seems the most plausible.\n\nBut let me think about this differently. Suppose the purchaser claims they never saw the additional terms, either online or with the product. Can the seller still enforce the arbitration clause?\n\nWell, enforceability of contract terms, including arbitration clauses, depends on whether the terms were part of the agreement between the parties.\n\nIn this case, the terms were presented both online via a hyperlink and with the delivered product, along with a clear notice that acceptance of the terms is required within 30 days, otherwise the product should be returned.\n\nIf the purchaser kept the product beyond 30 days without objecting to the terms, it could be seen as acceptance of the terms by conduct.\n\nAdditionally, the arbitration clause is part of the additional terms, and if those terms were sufficiently brought to the purchaser's attention, the clause should be enforceable.\n\nBut what if the purchaser argues that they didn't have a reasonable opportunity to review the terms, or that the terms were not conspicuous enough?\n\nWell, the terms were presented via a prominent hyperlink on the purchase form and again in writing with the delivered product. That seems like reasonable efforts to bring the terms to the purchaser's attention.\n\nMoreover, the bold-lettered notice about the 30-day acceptance period further emphasizes the importance of reviewing the terms.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that a court would find that the purchaser had sufficient notice of the terms and, by not returning the product within 30 days, accepted them, including the arbitration clause.\n\nSo, the answer is yes, the purchaser is legally bound to participate in arbitration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
