Lj\n\nC. Cj \u2228 Lj\n\nD. Lx\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each of these symbols might represent in predicate logic.\n\nPredicate logic is a formal system in logic where predicates can be applied to individuals or subjects to form statements. It typically involves variables, predicates, and quantifiers.\n\nIn the given options, it seems like there are predicates and possibly variables or constants representing individuals.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. jL\n\nHere, \"j\" might be a constant representing Johnny, and \"L\" is likely a predicate meaning \"came late.\" So, jL would mean \"Johnny came late.\" This seems straightforward and directly translates the sentence.\n\nB. Lj\n\nThis looks similar to A, but the order is reversed. In predicate logic, the predicate usually comes before the subject (especially in functional notation). So, Lj could be interpreted as \"late came Johnny,\" which is grammatically different from the original sentence, but semantically it might be the same if we consider \"L\" as the predicate \"came late.\"\n\nC. Cj \u2228 Lj\n\nThis option has a disjunction (\u2228), which means \"or.\" So, it's saying \"Cj or Lj.\" Here, \"Cj\" might represent \"came Johnny\" or \"Johnny came,\" and \"Lj\" as before, \"Johnny came late.\" But this seems a bit confusing because \"Cj\" isn't clear. If \"C\" is a predicate meaning \"came,\" then Cj would mean \"Johnny came,\" and Lj means \"Johnny came late.\" So, Cj \u2228 Lj would mean \"Johnny came or Johnny came late.\" This is not the same as just saying \"Johnny came late.\"\n\nD. Lx\n\nHere, \"L\" is likely the predicate \"came late,\" and \"x\" is a variable. This would mean \"x came late,\" where x is an unspecified individual. Since the sentence is about Johnny, this is too general and doesn't specify who came late.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the most direct and accurate translation of \"Johnny came late\" into predicate logic.\n\nWait a minute, in standard predicate logic, the convention is to have the predicate followed by the subject, like L(j), where L is the predicate \"came late\" and j is the constant \"Johnny.\" However, in some texts, especially in computer science, you might see jL used interchangeably.\n\nBut to be precise, the correct representation should be L(j), meaning the predicate L applied to the constant j.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. jL\n\nThis might be an abbreviation for L(j), but strictly speaking, in standard predicate logic, it should be L(j).\n\nB. Lj\n\nThis could also be interpreted as L(j), but the order is reversed compared to standard notation.\n\nC. Cj \u2228 Lj\n\nThis seems to be combining two predicates, which doesn't align well with the original sentence.\n\nD. Lx\n\nThis is too general, as x is not specified.\n\nTherefore, none of the options perfectly match the standard predicate logic form of L(j). However, among the given choices, option A (jL) is the closest to representing \"Johnny came late\" in predicate logic, assuming that j represents Johnny and L represents \"came late.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider the context or the specific notation used in the course or book from which this question comes. Sometimes, different texts use different conventions.\n\nFor example, in some logical systems, Lj could mean \"j is late,\" where L is a predicate meaning \"is late,\" and j is Johnny. But in that case, \"came late\" would need to be represented differently, perhaps as C(j) & L(j), where C(j) means \"Johnny came\" and L(j) means \"Johnny is late.\"\n\nHowever, that seems overly complicated for the given sentence, which is simply stating that Johnny came late.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I still think that option A is the best choice, even if it's not perfectly standard notation.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write it in standard predicate logic, I would use L(j), which is not present in the options. Since it's not an option, I have to choose among A, B, C, and D.\n\nOption B, Lj, might also be interpreted as L(j), depending on the convention used.\n\nOption C, Cj \u2228 Lj, seems to be trying to say \"Johnny came or Johnny came late,\" which is not equivalent to just \"Johnny came late.\"\n\nOption D, Lx, is too vague since x is not specified.\n\nBetween options A and B, both could be interpreted as L(j), with A being jL and B being Lj.\n\nIn mathematical logic, it's more common to write the predicate followed by the argument in parentheses, like L(j). However, in some logical systems, especially in philosophy or linguistics, you might see variations.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I would select option A as the best translation into predicate logic for \"Johnny came late.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
