                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about ionized isotopes moving in a magnetic field. They're all projected with the same speed into a uniform magnetic field, and their initial velocity is perpendicular to the field. I need to figure out which combination of mass and charge will result in the largest radius for the circular path they make.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a charged particle moves in a magnetic field. I remember that when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it experiences a Lorentz force that makes it move in a circular path. The radius of this path depends on the particle's mass, its charge, its velocity, and the strength of the magnetic field.\n\nThe formula for the radius of this circular path is:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{mv}{qB} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle,\n\n- \\(v\\) is its velocity,\n\n- \\(q\\) is its charge,\n\n- \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength.\n\nIn this problem, all the isotopes are projected with the same speed, so \\(v\\) is the same for all of them. The magnetic field \\(B\\) is uniform, so that's also the same for all cases. Therefore, the radius of the path depends on the mass and the charge of the isotope.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. m = 16 u, q = \u20135 e\n\nB. m = 17 u, q = \u20134 e\n\nC. m = 18 u, q = \u20133 e\n\nD. m = 20 u, q = \u20131 e\n\nI need to calculate \\( r = \\frac{mv}{qB} \\) for each option. Since \\(v\\) and \\(B\\) are the same for all, I can focus on the ratio of \\(m\\) to \\(q\\).\n\nSo, effectively, I need to find which option has the largest value of \\( \\frac{m}{q} \\), because \\( r \\) is directly proportional to \\( \\frac{m}{q} \\).\n\nLet's calculate \\( \\frac{m}{q} \\) for each option:\n\nA. \\( \\frac{16}{5} = 3.2 \\)\n\nB. \\( \\frac{17}{4} = 4.25 \\)\n\nC. \\( \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\)\n\nD. \\( \\frac{20}{1} = 20 \\)\n\nFrom these calculations, option D has the largest \\( \\frac{m}{q} \\) ratio, which means it should have the largest radius.\n\nBut wait a minute, the charges are negative. Does the sign of the charge matter in this formula?\n\nI recall that the Lorentz force formula is \\( \\vec{F} = q (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\), and the direction of the force depends on the sign of the charge. However, since we're dealing with the magnitude of the radius, the sign of the charge shouldn't affect the radius itself, only the direction of the force (i.e., the direction of the curvature).\n\nSo, the magnitude of the charge \\( |q| \\) is what matters in the formula, and the radius is \\( r = \\frac{mv}{qB} \\), where \\( q \\) is the magnitude of the charge.\n\nTherefore, the calculations above are correct, and option D indeed has the largest \\( \\frac{m}{q} \\), leading to the largest radius.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps considering the centripetal force equated to the magnetic force.\n\nThe centripetal force is \\( F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r} \\), and the magnetic force is \\( F_B = qvB \\). Setting these equal:\n\n\\[ \\frac{mv^2}{r} = qvB \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{mv}{qB} \\]\n\nWhich is the same formula I used earlier.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option D, with m = 20 u and q = \u20131 e, as it has the highest mass-to-charge ratio, leading to the largest radius.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
