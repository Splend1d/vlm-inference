                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand what \"passive movements\" mean, and there are four options here. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to grasp what \"passive\" means in this context. In general, passive usually means that something is being done to a person without them actively resisting or participating in the action. So, in terms of movements, passive movements are likely movements that are performed on a person without them resisting or helping with the movement.\n\nOption A says \"movement with resistance, stretching at end of range.\" Hmm, if it's passive, I wouldn't expect there to be resistance from the person. Resistance sounds like the person is trying to stop the movement, which would make it active in some way. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says \"movement without resistance, stretching at end of range.\" This seems more in line with my understanding of passive movements. Since it's passive, there should be no resistance from the person, and stretching at the end of the range might just be part of the movement to ensure full flexibility.\n\nOption C is \"movement with resistance, stopping at end of range.\" Again, if it's passive, I don't think there should be resistance. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption D says \"movement without resistance, stopping at end of range.\" This also fits with my initial thought about passive movements. No resistance means the person isn't fighting against the movement, and stopping at the end of range suggests that the movement is controlled and doesn't overextend the joints.\n\nNow, between options B and D, the difference is whether the movement involves stretching at the end of the range or just stopping at that point. I need to think about this.\n\nIn passive movements, especially in physical therapy or rehabilitation, therapists often move a person's limbs through their range of motion. The goal is to maintain joint flexibility and muscle length without causing injury. So, typically, they would move the limb to the end of its natural range and hold it there without overstretching.\n\nGiven that, option D seems like a accurate description: movement without resistance, stopping at the end of the range. The key points are:\n\n- No resistance from the person\n\n- Controlled movement\n\n- Stopping at the end of the range, not overstretching\n\nI think option B might be misleading because stretching at the end of the range could imply overextending or causing tension beyond the natural movement, which isn't the goal of passive movements. Instead, the movement should respect the joint's range of motion and stop at the end point without stretching excessively.\n\nSo, my answer would be option D: movement without resistance, stopping at the end of range.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. In passive range of motion exercises, therapists or caregivers move the patient's limbs through their available range of motion. The patient is instructed not to resist or help with the movement. The movement is smooth and controlled, stopping at the point where the joint reaches its maximum natural extension or flexion without forcing it.\n\nYes, that matches option D perfectly. So, I'm confident that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
