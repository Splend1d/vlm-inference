                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the second cosmic velocity, which is also called the escape velocity. It's the speed an object needs to have to break free from a celestial body's gravity without further propulsion. The celestial body has mass M and radius R, and G is the gravitational constant. I need to find the correct formula among the options provided.\n\nFirst, I recall that the escape velocity can be derived from the conservation of energy principle. At the surface of the celestial body, the object has both kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. If it's launched with a speed equal to the escape velocity, its kinetic energy should be just enough to overcome its gravitational potential energy so that its total energy becomes zero at infinity.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy at the surface is (1/2)mv\u00b2, and the gravitational potential energy is -GMm/R, where m is the mass of the object. Setting the total energy to zero at infinity, we have:\n\n(1/2)mv\u00b2 - GMm/R = 0\n\nI can simplify this by dividing both sides by m:\n\n(1/2)v\u00b2 - GM/R = 0\n\nThen, solving for v\u00b2:\n\n(1/2)v\u00b2 = GM/R\n\nv\u00b2 = 2GM/R\n\nSo, v = sqrt(2GM/R)\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. v = sqrt(GM/R)\n\nB. v = 2sqrt(GM/R)\n\nC. v = sqrt(2GM/R)\n\nD. v = sqrt(GM/2R)\n\nThe correct formula is option C: v = sqrt(2GM/R).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to derive it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the work done against gravity to lift the object from the surface to infinity. The work done should be equal to the initial kinetic energy at the surface.\n\nThe work done is the integral of the gravitational force from R to infinity, but that sounds complicated. Maybe sticking with the energy conservation is simpler.\n\nAnother way is to use the escape velocity formula in terms of the acceleration due to gravity at the surface. I know that g = GM/R\u00b2, but I'm not sure if that helps directly here.\n\nWait, maybe I can express the escape velocity in terms of g and R.\n\nIf g = GM/R\u00b2, then GM = gR\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting into the escape velocity formula:\n\nv = sqrt(2GM/R) = sqrt(2gR\u00b2 / R) = sqrt(2gR)\n\nThat makes sense. So, escape velocity is sqrt(2gR), where g is the gravitational acceleration at the surface, and R is the radius of the celestial body.\n\nBut since g = GM/R\u00b2, substituting back, we get v = sqrt(2GM/R), confirming option C again.\n\nLet me consider if there's any chance that another option could be correct. For example, option B is v = 2sqrt(GM/R). That doesn't seem right because it would overestimate the escape velocity.\n\nOption A is v = sqrt(GM/R), which is less than the actual escape velocity.\n\nOption D is v = sqrt(GM/2R), which is even smaller.\n\nSo, based on my calculations, option C seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the dimensions of each formula.\n\nThe dimensional formula for velocity is [L/T].\n\nLet's see:\n\nA. sqrt(GM/R): G has dimensions [L\u00b3/M/T\u00b2], M is [M], R is [L]. So, sqrt(GM/R) = sqrt([L\u00b3/M/T\u00b2]*[M]/[L]) = sqrt([L\u00b3/T\u00b2]/[L]) = sqrt([L\u00b2/T\u00b2]) = [L/T]. Dimensions are correct.\n\nB. 2sqrt(GM/R): Same as above, dimensions are correct.\n\nC. sqrt(2GM/R): Same as A, dimensions are correct.\n\nD. sqrt(GM/2R): Same as A, dimensions are correct.\n\nSo, all options have correct dimensions, which makes sense because the constant 2 is dimensionless.\n\nTherefore, the derivation points to option C being correct, and the dimensional analysis doesn't disprove any of the options due to the presence of dimensionless constants.\n\nI think I'm confident with my answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
