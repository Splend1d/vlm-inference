                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which list of Fed actions will only increase the money supply. I'm a bit rusty on monetary policy, but I remember that the Fed can influence the money supply through a few key actions. Let's recall what each action does:\n\n1. **Reserve Requirements**: These are the amounts that banks must hold in reserve and not lend out. If the Fed raises reserve requirements, banks have less money to lend, which could decrease the money supply. Conversely, if reserve requirements are lowered, banks can lend more, increasing the money supply.\n\n2. **Discount Rate**: This is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for short-term loans. If the Fed lowers the discount rate, it becomes cheaper for banks to borrow money, which might encourage them to lend more, increasing the money supply. Raising the discount rate has the opposite effect.\n\n3. **Open Market Operations**: Buying and selling bonds. When the Fed buys bonds, it injects money into the economy, increasing the money supply. When it sells bonds, it takes money out of the economy, decreasing the money supply.\n\nSo, to increase the money supply, the Fed should:\n\n- Lower reserve requirements\n\n- Lower the discount rate\n\n- Buy bonds\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; sell bonds.\n\n- Raising reserve requirements decreases money supply.\n\n- Lowering the discount rate increases money supply.\n\n- Selling bonds decreases money supply.\n\nSo, this option has actions that both increase and decrease the money supply, but overall, it seems like it would decrease the money supply.\n\nB. Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n\n- Again, raising reserve requirements decreases money supply.\n\n- Lowering the discount rate increases money supply.\n\n- Buying bonds increases money supply.\n\nHere, two actions increase the money supply, but one decreases it. Not entirely sure if the net effect is positive or negative, but since two out of three actions are expansionary, maybe it still increases, but it's not entirely clear.\n\nC. Raise reserve requirements; raise the discount rate; sell bonds.\n\n- Raising reserve requirements decreases money supply.\n\n- Raising the discount rate decreases money supply.\n\n- Selling bonds decreases money supply.\n\nAll three actions here are contractionary, meaning they decrease the money supply.\n\nD. Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n\n- Lowering reserve requirements increases money supply.\n\n- Lowering the discount rate increases money supply.\n\n- Buying bonds increases money supply.\n\nAll three actions in this option are expansionary, meaning they increase the money supply.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option D is the one where all actions contribute to increasing the money supply.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's some interaction between these actions that I'm not considering.\n\nFor example, in option B, raising reserve requirements decreases the money supply, but lowering the discount rate and buying bonds increase it. Would the decrease from higher reserves be offset by the increases from lower discount rates and bond purchases? It's possible that the net effect could still be an increase, depending on the magnitude of each action. However, the question asks for a list that contains only actions that will increase the money supply, implying that all actions should be expansionary, without any contractionary measures.\n\nSimilarly, in option A, raising reserve requirements is contractionary, which contradicts the goal of increasing the money supply.\n\nOption C is entirely contractionary, so it's out.\n\nOption D is all expansionary, which fits the bill.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any scenario where one of the actions in option D could indirectly lead to a decrease in the money supply. For example, if the Fed lowers reserve requirements, banks might lend more, but if they're already fully lent up, the effect might be limited. However, in general, lowering reserve requirements does increase the money supply by increasing the money multiplier.\n\nLowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow, which should encourage lending and thus increase the money supply.\n\nBuying bonds injects money into the economy, as the Fed pays for the bonds with newly created money, which increases the money supply.\n\nSo, all things considered, option D is the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
