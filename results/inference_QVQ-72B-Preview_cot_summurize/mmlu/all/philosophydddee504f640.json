                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Stevenson thought about empirical methods in resolving ethical disagreements. The options are:\n\nA. They're never useful.\n\nB. Sometimes useful, but not always enough.\n\nC. Always sufficient in principle.\n\nD. The only responsible way to do moral philosophy.\n\nFirst, I need to remember who Stevenson is. I think he's Richard Stevenson, who was a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly in meta-ethics and the nature of moral language. He was associated with the emotivist theory, which suggests that moral statements express emotions or attitudes rather than factual claims.\n\nGiven that background, let's think about how empirical methods would fit into resolving ethical disagreements according to Stevenson.\n\nEmpirical methods involve observation and experience, typically through scientific inquiry, to gather evidence about the world. In ethics, which deals with questions of right and wrong, good and bad, it's often debated whether these can be resolved empirically.\n\nOption A says empirical methods are never useful in resolving ethical disagreements. That seems too strong. Even emotivists might acknowledge that empirical facts can inform our understanding of ethical issues. For example, knowing the consequences of an action might influence our emotional responses to it.\n\nOption B suggests that empirical methods are sometimes useful but not always sufficient. This seems more plausible. Perhaps empirical data can help in some cases, but there are limits to what they can achieve in resolving ethical disagreements.\n\nOption C claims that empirical methods are always sufficient in principle for resolving ethical disagreements. This seems too optimistic. Many ethical disagreements persist despite empirical evidence, suggesting that there's more to resolving them than just factual information.\n\nOption D states that empirical methods are the only responsible way to engage in moral philosophy. This aligns with some forms of moral realism or ethical naturalism, which ground moral truths in empirical facts. However, emotivists like Stevenson might not agree, as they see moral statements as expressions of emotion rather than assertions of fact.\n\nWait a minute, if Stevenson was an emotivist, he probably didn't think that empirical methods were the only way to do moral philosophy. Emotivism suggests that moral discourse is about expressing feelings and attempting to influence others' feelings, not about stating facts that can be verified empirically.\n\nSo, if that's the case, maybe option A is correct\u2014empirical methods are never useful in resolving ethical disagreements. But that seems too absolute. Even if moral statements are emotive, empirical information can still be relevant to the context in which they're used.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose there's a disagreement about whether euthanasia is morally permissible. One person says, \"Euthanasia is wrong.\" According to Stevenson, this might be expressing their disapproval or negative feelings about euthanasia. To resolve the disagreement, would empirical methods help?\n\nWell, empirical data about the practices of euthanasia, the experiences of patients and families, and the social impacts could certainly inform the discussion. But ultimately, the disagreement might persist because it's about moral values, not just facts.\n\nSo, in this case, empirical methods might be useful to some extent (option B), but they're not the only thing needed. There might be other considerations, like moral principles or emotional responses, that aren't directly accessible through empirical means.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Stevenson believed that empirical methods have no role in resolving ethical disagreements. But that seems unlikely, given that empirical information can influence our emotions and thus our moral intuitions.\n\nI need to recall some of Stevenson's specific claims. He argued that moral disagreements involve differences in both fact and emotion. That is, people might disagree about the facts of a situation and about how they feel about it.\n\nIf that's the case, then empirical methods could help resolve factual disagreements, but not necessarily emotional ones. So, perhaps empirical methods are sometimes useful, but not always sufficient.\n\nOption B seems to capture that idea: empirical methods are sometimes useful but not always sufficient for resolving ethical disagreements.\n\nBut is there more to it? Maybe Stevenson thought that empirical methods are always sufficient in principle, but in practice, it's difficult to apply them to resolve emotional differences.\n\nOption C suggests that empirical methods are always sufficient in principle, which might imply that if we had enough empirical information, we could resolve any ethical disagreement. That doesn't align with Stevenson's emotivism, which emphasizes the role of emotions in moral discourse.\n\nSimilarly, option D suggests that empirical methods are the only responsible way to engage in moral philosophy. Again, this seems at odds with emotivism, which doesn't prioritize empirical facts over emotional expressions in moral discourse.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most accurate representation of Stevenson's view: empirical methods are sometimes useful in resolving ethical disagreements, but they're not always sufficient.\n\nTo confirm this, let's consider another angle. Stevenson was known for his theory that moral persuasion involves not just logical argumentation but also emotional engagement. He thought that to change someone's moral viewpoint, you need to influence their emotions, not just present them with facts.\n\nGiven that, empirical methods, which primarily deal with facts, would only be part of the picture in resolving ethical disagreements. Emotional engagement and other non-empirical methods would also be necessary.\n\nSo, again, this points towards option B: empirical methods are sometimes useful but not always sufficient.\n\nLet me consider if there's any evidence that Stevenson thought empirical methods were never useful in resolving ethical disagreements (option A). That seems unlikely, given that factual information can be relevant to ethical discussions. For example, knowing whether a certain action leads to positive or negative outcomes might influence someone's emotional response to it.\n\nTherefore, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C, claiming that empirical methods are always sufficient in principle, also seems incompatible with Stevenson's emphasis on the emotional component of moral disagreements. Even if empirical facts could be established, the emotional responses to those facts might still differ, leading to persistent disagreements.\n\nFinally, option D, suggesting that empirical methods are the only responsible way to engage in moral philosophy, contradicts Stevenson's view that moral discourse is essentially about emotional expression and persuasion.\n\nIn conclusion, based on Stevenson's emotivist theory, empirical methods are sometimes useful in resolving ethical disagreements but are not always sufficient, making option B the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
