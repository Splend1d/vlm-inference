Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nWhich of the following presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Calvin Coolidge and his views on taxation and government spending. The quote is from a speech he gave in 1924, and it's titled \"Economy in the Interest of All.\" He talks a lot about how important it is to protect people's property and their ability to keep the rewards of their own work. He says that taxing people too much is like making them work for the government instead of themselves, and that excessive taxation can lead to tyranny.\n\nHe also mentions that when the government starts ignoring the rights of people to keep their own property, it's a sign that free government is breaking down. He emphasizes the need for economy in government spending, saying it's a test of national character, and that ultimately, it's the working people who pay the taxes.\n\nSo, the question is asking which president would most likely share Coolidge's sentiments. The options are Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Coolidge's sentiments are. From the quote, it seems like he believes in limited government, low taxes, and protecting individual property rights. He's wary of excessive taxation and government overreach, suggesting that such practices can lead to tyranny and the erosion of freedom.\n\nSo, I should look for a president who also advocates for limited government, low taxes, and strong protection of property rights.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was president during the Great Depression and World War II. FDR is known for implementing the New Deal, which involved a large expansion of the federal government's role in the economy, including increased regulation and social programs funded by higher taxes. He raised taxes on the wealthy and on corporations to pay for these programs. This seems to contradict Coolidge's views on limited government and low taxation.\n\nNext, Lyndon B. Johnson. He was president during the 1960s and is known for his Great Society programs, which also expanded the federal government's role in areas like civil rights, healthcare, and education. He increased taxes to fund these initiatives. So, again, this seems at odds with Coolidge's emphasis on limited government and low taxes.\n\nThen, there's Ronald Reagan. He was president in the 1980s and is widely known for his conservative policies, which included significant tax cuts and a push for smaller government. Reagan believed that high taxes stifled economic growth and that government should be limited to allow for individual freedom and initiative. This sounds a lot like Coolidge's sentiments.\n\nFinally, Barack Obama. He was president from 2009 to 2017. Obama raised taxes on higher-income earners to fund his healthcare reform and other social programs. He also increased regulation in various sectors, such as finance and environmental protection. This again seems to go against Coolidge's views on limited taxation and government intrusion.\n\nSo, based on this brief analysis, Ronald Reagan seems to be the president who would most likely share Coolidge's sentiments on limited government, low taxes, and protecting individual property rights.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check this. Maybe there are some specifics about Coolidge's policies or philosophy that I'm missing.\n\nCalvin Coolidge was president from 1923 to 1929, during the Roaring Twenties. He was known for his conservative approach to government, emphasizing balanced budgets, reduced government spending, and low taxes to stimulate economic growth. He believed in minimal government intervention in the economy, which aligns with his statements in the quote.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Franklin D. Roosevelt: As previously thought, his New Deal involved significant expansion of government, which is the opposite of Coolidge's philosophy.\n\nB. Lyndon B. Johnson: His Great Society also expanded government programs and increased taxes, again conflicting with Coolidge's views.\n\nC. Ronald Reagan: His economic policies, known as Reaganomics, focused on reducing taxes, controlling government spending, and minimizing regulation, which align closely with Coolidge's sentiments.\n\nD. Barack Obama: His administration saw increases in taxes for higher earners and expanded government programs like the Affordable Care Act, which again differ from Coolidge's emphasis on limited government and low taxes.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is C. Ronald Reagan, as his economic and governmental philosophies align closely with those expressed by Calvin Coolidge in the provided quote.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
