                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about disposable income, consumption spending, and saving. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nFirst, disposable income is $10,000, and consumption spending is $8,000. For every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. I need to find which option is correct based on this information.\n\nOkay, so disposable income is the income available to a household after taxes have been accounted for. Consumption spending is what people spend on goods and services. Saving is what's left after consumption from disposable income.\n\nSo, saving = disposable income - consumption spending.\n\nGiven that, if disposable income is $10,000 and consumption spending is $8,000, then saving should be $10,000 - $8,000 = $2,000.\n\nNow, the problem says that for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. So, if disposable income increases by $100, saving increases by $10.\n\nMarginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the change in consumption spending divided by the change in disposable income. Similarly, marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the change in saving divided by the change in disposable income.\n\nSo, MPS = change in saving / change in disposable income.\n\nAccording to the problem, for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. So, change in saving is $10 when disposable income increases by $100.\n\nTherefore, MPS = $10 / $100 = 0.10.\n\nSo, option C seems correct: the marginal propensity to save is 0.10.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nWe know that MPC + MPS = 1.\n\nIf MPS is 0.10, then MPC should be 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nBut option A says MPC is 0.80, which doesn't match with MPS being 0.10.\n\nOption B says MPS is 0.20, which is different from what I calculated.\n\nOption D says MPS is 0.90, which also doesn't match with MPS being 0.10.\n\nSo, based on the calculation, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look at it differently.\n\nLet me think about the relationship again.\n\nDisposable income increases by $100, saving increases by $10.\n\nSo, MPS = change in saving / change in disposable income = $10 / $100 = 0.10.\n\nThat confirms option C.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any trick here.\n\nThe problem mentions \"given this information,\" and provides multiple choices. Maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nLet me see: disposable income is $10,000, consumption is $8,000, so saving is $2,000.\n\nFor every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10.\n\nSo, if disposable income increases by $100, saving increases by $10, and thus consumption increases by $90 ($100 - $10).\n\nSo, MPC = $90 / $100 = 0.90.\n\nMPS = $10 / $100 = 0.10.\n\nSo, option C is correct: MPS is 0.10.\n\nOption A says MPC is 0.80, which is incorrect; MPC is 0.90.\n\nOption B says MPS is 0.20, which is incorrect; MPS is 0.10.\n\nOption D says MPS is 0.90, which is incorrect; MPS is 0.10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nI think that's it. No further confusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
