                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about worker autonomy in decision making. It's asking what this concept is an example of, and the options are worker freedom, greater worker negotiation, worker empowerment, or increased worker power. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what worker autonomy in decision making means. From what I recall, autonomy generally refers to the ability to make decisions independently, without direct supervision or external control. So, in a workplace context, worker autonomy would involve employees having the authority to make decisions related to their job without constant oversight from managers.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Worker freedom: This seems related, because autonomy implies freedom to make choices. But is it the best description?\n\nB. Greater worker negotiation: This might involve employees having more say in discussions or negotiations, perhaps with management or in setting terms and conditions. But autonomy in decision making sounds more about making decisions directly rather than just negotiating.\n\nC. Worker empowerment: This sounds a lot like what autonomy would entail. Empowerment often means giving individuals the authority and resources to make decisions and take action without needing approval from above.\n\nD. Increased worker power: This could be similar, as having more power might allow workers to make decisions independently. But power can be a bit vague; it could refer to different aspects of influence in the workplace.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Worker autonomy in decision making is about individuals or groups of workers being able to make choices that affect their work processes or outcomes without seeking approval from higher-ups each time. This aligns closely with the concept of empowerment, where employees are given the capability to act on their own initiative.\n\nWorker freedom might be a part of it, but it seems a bit too broad. Freedom could encompass many things beyond just decision-making authority. For example, it could include flexibility in work hours or choice of projects, which aren't necessarily directly about decision making.\n\nGreater worker negotiation seems more about the process of discussing and perhaps reaching agreements, rather than the actual making of decisions in day-to-day work. While negotiation can lead to more autonomous decision-making, it's not the same as directly making decisions on one's own.\n\nIncreased worker power is also a possibility, but it's a bit more general. Power in an organization can manifest in various ways, not just in decision-making authority. It could also relate to influence over strategic directions, resource allocation, or even control over other employees.\n\nGiven these considerations, worker empowerment seems to be the most precise answer. Empowerment specifically involves granting employees the authority and responsibility to make decisions and take actions within their roles, which matches the idea of autonomy in decision making.\n\nMoreover, empowerment is often seen as a management strategy to improve efficiency, innovation, and job satisfaction by allowing workers to have more control over their work. It's about trusting employees to make good decisions and providing them with the necessary support and information to do so.\n\nIn contrast, the other options don't capture the essence of decision-making autonomy as directly. Worker freedom is too broad, greater worker negotiation is more about the process of discussion, and increased worker power is too general and could encompass more than just decision-making authority.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Worker empowerment.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a real-world example. Suppose a team of software developers is given the autonomy to decide on the technology stack for a new project, without having to get approval from upper management. This is an example of worker autonomy in decision making. It empowers the developers by trusting their expertise and giving them the authority to make important decisions, which can lead to higher job satisfaction and potentially better project outcomes.\n\nThis scenario fits perfectly with the concept of worker empowerment, where employees are given the freedom and responsibility to make key decisions related to their work. It's not just about general freedom or increased negotiating power but specifically about being empowered to make decisions.\n\nSo, after considering all the options and the meaning of worker autonomy in decision making, I'm confident that worker empowerment is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
