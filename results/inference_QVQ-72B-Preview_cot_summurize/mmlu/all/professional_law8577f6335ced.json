                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. There's a city ordinance that says you can't wash vehicles parked on city streets. But this guy does it anyway, and when he washes his car, the water makes a puddle that freezes overnight. Then, the next morning, another driver slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. The driver is suing the man who washed the car, claiming he was negligent per se. I need to find out which additional fact would help the man who washed the car the most in his defense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"negligent per se\" means. I think it means that if someone violates a law or ordinance, and that violation causes someone to get hurt, then the person who violated the law is automatically considered negligent. So, in this case, because the man violated the ordinance by washing his car on the street, and that led to the accident, the driver is arguing that the man was negligent per se.\n\nBut the man is being sued, and he's probably trying to defend himself against this claim. So, I need to think about which of these additional facts could weaken the argument that he was negligent per se.\n\nLet's look at option A: The man was not aware of the ordinance. Hmm, does ignorance of the law excuse him? I don't think so. Generally, ignorance of the law is not a defense in most legal systems. So, even if he didn't know about the ordinance, if the ordinance was in place to protect something, like preventing water from getting on the street and freezing, then his ignorance might not matter. The fact that he violated the ordinance could still make him negligent per se.\n\nOption B: The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck. This is interesting. It seems like the ordinance was put in place because of a specific incident where someone washing their car was hit by a truck. This might suggest that the primary purpose of the ordinance is to prevent accidents where people washing their cars are hit by moving vehicles, not necessarily to prevent water from getting on the street and freezing.\n\nWait a minute, if the ordinance was enacted to prevent accidents where car washers are hit by trucks, then the violation of the ordinance leading to a different kind of accident\u2014someone sliding on ice\u2014might not directly relate to the purpose of the ordinance. Maybe the man can argue that the ordinance was meant to prevent one type of harm (accidents involving car washers being hit), and not another type of harm (ice on the road causing accidents). So, perhaps violating the ordinance doesn't automatically make him negligent per se for this different kind of accident.\n\nOption C: The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident. This seems like it could be relevant because it establishes that the driver knew or should have known that the ice might have been caused by the man washing his car. But does this help the man? Maybe not directly. It might even hurt his case because the driver can testify that he saw the man washing his car, which connects the man's actions to the accident.\n\nOption D: The driver is not a resident of the city. This might be relevant if the driver wasn't familiar with local ordinances or conditions. But I'm not sure how this helps the man. Just because the driver isn't a resident doesn't mean that the man isn't negligent for violating the ordinance.\n\nLet me think again. If the driver isn't a resident, maybe he wasn't aware of the local conditions, like how quickly water can freeze on the streets overnight. Perhaps the man can argue that the driver should have been more cautious driving on unfamiliar roads, especially in different climate conditions. But I'm not sure if that's a strong defense against the negligent per se claim.\n\nComparing the options, option B seems to offer the most potential for the man's defense. If the ordinance was enacted to prevent accidents involving car washers being hit by trucks, and the man's violation of the ordinance led to a different kind of accident (someone sliding on ice), then perhaps the man can argue that the negligence per se doesn't apply because the harm wasn't the type the ordinance was designed to prevent.\n\nI think the key here is the purpose of the ordinance. If the ordinance was meant to prevent one type of accident, and the violation led to a different type of accident, then maybe the man isn't automatically negligent per se for that different harm.\n\nSo, I would say that option B would help the man the most in his defense against the negligent per se claim.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
