The question is asking what cognitive bias or psychological phenomenon her failure to use her jeans and sweater as a pillow substitute best illustrates. The options are:\n\nA. The availability heuristic\n\nB. Functional fixedness\n\nC. Confirmation bias\n\nD. The representativeness heuristic\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with the availability heuristic (option A): This is a mental shortcut where people make decisions based on immediate examples that come to mind. It's about how easily we can recall information. So, if Shannon was thinking about pillows and couldn't think of anything else to use because she associated comfort with sleeping only with a pillow, maybe this could be a stretch. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, functional fixedness (option B): This is when we can't see an object beyond its typical use. For example, if Shannon only saw her jeans and sweater as clothing and couldn't think of them as potential pillows, that sounds like functional fixedness. She was fixed on their primary function and couldn't think of alternative uses.\n\nConfirmation bias (option C): This is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. If Shannon believed that only a real pillow could provide comfort while sleeping and ignored other possible solutions, that might be confirmation bias. But again, it seems more about her inability to think of alternatives rather than confirming a preexisting belief.\n\nThe representativeness heuristic (option D): This is when people judge the probability of an event based on how much it resembles typical cases. It's about similarity to a prototype. Not sure how this directly applies here.\n\nGiven these definitions, functional fixedness seems the most straightforward fit. Shannon was so fixed on her jeans and sweater being just clothes that she couldn't see them as potential substitutes for a pillow, even though they could have served the purpose.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe the availability heuristic could be at play if Shannon was so focused on the discomfort of not having a pillow that she couldn't think of any solutions because all she could think about was the absence of a pillow. But that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nConfirmation bias might involve her holding onto the belief that only a real pillow would work, and thus not considering other options. But again, that seems similar to functional fixedness.\n\nThe representativeness heuristic doesn't seem directly applicable here because it's about judging probability based on similarity, and I don't see how that relates to Shannon's situation.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Functional fixedness. Shannon was unable to think beyond the typical use of her jeans and sweater as clothing and couldn't consider them as potential pillows.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
