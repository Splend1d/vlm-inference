                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"The area bounded by the parabola y = x\u00b2 and the lines y = 1 and y = 9 equals...\" and then there are some options. Okay, let's see. I need to find the area where y is between 1 and 9, and it's bounded by the parabola y = x\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I should probably sketch this out to visualize what's going on. So, y = x\u00b2 is a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex at the origin. The lines y = 1 and y = 9 are horizontal lines, so they will intersect the parabola at certain points.\n\nLet me find out where y = 1 intersects y = x\u00b2. Set x\u00b2 = 1, so x = 1 or x = -1. Similarly, where y = 9 intersects y = x\u00b2, x\u00b2 = 9, so x = 3 or x = -3.\n\nSo, the area I'm looking for is between y = 1 and y = 9, and it's bounded by the parabola. It seems like it's the area between the parabola and these two horizontal lines.\n\nMaybe I can think of it as integrating the difference between the parabola and the lower bound, which is y = 1, from x = -1 to x = 3, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I should integrate with respect to y instead of x.\n\nIf I integrate with respect to y, since the bounds are given in terms of y, that might make sense. So, the parabola is y = x\u00b2, which can be written as x = \u00b1\u221ay. So, for each y between 1 and 9, the x-limits are from -\u221ay to \u221ay.\n\nBut the problem is that the area is bounded by y = 1 and y = 9, so maybe I need to find the area between y = 1 and y = 9, and the parabola x = \u00b1\u221ay.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to find the area between the curves y = x\u00b2 and y = 9, and y = x\u00b2 and y = 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the x-limits for each y. For a given y between 1 and 9, x goes from -\u221ay to \u221ay.\n\nSo, the area dA for a particular y would be the integral from x = -\u221ay to \u221ay of dx, which is 2\u221ay dx.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. If I think of it as a horizontal strip, the width dy, and for each y, the length is from x = -\u221ay to x = \u221ay, so the length is 2\u221ay.\n\nTherefore, dA = 2\u221ay dy.\n\nSo, the total area A would be the integral from y = 1 to y = 9 of 2\u221ay dy.\n\nThat seems promising. Let's compute that integral.\n\nSo, A = \u222b from 1 to 9 of 2\u221ay dy.\n\n\u221ay is y^(1/2), so \u222b y^(1/2) dy is (2/3)y^(3/2).\n\nWait, no, since there's a 2 in front, it should be 2 * (2/3)y^(3/2) = (4/3)y^(3/2).\n\nNow, evaluate that from y = 1 to y = 9.\n\nSo, A = (4/3)(9)^(3/2) - (4/3)(1)^(3/2).\n\nFirst, 9^(3/2) is (9^(1/2))\u00b3 = 3\u00b3 = 27.\n\nAnd 1^(3/2) is 1.\n\nSo, A = (4/3)(27) - (4/3)(1) = 36 - 4/3 = 108/3 - 4/3 = 104/3.\n\nOkay, that matches option D. 104/3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if my approach is correct.\n\nI integrated 2\u221ay dy from y = 1 to y = 9, which should give the area between the parabola x\u00b2 = y and the lines y = 1 and y = 9.\n\nBut is there another way to look at this? Maybe integrating with respect to x.\n\nIf I integrate with respect to x, for x between -1 and 3, but that doesn't seem straightforward because the bounds in y are from 1 to 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the area between x = -3 and x = 3, and subtract the area where y < 1.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nThe area between x = -3 and x = 3, bounded by y = x\u00b2 and y = 9.\n\nFirst, find where y = x\u00b2 intersects y = 9: x = \u00b13.\n\nSo, the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 9 from x = -3 to x = 3.\n\nBut I need to integrate the difference between y = 9 and y = x\u00b2 from x = -3 to x = 3.\n\nSo, A = \u222b from -3 to 3 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx.\n\nCompute that integral.\n\n\u222b (9 - x\u00b2) dx from -3 to 3.\n\nThis is 9x - (1/3)x\u00b3 evaluated from -3 to 3.\n\nAt x = 3: 9*3 - (1/3)(27) = 27 - 9 = 18.\n\nAt x = -3: 9*(-3) - (1/3)(-27) = -27 + 9 = -18.\n\nSo, total area is 18 - (-18) = 36.\n\nBut this is the area between y = 9 and y = x\u00b2 from x = -3 to x = 3.\n\nBut the original problem asks for the area bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 1, and y = 9.\n\nSo, maybe I need to subtract the area where y < 1.\n\nThat is, the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 1 from x = -1 to x = 1.\n\nSimilarly, A_lower = \u222b from -1 to 1 of (1 - x\u00b2) dx.\n\nCompute that: 1x - (1/3)x\u00b3 from -1 to 1.\n\nAt x = 1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nAt x = -1: 1 - (-1/3) = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3.\n\nSo, A_lower = 2/3 - 4/3 = -2/3. But area is positive, so 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the total area bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 1, and y = 9 is A_total = A - A_lower = 36 - 2/3 = 108/3 - 2/3 = 106/3.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the integrals.\n\nLet me try to visualize this again.\n\nThe area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 9 from x = -3 to x = 3 is indeed 36, as calculated.\n\nNow, the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 1 from x = -1 to x = 1 is 2/3, as calculated.\n\nBut when I subtract 2/3 from 36, I get 106/3, which doesn't match my earlier result of 104/3.\n\nThere must be something wrong with this approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the area in terms of y, as I did initially.\n\nIntegrating 2\u221ay dy from y = 1 to y = 9 gives 104/3, which matches one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 1, and y = x\u00b2 and y = 9.\n\nWait, maybe I need to integrate the difference between the upper and lower bounds with respect to y.\n\nSo, for each y between 1 and 9, the x-limits are from -\u221ay to \u221ay.\n\nBut since it's symmetric, the width at each y is 2\u221ay.\n\nTherefore, dA = 2\u221ay dy.\n\nIntegrating from y = 1 to y = 9: \u222b from 1 to 9 of 2\u221ay dy.\n\nAs before, this evaluates to 104/3.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried subtracting the lower area from the upper area, I got 106/3, which doesn't match.\n\nMaybe there's a better way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the area as the integral of the difference between the upper and lower bounds.\n\nBut in this case, since it's vertical strips, it's complicated because the x-limits change at y = 1 and y = 9.\n\nWait, maybe breaking it into parts.\n\nFrom y = 1 to y = 9, the area is the integral of 2\u221ay dy, as established.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use geometry.\n\nThe area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 9 from x = -3 to x = 3 is 36.\n\nThe area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 1 from x = -1 to x = 1 is 2/3.\n\nBut the area bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 1, and y = 9 should be the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 9 minus the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 1.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 9 includes the area above y = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 9 from x = -3 to x = 3 includes the part from y = 1 to y = 9, but also from y = 0 to y = 1.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I subtracted the area from y = x\u00b2 to y = 1, which is 2/3.\n\nBut that doesn't account for the area where y < 1.\n\nWait, maybe I need to subtract the area where y < 1 twice, because the area between y = x\u00b2 and y = 9 includes the area above y = 1 and the area below y = 1.\n\nBut this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can find the area by integrating the difference between the upper and lower bounds with respect to y.\n\nSo, for each horizontal strip at height y, the width is from x = -\u221ay to x = \u221ay, which is 2\u221ay.\n\nTherefore, dA = 2\u221ay dy.\n\nIntegrating from y = 1 to y = 9: \u222b from 1 to 9 of 2\u221ay dy.\n\nCompute the integral: 2*(2/3)y^(3/2) evaluated from 1 to 9.\n\nThat is (4/3)(9)^(3/2) - (4/3)(1)^(3/2) = (4/3)(27) - (4/3)(1) = 36 - 4/3 = 104/3.\n\nSo, the area is 104/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's choice D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check this by numerical methods or by geometry, but I think this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 104/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
