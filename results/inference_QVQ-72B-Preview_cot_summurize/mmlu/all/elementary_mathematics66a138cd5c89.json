                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which group of numbers is ordered from least to greatest. The options are:\n\nA. 0.25, 1.6, 1.0\n\nB. 1.0, 0.25, 1.6\n\nC. 0.25, 1.0, 1.6\n\nD. 1.6, 1.0, 0.25\n\nOkay, so I need to compare these numbers and see which one starts with the smallest number and goes up to the largest.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"least to greatest\" means. It means arranging the numbers in ascending order, from the smallest number to the largest number.\n\nSo, I need to look at each option and check if the numbers are in that order.\n\nLet's look at option A: 0.25, 1.6, 1.0\n\nWait, is 0.25 less than 1.6? Yes, because 0.25 is the same as 25/100, which is less than 1. And 1.6 is bigger than 1. But then there's 1.0 in between. So, 0.25, then 1.0, then 1.6 would be the correct order. But in option A, it's 0.25, 1.6, 1.0, which is not correct because 1.0 should come before 1.6.\n\nSo, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: 1.0, 0.25, 1.6\n\nHere, 1.0 is being placed before 0.25, but actually 1.0 is larger than 0.25. So, this can't be correct. It should be 0.25 before 1.0.\n\nSo, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: 0.25, 1.0, 1.6\n\nThis seems right. 0.25 is the smallest, then 1.0, then 1.6. Let me double-check.\n\n0.25 is less than 1.0, and 1.0 is less than 1.6. So, yes, this seems correct.\n\nOption D: 1.6, 1.0, 0.25\n\nThis starts with the largest number, 1.6, and goes down to 0.25, which is the smallest. So, this is not in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the correct option should be C.\n\nWait a minute, let's make sure about the values. Maybe I should convert them all to fractions or think about their decimal places.\n\n0.25 is the same as 1/4, which is 0.25.\n\n1.0 is exactly 1.\n\n1.6 is 1 and 3/5, which is 1.6.\n\nSo, 0.25, 1.0, 1.6 is indeed in ascending order.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of money. If 0.25 is 25 cents, 1.0 is $1.00, and 1.6 is $1.60. So, 0.25 < 1.0 < 1.6.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option C: 0.25, 1.0, 1.6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
