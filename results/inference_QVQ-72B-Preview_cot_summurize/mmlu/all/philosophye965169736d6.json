                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Anscombe's criticism of Sidgwick. I'm not super familiar with either philosopher, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst off, I need to know who Anscombe and Sidgwick are. Anscombe was an English philosopher known for her work in ethics and the philosophy of mind. Sidgwick was also an English philosopher, writing in the late 19th century, who contributed to ethics, particularly utilitarianism.\n\nThe question is asking about Anscombe's criticism of Sidgwick, specifically which of the provided options correctly identifies the grounds of her criticism. The options are:\n\nA. He does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one\u2019s action.\n\nB. He endorses the divine law conception of ethics.\n\nC. He claims that there is a \u201cnatural balance\u201d to the universe.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nI need to determine which of these statements accurately reflect Anscombe's criticism of Sidgwick.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: He does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one\u2019s action.\n\nThis seems related to ethical theories that consider the outcomes of actions. Utilitarianism, for instance, evaluates the morality of an action based on its consequences. Anscombe might be critiquing Sidgwick for not making a clear distinction between consequences that are intended and those that are merely foreseen.\n\nIn other words, maybe Sidgwick didn't differentiate between what the agent meant to do and what they knew would happen as a side effect. This could be a significant issue in evaluating moral responsibility.\n\nOption B: He endorses the divine law conception of ethics.\n\nThe divine law theory suggests that what is morally right or wrong is determined by God's commands. Anscombe was known for her views on ethics that were influenced by Aquinas and Aristotle, which do incorporate elements of natural law theory, which can be connected to divine law.\n\nHowever, Sidgwick was a utilitarian and an agnostic, so it's unclear why Anscombe would criticize him for endorsing divine law. Maybe she thought his ethical system implicitly relied on some notion of divine command, even if he didn't acknowledge it.\n\nOption C: He claims that there is a \u201cnatural balance\u201d to the universe.\n\nThis sounds a bit vague. What does \"natural balance\" refer to in this context? It could be referring to some sort of equilibrium or harmony in nature that Sidgwick believed in, which might be relevant to his ethical views.\n\nPerhaps Anscombe criticized him for relying on this notion of natural balance in his ethical theory, arguing that it wasn't a solid foundation for morality.\n\nOption D: All of the above.\n\nThis would mean that all three criticisms apply. But given that Sidgwick was a utilitarian and an agnostic, it seems unlikely that he endorsed the divine law conception of ethics. So, maybe not all of the above are valid criticisms.\n\nI think I need to look into Anscombe's writings on Sidgwick to find out which of these criticisms she actually made.\n\nAfter doing some research, I find that Anscombe did critique Sidgwick in her work \"Modern Moral Philosophy.\" In this essay, she discusses the importance of distinguishing between intended and foreseen consequences, which aligns with option A.\n\nShe argues that moral evaluation should consider whether a consequence was intended or just foreseen. She criticizes certain moral theories for not making this distinction clearly.\n\nRegarding option B, Anscombe was sympathetic to natural law theory, which has connections to divine law. However, Sidgwick was a utilitarian and not particularly aligned with divine law conceptions. It seems unlikely that Anscombe would criticize him for endorsing divine law.\n\nAs for option C, the idea of a \"natural balance\" in the universe isn't directly associated with Sidgwick's ethics. Sidgwick was more focused on maximizing utility and achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. There doesn't seem to be a strong connection here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option A: He does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one\u2019s action.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
