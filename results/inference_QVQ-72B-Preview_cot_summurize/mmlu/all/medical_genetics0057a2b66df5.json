                    "text": "So I have this problem here about genotype frequencies in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. It says that if the frequencies of the two alleles at a gene are 0.6 and 0.4, what's the frequency of heterozygotes? The options are 0.8, 0.64, 0.48, and 0.32.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is and how it relates to genotype frequencies. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a principle in population genetics that states that in a large, randomly mating population with no mutation, migration, or selection, allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from one generation to the next.\n\nThe formula for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles, and p\u00b2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype, and q\u00b2 is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype.\n\nIn this problem, it's given that the allele frequencies are 0.6 and 0.4. I need to figure out which one is p and which one is q. Let's assume p = 0.6 and q = 0.4.\n\nAccording to the formula, the frequency of heterozygotes should be 2pq.\n\nSo, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 2 * 0.24 = 0.48.\n\nWait, that's option C, 0.48.\n\nBut let me double-check if it matters which frequency is p and which is q. Since there are only two alleles, p + q = 1, so it doesn't matter which one you assign to p or q, as long as they add up to 1.\n\nSo, if p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, then 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48.\n\nAlternatively, if I switch p and q, so p = 0.4 and q = 0.6, then 2pq = 2*(0.4)*(0.6) = 0.48 still.\n\nSo, in both cases, the frequency of heterozygotes is 0.48.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the heterozygote frequency could be calculated differently? Maybe using another formula or considering something else?\n\nWell, in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the only factors are p and q, and the heterozygote frequency is always 2pq, assuming two alleles.\n\nLet me see if any of the other options could possibly make sense.\n\nOption A is 0.8, which would be p\u00b2 if p were 0.8, but that's not the case here.\n\nOption B is 0.64, which is p\u00b2 when p is 0.8, but again, p is 0.6 here.\n\nOption D is 0.32, which is 2pq if p and q were both 0.4 and 0.4, but that's not the case.\n\nSo, based on the given frequencies, 0.48 seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other context that might change this.\n\nIn a two-allele system, with frequencies p and q, and assuming random mating and no other evolutionary forces, the genotype frequencies should follow the Hardy-Weinberg proportions: p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, with p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, we have:\n\n(0.6)\u00b2 + 2*(0.6)*(0.4) + (0.4)\u00b2 = 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1.0, which checks out.\n\nSo, the heterozygote frequency is indeed 0.48.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the heterozygote frequency could be different if the alleles have different effects or if there's linkage with other genes? No, because the problem specifies Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which assumes no selection or other evolutionary forces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to test understanding of allele frequencies and genotype frequencies.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nIf p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, then the frequency of homozygous dominant (p\u00b2) is (0.6)\u00b2 = 0.36.\n\nThe frequency of homozygous recessive (q\u00b2) is (0.4)\u00b2 = 0.16.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of heterozygotes is 1 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1 - (0.36 + 0.16) = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48.\n\nAgain, that confirms the heterozygote frequency is 0.48.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of Punnett squares, with two alleles, the genotypes would be PP, Pq, qP, and qq, with frequencies p\u00b2, 2pq, 2pq, and q\u00b2, respectively.\n\nSo, again, heterozygotes are 2pq = 0.48.\n\nI think I'm reinforcing the same answer repeatedly.\n\nLet me consider if the alleles are codominant or if there's any other factor that could affect the heterozygote frequency.\n\nNo, in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, it doesn't matter how the alleles are expressed phenotypically; the genotype frequencies are determined solely by the allele frequencies and the assumption of random mating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 0.48.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption A is 0.8, which is p if p were 0.8, but p is 0.6 here.\n\nOption B is 0.64, which is p\u00b2 when p is 0.8, but again, p is 0.6.\n\nOption D is 0.32, which is 2pq if p and q were both 0.4, but they are 0.6 and 0.4.\n\nSo, none of these other options make sense given the allele frequencies provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed C. 0.48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
