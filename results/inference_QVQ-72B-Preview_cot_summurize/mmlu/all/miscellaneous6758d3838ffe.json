                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Who composed the 'Moonlight Sonata'?\" and the options are Mozart, Handel, Bach, and Beethoven. Hmm, I need to figure out who wrote that piece. I know that the 'Moonlight Sonata' is a famous piano sonata, but I'm not entirely sure who composed it. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the 'Moonlight Sonata' is. It's a piano sonata, and I believe it's known for its serene and melodic first movement, which is in a slow tempo and has this dreamy quality. The full title is something like Sonata quasi una fantasia, Op. 27, No. 2, but I might be mixing that up with another piece.\n\nNow, considering the composers listed:\n\nA. Mozart \u2013 he was a prolific composer of the Classical period, known for his symphonies, operas, and piano concertos. He wrote many piano sonatas as well, but I don't recall him composing something specifically called the 'Moonlight Sonata.'\n\nB. Handel \u2013 he was a Baroque composer, famous for his oratorios like 'Messiah' and operas. He also wrote keyboard suites and concerti grossi, but again, I don't remember a 'Moonlight Sonata' from him.\n\nC. Bach \u2013 another Baroque composer, known for his complex counterpoint and deep religious music. He wrote numerous keyboard works, including the Well-Tempered Clavier and the Goldberg Variations, but not the 'Moonlight Sonata,' as far as I know.\n\nD. Beethoven \u2013 a key figure in the transition from Classical to Romantic music, famous for his symphonies, piano sonatas, and string quartets. He composed many piano sonatas, and I think the 'Moonlight Sonata' is one of them.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that Beethoven wrote 32 piano sonatas, each with its own characteristics and nicknames. For example, the 'Path\u00e9tique' Sonata, the 'Appassionata,' and the 'Moonlight' Sonata. Yes, that sounds familiar.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try to recall the opening notes of the 'Moonlight Sonata.' It starts with a quiet, introspective melody in the left hand, with the right hand playing soft, sustained chords. That's definitely Beethoven's style, especially from his middle period.\n\nI also remember that the 'Moonlight Sonata' was published in 1801, which places it squarely within Beethoven's oeuvre, as he was active from the late 18th century into the early 19th century.\n\nTo sum it up, based on my knowledge of classical music and the characteristics of the 'Moonlight Sonata,' I'm confident that Ludwig van Beethoven is the composer of this renowned piece.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D.
