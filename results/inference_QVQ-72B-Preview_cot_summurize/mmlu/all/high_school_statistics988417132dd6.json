                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about probabilities of two events, E and F. They both have nonzero probabilities, p and q respectively. And I need to figure out which of the given options is impossible. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A: p + q > 1.\n\nI know that probabilities can range from 0 to 1, and the probability of the entire sample space is 1. If E and F are disjoint, their probabilities add up, but if they're not, it's a bit different. Wait, actually, even if they're not disjoint, p(E or F) can be greater than 1 if p(E) + p(F) - p(E and F) is greater than 1. But is that possible?\n\nHmm, let's think. If p(E) = p and p(F) = q, and p(E and F) = r, then p(E or F) = p + q - r. If p + q - r > 1, that could happen if p + q > 1 and r is less than p + q - 1. So, it's possible for p + q to be greater than 1 as long as there's some overlap to make p(E or F) less than or equal to 1. So, option A might not be impossible, but I need to check carefully.\n\nWait, the question is asking which is impossible, meaning which of these cannot happen under any circumstances. So, can p + q ever be greater than 1?\n\nWell, if E and F are mutually exclusive, then p + q cannot be greater than 1 because p(E or F) would be p + q, and that can't exceed 1. But if they're not mutually exclusive, then p(E or F) = p + q - p(E and F), which can be less than or equal to 1 as long as p(E and F) >= p + q - 1. So, in that case, p + q could be greater than 1, but p(E or F) wouldn't exceed 1 because p(E and F) would adjust accordingly.\n\nSo, option A is possible if the events are not mutually exclusive and their intersection has positive probability. Therefore, option A is not impossible.\n\nMoving on to option B: p - q < 0.\n\nThis is just saying that p is less than q. Well, probabilities are positive numbers, so one probability can certainly be less than another. For example, if p = 0.3 and q = 0.4, then p - q = -0.1 < 0. So, this seems possible. Therefore, option B is not impossible.\n\nNext, option C: p / q > 1.\n\nThis is saying that p is greater than q. Similar to the previous option, probabilities can be compared in this way. If p = 0.6 and q = 0.3, then p / q = 2 > 1. So, this is also possible. Therefore, option C is not impossible.\n\nFinally, option D: E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, this is interesting. Independence and mutual exclusivity are two different concepts. Let's recall their definitions.\n\nTwo events E and F are independent if p(E and F) = p(E) * p(F). They are mutually exclusive if p(E and F) = 0.\n\nSo, if E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive, that would mean:\n\n0 = p(E) * p(F)\n\nBut since p and q are nonzero (as given), this can't be true. Because p * q \u2260 0 if p \u2260 0 and q \u2260 0.\n\nWait, but p * q is not zero if p and q are nonzero. So, p * q \u2260 0, but we have p and q are nonzero, so p * q > 0. But for mutual exclusivity, p(E and F) = 0, which contradicts p * q > 0.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for E and F to be both independent and mutually exclusive if p and q are nonzero.\n\nAh, so option D is impossible.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nSuppose E and F are independent. Then, p(E and F) = p * q. But if they are mutually exclusive, p(E and F) = 0. So, p * q = 0, which contradicts p and q being nonzero. Therefore, it's impossible for them to be both independent and mutually exclusive under these conditions.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
