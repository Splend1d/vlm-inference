Let's see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that the UK Constitution's only source of power is that of the sovereign. Hmm, I thought the UK had a parliamentary system where Parliament has a lot of power. Is the sovereign really the only source of power? That seems a bit strong. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOption B says that the UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of Parliament. I've heard that in some countries, like the United States, the judiciary can declare laws unconstitutional, but does that apply to the UK? I think in the UK, Parliament is sovereign, meaning its laws can't be overturned by the courts. But there might be exceptions or recent changes, so I should be careful here.\n\nOption C says that the UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources. That sounds familiar. I recall that unlike many countries that have a single written constitution, the UK's constitution is made up of various documents, customs, and conventions. So, it's not all written down in one place. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says that the UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights. Well, I know that the UK does have the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. But is that the same as having a Bill of Rights? I think a Bill of Rights typically lists individual liberties and protections, and while the Human Rights Act does that to some extent, it's not the foundation of the entire constitution. Maybe this isn't the best description.\n\nLet me think this through. The UK is known for having an unwritten or uncodified constitution, which means that its constitutional rules and principles are found in a combination of statutory law, common law, and conventions. So, that aligns with option C.\n\nOption A seems off because while the monarch is part of the constitution, they don't hold the only source of power. Parliament and the judiciary also play significant roles.\n\nOption B is tricky because, in the UK, the judiciary can interpret laws and declare them incompatible with human rights, but they can't actually overturn acts of Parliament. Parliament remains sovereign and can pass laws that go against judicial interpretations.\n\nOption D mentions a Bill of Rights. While the UK does have the Human Rights Act, which is important for protecting individual liberties, it's not the foundational basis of the entire constitution. The constitution is much broader and includes things like the relationship between the executive, legislature, and judiciary.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option C seems to be the most accurate description of the UK Constitution: it is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
