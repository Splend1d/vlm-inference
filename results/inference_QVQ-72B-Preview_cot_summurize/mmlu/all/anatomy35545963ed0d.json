                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about male anatomy, specifically about the structures near the bladder and the urethra. The question is asking which structure in men is located at the neck of the bladder and surrounds the urethra. The options are the epididymis, the prostate, the scrotum, and the seminal vesicle.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the neck of the bladder is. The bladder is like a bag that holds urine, and the neck of the bladder is probably the narrow part where it connects to the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body.\n\nSo, the question is asking which of these structures is right at that connection point, surrounding the urethra.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nA. Epididymis: I know that the epididymis is part of the male reproductive system. It's where sperm mature and are stored. I think it's located along the testes, in the scrotum. Doesn't sound like it's at the neck of the bladder or surrounding the urethra.\n\nB. Prostate: The prostate is also part of the male reproductive system. It's involved in producing fluid that makes up semen. I recall that the prostate is located just below the bladder, surrounding the upper part of the urethra. That sounds like it could be at the neck of the bladder.\n\nC. Scrotum: This is the sac that holds the testes. It's located outside the body, below the penis. Definitely not at the neck of the bladder.\n\nD. Seminal vesicle: These are two glands that produce most of the fluid in semen. They're located near the base of the bladder and connect to the ejaculatory ducts. While they are close to the bladder, I don't think they surround the urethra.\n\nBased on this, the prostate seems like the most likely candidate. It's positioned right below the bladder, surrounding the urethra, which matches the description in the question.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check.\n\nThe neck of the bladder is the area where the bladder connects to the urethra. The prostate is directly below the bladder and encircles the urethra at this point. It plays a crucial role in the male reproductive system by secreting fluids that help nourish and transport sperm.\n\nThe epididymis is involved in sperm maturation and storage, but it's located in the scrotum, which is away from the bladder and urethra.\n\nThe scrotum is clearly not at the neck of the bladder; it's an external structure.\n\nThe seminal vesicles are indeed near the bladder, but they don't surround the urethra. Their main function is to produce fluids that make up semen, and they connect to the ejaculatory ducts, which merge with the urethra.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be the prostate.\n\nJust to make sure, I can visualize it: the bladder sits in the pelvis, with the urethra coming out from the bottom. The prostate is right there at the base, wrapping around the urethra. So, yes, that fits perfectly.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is B. Prostate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
