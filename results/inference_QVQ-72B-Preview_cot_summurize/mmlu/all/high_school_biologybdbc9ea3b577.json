                    "text": "So I have this question about the resting membrane potential, and it's asking which of the three things\u2014active transport, selective permeability, or differential distribution of ions across the axonal membrane\u2014are important for maintaining the resting membrane potential. The options are A. III only, B. I and II only, C. II and III only, or D. I, II, and III.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the resting membrane potential is. I know that it's the voltage difference across the cell membrane when the cell is at rest, meaning no action potentials are firing. In neurons, this is typically around -70 millivolts inside negative relative to the outside.\n\nNow, let's think about each of the options:\n\nI. Active transport: This involves processes like the sodium-potassium pump, which uses energy to move ions against their concentration gradients. In neurons, the sodium-potassium pump moves three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it moves in. This helps establish and maintain ion gradients across the membrane, which are crucial for the resting membrane potential.\n\nII. Selective permeability: This refers to the cell membrane's ability to allow some substances to pass through while blocking others. In neurons, the membrane is more permeable to potassium ions (K+) than to sodium ions (Na+) when at rest. This differential permeability influences the resting membrane potential because potassium ions can more easily diffuse out of the cell, contributing to the negative charge inside.\n\nIII. Differential distribution of ions across the axonal membrane: This sounds like it's referring to the concentration gradients of ions across the membrane. For example, there are higher concentrations of Na+ outside the cell and higher concentrations of K+ inside the cell. This uneven distribution is key to the resting membrane potential.\n\nSo, active transport helps set up and maintain these ion gradients. Selective permeability allows certain ions to cross the membrane more easily, affecting the voltage. And the differential distribution of ions is directly responsible for the voltage difference.\n\nWait a minute, is there any way one of these could not be involved in the resting membrane potential?\n\nLet me consider if active transport is directly involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential. The sodium-potassium pump is essential for maintaining the ion gradients, which in turn influence the resting potential. So, I think active transport is definitely involved.\n\nSelective permeability is also crucial because the membrane's permeability to different ions determines how they can move across the membrane in response to concentration and voltage gradients. Without selective permeability, the membrane would be equally permeable to all ions, which wouldn't maintain the necessary ion distributions.\n\nDifferential distribution of ions is the result of both active transport and selective permeability. The pump moves ions to create gradients, and the selective permeability allows for the stabilization of these gradients.\n\nSo, all three seem to be involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential.\n\nBut let me think about it differently. Maybe there's a way where one of these isn't directly involved.\n\nFor example, if the differential distribution of ions is a result of both active transport and selective permeability, perhaps it's not an independent factor.\n\nHowever, in reality, the differential distribution is a consequence of both active transport and selective permeability, and it's this distribution that directly gives rise to the resting membrane potential through the Nernst equation and the Goldman equation.\n\nTherefore, all three are necessary:\n\n- Active transport establishes and maintains ion gradients.\n\n- Selective permeability allows for the diffusion of ions in response to these gradients, leading to the establishment of a membrane potential.\n\n- Differential distribution of ions is the result of these processes and is what creates the voltage difference across the membrane.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any scenario where one of these isn't necessary.\n\nSuppose there was no active transport; would the resting membrane potential still be maintained? No, because without active transport, ion gradients would eventually equalize, and the resting potential would be lost.\n\nWhat if there was no selective permeability? If the membrane was equally permeable to all ions, then there wouldn't be a driving force for ions to move in a way that maintains the resting potential.\n\nAnd without the differential distribution of ions, there wouldn't be a membrane potential at all.\n\nTherefore, all three are essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
