                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Ross and his criticism of utilitarianism. The question says that Ross claims the essential defect of utilitarianism is that it ignores...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. the value of pleasure.\n\nB. autonomy.\n\nC. epistemological responsibility.\n\nD. the personal character of duty.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall who Ross is in this context. I think he's referring to W.D. Ross, the Scottish philosopher who was known for his work in ethics, particularly deontological ethics.\n\nUtilitarianism, as I understand it, is a consequentialist theory that suggests the right action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as happiness or pleasure, for the greatest number of people.\n\nNow, Ross was a critic of utilitarianism, and he believed in a form of deontology that emphasized moral duties and obligations that exist regardless of their consequences.\n\nSo, the question is asking what Ross thought was the fundamental flaw of utilitarianism\u2014that is, what does utilitarianism ignore that Ross thought was crucial in ethical theory.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: the value of pleasure.\n\nHmm, utilitarianism actually places a high value on pleasure. It seeks to maximize pleasure or happiness. So, it doesn't ignore the value of pleasure; rather, it makes pleasure a central concern. Maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B: autonomy.\n\nAutonomy refers to the ability of an individual to make their own choices and decisions, free from external control or influence. Utilitarianism, being a consequentialist theory, focuses on the outcomes of actions rather than the inherent rights or autonomy of individuals. It's possible that Ross thought utilitarianism ignored autonomy because it might require sacrificing an individual's autonomy for the greater good.\n\nOption C: epistemological responsibility.\n\nThis one sounds a bit tricky. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and belief. So, epistemological responsibility would involve being responsible for one's beliefs and knowledge. Utilitarianism is more concerned with actions and their consequences rather than with the process of acquiring knowledge or the justification of beliefs. Maybe Ross thought that utilitarianism didn't place enough emphasis on having well-founded beliefs or knowledge when making moral decisions.\n\nOption D: the personal character of duty.\n\nThis seems intriguing. Utilitarianism is often criticized for treating moral duties as too impersonal or for allowing the ends to justify the means, potentially compromising individual duties and obligations. Ross was known for his theory of prima facie duties, which are obligations that hold unless they conflict with a stronger duty. This suggests that he valued the specific, personal nature of duties, which might not be adequately addressed in utilitarianism.\n\nSo, considering Ross's perspective, I need to think about which of these options best captures what he would consider the essential defect of utilitarianism.\n\nGiven that utilitarianism already emphasizes pleasure, option A seems less likely.\n\nAutonomy is an important concept in ethics, and utilitarianism might indeed overlook individual autonomy in favor of the greater good. However, I'm not entirely sure if this was Ross's primary criticism.\n\nEpistemological responsibility seems a bit of a stretch here. While important, it doesn't seem to be at the heart of Ross's criticisms of utilitarianism.\n\nThe personal character of duty, on the other hand, aligns closely with Ross's deontological approach. He emphasized duties such as fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, and self-improvement, which have a distinct personal aspect. Utilitarianism, by focusing on overall utility, might overlook these specific duties or treat them as means to an end rather than ends in themselves.\n\nMoreover, Ross's idea of prima facie duties suggests that certain duties are self-evident and ought to be followed unless they conflict with a stronger duty. Utilitarianism, in contrast, would require weighing the consequences of fulfilling or ignoring these duties, potentially reducing their personal significance.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Ross would argue that utilitarianism's essential defect is its disregard for the personal character of duty.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. I recall that Ross criticized utilitarianism for several reasons, including its overemphasis on consequences at the expense of moral rules and duties. He also believed that utilitarianism couldn't adequately account for the moral importance of specific obligations, such as promises and duties to particular persons.\n\nThis further supports the idea that Ross was concerned with utilitarianism's treatment of duty, particularly its personal and specific nature.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be D: the personal character of duty.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly consider if there's any other information that might lead me to choose another option.\n\nFor example, perhaps Ross had specific issues with epistemological responsibility in utilitarianism. But, as far as I can recall, his main criticisms were centered around the nature of duty and the problems with consequentialism.\n\nSimilarly, while autonomy is an important concept in ethics, and utilitarianism might indeed overlook individual autonomy, I don't think this was Ross's primary criticism.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the best answer is D: the personal character of duty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
