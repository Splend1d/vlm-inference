                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. The teacher has three packages of stickers: one has 56 stickers, another has 48, and the third has 58 stickers. The teacher wants to divide all these stickers equally among 27 students. I need to figure out how many stickers each student will receive. The options are 6, 9, 54, or 81 stickers.\n\nFirst, I think I should find out the total number of stickers the teacher has. To do that, I need to add up the stickers from all three packages. So, 56 plus 48 is 104, and then adding 58 to that makes 162 stickers in total. So, there are 162 stickers altogether.\n\nNow, the teacher wants to divide these 162 stickers equally among 27 students. That means I need to divide 162 by 27 to find out how many stickers each student gets.\n\nLet me try that division: 27 times 6 is 162. So, 162 divided by 27 equals 6. That means each student would get 6 stickers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the total stickers: 56 plus 48 is indeed 104, and 104 plus 58 is 162. So, that checks out.\n\nNow, dividing 162 by 27: 27 times 6 is 162, and 162 divided by 27 is 6. So, yes, each student gets 6 stickers.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 6 stickers, B is 9 stickers, C is 54 stickers, and D is 81 stickers. So, the correct answer should be A. 6 stickers.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe I can think about dividing each package separately and then combining those results.\n\nFirst, dividing 56 by 27: 27 times 2 is 54, which is less than 56, so 27 times 2 is 54, and 56 minus 54 is 2. So, each student would get 2 stickers from this package, with a remainder of 2 stickers.\n\nNext, dividing 48 by 27: 27 times 1 is 27, times 2 is 54. So, 27 times 1 is 27, times 2 is 54, which is less than 48. 27 times 1 is 27, times 2 is 54, which is 6 less than 48. So, 27 times 1 is 27, times 2 is 54, which is too much. So, 27 times 1 is 27, and 48 minus 27 is 21. So, each student gets 1 sticker from this package, with a remainder of 21 stickers.\n\nLastly, dividing 58 by 27: 27 times 2 is 54, which is less than 58, and 27 times 3 is 81, which is more than 58. So, 27 times 2 is 54, and 58 minus 54 is 4. So, each student gets 2 stickers from this package, with a remainder of 4 stickers.\n\nNow, adding up the stickers each student gets from each package: 2 from the first package, 1 from the second, and 2 from the third, totaling 2 plus 1 plus 2, which is 5 stickers per student. But wait, earlier I got 6 stickers per student when dividing the total stickers by the number of students. Now, adding up the individual divisions gives me 5 stickers per student. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nI must have made a mistake in one of these calculations. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, total stickers: 56 + 48 + 58 = 162.\n\nDivide 162 by 27: 27 times 6 is 162, so 6 stickers per student. That seems correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the individual divisions:\n\nFirst package: 56 \u00f7 27.\n\n27 times 2 is 54, which is exactly 56 - 54 = 2, so remainder 2. So, each student gets 2 stickers from this package.\n\nSecond package: 48 \u00f7 27.\n\n27 times 1 is 27, times 2 is 54. Since 48 is less than 54, each student gets 1 sticker from this package.\n\nThird package: 58 \u00f7 27.\n\n27 times 2 is 54, which is less than 58, and 27 times 3 is 81, which is more than 58. So, each student gets 2 stickers from this package.\n\nTotal stickers per student: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n\nBut total stickers divided by 27 is 6. There's a\u77db\u76fe here. Why is there a difference?\n\nAh, I see. When you divide each package separately and add up the whole numbers, you're not accounting for the remainders. The remainders mean that some stickers are left over, which should also be distributed.\n\nWait, but the problem says to divide all the stickers equally among the students. So, the teacher first adds all the stickers together and then divides by 27.\n\nAlternatively, distributing each package separately and then summing wouldn't account for the stickers left over from each division, which should actually be combined.\n\nSo, my initial approach is correct: add all the stickers and divide by 27.\n\nBut to understand why the two methods differ, consider that in the separate divisions, the remainders are not being combined and distributed further. Whereas, in the total division, all stickers are considered together, ensuring no stickers are left out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed 6 stickers per student.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 6 stickers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 6 \\text{ stickers}} \\]"
