                    "text": "Let's see. I have this genetics problem here. It says that the likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2, will be one of these options: A. 0.4, B. 0.32, C. 0.08, D. 0.02.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. We're dealing with alleles, which are different forms of a gene. The problem mentions two specific alleles, each with a frequency of 0.2 in the population. So, the frequency of each allele is 20%, right?\n\nNow, the question is about the likelihood of an individual carrying both of these alleles. Assuming that these alleles are at two different loci, and considering the principles of Mendel's law of independent assortment, the frequencies of these alleles should multiply if they are inherited independently.\n\nBut wait, in reality, human DNA markers can be linked, meaning they might not assort independently. However, for the sake of this problem, I think we can assume that the alleles are inherited independently, following the multiplicative rule.\n\nSo, if the frequency of one allele is 0.2, and the frequency of the other allele is also 0.2, then the probability of an individual having both alleles would be 0.2 multiplied by 0.2, which is 0.04. But that's not among the options, which makes me think that maybe there's more to this problem.\n\nLet me consider if these alleles are on the same locus or different loci. The problem says \"two specific alleles of a human DNA marker.\" A DNA marker typically refers to a specific location on a chromosome, so if it's a marker, it's probably a single locus with multiple alleles. But the problem mentions two specific alleles, suggesting they might be at the same locus or different loci.\n\nIf they're at the same locus, then it's a heterozygote frequency, which would be 2*p*q, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. Given that both are 0.2, then q would be 0.2, and p would be 0.2 as well. So, 2*p*q = 2*(0.2)*(0.2) = 0.08. That's option C.\n\nHowever, if the alleles are at different loci, then the probability of having both would be p*q, assuming independence, which would be 0.2*0.2 = 0.04, which isn't an option.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem is referring to two alleles at the same locus, implying heterozygosity. In that case, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of heterozygotes would be 2*p*q, which, as calculated, is 0.08.\n\nBut let me double-check. If p = frequency of one allele = 0.2, and q = frequency of the other allele = 0.2, then the heterozygote frequency is indeed 2*p*q = 2*(0.2)*(0.2) = 0.08.\n\nHowever, in reality, for a diallelic locus, the frequencies should add up to 1. If both alleles have a frequency of 0.2, that would mean p + q = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4, which doesn't add up to 1. That suggests there might be more alleles at that locus, but typically, for simplicity in genetics problems, we deal with two alleles per locus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering multiple loci. If there are two independent loci, each with an allele frequency of 0.2, then the joint probability of having both alleles would be p*q = 0.2*0.2 = 0.04, but again, that's not an option.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. It says \"two specific alleles of a human DNA marker,\" which might imply that these two alleles are at the same locus, and we're to find the frequency of individuals carrying both, meaning heterozygotes.\n\nIn that case, as per Hardy-Weinberg, the heterozygote frequency is 2*p*q. Given p = q = 0.2, then 2*(0.2)*(0.2) = 0.08, which is option C.\n\nBut I'm still confused because if p and q are both 0.2, then p + q = 0.4, which leaves 0.6 for other alleles at that locus. Does that matter here? Probably not, since we're only concerned with these two specific alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only these two alleles and ignoring others, even if their combined frequency doesn't add up to 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake in the problem, and p and q should be interpreted differently.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If we have two alleles, A and B, each with frequency 0.2, then the frequency of individuals who are A/B heterozygotes would be 2*p*q = 0.08.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is referring to two different loci, each with an allele frequency of 0.2, and we want the probability that an individual has the specific allele at both loci, assuming independence, it would be p*q = 0.04.\n\nBut since 0.04 isn't an option, and 0.08 is, perhaps the problem is assuming that the two alleles are at the same locus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the probability of having two copies of the same allele in a homozygous individual.\n\nIf it's a homozygous individual for allele A, with frequency p = 0.2, then the frequency would be p^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04, which again isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the probability of having at least one of each allele, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the probability of having two specific alleles, meaning two different alleles in a heterozygous state, which would be 2*p*q = 0.08.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering the probability of having two specific alleles in a diploid organism, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the problem is about the probability that an individual carries both alleles, regardless of whether they are homozygous or heterozygous.\n\nIn that case, for a single locus with two alleles, A and B, each with frequency 0.2, the frequency of individuals carrying at least one of each would be the frequency of heterozygotes, which is 2*p*q = 0.08.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about two different loci, each with an allele frequency of 0.2, and we want the probability that an individual has both specific alleles, assuming independence, it would be p*q = 0.04.\n\nBut since 0.04 isn't an option, and 0.08 is, perhaps the problem is referring to a single locus with two specific alleles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and it should specify whether the alleles are at the same locus or different loci.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, I'm leaning towards 0.08 being the correct answer, assuming it's a single locus with two specific alleles, and we're calculating the heterozygote frequency.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.08.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
