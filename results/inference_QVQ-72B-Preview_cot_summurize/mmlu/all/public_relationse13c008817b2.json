Hmm, I'm not sure about this, but I think it was in 1922.\n\nWait, let me think. The BBC is British Broadcasting Corporation, right? I remember that it's a British public service broadcaster, and it's one of the oldest broadcasters in the world. But when did it start exactly?\n\nI think radio broadcasting in Britain began sometime in the early 20th century. Let me see if I can recall any specific dates. I think the first experimental radio broadcasts in the UK were in the early 1900s, maybe around 1906 or so. But that's just a guess.\n\nLet me consider the context. The BBC was established by a royal charter, and I believe it was founded in 1927. Wait, but one of the options is 1927, and another is 1922. Maybe the BBC was founded in 1927, but started broadcasting earlier?\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps I should look at when regular radio services began in the UK. I think that might have been in the early 1920s.\n\nLet me see, in 1922, there was a significant event in broadcasting history. I think it was the year when the British Broadcasting Company was formed as a private company, financed by a consortium of radio set manufacturers. And then, in 1927, it became a public corporation, the BBC.\n\nSo, if the British Broadcasting Company started in 1922 and began broadcasting that year, and then it became the BBC in 1927, which continued the broadcasting, maybe the actual start of broadcasting was in 1922.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the first radio broadcasts in Britain. I recall that there were some early transmissions by people like Marconi, but those were more experimental and not regular broadcasting.\n\nThe BBC website might have some information about their history. If I recall, they celebrate their founding in 1927, but they might have been broadcasting before that under a different name or structure.\n\nLet me try to remember if there were any famous radio programs or personalities from the 1920s. There was Arthur Lake, who was a radio comedian, and I think he was on the air in the 1920s. Maybe that can give me a clue about when broadcasting started.\n\nAlso, I think the BBC had a famous theme tune or something that they used to start their broadcasts, but I can't remember the details.\n\nLet me consider the technological aspect. Radio technology was developing rapidly in the early 20th century, and by the 1920s, it was becoming more widespread. So, it makes sense that regular broadcasting would have started around that time.\n\nI think the first regular wireless broadcasts in the UK were by the Marconi Company and others, and then the British Broadcasting Company was formed in 1922 to consolidate these efforts.\n\nSo, perhaps the BBC, or its predecessor, started broadcasting in 1922, and then it became the public corporation we know today in 1927.\n\nGiven that, I would say that the BBC started broadcasting radio in 1922.\n\nWait, but one of the options is 1917. Was there any broadcasting in 1917? During World War I, there might have been some military or experimental broadcasts, but I don't think regular public broadcasting started that early.\n\nLet me double-check. If the British Broadcasting Company was formed in 1922 and started broadcasting that year, and then became the BBC in 1927, then 1922 seems like the most plausible answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the BBC considers its founding to be in 1927, but traces its history back to 1922. In that case, perhaps they recognize 1922 as the start of their broadcasting operations.\n\nI think the best answer is 1922.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1922} \\]"
