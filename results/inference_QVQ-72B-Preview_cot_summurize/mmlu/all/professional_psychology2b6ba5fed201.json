                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about age discrimination in the workplace, especially concerning firing an employee. The question is about what constitutes evidence of age discrimination from the psychologist's perspective. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nOption A says that evidence of age discrimination exists only when company policy reflects adverse impact on older workers. Hmm, that sounds like it's referring to policies that disproportionately affect older employees. But is that the only way age discrimination can occur? What about individual instances where someone is fired because of their age, but the policy itself doesn't explicitly discriminate?\n\nOption B says that age discrimination exists whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing. This seems straightforward. It suggests that if age is the reason for firing, regardless of the policy or the economic impact, it's discrimination. But is that entirely accurate? Can age ever be a legitimate reason for firing, say, if the job requires certain physical abilities that decline with age? Probably not, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption C mentions that discrimination is evident whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss. This seems off. Economic loss is a consequence of being fired, but it doesn't necessarily prove that age discrimination occurred. Someone could be fired for poor performance and still suffer economic loss, but that's not discrimination based on age.\n\nOption D states that evidence of age discrimination exists only when the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically. This seems similar to option A, focusing on group impact rather than individual cases. But again, what about individual instances of discrimination that don't affect the majority?\n\nI think the key here is understanding what constitutes age discrimination. Generally, age discrimination involves treating someone less favorably because of their age, regardless of their work performance or other factors. So, if someone is fired solely based on their age, that's discrimination.\n\nBut wait, there might be exceptions or nuances in the law. For example, if a job requires certain physical capabilities that decline with age, and the employee can't perform those tasks anymore, maybe age can be a factor. But I think even then, it's about the ability to perform the job, not the age itself.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe I should look at the definition of age discrimination in employment. I recall that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older from discrimination based on age in hiring, firing, promotion, or any other aspect of employment. So, according to the ADEA, it's illegal to fire someone because of their age if they're in this protected group.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to align closely with this definition. It says that if age is the basis for firing, rather than work performance, it's discrimination. That makes sense because performance is typically a legitimate reason for termination, whereas age should not be a factor.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there are other factors that could make age a legitimate reason for firing. For example, if the job requires retirement at a certain age for safety reasons, like pilots or air traffic controllers, maybe there are exceptions. But generally, age shouldn't be the sole criterion for firing someone.\n\nOption A talks about company policy reflecting adverse impact on older workers. This seems more related to disparate impact, where a policy appears neutral but ends up disproportionately affecting older workers. While this can be a form of discrimination, it's not the only way discrimination can occur. Individual acts of discrimination, like firing someone based on their age, are also covered under the ADEA.\n\nOption C mentions substantial economic loss. While being fired at an older age might lead to greater economic hardship due to factors like reduced earning potential or difficulty finding new employment, the economic impact isn't what defines age discrimination. The discrimination is about the reason for the firing, not the consequences.\n\nOption D focuses on when a majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically. This again seems related to disparate impact, where a policy affects a larger group of older workers. But individual cases of discrimination where only one person is affected are also covered under the law.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best answer is option B: whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing. This directly aligns with the definition of age discrimination, which prohibits firing someone based on their age rather than their job performance or other legitimate business reasons.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider an example. Suppose a company fires a 45-year-old employee solely because they want a younger, more \"energetic\" staff. That's clearly age discrimination. On the other hand, if the employee is fired for consistently underperforming, and age isn't a factor, that's a legitimate reason.\n\nAnother example: if a company has a policy that mandates retirement at age 65, that could be considered age discrimination unless there's a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) that justifies it, like in safety-sensitive positions.\n\nSo, in both cases, it's about whether age is the reason for the termination, not necessarily the economic impact or the existence of a policy that affects older workers disproportionately.\n\nTherefore, I believe option B is the correct answer. It captures the essence of age discrimination in firing decisions by focusing on the reason for termination\u2014age versus work performance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
