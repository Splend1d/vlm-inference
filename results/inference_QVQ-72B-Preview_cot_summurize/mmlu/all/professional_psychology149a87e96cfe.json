                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this Overjustification Hypothesis. It sounds like it's about how rewards can sometimes backfire and actually decrease someone's interest in an activity they already enjoy. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, the self-concept is how we see ourselves, right? It's our beliefs about our own traits and abilities. But this question seems to be more about motivation and how rewards can affect intrinsic motivation.\n\nOption A says that rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. That seems to align with what I think the Overjustification Hypothesis is about. I've heard that if you reward someone for doing something they already like doing, it might make them think they're only doing it for the reward, not because they actually enjoy it.\n\nOption B is about experiencing an emotion: first having physiological arousal, then interpreting it cognitively. That sounds like the James-Lange theory of emotion, which isn't directly related to overjustification or self-concept in this context.\n\nOption C mentions that when internal cues are vague, people infer their feelings by observing their behavior and the situation around them. That seems similar to the cognitive appraisal theories of emotion, but again, not directly connected to the overjustification hypothesis.\n\nOption D says that not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. That seems counterintuitive. If someone is doing something they enjoy, not rewarding them might not necessarily decrease their interest, at least not in the same way that overjustification does.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option A is the correct answer. The Overjustification Hypothesis suggests that providing external rewards for intrinsically motivating activities can lead to a decrease in intrinsic motivation.\n\nLet me think of an example to make sure I get it. Suppose a child loves drawing for fun. If parents start giving the child stickers every time they draw, the child might start thinking they're drawing to get stickers rather than just because they enjoy it. Over time, if the stickers stop, the child might lose interest in drawing because they've come to associate it with getting a reward.\n\nOn the other hand, if the child is never rewarded and just draws because they like it, their interest might remain steady or even grow naturally.\n\nSo, in this case, overjustifying the behavior with a reward (the stickers) could lead to a decrease in intrinsic motivation.\n\nWait a minute, but the hypothesis is called \"overjustification.\" Does that mean providing too much justification, like excessive rewards, can have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation?\n\nI think that's the idea. The term \"overjustification\" implies that there's an overemphasis on external rewards, which can overshadow the intrinsic pleasure of the activity.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any studies related to this. I think there was a famous experiment where children who enjoyed drawing were given rewards for drawing, and then their motivation to draw decreased afterward compared to a control group that wasn't rewarded.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. It's likely referring to the experiment by Lepper, Greene, and Nisbett in 1973, where they found that children who were rewarded with a certificate for drawing with colorful markers later showed less intrinsic interest in drawing than those who weren't rewarded.\n\nSo, this supports option A: rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest.\n\nOption B is about the sequence of emotion experience, which is a different concept and doesn't relate to overjustification.\n\nOption C is about how people infer their emotions when internal cues are unclear, which is also unrelated to overjustification.\n\nOption D suggests that not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. While it's possible that continuous non-reward might lead to discouragement, especially if the activity is difficult, the overjustification hypothesis specifically addresses the negative effects of providing rewards for intrinsically motivating activities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer according to the Overjustification Hypothesis is option A: rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
