                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a first-order reaction. The specific rate constant, k, is given as 86 h^-1, and I need to find out how much of a 0.0500 g sample remains after 58 seconds. The options are 0.0500 g, 0.0250 g, 0.0125 g, and 0.00625 g.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equation for a first-order reaction. I know that for a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:\n\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{[A_t]}{[A_0]} \\right) = -kt \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\([A_t]\\) is the concentration at time t,\n\n- \\([A_0]\\) is the initial concentration,\n\n- \\(k\\) is the rate constant,\n\n- \\(t\\) is time.\n\nBut here, I'm dealing with mass, not concentration. However, since the sample is pure, I can consider the mass to be proportional to the concentration. So, I can use the same equation, replacing \\([A_t]\\) and \\([A_0]\\) with the mass at time t and the initial mass, respectively.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{m_t}{m_0} \\right) = -kt \\]\n\nGiven that \\(m_0 = 0.0500\\) g, and I need to find \\(m_t\\) after \\(t = 58\\) seconds.\n\nBut wait, the rate constant \\(k = 86\\) h^-1 is given in hours inverse, and the time is in seconds. I need to make sure that the units are consistent. So, I should convert either the rate constant to seconds inverse or the time to hours.\n\nLet's convert the time from seconds to hours because the rate constant is in hours inverse. That will be easier.\n\nThere are 3600 seconds in an hour, so:\n\n\\[ t_{hours} = \\frac{58 \\, \\text{seconds}}{3600 \\, \\text{seconds/hour}} = \\frac{58}{3600} \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nNow, plugging into the equation:\n\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{m_t}{0.0500} \\right) = -86 \\times \\frac{58}{3600} \\]\n\nLet me calculate the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\frac{58}{3600}\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{58}{3600} = 0.01611\\overline{1} \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ -86 \\times 0.01611\\overline{1} \\approx -1.399 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{m_t}{0.0500} \\right) \\approx -1.4 \\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\(m_t\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{m_t}{0.0500} = e^{-1.4} \\]\n\n\\[ m_t = 0.0500 \\times e^{-1.4} \\]\n\nI need to calculate \\(e^{-1.4}\\). Let's see, \\(e\\) is approximately 2.71828, so:\n\n\\[ e^{-1.4} \\approx \\frac{1}{e^{1.4}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(e^{1.4}\\):\n\nI know that \\(e^1 \\approx 2.71828\\), and \\(e^{0.4}\\) is roughly 1.49182. So,\n\n\\[ e^{1.4} \\approx 2.71828 \\times 1.49182 \\approx 4.05465 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ e^{-1.4} \\approx \\frac{1}{4.05465} \\approx 0.2466 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ m_t \\approx 0.0500 \\times 0.2466 \\approx 0.01233 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options, this is closest to 0.0125 g.\n\nBut wait, let me check if my calculation is accurate enough. Maybe I should use a calculator for a more precise value of \\(e^{-1.4}\\).\n\nI know that \\(e^{-1.4}\\) is approximately 0.246597.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ m_t = 0.0500 \\times 0.246597 \\approx 0.01233 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nWhich rounds to 0.0125 g.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.0125 g.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units conversion to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nTime in hours is indeed:\n\n\\[ t_{hours} = \\frac{58 \\, \\text{sec}}{3600 \\, \\text{sec/hour}} = 0.01611\\overline{1} \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nAnd \\(k = 86 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}\\), so the units should cancel correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I could have converted \\(k\\) to seconds inverse:\n\n\\[ k_{s^{-1}} = 86 \\, \\text{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{hour}}{3600 \\, \\text{seconds}} = \\frac{86}{3600} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 0.023889 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\]\n\nThen, plugging into the equation:\n\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{m_t}{0.0500} \\right) = -0.023889 \\times 58 \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{m_t}{0.0500} \\right) \\approx -1.399 \\]\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, regardless of the unit conversion method, I end up with the same result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 0.0125 g.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
