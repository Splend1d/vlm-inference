                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out in which decade the Hula-Hoop was invented. The options are the 1890s, 1920s, 1950s, and 1970s. Hmm, I don't remember the exact year, but I think it was around the mid-20th century.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a Hula-Hoop is. It's a kind of toy that people spin around their waist, arms, or neck for exercise or entertainment. It's made of a hollow plastic tube, usually colorful and sometimes weighted.\n\nI think the Hula-Hoop became really popular in the 1950s, but was it invented in that decade? Maybe it was invented earlier, and its popularity peaked in the 1950s.\n\nLet me consider the history of the Hula-Hoop. I believe it was invented by two brothers, Richard and Larry Steffens, who were inspired by a similar toy they saw in Australia. They brought the idea back to the United States and started producing the Hula-Hoop.\n\nWait, I think the original Hula-Hoop was produced by the Wham-O toy company. Was Wham-O founded in the 1950s? I know Wham-O is famous for inventing things like the Frisbee and the Slip 'N Slide, but I'm not sure about the exact timeline.\n\nLet me try to recall the year the Hula-Hoop was invented. I think it was in 1958. Is that right? If so, that would place it in the 1950s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was in 1960. I'm a bit unsure. Let me think of another approach. Maybe I can think about when it first became a fad in the United States.\n\nI remember that in the late 1950s, there was a Hula-Hoop craze, with people of all ages participating in Hula-Hoop contests and events. So, even if the Hula-Hoop was invented a bit earlier, its popularity definitely peaked in the 1950s.\n\nBut was it invented in the 1950s or perhaps earlier? Maybe in the 1920s, as one of the options suggests.\n\nLet me consider the technology behind the Hula-Hoop. It's a simple device, just a hollow tube, so it doesn't require advanced technology to produce. That means it could have been invented earlier than the 1950s.\n\nOn the other hand, the 1950s was a time when plastic manufacturing became more widespread, which might have made the production of Hula-Hoops more feasible and cost-effective.\n\nI'm still leaning towards the 1950s as the decade of invention, but I want to be sure. Maybe I should look at when Wham-O was founded.\n\nWham-O was founded in 1948, and they started producing the Frisbee in 1948 as well. So, if Wham-O was already in business in the late 1940s, it's plausible that they invented the Hula-Hoop in the 1950s.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that the Hula-Hoop was based on an ancient concept. Similar spinning toys have been used by children for thousands of years, often made of wood or metal.\n\nIn fact, I think there were Hula-Hoop-like toys in many cultures throughout history. So, the Hula-Hoop as we know it today might be a modern version of these traditional toys.\n\nGiven that, it's unlikely that the Hula-Hoop was invented in the 1890s, which is another option provided.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the patent date for the Hula-Hoop. If I could recall when it was patented, that would give me a definitive answer.\n\nI think the Hula-Hoop was patented in the 1950s. Was it in 1958 or 1959? I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it was invented in the 1970s, which is another option. But that seems too late to me, because I have a vague memory of seeing footage of people using Hula-Hoops in the 1960s.\n\nLet me think about the 1970s. That was when disco was popular, and there might have been a resurgence in dance and movement toys, but I don't recall Hula-Hoops being particularly popular in that decade.\n\nSimilarly, the 1920s seem too early, as that was before the widespread use of plastics, which are essential for making Hula-Hoops.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the Hula-Hoop was invented in the 1920s, but it didn't become popular until the 1950s when plastics became more common.\n\nBut I think the invention of the Hula-Hoop is generally attributed to the 1950s, specifically to Richard Steffens and Wham-O.\n\nLet me try to recall if there was any earlier version of the Hula-Hoop. I think there were similar toys in earlier times, but the modern Hula-Hoop as we know it today was likely invented in the 1950s.\n\nAnother angle: maybe I can think about who popularized the Hula-Hoop. I recall that there was a man named Arthur Lake who helped popularize it through television commercials and appearances.\n\nArthur Lake was an entertainer and businessman who saw the potential in the Hula-Hoop and worked with Wham-O to market it. Given that, and considering Arthur Lake's career span, it seems consistent with the 1950s timeline.\n\nAdditionally, I remember that the Hula-Hoop craze spread rapidly in 1958, with millions of units sold in a short period. So, if the craze started in 1958, it's likely that the invention occurred around that time or shortly before.\n\nPerhaps Wham-O invented the Hula-Hoop in the early 1950s and it took a few years to gain popularity, leading to the craze in 1958.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Hula-Hoop was invented in the late 1950s, say in 1957, and the craze followed in 1958.\n\nEither way, it still places the invention in the 1950s.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to choose among the given options:\n\nA. 1890s\n\nB. 1920s\n\nC. 1950s\n\nD. 1970s\n\nBased on my recollection and the logical deduction, I am fairly confident that the Hula-Hoop was invented in the 1950s.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there's any possibility that it was invented in the 1970s. As I thought earlier, the 1970s were more about disco and other forms of entertainment, and I don't recall Hula-Hoops being a significant trend in that decade.\n\nSimilarly, the 1920s seem too early, given the technological limitations of the time regarding plastic manufacturing.\n\nThe 1890s is even earlier, and while there might have been similar toys back then, the actual Hula-Hoop as we know it today is unlikely to have been invented that far back.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is C. 1950s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
