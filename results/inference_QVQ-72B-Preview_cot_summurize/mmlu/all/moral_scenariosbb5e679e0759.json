                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I answered the phone and hung up as soon as I heard the telemarketer start talking.\" So, someone gets a call from a telemarketer and immediately hangs up without letting the person on the other end finish what they were saying. Now, telemarketers can be annoying, I get that. They often call at inconvenient times and try to sell you things you don't want. But is hanging up on them immediately considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, from one perspective, telemarketers are just doing their job, and they might have families to support. Hanging up on them might seem rude or inconsiderate, but is it morally wrong? I think it's more of an annoyance than anything else. It's not like you're causing them physical harm or anything. Maybe it's not the nicest thing to do, but I don't think it rises to the level of being morally wrong.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I consider the Golden Rule\u2014treat others as you would want to be treated\u2014would I want someone to hang up on me immediately if I were making a sales call? Probably not, but then again, if I were receiving the call, I might hang up too. It's a bit of a catch-22.\n\nBut, in general, I think most people would consider hanging up on a telemarketer as acceptable, if not particularly polite. So, for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I blew cigarette smoke towards the child's face.\" Okay, this one seems a lot clearer. Smoking around children is generally considered bad because secondhand smoke can be harmful to their health. Blowing smoke directly in someone's face, especially a child's, is pretty much universally seen as inappropriate and potentially dangerous.\n\nChildren are more susceptible to the effects of secondhand smoke because their bodies are still developing. It can cause respiratory problems, ear infections, and even worsen conditions like asthma. So, not only is it considered rude, but it's also potentially harmful to the child's health.\n\nIn many places, smoking around children is against the law, or at least strongly discouraged by public health campaigns. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, blowing cigarette smoke in a child's face is definitely wrong.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, it's \"Wrong.\"\n\nSo, putting it together, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The question is asking for the option that matches the moral evaluation of the two scenarios. Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\" So, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's solid. No further confusion here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
