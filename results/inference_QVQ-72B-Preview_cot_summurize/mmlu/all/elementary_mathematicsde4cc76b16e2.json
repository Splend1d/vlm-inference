                    "text": "Let's see. Sapphire has 179 balloons and she wants to put 7 balloons in each bouquet. I need to figure out how many bouquets she can make. So, I guess I should divide 179 by 7.\n\nHmm, 179 divided by 7. Let me try that. 7 times 25 is 175, and 179 minus 175 is 4, so 25 bouquets with 4 balloons left over. But wait, she can't make a bouquet with only 4 balloons if she needs 7 in each. So, maybe I need to consider only complete bouquets.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 32 bouquets, B is 23, C is 25, and D is 26. Since I got 25 with some balloons left, maybe 25 is the correct answer. But let me double-check.\n\nIf she has 179 balloons and each bouquet has 7 balloons, then 179 divided by 7 should be 25 with a remainder of 4, as I calculated before. So, she can make 25 complete bouquets with 4 balloons left over. Since she can't make another complete bouquet with those 4 balloons, the answer should be 25 bouquets.\n\nBut let's see if maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe using multiplication or something else. If she uses 7 balloons per bouquet, then for 25 bouquets, she would use 25 times 7, which is 175 balloons. She has 179 balloons, so 179 minus 175 is 4 balloons left. Again, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think the answer is C. 25 bouquets.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if 25 is indeed the correct number. What if I try to make 26 bouquets? 26 times 7 is 182, but she only has 179 balloons, so that would be 3 balloons short. So, 26 bouquets aren't possible because she doesn't have enough balloons.\n\nWhat about 23 bouquets? 23 times 7 is 161. 179 minus 161 is 18 balloons left. Again, she can't make another complete bouquet with those 18 balloons, so she could make 23 bouquets plus some balloons left over, but the question asks for the number of bouquets she can make, assuming she uses all the balloons in complete bouquets.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of complete bouquets, she should make as many as possible without any leftover balloons. But since she has 179 balloons and 7 per bouquet, dividing 179 by 7 gives 25 bouquets with 4 balloons left over.\n\nAlternatively, if she could adjust the number of balloons per bouquet, but the problem says she needs to put 7 balloons in each bouquet. So, she has to stick with that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 25 bouquets.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. Maybe the type of balloons or some other constraints, but the problem doesn't specify anything like that. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. 25 bouquets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
