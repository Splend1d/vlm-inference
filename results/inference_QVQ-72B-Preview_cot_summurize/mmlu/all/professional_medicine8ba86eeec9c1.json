The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent.

                    "text": "So I've got this case about a 70-year-old woman who's been experiencing worsening tremors in her hands. She says she's had a mild tremor most of her life, but lately, it's gotten worse and more frequent, especially when she's tired or stressed. Now, it's so bad that she feels embarrassed to eat in public because of the shaking. She recently started taking fluoxetine about three weeks ago to help cope with the loss of her husband two months back. She also has essential hypertension, which is controlled with lisinopril, and hyperlipidemia, managed with atorvastatin. Occasionally, she takes ibuprofen for joint pain. Interestingly, she mentions that drinking a glass of wine daily seems to reduce her tremor, whereas before, she only drank one to two alcoholic beverages a month.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, essential tremor is a common movement disorder that typically affects the hands and can run in families. It often worsens with stress or fatigue, which matches her description. But she's saying it's gotten significantly worse over the past month, and she's been on fluoxetine for three weeks. Could the fluoxetine be causing or worsening the tremor?\n\nI know that some medications can cause tremors as a side effect, and fluoxetine is an SSRI antidepressant. SSRIs can sometimes cause tremors, especially in higher doses or in certain individuals. Maybe that's contributing to her worsening tremor.\n\nBut wait, she's been having this tremor most of her life, so it's not entirely new. The fluoxetine might be exacerbating an existing condition. Alternatively, perhaps the stress of her husband's death could be playing a role in worsening her tremor.\n\nShe also reports that alcohol seems to help reduce her tremor, which is interesting because in essential tremor, alcohol is sometimes known to temporarily alleviate symptoms. That might be why she's noticed some improvement after drinking wine.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy\n\nB. Bereavement reaction\n\nC. Early Parkinson disease\n\nD. Increase in alcohol consumption\n\nStarting with option A: fluoxetine causing the tremor. As I thought earlier, fluoxetine can indeed cause tremors, especially in older adults or in higher doses. Given that she started it three weeks ago, and her tremor has worsened in the past month, there might be a temporal relationship there. However, essential tremor can also progress over time, especially with increasing age and stress, which she's undoubtedly under due to her husband's passing.\n\nOption B: bereavement reaction. Losing a spouse is a significant stressor, and it can manifest in various ways, including worsening of existing medical conditions. Stress can exacerbate essential tremor, so it's possible that her grief is contributing to the worsening of her tremor. But again, fluoxetine could also be a factor here.\n\nOption C: early Parkinson disease. Parkinson's typically starts after age 50, with tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The tremor in Parkinson's is usually resting tremor, meaning it occurs when the limbs are at rest and can decrease with movement. In contrast, essential tremor is more prominent during action or intention movements and is often absent at rest. In this patient, the tremor is described as not present at rest, which aligns more with essential tremor than Parkinson's. However, sometimes, Parkinson's can present with action tremors, especially in the early stages. But given her long history of tremor, it seems more likely that she has essential tremor that's worsening with age and stress.\n\nOption D: increase in alcohol consumption. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily. While alcohol can affect tremors, especially in essential tremor, where it might temporarily reduce symptoms, increasing alcohol consumption isn't typically a cause of worsening tremor. In fact, some people with essential tremor report that alcohol helps lessen their tremors, which seems to be the case here. So, it's unlikely that the increase in alcohol consumption is causing her tremor to worsen.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most likely cause of her worsening tremor is a combination of her existing essential tremor progressing with age and the potential exacerbating effect of fluoxetine. Given that she's been on fluoxetine for only three weeks, it's possible that the medication is contributing to the recent worsening of her tremor.\n\nI should also consider that fluoxetine might be interacting with her other medications or with alcohol, although atorvastatin and lisinopril are generally well-tolerated with fluoxetine. Ibuprofen might interact with fluoxetine, but I'd have to look that up.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps her hypertension or hyperlipidemia is worsening, leading to changes in her neurological status, but that seems less likely since her conditions are controlled with medication.\n\nAlso, her BMI is 25 kg/m2, which is within the normal range, so weight isn't a factor here.\n\nGiven the information provided, I would lean towards option A: adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy, combined with the natural progression of her essential tremor. However, I should keep in mind that bereavement (option B) could also be a contributing factor, given the recent loss of her husband and the stress associated with it.\n\nTo make a more informed decision, I'd need to review her medication dosages, check for any recent changes in her health or medications, and possibly consult with a neurologist or a movement disorders specialist. Additionally, the results of her complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and thyroid function tests might provide more insights, although they're pending at this time.\n\nIn summary, the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor is an adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy, potentially exacerbating her underlying essential tremor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
