To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nWhich of the following resources would the author of the second passage have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's about two passages from historical figures in India and what was then the Hudson's Bay Company's territory. The first passage is from William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India, discussing the practice of sati and whether to continue or prohibit it. The second passage is from George Simpson, who talks about ruling Indians with a \"rod of iron\" and making them dependent on the goods provided by the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nThe question is asking which resource the author of the second passage, George Simpson, would have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives. The options are ivory, tobacco, silver, or furs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who George Simpson was and what his role was with the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826. The Hudson's Bay Company was a fur trading company based in Canada, and it had significant influence in North America during that time. So, Simpson was the head of the northern department of this company.\n\nGiven that the Hudson's Bay Company was primarily involved in the fur trade, it's reasonable to assume that furs were a major part of their business. They traded with Indigenous peoples for furs, which were then sold in European markets, particularly for fashion purposes.\n\nNow, looking at the second passage, Simpson mentions selling foodstuffs and manufactured goods to the Indigenous people, making them dependent on these supplies. This suggests that the company was not only trading but also trying to control the Indigenous populations by making them reliant on company-provided goods.\n\nGiven this context, it seems logical that the resource Simpson would be most interested in obtaining from the local natives is furs, as that was the primary commodity the Hudson's Bay Company dealt in during that period.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nA. Ivory: Ivory was primarily obtained from elephants, which are found in Africa and Asia. Since the Hudson's Bay Company operated in North America, it's unlikely that they would be involved in trading ivory from local natives.\n\nB. Tobacco: Tobacco was grown in various parts of North America, and while it was a significant crop in some regions, especially in the southeastern United States, the Hudson's Bay Company's main operations were in the northern regions, where tobacco cultivation was less common. Moreover, the company was more known for fur trading than tobacco trading.\n\nC. Silver: Silver mining and trading did occur in North America, but again, the Hudson's Bay Company was primarily a fur trading enterprise. While they might have been involved in some mineral trading, their main focus was on furs.\n\nD. Furs: As mentioned earlier, furs were the primary commodity of the Hudson's Bay Company. They had extensive networks and forts set up for the purpose of trading furs with Indigenous peoples.\n\nConsidering all this, it's clear that George Simpson, as the head of the northern department of the Hudson's Bay Company, would have been most interested in obtaining furs from the local natives.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, I should think about whether there might be any specific historical context or events around 1826 that could influence this.\n\nIn the 1820s, the Hudson's Bay Company was facing competition from other fur trading companies, such as the North West Company, which merged with the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821. This consolidation likely strengthened the Hudson's Bay Company's position in the fur trade.\n\nAdditionally, during this period, the demand for beaver pelts was high in Europe for making hats and other fashion items. This demand drove much of the company's activities.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical context and the nature of the Hudson's Bay Company's operations, furs remain the most plausible answer.\n\nAnother point to consider is that Simpson's statement about making the Indigenous people dependent on foodstuffs and manufactured goods suggests that the company was involved in supplying these items in exchange for furs. This further reinforces the idea that furs were the primary resource they were seeking from the locals.\n\nIn conclusion, the author of the second passage, George Simpson, would have been most likely interested in obtaining furs from local natives. So, the correct answer is D. Furs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
