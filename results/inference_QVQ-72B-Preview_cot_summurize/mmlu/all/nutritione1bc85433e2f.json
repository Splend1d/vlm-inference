Head circumference. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that growth assessment is important in children because it helps track their development and health over time. But I'm not sure if it's just about measuring height or weight or both.\n\nLet me think about this. In pediatric check-ups, doctors usually measure both height and weight, right? They plot these measurements on growth charts to see how a child is growing compared to others of the same age and sex. So, maybe both weight and height are important.\n\nBut why would they measure both? Well, weight can indicate if a child is getting enough nutrition, but height is also crucial because it shows long-term growth trends. Some kids might be heavy but not tall, or vice versa, so measuring both gives a better picture.\n\nWait, but what about head circumference? I remember that in infants and young children, head circumference is measured because it can indicate brain growth. So, maybe in routine practice, especially for younger kids, head circumference is also important.\n\nBut the question is asking for assessing growth in routine practice, and it's multiple choice with options A. Height only, B. Weight only, C. Weight and height, D. Head circumference. So, I need to choose among these options.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Height only: While height is important for long-term growth, it doesn't give information about weight or body composition. So, relying on height only might miss some aspects of growth.\n\nB. Weight only: Weight can fluctuate based on many factors, like fluid retention or recent meals, and doesn't provide information about height or proportions. So, again, not comprehensive.\n\nC. Weight and height: This seems more comprehensive. By measuring both, healthcare providers can calculate things like BMI (Body Mass Index), which helps assess if a child is underweight, overweight, or obese. Also, plotting both weight and height on growth charts helps monitor growth patterns over time.\n\nD. Head circumference: This is particularly important in infants and young children because it can reflect brain growth. However, once a child gets older, head circumference becomes less relevant for general growth assessment.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best answer is C. Weight and height. Measuring both provides a more complete picture of a child's growth and health status over time.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is head circumference considered part of routine growth assessment in all age groups? Probably not, since it's more relevant for younger children. So, maybe it's not included in routine practice for all ages.\n\nAlso, while head circumference is important for monitoring brain growth in infants, it's not the only measure, and it's not as relevant for older children or adolescents.\n\nSo, in routine practice, for a general growth assessment, measuring weight and height seems to be the standard approach.\n\nI think I'll go with option C. Weight and height.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
