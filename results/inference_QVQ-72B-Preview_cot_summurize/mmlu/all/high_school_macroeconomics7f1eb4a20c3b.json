The options are:\n\nA. quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nB. week; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nC. month; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nD. month; The Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nFirst, I know that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is a measure of the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a specific period. So, it's an important economic indicator.\n\nNow, I need to recall how frequently GDP is calculated. I think it's usually done on a quarterly basis. Yeah, that sounds familiar. Most countries report GDP on a quarterly basis, and then annualize it for comparison.\n\nLet me confirm that. Quarterly means four times a year, right? Like, first quarter is January to March, second quarter is April to June, and so on. That makes sense.\n\nBut just to be sure, I'll think about when GDP data is typically released. In the United States, for example, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) releases GDP data every quarter. I think they do preliminary estimates and then revisions later on.\n\nWait, is there also monthly GDP data? Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. I know that there are monthly economic indicators like retail sales and industrial production, but GDP itself is more comprehensive and takes time to compile, so it's probably not done monthly.\n\nWhat about weekly? That seems too frequent for GDP calculations. GDP involves a lot of data collection and analysis, which can't be done that quickly. So, weekly seems unlikely.\n\nLet me consider the agencies mentioned. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and it's responsible for producing economic accounts statistics, including GDP. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is another agency under the Department of Labor, and they focus on labor statistics like unemployment rates and inflation indices.\n\nSo, GDP is definitely the purview of the BEA, not the BLS. Therefore, options A and C mention the BEA, while B and D mention the BLS. Since BLS doesn't calculate GDP, I can eliminate options B and D.\n\nNow, between options A and C, which one is correct? Quarterly or monthly?\n\nAs I thought earlier, GDP is calculated quarterly. Monthly calculations would be too frequent and probably not feasible given the data collection requirements. Moreover, official GDP figures are released quarterly by the BEA.\n\nTo double-check, I can recall that in economics classes, we always refer to GDP as a quarterly measure. Annual GDP is just the sum of the four quarters, sometimes adjusted for inflation.\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer: quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there's any possibility of monthly GDP calculations. While there might be some private sector estimates or experimental statistics that provide monthly GDP estimates, the official GDP data is indeed released quarterly by the BEA.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
