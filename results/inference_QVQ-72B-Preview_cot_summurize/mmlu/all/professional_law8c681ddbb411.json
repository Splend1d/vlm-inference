                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the creditor can collect $2,000 from the buyer of a car sold by the debtor. The debtor had a $2,000 debt to the creditor, but the statute of limitations has run out, so the creditor can't directly collect from the debtor anymore. Then, the debtor sells his car to a buyer and, in a written agreement, the buyer promises to pay the $2,000 directly to the creditor \"in satisfaction of [the debtor's] debt to [the creditor].\"\n\nAlright, so the question is whether the creditor can now recover the $2,000 from the buyer. There are four options:\n\nA. No, because paying the $2,000 to the creditor would go against the public policy expressed in the statute of limitations, which prevents enforcing old claims.\n\nB. No, because even though the creditor is an intended beneficiary of the agreement between the debtor and the buyer, the buyer can still raise any defenses that could be used between the debtor and the buyer themselves.\n\nC. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor, regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay anything.\n\nD. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor revives the otherwise uncollectible debt.\n\nHmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations, meaning the creditor can't sue the debtor to collect it anymore. But the debtor sells his car to a buyer, and in the sale agreement, the buyer promises to pay the $2,000 to the creditor to satisfy the debtor's old debt.\n\nSo, the question is whether this new agreement between the buyer and the creditor is enforceable, despite the original debt being uncollectible due to the statute of limitations.\n\nOption A says no, because enforcing this would undermine the policy behind the statute of limitations, which is to prevent old, stale claims from being brought after too much time has passed. But is that directly applicable here? The original debt is barred by the statute, but this is a new agreement involving a third party, the buyer.\n\nOption B says no, because even if the creditor is an intended beneficiary of this agreement, the buyer can still raise any defenses that could be used between the debtor and the buyer. But I'm not sure what defenses would apply here. The buyer agreed in writing to pay the $2,000 to the creditor.\n\nOption C says yes, because the buyer's promise is enforceable by the creditor, regardless of the debtor's legal obligation. This seems plausible. The buyer made a direct promise to the creditor, so perhaps the creditor can enforce that promise directly.\n\nOption D says yes, because the buyer's promise revives the otherwise uncollectible debt. I'm not sure about that. Reviving a debt usually involves the debtor\u91cd\u65b0\u627f\u8ba4\u503a\u52a1\uff0cbut here it's the buyer making the promise, not the debtor.\n\nWait, the debtor is the one who owed the original debt, but it's the buyer who's promising to pay it. So, it's not the debtor reviving their own debt; it's a third party agreeing to pay it.\n\nSo, maybe revival doesn't apply here.\n\nLet me think about third-party beneficiary contracts. In contract law, when a contract is made for the benefit of a third party, that third party can sometimes enforce the contract.\n\nHere, the agreement between the buyer and the debtor specifies that the buyer will pay the $2,000 to the creditor \"in satisfaction of [the debtor's] debt to [the creditor].\"\n\nSo, the creditor is an intended beneficiary of this agreement, right? The purpose is to satisfy the debtor's debt to the creditor.\n\nBut option B says no, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\n\nWhat defenses could the buyer have against the creditor? The buyer might argue that they were induced into the agreement based on some misrepresentation or that there was some duress involved, but the scenario doesn't provide any information suggesting that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buyer could argue that since the original debt is barred by the statute of limitations, the creditor has no enforceable claim against the debtor, so the buyer shouldn't be required to pay.\n\nBut, the buyer made a separate promise to pay the creditor, so maybe that stands on its own.\n\nWait, maybe it's like assuming the debt. If the buyer agrees to pay the debtor's debt to the creditor, and it's in writing, signed by the buyer, then perhaps the creditor can enforce that promise.\n\nBut option A argues that enforcing it would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims. Is that a valid point?\n\nWell, the statute of limitations is designed to promote certainty and prevent people from being sued over very old debts where evidence might be lost or memories faded. But in this case, it's not the creditor suing the debtor for the old debt; it's the creditor seeking payment from the buyer based on the buyer's new promise.\n\nSo, maybe the policy behind the statute of limitations doesn't directly apply here because it's a new agreement.\n\nOption C seems strong because the buyer made a clear promise to pay the creditor, and the creditor is an intended beneficiary of that promise.\n\nOption D suggests that the buyer's promise revives the uncollectible debt, but I'm not sure that's accurate. Revival typically requires the debtor to acknowledge the debt or make a payment on it, not a third party like the buyer.\n\nSo, perhaps revival doesn't apply here.\n\nOption B suggests that the creditor's rights are subject to any defenses the buyer has against the debtor. But what defenses would the buyer have against the debtor in this scenario? The buyer bought the car and agreed to pay the debt; unless there was some fraud or other issue with the car sale, it's not clear what defenses would be available.\n\nMaybe the buyer could argue that the debt is unenforceable, but that seems like a defense against the creditor, not against the debtor.\n\nWait, perhaps the buyer could argue that since the debt is barred by the statute of limitations, the creditor has no enforceable claim, so the buyer's promise is void for lack of consideration or something like that.\n\nBut, the buyer received the car in exchange for the promise to pay the $2,000 to the creditor, so there was consideration for the buyer's promise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the buyer's promise is a novation or debt assumption, and since the original debt is unenforceable, the assumption is also unenforceable.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. If the buyer voluntarily agrees to pay the debt, even knowing it's unenforceable, perhaps that agreement is still binding.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me look up some case law or legal principles that might apply here.\n\nFirst, third-party beneficiary contracts: Generally, when a contract is made for the benefit of a third party, that third party can enforce the contract if they are an intended beneficiary.\n\nIn this case, the agreement between the buyer and the debtor specifies that the buyer will pay the $2,000 to the creditor \"in satisfaction of [the debtor's] debt to [the creditor].\"\n\nSo, the creditor is clearly an intended beneficiary.\n\nNow, can the creditor enforce this promise despite the original debt being barred by the statute of limitations?\n\nOne argument is that since the original debt is unenforceable, the buyer's promise to pay it is also unenforceable because it's based on an invalid debt.\n\nBut, the buyer made a separate promise to pay the creditor, and it's in writing, so perhaps the creditor can enforce it directly against the buyer.\n\nOption A says no because it would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims.\n\nBut, the policy behind the statute of limitations is to prevent the original debtor from being sued for old debts where evidence might be lost or memories faded. Here, the buyer is a new party who voluntarily agreed to pay the debt, so perhaps the policy considerations are different.\n\nOption B says no because the creditor's rights are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\n\nBut again, what defenses would the buyer have against the creditor? The buyer and the creditor didn't contract directly; the buyer contracted with the debtor.\n\nUnless there's some privity of contract or something, it's not clear.\n\nOption C says yes because the buyer's promise is enforceable by the creditor regardless of the debtor's legal obligation.\n\nThis seems compelling. The buyer made a promise to the creditor, and the creditor is an intended beneficiary, so the creditor should be able to enforce that promise.\n\nOption D says yes because the buyer's promise revived the uncollectible debt.\n\nI'm not sure about that. Revival typically involves the debtor\u91cd\u65b0\u627f\u8ba4\u503a\u52a1\uff0cnot a third party like the buyer agreeing to pay it.\n\nSo, maybe revival isn't the right concept here.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C: Yes, because the buyer's promise is enforceable by the creditor regardless of the debtor's legal obligation.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any exceptions or if the statute of limitations would prevent the creditor from enforcing the buyer's promise.\n\nSuppose the buyer pays the $2,000 to the creditor. Would that payment be enforceable against the buyer if the buyer later claims that the debt was barred by the statute of limitations?\n\nWell, the buyer voluntarily agreed to pay the debt, so perhaps the payment is valid even if the original debt was unenforceable.\n\nAlternatively, if the buyer pays the debt and then sues the debtor to recover it, the debtor could raise the statute of limitations as a defense.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's the creditor seeking to enforce the buyer's promise.\n\nI think the key here is that the buyer made a new promise to pay the debt, and that promise is enforceable by the creditor as a third-party beneficiary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
