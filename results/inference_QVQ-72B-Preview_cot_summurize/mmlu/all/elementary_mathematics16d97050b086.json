The question is asking for the difference between these two numbers, and I have to pick which range that difference falls into. The options are:\n\nA. 1,300 and 1,500\n\nB. 1,000 and 1,200\n\nC. 700 and 900\n\nD. 400 and 600\n\nOkay, so first thing I should do is estimate the subtraction. 999 minus 103.\n\nOne way to approach this is to round the numbers to make the subtraction easier. For example, I can round 999 to 1000. So, 1000 minus 103.\n\nThat would be 1000 - 100 = 900, and then 900 - 3 = 897.\n\nBut wait, I rounded 999 up to 1000. So, the actual subtraction should give me a slightly smaller number than 897, because 999 is less than 1000.\n\nLet me check that. If I subtract 103 from 999:\n\n999\n\n-103\n\n------\n\n896\n\nSo, the exact answer is 896.\n\nNow, I need to see which range 896 falls into from the options given.\n\nOption A is 1,300 to 1,500. That's way higher than 896.\n\nOption B is 1,000 to 1,200. Still higher than 896.\n\nOption C is 700 to 900. That seems promising because 896 is within that range.\n\nOption D is 400 to 600. That's lower than 896.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct choice should be Option C: 700 and 900.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's another way to estimate.\n\nAnother method could be to break down the numbers.\n\n999 can be thought of as 1000 - 1.\n\nSo, 1000 - 1 - 103 = 1000 - 104 = 896.\n\nAgain, that confirms the exact difference is 896.\n\nSince 896 falls within the range of 700 to 900, Option C is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes there. It seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
