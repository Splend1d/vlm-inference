                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on calculus, but I remember that acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time. So, if I have a position equation, I need to find the first derivative to get the velocity and then the second derivative to get the acceleration.\n\nThe position equation given is:\n\nx = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25\n\nWhere x is in meters and t is in seconds.\n\nFirst, I need to find the first derivative of x with respect to t to get the velocity, v.\n\nSo, v = dx/dt = d(2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25)/dt\n\nI can differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe derivative of 2.0t^3 is 3*2.0t^2 = 6.0t^2\n\nThe derivative of 4.0t is 4.0\n\nThe derivative of 6.25 (a constant) is 0\n\nSo, v = 6.0t^2 + 4.0\n\nNow, I need to find the second derivative, which is the acceleration, a.\n\na = dv/dt = d(6.0t^2 + 4.0)/dt\n\nAgain, differentiate each term.\n\nThe derivative of 6.0t^2 is 2*6.0t = 12.0t\n\nThe derivative of 4.0 is 0\n\nSo, a = 12.0t\n\nNow, I need to find the acceleration at t = 1.50 s.\n\nPlug t = 1.50 into the acceleration equation:\n\na = 12.0 * 1.50 = 18.0 m/s\u00b2\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6 m/s\u00b2\n\nB. 12 m/s\u00b2\n\nC. 18 m/s\u00b2\n\nD. 24 m/s\u00b2\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 18 m/s\u00b2\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using the coefficients directly.\n\nI know that in constant acceleration motion, the position can be described by:\n\nx = x\u2080 + v\u2080t + (1/2)at\u00b2\n\nBut in this problem, the position equation is a third-degree polynomial, which suggests that acceleration isn't constant.\n\nWait, the equation here is x = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25\n\nSo, it's a function of t to the third power, which implies that acceleration is changing.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a third-degree polynomial, the acceleration is indeed variable, but for the purpose of this problem, we're to find the instantaneous acceleration at t = 1.50 s, which we've calculated as 18.0 m/s\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the units.\n\nAcceleration is m/s\u00b2, which matches what I have.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the third derivative of position, which would give jerk (the rate of change of acceleration), but I don't think that's necessary here since the question only asks for acceleration.\n\nAlso, since there are no other forces or factors mentioned, I can assume that the only acceleration is coming from the derivative of the position function.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 18 m/s\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18\\ \\text{m/s}^{2}} \\]"
