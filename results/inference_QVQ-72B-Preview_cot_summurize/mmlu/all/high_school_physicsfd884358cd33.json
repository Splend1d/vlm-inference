                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a small cart of mass \\(m\\) that's initially at rest. It collides elastically with a larger cart of mass \\(4m\\) that's moving at velocity \\(v\\). After the collision, the large cart loses half of its kinetic energy to the small cart. We need to find the velocity of the small cart after the collision.\n\nFirst, since the collision is elastic, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. That's important. Let's denote the velocities after the collision as \\(v_m\\) for the small cart and \\(v_{4m}\\) for the large cart.\n\nSo, the equations we'll use are:\n\n1. Conservation of momentum:\n\n\\[\nm \\cdot 0 + 4m \\cdot v = m \\cdot v_m + 4m \\cdot v_{4m}\n\\]\n\n2. Conservation of kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m \\cdot v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m \\cdot v_m^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m \\cdot v_{4m}^2\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the large cart loses half of its kinetic energy to the small cart. So, the kinetic energy of the large cart after the collision is half of what it was before the collision.\n\nLet's calculate the initial kinetic energy of the large cart:\n\n\\[\nKE_{\\text{initial, large}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m \\cdot v^2 = 2m v^2\n\\]\n\nAfter the collision, it loses half of its kinetic energy to the small cart, meaning its final kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[\nKE_{\\text{final, large}} = 2m v^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2m v^2 = m v^2\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If it loses half its kinetic energy, then its final kinetic energy should be half of the initial kinetic energy, which is \\(m v^2\\), as I just calculated.\n\nBut let's confirm this. Initial kinetic energy is \\(2m v^2\\), losing half means losing \\(m v^2\\), so final kinetic energy is \\(m v^2\\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"loses half its kinetic energy to the small cart.\" So, the small cart gains this energy. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nKE_{\\text{final, small}} = \\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2m v^2 = m v^2\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the large cart loses half its kinetic energy, which is \\(m v^2\\), and this energy is transferred to the small cart, then the small cart's kinetic energy should be \\(m v^2\\). But that would mean:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 = m v^2 \\implies v_m^2 = 2 v^2 \\implies v_m = \\sqrt{2 v^2} = v \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41v\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's one of the options. But let's verify if this satisfies both conservation laws.\n\nFirst, let's write down the conservation of momentum equation:\n\n\\[\n0 + 4m v = m v_m + 4m v_{4m}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\(v_m = v \\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n4m v = m \\cdot v \\sqrt{2} + 4m v_{4m}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_{4m}\\):\n\n\\[\n4m v - m v \\sqrt{2} = 4m v_{4m} \\implies m v (4 - \\sqrt{2}) = 4m v_{4m} \\implies v_{4m} = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{2}}{4} v\n\\]\n\nNow, let's check the kinetic energy conservation.\n\nInitial kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\n2m v^2\n\\]\n\nFinal kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m v_{4m}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m (v \\sqrt{2})^2 + 2m \\left( \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{2}}{4} v \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m (2 v^2) + 2m \\left( \\frac{16 - 8 \\sqrt{2} + 2}{16} v^2 \\right) = m v^2 + 2m \\left( \\frac{18 - 8 \\sqrt{2}}{16} v^2 \\right) = m v^2 + \\frac{9 - 4 \\sqrt{2}}{8} m v^2\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't seem to equal the initial kinetic energy of \\(2m v^2\\). Maybe I made a mistake in assuming \\(v_m = v \\sqrt{2}\\) directly.\n\nLet's try to solve the equations properly.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. \\(4m v = m v_m + 4m v_{4m}\\) ... (1)\n\n2. \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m v_{4m}^2\\) ... (2)\n\nAnd from the problem, the large cart loses half its kinetic energy, meaning:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m v^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m v_{4m}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m v^2 / 2 \\implies 2m v^2 - 2m v_{4m}^2 = m v^2 \\implies 2m v^2 - m v^2 = 2m v_{4m}^2 \\implies m v^2 = 2m v_{4m}^2 \\implies v_{4m}^2 = \\frac{v^2}{2} \\implies v_{4m} = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems off because the large cart should have a velocity less than \\(v\\) after losing energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the energy transfer. Let's re-express the energy condition.\n\nThe large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the small cart. So, the small cart gains \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m v^2 / 2 = m v^2\\), meaning its final kinetic energy is \\(m v_m^2 / 2 = m v^2\\), so \\(v_m^2 / 2 = v^2\\), hence \\(v_m^2 = 2 v^2\\), and thus \\(v_m = v \\sqrt{2}\\), which is approximately \\(1.41v\\).\n\nBut as we saw, this doesn't satisfy the momentum conservation. Maybe I need to solve the equations simultaneously.\n\nLet's rearrange equation (1):\n\n\\[\nv_{4m} = \\frac{4m v - m v_m}{4m} = v - \\frac{v_m}{4}\n\\]\n\nPlug this into equation (2):\n\n\\[\n2m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 + 2m \\left( v - \\frac{v_m}{4} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nExpand the squared term:\n\n\\[\n2m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 + 2m \\left( v^2 - \\frac{v_m v}{2} + \\frac{v_m^2}{16} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 + 2m v^2 - m v v_m + \\frac{m v_m^2}{8}\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n0 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) m v_m^2 - m v v_m + (2m v^2 - 2m v^2) = \\left( \\frac{5}{8} \\right) m v_m^2 - m v v_m\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{5}{8} v_m^2 - v v_m \\implies v_m \\left( \\frac{5}{8} v_m - v \\right) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, either \\(v_m = 0\\) or \\(\\frac{5}{8} v_m = v\\), which gives \\(v_m = \\frac{8}{5} v = 1.6v\\).\n\nBut \\(v_m = 0\\) doesn't make sense because the small cart was at rest initially and collides elastically, so it should move. However, \\(v_m = 1.6v\\) doesn't match our earlier assumption of \\(v_m = v \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41v\\), and it also doesn't seem to satisfy the condition that the large cart loses half its kinetic energy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the energy equations. Let's try again.\n\nThe large cart loses half its kinetic energy, meaning its final kinetic energy is half of its initial kinetic energy.\n\nInitial kinetic energy of large cart: \\(2m v^2\\)\n\nFinal kinetic energy of large cart: \\(m v^2\\)\n\nTherefore, the small cart's final kinetic energy should be \\(2m v^2 - m v^2 = m v^2\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 = m v^2 \\implies v_m^2 = 2 v^2 \\implies v_m = v \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41v\n\\]\n\nBut according to the momentum conservation, as we saw earlier, this doesn't hold. Maybe I need to consider the direction of velocities.\n\nLet's assume both carts are moving in the same direction. Let's denote velocities after collision as \\(v_m\\) (small cart) and \\(v_{4m}\\) (large cart), both positive in the direction of initial motion.\n\nConservation of momentum:\n\n\\[\n0 + 4m v = m v_m + 4m v_{4m} \\implies v_m = 4v - 4 v_{4m}\n\\]\n\nConservation of kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\n2m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 + 2m v_{4m}^2 \\implies 4 v^2 = v_m^2 + 4 v_{4m}^2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(v_m\\) from the first equation into the second:\n\n\\[\n4 v^2 = (4v - 4 v_{4m})^2 + 4 v_{4m}^2 \\implies 4 v^2 = 16 v^2 - 32 v v_{4m} + 16 v_{4m}^2 + 4 v_{4m}^2 \\implies 4 v^2 = 16 v^2 - 32 v v_{4m} + 20 v_{4m}^2\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n0 = 12 v^2 - 32 v v_{4m} + 20 v_{4m}^2 \\implies 0 = 6 v^2 - 16 v v_{4m} + 10 v_{4m}^2\n\\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[\n0 = 3 v^2 - 8 v v_{4m} + 5 v_{4m}^2\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic in \\(v_{4m}\\):\n\n\\[\n5 v_{4m}^2 - 8 v v_{4m} + 3 v^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(v_{4m}\\):\n\n\\[\nv_{4m} = \\frac{8v \\pm \\sqrt{64 v^2 - 60 v^2}}{10} = \\frac{8v \\pm \\sqrt{4 v^2}}{10} = \\frac{8v \\pm 2v}{10}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(v_{4m} = \\frac{10v}{10} = v\\) or \\(v_{4m} = \\frac{6v}{10} = 0.6v\\)\n\nNow, plug these back into \\(v_m = 4v - 4 v_{4m}\\):\n\nIf \\(v_{4m} = v\\), then \\(v_m = 4v - 4v = 0\\)\n\nIf \\(v_{4m} = 0.6v\\), then \\(v_m = 4v - 2.4v = 1.6v\\)\n\nNow, check the kinetic energy of the large cart in each case.\n\nFirst case: \\(v_{4m} = v\\), \\(v_m = 0\\)\n\nKinetic energy of large cart after collision: \\(2m v^2\\), which is the same as before. But the problem states it loses half its kinetic energy, so this can't be right.\n\nSecond case: \\(v_{4m} = 0.6v\\), \\(v_m = 1.6v\\)\n\nKinetic energy of large cart after collision: \\(2m (0.6v)^2 = 2m \\cdot 0.36 v^2 = 0.72 m v^2\\)\n\nInitial kinetic energy: \\(2m v^2\\)\n\nEnergy lost by large cart: \\(2m v^2 - 0.72 m v^2 = 1.28 m v^2\\)\n\nBut according to the problem, it should lose half its kinetic energy, which is \\(m v^2\\). So, \\(1.28 m v^2 \\neq m v^2\\). This doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the energy transfer more carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the initial kinetic energy of the large cart as \\(KE_{\\text{initial, large}} = 2m v^2\\). After the collision, it has \\(KE_{\\text{final, large}} = 2m v_{4m}^2\\), and the small cart has \\(KE_{\\text{final, small}} = \\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the small cart. So:\n\n\\[\nKE_{\\text{lost}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2m v^2 = m v^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nKE_{\\text{final, small}} = m v^2 \\implies \\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 = m v^2 \\implies v_m^2 = 2 v^2 \\implies v_m = v \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41v\n\\]\n\nBut as we saw, this doesn't satisfy the momentum conservation with the calculated \\(v_{4m}\\). Maybe I need to consider that the energy lost by the large cart is equal to the energy gained by the small cart, which is \\(m v^2\\), so:\n\n\\[\n2m v^2 - 2m v_{4m}^2 = m v^2 \\implies 2m v^2 - m v^2 = 2m v_{4m}^2 \\implies m v^2 = 2m v_{4m}^2 \\implies v_{4m}^2 = \\frac{v^2}{2} \\implies v_{4m} = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707v\n\\]\n\nNow, plug this back into the momentum equation:\n\n\\[\n4m v = m v_m + 4m \\cdot \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}} \\implies 4v = v_m + 2 \\sqrt{2} v \\implies v_m = 4v - 2 \\sqrt{2} v \\approx 4v - 2.828v = 1.172v\n\\]\n\nThis is different from our earlier calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the energy transfer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the coefficient of restitution since it's an elastic collision, which means e = 1.\n\nThe relative velocity after collision equals the relative velocity before collision:\n\n\\[\nv_{4m} - v_m = v - 0 \\implies v_{4m} - v_m = v \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\n\nAnd from conservation of momentum:\n\n\\[\n4m v = m v_m + 4m v_{4m} \\implies 4v = v_m + 4 v_{4m} \\quad \\text{(4)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\(v_{4m} - v_m = v\\) ... (3)\n\n2. \\(v_m + 4 v_{4m} = 4v\\) ... (4)\n\nLet's solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\n\\[\nv_{4m} = v + v_m\n\\]\n\nPlug this into equation (4):\n\n\\[\nv_m + 4(v + v_m) = 4v \\implies v_m + 4v + 4 v_m = 4v \\implies 5 v_m + 4v = 4v \\implies 5 v_m = 0 \\implies v_m = 0\n\\]\n\nBut this contradicts our earlier assumption that \\(v_m = v \\sqrt{2}\\). There must be an error in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the energy condition properly.\n\nGiven that the large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the small cart, and the small cart gains this energy, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4m v^2 / 2 = m v^2 \\implies v_m^2 = 2 v^2 \\implies v_m = v \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41v\n\\]\n\nBut from the momentum conservation, if \\(v_m = v \\sqrt{2}\\), then:\n\n\\[\n4v = v \\sqrt{2} + 4 v_{4m"
