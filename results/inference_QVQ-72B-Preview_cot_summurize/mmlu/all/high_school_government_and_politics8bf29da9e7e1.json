The question is asking what these voters are most likely to be aware of based on their news consumption. The options are:\n\nA. Which special interest groups have endorsed which candidates\n\nB. The relative strength of each candidate's support, as indicated by public opinion polls\n\nC. Candidates' positions on international issues\n\nD. Candidates' positions on domestic issues\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what television network news typically covers during national elections. News networks often focus on the horse race aspect of elections\u2014meaning they report on who's leading, who's trailing, and how the candidates are doing in the polls. They also cover significant events like debates, rallies, and election nights.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Special interest group endorsements: While endorsements might be mentioned occasionally, especially if they're from prominent groups, I don't think they're the primary focus of news coverage. News networks might not delve deeply into every endorsement, so this might not be the most likely thing voters would be aware of solely from watching TV news.\n\nB. Relative strength of candidates based on polls: This seems very relevant. News networks frequently report on poll numbers, showing which candidates are gaining or losing popularity. These polls can influence public perception and are often a big part of election coverage. So, this seems like a strong possibility.\n\nC. Candidates' positions on international issues: While important, I think that TV news might not always provide in-depth coverage of candidates' detailed positions on international issues. They might touch on broad strokes but not get into specifics. Therefore, voters might not have a comprehensive understanding of these positions just from watching TV news.\n\nD. Candidates' positions on domestic issues: Similar to international issues, TV news might cover general positions on domestic issues like the economy, healthcare, and education, but detailed discussions might be limited. So, again, not necessarily providing a deep understanding.\n\nComparing all the options, I think that the relative strength of candidates as indicated by public opinion polls (option B) is something that TV news networks emphasize heavily. Poll numbers are often presented as headlines or lead stories, making them highly visible to viewers.\n\nOn the other hand, endorsements from special interest groups (option A) might be covered, but not to the same extent. And while candidates' positions on international and domestic issues (options C and D) are important, TV news might not provide the depth needed for voters to fully grasp these positions based solely on news coverage.\n\nTherefore, I would say that voters who rely exclusively on television network news coverage of national elections are most likely to be aware of the relative strength of each candidate's support, as indicated by public opinion polls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
