                    "text": "So I've got this chemical equation here: S(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 SO\u2082(g). And there are four statements A through D about it. I need to figure out which ones are correct. Let's take them one by one.\n\nStarting with A: \"one atom of S reacts with one molecule of O\u2082 to yield one molecule of SO\u2082.\" Okay, so looking at the equation, it's showing one sulfur atom combining with one oxygen molecule to make one molecule of sulfur dioxide. That seems straightforward. But I should make sure about the stoichiometry. The equation is balanced with coefficients of 1 for each reactant and product. So, yes, it's saying one atom of sulfur reacts with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce one molecule of sulfur dioxide. That sounds right to me.\n\nMoving on to B: \"one mole of sulfur atoms reacts with one mole of oxygen molecules to yield one mole of sulfur dioxide molecules.\" This is similar to A but in terms of moles. Moles are a way to count particles in chemistry, right? So, one mole of sulfur would contain about 6.022 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 atoms, and one mole of oxygen molecules would have the same number of molecules. According to the balanced equation, they react in a one-to-one ratio to produce one mole of sulfur dioxide molecules. This seems consistent with the equation, so I think B is also correct.\n\nNow, C: \"the position of equilibrium must be on the product side.\" Hmm, this one is a bit trickier. First off, I need to recall what an equilibrium position means in a chemical reaction. Equilibrium is when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, and the concentrations of reactants and products don't change over time. The position of equilibrium refers to the relative concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium.\n\nThe statement says it \"must be on the product side.\" That would mean that at equilibrium, there are more products than reactants. But looking back at the equation, it's a synthesis reaction where sulfur and oxygen combine to form sulfur dioxide. However, without knowing the equilibrium constant (K\u2090) for this reaction, it's hard to say for sure where the equilibrium lies.\n\nI do know that sulfur dioxide is a stable compound, and the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy. Typically, exothermic reactions favor the formation of products, but I need to confirm if this reaction really does favor the product side at equilibrium.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the reaction is exothermic, which it is, because it's releasing energy, then according to Le Chatelier's principle, lowering the temperature would favor the forward reaction. But that doesn't directly tell me about the equilibrium constant.\n\nMaybe I should look up the equilibrium constant for this reaction. I recall that for many synthesis reactions, especially those that are exothermic and proceed readily in one direction, the equilibrium does favor the products. For example, the synthesis of ammonia in the Haber process is exothermic and favors products at lower temperatures.\n\nAssuming that's the case here, then yes, the equilibrium would lie towards the products. But I'm not entirely sure about the specific value of K\u2090 for this reaction. Maybe I should consider the entropy change as well.\n\nThe reaction combines one solid and one gas to form one gas. So, the total entropy change might be relevant here, which brings me to statement D: \"the entropy increase will be large.\"\n\nEntropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. In this reaction, we have one solid (sulfur) and one gas (oxygen) reacting to form one gas (sulfur dioxide). So, the reactants have one gas and one solid, while the products have one gas.\n\nWait a minute, the number of gas molecules is decreasing from one to one. Oh, no, actually, both reactants and products have one gas molecule per mole. Wait, sulfur is a solid, oxygen is a gas, and sulfur dioxide is a gas. So, the number of gas molecules is the same on both sides: one gas molecule on the reactant side (O\u2082) and one on the product side (SO\u2082). So, there's no change in the number of gas molecules.\n\nBut sulfur is changing from a solid to a gas-like state in the product. Solids have lower entropy than gases because their particles are more ordered. So, forming SO\u2082 gas from S solid and O\u2082 gas would involve an increase in entropy due to the solid turning into a gas.\n\nWait, but the equation shows S(s) + O\u2082(g) \u2192 SO\u2082(g). So, one solid and one gas turning into one gas. So, the entropy change would be positive because a solid is turning into a gas, right? But I need to think carefully about this.\n\nActually, in the reaction, one solid and one gas are turning into one gas. So, the number of gas molecules is decreasing from two (one O\u2082 and one SO\u2082) to one (just SO\u2082)? Wait, no, it's one gas molecule on each side. Wait, no, reactants have one gas molecule (O\u2082), and products have one gas molecule (SO\u2082). So, the number of gas molecules is conserved.\n\nBut the entropy change isn't just about the number of gas molecules; it's also about the change from solid to gas. Since sulfur is a solid and is turning into a gas in the product, that should increase entropy.\n\nBut the answer choices mention \"the entropy increase will be large.\" Is that accurate?\n\nLet me consider the standard entropy changes. Sulfur dioxide is a gas, and sulfur is a solid, so forming a gas from a solid should increase entropy. Oxygen is already a gas, so its entropy doesn't change much.\n\nTherefore, the overall entropy change should be positive due to the conversion of solid sulfur to gaseous sulfur dioxide.\n\nBut is this entropy increase \"large\"? Well, entropy changes can vary, but generally, any change from solid to gas is a significant increase in entropy.\n\nFor example, the entropy of vaporization for water is around 44 J/K/mol, which is a substantial increase.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, forming SO\u2082 gas from solid sulfur would involve a significant entropy increase.\n\nSo, I think D is correct: the entropy increase will be large.\n\nNow, going back to C, since the reaction is exothermic and entropy-increasing, it's likely that the equilibrium favors the products.\n\nI recall that for a reaction where both enthalpy change (\u0394H) and entropy change (\u0394S) are favorable, the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G) should be negative, promoting the formation of products.\n\nGiven that \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S, if \u0394H is negative (exothermic) and \u0394S is positive (entropy increases), then \u0394G is negative, which favors the formation of products.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium position should indeed favor the products.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, statements A, B, C, and D all seem to be correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is probably expecting to select multiple correct options, perhaps indicating which statements are true.\n\nBut in any case, based on my analysis, all four statements appear to be correct.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nA: The equation shows one atom of S reacting with one molecule of O\u2082 to yield one molecule of SO\u2082. That matches the balanced equation.\n\nB: Talking about moles, one mole of S reacts with one mole of O\u2082 to yield one mole of SO\u2082. That's consistent with the stoichiometry.\n\nC: The equilibrium position favors products because the reaction is exothermic and entropy-increasing, leading to a negative \u0394G.\n\nD: Entropy increases significantly due to the conversion of solid to gas.\n\nTherefore, all statements A through D are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A, B, C, D} \\]"
