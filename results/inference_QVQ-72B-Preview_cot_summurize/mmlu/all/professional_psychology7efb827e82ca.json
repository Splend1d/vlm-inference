                    "text": "So I've got this question here about marital discord and child behavior problems. It says that Carol and Jim are having marital difficulties, and they have two school-aged children, a boy and a girl. Based on a meta-analysis of research on this topic, which of the following would be expected regarding the likelihood of their children manifesting immediate behavior problems?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Neither child is more likely to manifest an immediate behavior problem than are children of stable marriages.\n\nB. The girl is more likely than the boy to manifest an immediate behavior problem.\n\nC. The boy is more likely than the girl to manifest an immediate behavior problem.\n\nD. Both children are equally likely to manifest an immediate behavior problem.\n\nAlright, so first off, I need to understand what a meta-analysis is. From what I recall, a meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies. So, in this case, it's combining research on the relationship between marital discord and child behavior problems.\n\nNow, marital discord refers to conflicts or problems in the relationship between spouses. And child behavior problems could refer to a range of issues, like aggression, disobedience, or other difficulties in behavior.\n\nThe question is asking, based on this research, what would be expected regarding the likelihood of these children having behavior problems, and specifically, is there a difference between the boy and the girl.\n\nI need to think about what research has found in this area. I remember that children of parents who have marital problems can be at higher risk for various issues, including behavior problems. But I'm not sure about the gender differences.\n\nLet me consider what I know about gender differences in behavior problems. Generally, boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing behavior problems like aggression and hyperactivity, while girls might be more prone to internalizing problems like anxiety and depression. But this is a general trend, and it might not apply equally in all situations.\n\nBut the question is specifically about immediate behavior problems, possibly meaning externalizing problems that might be more evident right away.\n\nWait, but I need to base my answer on the meta-analysis mentioned. Since it's a meta-analysis, it's combining multiple studies, so it should provide a more robust conclusion than any single study.\n\nI need to think about what typical findings are in this area. From what I recall, research suggests that boys may be more reactive to marital conflict in terms of externalizing behavior problems, at least in some cultures.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look at it differently. Perhaps the answer is that both children are equally likely to manifest behavior problems, but the types of problems might differ based on gender.\n\nHowever, the options are about likelihood, not about the type of problems.\n\nOption A says neither child is more likely to have behavior problems than children from stable marriages. But that seems counterintuitive because the meta-analysis is likely to show some increased risk for children from homes with marital discord.\n\nOption B suggests the girl is more likely than the boy to have behavior problems. But as I thought earlier, boys might be more prone to externalizing problems in response to family stress.\n\nOption C says the boy is more likely than the girl to have behavior problems, which aligns somewhat with my initial thoughts.\n\nOption D says both are equally likely, which could also be a possibility.\n\nI need to think more carefully. Maybe I should consider the stress generated by parental conflict and how children respond to that stress.\n\nParental conflict can create a stressful home environment, which can affect children's emotional and behavioral development. Research has shown that chronic exposure to marital conflict can lead to various negative outcomes in children, including behavior problems.\n\nBut again, regarding gender differences, I'm a bit unsure.\n\nLet me try to recall specific studies or review articles on this topic. I think there is evidence that boys may be more vulnerable to the effects of marital discord in terms of externalizing behavior problems, while girls might be more affected in terms of internalizing problems.\n\nHowever, the question specifies immediate behavior problems, which might suggest externalizing behaviors that are more readily observable.\n\nSo, if boys are more prone to externalizing problems in response to marital discord, then option C might be correct.\n\nBut I need to confirm this. Maybe I should consider the age of the children as well. They are school-aged, so probably around 6 to 12 years old.\n\nIn this age group, boys are generally more likely to exhibit externalizing behavior problems, regardless of family context. But when you add the factor of marital discord, does that change things?\n\nI think that marital discord can exacerbate existing tendencies. So if boys are already more prone to externalizing problems, then the stress of parental conflict might make it worse.\n\nOn the other hand, girls might internalize the stress more, leading to different types of problems that might not be immediately observable as behavior problems.\n\nBut the question is specifically about immediate behavior problems, which are likely to be more externalizing in nature.\n\nSo, perhaps the boy is more likely to manifest these problems immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both children are equally likely to have behavior problems, but the types differ.\n\nBut the options are about likelihood, not about the type of problems.\n\nOption D suggests both are equally likely, which might be a possibility, but perhaps the research shows a difference.\n\nOption A says neither is more likely than children from stable marriages, which seems unlikely given the established research on the effects of marital discord.\n\nOption B suggests the girl is more likely, but that contradicts what I know about externalizing behaviors being more common in boys.\n\nOption C suggests the boy is more likely, which aligns with my understanding.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nMaybe I should consider the idea that girls might be more resilient in some ways or that they express their distress differently, which might not be captured under \"immediate behavior problems.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some research, girls are found to be more affected.\n\nBut based on what I know, I think option C is the most plausible answer.\n\nSo, my final choice would be option C: the boy is more likely than the girl to manifest an immediate behavior problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
