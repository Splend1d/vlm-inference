                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about import quotas. So, an import quota is like a limit on how much of a certain good can be imported into a country, right? I think it's usually set by the government to protect domestic producers from foreign competition. Now, the question is asking about a predictable consequence of implementing such a quota.\n\nOption A says increased competition and lower consumer prices. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. If there's a quota on imports, meaning fewer imports are allowed, then the supply of that good in the market should decrease. With less supply, prices might actually go up, not down. So, lower consumer prices seem unlikely. Maybe competition decreases too, since fewer foreign producers can enter the market. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B mentions increased government tax revenue from imported goods. Well, if there's a quota, meaning only a certain amount can be imported, and assuming that the government imposes taxes on those imports, then with fewer imports, the total tax revenue might actually decrease, unless the tax rate is adjusted. So, increased tax revenue doesn't necessarily follow from implementing a quota. Maybe not the right answer.\n\nOption C talks about rising net exports and a rightward shift in aggregate supply. Net exports are exports minus imports. If imports are restricted due to a quota, then imports decrease, which would increase net exports. That makes sense. But aggregate supply is about the total output of goods and services in the economy. A quota on imports might affect specific industries, but it's not clear if it would shift the entire aggregate supply curve to the right. Maybe not directly.\n\nOption D says higher consumer prices and a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers. Okay, so if imports are restricted, the supply decreases, which could lead to higher prices. That seems plausible. And since quotas can protect less efficient domestic producers from more efficient foreign producers, it might lead to a misallocation of resources. That also makes sense.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: decreased competition and higher prices, not increased competition and lower prices.\n\n- B: quotas limit imports, which might reduce tax revenue unless compensated by higher tax rates.\n\n- C: net exports might rise, but aggregate supply isn't directly affected.\n\n- D: higher prices and misallocation of resources seem likely consequences.\n\nSo, D seems to be the most accurate answer based on my understanding.\n\nWait a minute, let's think about aggregate supply again. Aggregate supply is the total supply of goods and services in an economy at a given price level. A quota on imports affects only specific goods, not the overall production capacity or the cost of production factors. Therefore, it's unlikely to shift the aggregate supply curve. So, option C's mention of a rightward shift in aggregate supply might be incorrect.\n\nAlso, regarding option A, even though imports are restricted, leading to less competition in the domestic market, which could allow domestic producers to raise prices, it doesn't necessarily mean that consumer prices will decrease. In fact, with less supply, prices might increase.\n\nOption B assumes that tax revenue from imports increases, but with a quota that limits the quantity of imports, total tax revenue might decrease unless the per-unit tax is increased significantly.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate: higher consumer prices due to restricted supply and misallocation of resources because protected domestic producers may be less efficient than foreign producers.\n\nI think the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
