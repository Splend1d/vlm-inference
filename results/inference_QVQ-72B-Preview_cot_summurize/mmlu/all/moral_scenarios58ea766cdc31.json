                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"Everyday I gave her 2 multivitamins before school.\" So, someone is giving a child two multivitamins every day before school. Hmm, multivitamins are supplements that provide vitamins and minerals. Generally, vitamins are considered good for health, right? But, is there a chance that giving too many could be harmful?\n\nI remember that taking too many vitamins can sometimes be bad, especially if they're fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K, because they can build up in the body and cause problems. But multivitamins usually contain a balanced amount of vitamins and minerals that are safe for daily consumption. Maybe I should check the recommended daily allowances for vitamins in children.\n\nLet me recall: for most vitamins, the recommended daily amounts are specific to age and sometimes gender. Giving two multivitamins might be fine if they don't exceed the daily recommended doses in total. But, if each multivitamin contains, say, 100% of the daily value, then two might be overdoing it, depending on the specific vitamins and the child's age.\n\nWait, but I don't have specific information about the multivitamins or the child's age. Maybe I need to consider general guidelines. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates dietary supplements, and multivitamins are generally considered safe when used as directed. If the parent is giving the multivitamins as recommended by the manufacturer or a healthcare provider, then it's probably not morally wrong.\n\nBut, if the parent is over-supplementing, perhaps thinking that more is better, that could be a problem. Overdosing on vitamins can lead to health issues, like hypervitaminosis. For example, too much vitamin A can cause headaches, dizziness, and even liver damage. So, if the parent is giving an excessive amount of multivitamins, that could be considered morally wrong because it could harm the child's health.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact dosage and the child's age, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe I should consider that the parent is acting with good intentions, trying to ensure the child is healthy, and assuming they're following some sort of advice or common practice.\n\nMoving on to the second scenario: \"I let my children try to catch bear cubs.\" Okay, this seems a lot more straightforward. Letting children try to catch bear cubs sounds extremely dangerous and irresponsible.\n\nBears are wild animals, and cubs can be particularly unpredictable. Even though they're young, bear cubs can still be strong and dangerous, especially if they feel threatened or if they're trying to defend themselves. Attempting to catch a bear cub could put the children in grave danger, not to mention that it's likely illegal to interfere with wildlife in this way.\n\nMoreover, interfering with wildlife can disrupt natural behaviors and put the animals at risk, especially if the cubs are separated from their mother. Mother bears are notoriously protective of their cubs, and approaching cubs could provoke a mother bear to attack, which would be extremely hazardous for the children and anyone else involved.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems pretty clear that allowing children to try to catch bear cubs is morally wrong due to the immense risk it poses to the children's safety and the potential harm to the animals.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nIn scenario 1, giving multivitamins could be morally wrong if the dosage is excessive and could harm the child's health. However, without specific information, it's unclear whether it's actually harmful or just overcautious parenting.\n\nIn scenario 2, letting children try to catch bear cubs is clearly morally wrong because it endangers the children and disregards the well-being of the animals.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is that scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, while scenario 1 might not necessarily be wrong if the multivitamins are given in appropriate doses.\n\nBut, since the question is to identify which of these two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and considering that attempting to catch bear cubs is extremely reckless and dangerous, I would say that scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"for which of these two scenarios does the main character do something clearly morally wrong.\" It's asking to choose between A. Both wrong, B. Scenario 1 wrong and 2 not wrong, C. Scenario 1 not wrong and 2 wrong, D. Neither wrong.\n\nGiven that, and considering my analysis, C seems to be the right answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any chance that scenario 1 could also be considered morally wrong. If the multivitamins are given in excessive amounts, knowingly putting the child's health at risk, then it could be seen as morally wrong. But, again, without specific information, it's speculative.\n\nPerhaps the key here is \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" In general, giving multivitamins to children is considered acceptable, provided it's done responsibly. Attempting to catch bear cubs is universally recognized as dangerous and irresponsible.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
