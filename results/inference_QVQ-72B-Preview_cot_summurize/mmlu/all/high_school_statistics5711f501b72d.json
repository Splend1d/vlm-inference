                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a large department store that serves customers each day, and the number of customers is normally distributed. The mean is 3,250 customers, and the standard deviation is 320. I need to find the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days. There are four options given: A. (3,034, 3,466), B. (2,930, 3,570), C. (2,610, 3,890), and D. (2,450, 4,050).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"middle 50% of days\" means in statistical terms. In a normal distribution, the middle 50% refers to the interval that contains the central 50% of the data. So, 25% below the mean and 25% above the mean.\n\nSince it's a normal distribution, I can use properties of the normal distribution to find this interval. I recall that in a normal distribution, certain percentages of the data fall within certain numbers of standard deviations from the mean.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean (between mean - 1 SD and mean + 1 SD).\n\n- Approximately 95% falls within two standard deviations.\n\n- Approximately 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nBut here, I need the middle 50%, so I need to find the interval that includes from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile. This is also known as the interquartile range (IQR).\n\nIn a normal distribution, the z-scores corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles can be found using standard normal distribution tables or using statistical software.\n\nI think the z-score for the 25th percentile is approximately -0.674 and for the 75th percentile is about 0.674. But to be precise, I should look up the exact z-scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles.\n\nLet me check a z-table or use a calculator to find the exact z-scores for these percentiles.\n\nLooking it up, I find that:\n\n- The z-score for the 25th percentile is approximately -0.674.\n\n- The z-score for the 75th percentile is approximately 0.674.\n\nSo, the lower bound of the middle 50% is mean - (0.674 * SD), and the upper bound is mean + (0.674 * SD).\n\nGiven that the mean is 3,250 and the standard deviation is 320,\n\nLower bound = 3,250 - (0.674 * 320)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.674 * 320 = 215.68\n\nSo, 3,250 - 215.68 = 3,034.32\n\nSimilarly, upper bound = 3,250 + 215.68 = 3,465.68\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, that's approximately 3,034 to 3,466 customers.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is (3,034, 3,466), which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's another way to approach this or if I've made any mistakes.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the empirical rule, but that's more approximate and typically refers to the 68-95-99.7 percentages I mentioned earlier. Since we need the exact middle 50%, using the exact z-scores is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the inverse normal function in a statistical calculator or software to find the exact percentiles.\n\nAssuming I don't have any calculation errors, the answer should be option A.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect:\n\nOption B: (2,930, 3,570)\n\nThis seems to correspond to approximately mean \u00b1 1 SD, since 3,250 - 320 = 2,930 and 3,250 + 320 = 3,570. But this would cover roughly 68% of the data, not 50%.\n\nOption C: (2,610, 3,890)\n\nThis seems to correspond to mean \u00b1 1.875 SD (since 320 * 1.875 = 600, so 3,250 - 600 = 2,650 and 3,250 + 600 = 3,850, but that doesn't match exactly). Wait, actually, 3,250 - 640 = 2,610 and 3,250 + 640 = 3,890. So, this might correspond to a different percentile range.\n\nOption D: (2,450, 4,050)\n\nThis seems to correspond to mean \u00b1 2.5 SD (320 * 2.5 = 800, so 3,250 - 800 = 2,450 and 3,250 + 800 = 4,050). This would cover approximately 99% of the data, which is much more than 50%.\n\nTherefore, based on my calculations and the elimination of other options, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nTo confirm, the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days is approximately (3,034, 3,466).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
