                    "text": "So I have this question here about the Supreme Court's decision in Marbury v. Madison. It's asking which principle was established by that decision, and the options are:\n\nA. One man, one vote\n\nB. Separate but equal\n\nC. Judicial review\n\nD. Right to privacy\n\nHmm, I need to recall what Marbury v. Madison was about and what principle it established.\n\nI remember that Marbury v. Madison is a landmark case in United States constitutional law. It was decided in 1803 by the Supreme Court, and it's often cited as the basis for the Court's power of judicial review. But just to make sure, let me think through each option.\n\nOption A: One man, one vote. I think that has to do with voting rights and apportionment. I recall a case called Reynolds v. Sims that established the principle of \"one person, one vote,\" ensuring that legislative districts are roughly equal in population. That was in the 1960s, which is much later than Marbury v. Madison. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B: Separate but equal. That sounds familiar; it's about segregation. I believe that was from the case Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, which upheld racial segregation as long as the facilities for blacks and whites were equal. But that was overturned later by Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. Again, that's not Marbury v. Madison.\n\nOption C: Judicial review. This is the power of the courts to review and invalidate laws that are unconstitutional. This seems promising because I think Marbury v. Madison is famous for establishing this principle. Let me double-check my memory.\n\nIn Marbury v. Madison, William Marbury was seeking a commission that had been promised to him by the outgoing administration of John Adams, but it was withheld by the incoming Jefferson administration. Marbury sued, and Chief Justice John Marshall had to decide whether the Supreme Court had the authority to issue a writ of mandamus based on the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\nMarshall concluded that while Marbury was entitled to his commission, the Supreme Court did not have the authority to issue the writ because the Judiciary Act of 1789 conflicted with the Constitution. In his decision, Marshall declared that the Supreme Court could not issue the writ, effectively invalidating part of the Judiciary Act. This act of striking down a law as unconstitutional is judicial review.\n\nThis was a significant assertion of the Supreme Court's power to interpret the Constitution and to nullify laws that violate it. So, this seems to align perfectly with what Marbury v. Madison is known for.\n\nOption D: Right to privacy. This is another important principle, but I think it was established in different cases. For instance, Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965 recognized a right to privacy in the context of marital relations, and later cases like Roe v. Wade built upon that. So, again, not related to Marbury v. Madison.\n\nGiven this review, it seems clear that the principle established by Marbury v. Madison is judicial review. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. Judicial review.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly summarize why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. One man, one vote: This relates to electoral representation and was established in cases like Reynolds v. Sims, not Marbury v. Madison.\n\nB. Separate but equal: This was a doctrine related to segregation, established in Plessy v. Ferguson and overturned later; not connected to Marbury v. Madison.\n\nD. Right to privacy: This was recognized in cases like Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade, which are distinct from Marbury v. Madison.\n\nSo, I'm confident that C. Judicial review is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Judicial review}} \\]"
