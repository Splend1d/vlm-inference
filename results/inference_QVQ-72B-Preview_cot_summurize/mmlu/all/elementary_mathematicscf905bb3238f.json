                    "text": "I have this problem here: there are 762 students at a citywide competition, and they're divided into 6 equal-sized teams. I need to figure out how many students are on each team. The options are 110, 120, 127, and 137. Hmm, let's see.\n\nWell, if there are 762 students and they're divided equally into 6 teams, I think I just need to divide 762 by 6 to find out how many students are on each team. So, 762 divided by 6.\n\nLet me do that division. 762 \u00f7 6. Well, 6 times 120 is 720, but that's not quite right. Wait, 6 times 120 is 720, and then there's a remainder. Let me try again.\n\nActually, let me think step by step. To divide 762 by 6:\n\nFirst, look at the hundreds place: 7 hundreds. 6 goes into 7 once (since 6 times 1 is 6), and 7 minus 6 is 1. Bring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 16. Now, 6 goes into 16 twice (6 times 2 is 12), and 16 minus 12 is 4. Bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 42. Now, 6 goes into 42 seven times (6 times 7 is 42), and 42 minus 42 is 0. So, the division is exact, and 762 \u00f7 6 = 127.\n\nWait, but one of the options is 127. So, that seems like it could be the answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me try another way. Maybe I can use multiplication to verify. If there are 6 teams and each has 127 students, then total students should be 6 times 127. So, 6 \u00d7 127. Let's calculate that.\n\n6 \u00d7 100 = 600\n\n6 \u00d7 20 = 120\n\n6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n\nAdding those up: 600 + 120 = 720, plus 42 is 762. Yes, that matches the total number of students. So, 127 is indeed the correct number of students per team.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other options quickly.\n\nOption A is 110. If each team had 110 students, then 6 \u00d7 110 would be 660, which is less than 762. So, that's not enough.\n\nOption B is 120. 6 \u00d7 120 is 720, which is still less than 762.\n\nOption D is 137. 6 \u00d7 137 would be 822, which is more than 762.\n\nSo, the only option that fits exactly is 127.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether the teams are actually equal in size. The problem says they're divided into 6 equal-sized teams, so I assume they are equal, and my calculation seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to realize that 762 divided by 6 is the same as 762 \u00f7 6, which I already calculated as 127.\n\nAlternatively, I could use fractions or decimals, but since we're dealing with whole numbers of students, it should be a whole number.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems straightforward. So, the answer should be 127 students per team.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll check the multiplication again: 6 \u00d7 127.\n\n6 \u00d7 127 =\n\n(6 \u00d7 100) + (6 \u00d7 20) + (6 \u00d7 7) = 600 + 120 + 42 = 762.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 127.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{127} \\]"
