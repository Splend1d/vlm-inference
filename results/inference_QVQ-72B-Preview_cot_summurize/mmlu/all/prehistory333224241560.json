                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about early evidence of complexity in Mayan societies around 2650 years before the present. The options are:\n\nA. finely carved obsidian statuary.\n\nB. decorated stepped platforms.\n\nC. the introduction of chocolate into the Mesoamerican economy.\n\nD. a ritual ball game in which the losers were sacrificed to the gods.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"complexity\" in societies means. Generally, social complexity refers to the development of more organized and structured forms of society, like the emergence of social classes, specialized jobs, centralized government, and advanced technology or art.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: finely carved obsidian statuary.\n\nObsidian is a volcanic glass that was highly valued in Mesoamerica for its suitability for crafting tools and ornaments. Finely carved statuary suggests advanced craftsmanship and artistic skill, which could indicate a society with specialized artisans and possibly a class of elites who could commission such works. This sounds like a sign of social complexity.\n\nOption B: decorated stepped platforms.\n\nDecorated stepped platforms are likely architectural features, possibly related to religious or ceremonial buildings. The decoration and construction of such platforms would require organized labor and possibly religious or royal patronage. This also points towards a complex society with the means to invest in large-scale construction projects.\n\nOption C: the introduction of chocolate into the Mesoamerican economy.\n\nChocolate, or cacao, was indeed important in Mesoamerican cultures, both ceremonially and economically. However, its introduction into the economy might not directly indicate increased social complexity in the same way that advanced art or architecture does. It could signify trade relationships or cultural practices, but these might not necessarily reflect the same level of social organization.\n\nOption D: a ritual ball game in which the losers were sacrificed to the gods.\n\nThe Mesoamerican ballgame was a significant part of Mayan culture, often with religious overtones. Sacrificing losers suggests a structured ritual with religious significance, possibly involving priests or other ceremonial figures. While this indicates religious practices and possibly a class of religious specialists, it might not be as direct an indicator of overall social complexity as options A and B.\n\nNow, considering the timeframe: around 2650 B.P. (Before Present), which is roughly 650 BCE. The Mayan civilization was in its Preclassic period during this time, which is known for the development of early cities and monumental architecture.\n\nGiven that, both options A and B relate to artistic and architectural achievements, which are clear indicators of social complexity. Option C involves economics and culture, which might not directly reflect social complexity in the same manner, and option D involves religious practices, which could indicate some level of social organization but perhaps not to the same extent.\n\nBetween options A and B, I'm leaning towards option B: decorated stepped platforms. Architecture, especially large-scale construction like platforms, typically requires a significant amount of organized labor and resources, suggesting a society with the ability to mobilize and coordinate its members effectively. Additionally, the decoration of these platforms implies artistic development and possibly the presence of a ruling class or religious hierarchy that could invest in such projects.\n\nFinely carved obsidian statuary, while impressive, might be more indicative of artistic skill and access to valuable materials, but perhaps less so of the overall social organization needed for large-scale construction projects.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option B: decorated stepped platforms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
