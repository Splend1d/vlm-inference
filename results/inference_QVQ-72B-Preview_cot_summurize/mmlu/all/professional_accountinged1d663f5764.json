                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem about consolidated federal income tax returns for corporations. So, we have three corporations: Rigg, Steele, and Urco. They're all C corporations on a calendar year and use the accrual basis for accounting. Rigg owns 85% of Steele and 40% of Urco. Steele owns 50% of Urco. The question is asking which group qualifies as an affiliated group for filing a consolidated tax return.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules for forming an affiliated group under U.S. tax law. Generally, an affiliated group consists of a parent corporation and its subsidiaries, where the parent owns at least 80% of the voting power of each subsidiary's stock. Also, the group must file a consolidated tax return if they choose to do so.\n\nSo, let's map out the ownership structure:\n\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele.\n\n- Rigg owns 40% of Urco.\n\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n\nFrom this, it seems like Rigg is the top-tier corporation, owning parts of Steele and Urco directly. Steele, in turn, owns part of Urco.\n\nNow, to determine if there's an affiliated group, I need to check if there's a parent corporation that owns at least 80% of the voting stock of its subsidiaries.\n\nStarting with Rigg:\n\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele, which is more than 80%, so Rigg directly owns Steele.\n\n- Rigg owns 40% of Urco, which is less than 80%, so Rigg doesn't directly own Urco at the required threshold.\n\nBut Steele owns 50% of Urco. Since Rigg owns 85% of Steele, does that mean Rigg indirectly owns 42.5% of Urco through Steele (85% of Steele's 50% ownership in Urco)? Wait, but for consolidated returns, I think the ownership is looked at on a direct basis, not including indirect ownership through subsidiaries.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider both direct and indirect ownership. Let's check the tax regulations on this.\n\nUpon checking, for consolidated return purposes, the 80% ownership test can include both direct and indirect ownership. So, if a parent owns at least 80% of a subsidiary directly or through other subsidiaries, that subsidiary can be included in the affiliated group.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total ownership Rigg has in Urco, considering both direct and indirect ownership.\n\nDirect ownership:\n\n- Rigg owns 40% of Urco.\n\nIndirect ownership through Steele:\n\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele.\n\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n\nSo, Rigg's indirect ownership in Urco through Steele is 85% * 50% = 42.5%.\n\nTherefore, Rigg's total ownership in Urco is 40% (direct) + 42.5% (indirect) = 82.5%.\n\nWait, but 82.5% is more than 80%, but the requirement is to own at least 80% of the voting power. However, Rigg only owns 40% directly. The indirect ownership through Steele adds up to 42.5%, making it 82.5% in total.\n\nBut does the IRS allow including indirect ownership for the purposes of forming an affiliated group? I need to confirm this.\n\nAfter checking, the Internal Revenue Code section 1504(a) defines an affiliated group as a parent corporation and its subsidiaries, where the parent owns at least 80% of the voting power of each subsidiary's stock, directly or indirectly.\n\nSo, even if the parent doesn't own 80% directly, as long as the parent owns at least 80% in total (direct plus indirect), the subsidiary can be part of the affiliated group.\n\nIn this case, Rigg owns 85% of Steele directly, which satisfies the 80% requirement for Steele to be a subsidiary of Rigg.\n\nFor Urco, Rigg owns 40% directly and 42.5% indirectly through Steele, totaling 82.5%, which satisfies the 80% requirement.\n\nTherefore, Rigg, Steele, and Urco can form an affiliated group for consolidated tax return purposes.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA. Rigg and Urco.\n\nB. Urco and Steele.\n\nC. Rigg, Steele, and Urco.\n\nD. An affiliated group does not exist.\n\nGiven that, option C seems correct because all three corporations can be part of the affiliated group.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other considerations.\n\nFor example, does Steele own enough of Urco to include Urco in the group? Steele owns 50% of Urco, but Steele is itself a subsidiary of Rigg. So, Rigg owns Steele, and Steele owns Urco.\n\nBut since Rigg owns 85% of Steele, and Steele owns 50% of Urco, Rigg's indirect ownership in Urco is 85% * 50% = 42.5%, as calculated earlier.\n\nAdditionally, Rigg owns 40% directly, so total ownership is 82.5%, which meets the 80% threshold.\n\nTherefore, Urco can be included in the affiliated group with Rigg and Steele.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider only direct ownership, Rigg owns 40% of Urco, which is less than 80%, so Urco wouldn't qualify directly, but since Rigg owns Steele, which owns Urco, the indirect ownership allows Urco to be included.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C: Rigg, Steele, and Urco.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nOption A: Rigg and Urco.\n\nRigg owns 40% of Urco directly, which is less than 80%, so they cannot form an affiliated group just the two of them, unless there's indirect ownership that bumps it up to 80%.\n\nBut in this case, Rigg only owns 40% directly, and there's no other corporation through which Rigg owns Urco indirectly, except Steele, which is also a subsidiary.\n\nSo, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Urco and Steele.\n\nUrco is owned by both Rigg (40%) and Steele (50%). Neither of these owns 80% of Urco directly.\n\nSteele owns 50% of Urco, which is less than 80%, and Urco doesn't own any other corporation here.\n\nSo, they cannot form an affiliated group just the two of them.\n\nOption D: An affiliated group does not exist.\n\nBut based on our earlier analysis, option C seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Rigg, Steele, and Urco.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
