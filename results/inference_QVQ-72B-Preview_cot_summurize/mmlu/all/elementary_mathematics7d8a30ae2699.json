The options are:\n\nA. one hundred seventy-nine thousand twelve\n\nB. one hundred seventy-nine nine hundred twelve\n\nC. one hundred seventy thousand nine hundred twelve\n\nD. one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The number is 179,912. I need to convert this into words.\n\nFirst, I know that numbers are divided into periods, like hundreds, thousands, and so on. In 179,912, the comma is placed after the thousands, so it's 179 thousand and then 912.\n\nLet me start from the left.\n\nThe first three digits are 179, which is in the thousands place. So, 179 thousand.\n\nNow, 179 can be broken down as 1 hundred, 7 tens, and 9 ones. So, 179 is one hundred seventy-nine.\n\nSo, one hundred seventy-nine thousand.\n\nThen, there's 912. That's in the hundreds, tens, and ones place.\n\n912 can be broken down as 9 hundreds, 1 ten, and 2 ones. So, nine hundred twelve.\n\nBut when you combine it with the thousands, it should be one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. one hundred seventy-nine thousand twelve\n\nB. one hundred seventy-nine nine hundred twelve\n\nC. one hundred seventy thousand nine hundred twelve\n\nD. one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve\n\nOption D seems to match my calculation.\n\nWait a minute, option A says one hundred seventy-nine thousand twelve. That seems close, but it's missing the nine hundred in the last part.\n\nOption B says one hundred seventy-nine nine hundred twelve. That doesn't sound right because it's using \"nine hundred\" instead of \"nine hundred twelve.\"\n\nOption C says one hundred seventy thousand nine hundred twelve. Here, it's one hundred seventy thousand, but it should be one hundred seventy-nine thousand.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nLet's consider the number 179,912.\n\nThe first part is 179, which is one hundred seventy-nine.\n\nThen, the second part is 912, which is nine hundred twelve.\n\nSo, combined, it should be one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI think the answer is D. one hundred seventy-nine thousand nine hundred twelve.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
