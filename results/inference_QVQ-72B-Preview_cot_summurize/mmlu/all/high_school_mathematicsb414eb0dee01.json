                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What is the shortest distance between the y-axis and the point (2, 7)? And the options are A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 7.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being asked here. We have a point in a coordinate plane, right? The point is at (2, 7), which means it's located 2 units along the x-axis and 7 units along the y-axis. Now, the question is asking for the shortest distance between this point and the y-axis.\n\nOkay, so the y-axis is the line where x is 0. So, basically, we're trying to find the closest distance from the point (2, 7) to the line x = 0.\n\nI remember that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. So, if I can find the perpendicular from the point to the y-axis, that should be the shortest distance.\n\nBut wait, the y-axis is vertical, so it's a vertical line. That means the perpendicular from the point to the y-axis would be a horizontal line, right? Because horizontal lines are perpendicular to vertical lines.\n\nSo, if I draw a horizontal line from the point (2, 7) straight to the y-axis, that should be the shortest path.\n\nNow, the point is at x = 2, and the y-axis is at x = 0. So, the horizontal distance between them should just be the difference in their x-coordinates.\n\nSo, the distance would be |2 - 0| = 2 units.\n\nWait, but is there more to it? The options are 1, 2, 3, and 7. So, 2 is one of the options. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using the distance formula.\n\nThe general distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\n\nBut in this case, we're trying to find the distance from a point to a line, not between two points.\n\nWait, but the y-axis is like an infinite line, right? So, the distance from a point to a line is different from the distance between two points.\n\nActually, no. The y-axis is a line, not a point. So, it's correct to think in terms of the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.\n\nIn analytic geometry, the formula for the distance from a point to a line is |ax + by + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2), where the line is ax + by + c = 0.\n\nBut for the y-axis, which is x = 0, that's the same as x + 0y = 0. So, a = 1, b = 0, c = 0.\n\nPlugging into the formula: |1*2 + 0*7 + 0| / sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = |2 + 0 + 0| / sqrt(1) = 2 / 1 = 2.\n\nSo, again, the distance is 2.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the coordinates more carefully. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nThe point is (2, 7). So, it's two units to the right of the y-axis and seven units up from the x-axis.\n\nIs there any chance that the distance could be different based on the y-coordinate?\n\nWell, the y-axis is horizontal, so the distance shouldn't depend on the y-coordinate. It should only depend on the x-coordinate.\n\nWait, no, the y-axis is vertical, sorry. My bad.\n\nNo, actually, the y-axis is the vertical axis, running up and down. So, horizontal lines are perpendicular to it.\n\nSo, the shortest distance should indeed be along the horizontal line at y = 7, straight to the y-axis at x = 0.\n\nSo, again, the distance is |2 - 0| = 2.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nMaybe using vectors. If I consider the point (2, 7) and the y-axis, which is the set of all points where x = 0.\n\nThe vector from any point on the y-axis to (2, 7) would be something like (0, k) to (2, 7), which is (2, 7 - k).\n\nThe shortest distance would be the magnitude of the projection of this vector onto the direction vector of the y-axis, but actually, since the y-axis is vertical, the perpendicular distance is simply the x-coordinate.\n\nWait, this seems to confirm what I already have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Pythagoras theorem.\n\nIf I consider the right triangle formed by the point (2, 7), and the y-axis at (0, 7), and the origin (0,0).\n\nWait, but the y-axis at (0,7) is not the origin.\n\nWait, no, the y-axis is the line x = 0, which includes points like (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,7).\n\nSo, the distance from (2,7) to (0,7) is simply |2 - 0| = 2.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nIs there a possibility that the question is trying to trick me by including other options?\n\nLet me see. The options are 1, 2, 3, and 7.\n\nI can eliminate 7 immediately because that's the y-coordinate, and as I've reasoned, the distance should be the x-coordinate, which is 2.\n\nSo, 7 doesn't make sense.\n\nOption 1 is probably a distractor, and 3 is between 2 and 7, but doesn't align with my reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 2.\n\nJust to be thorough, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the coordinate system.\n\nIs the coordinate system standard, with the origin at (0,0), positive x to the right, and positive y upwards?\n\nYes, that's the standard coordinate system.\n\nSo, the point (2,7) is two units to the right of the y-axis and seven units up.\n\nThe shortest distance to the y-axis should indeed be the perpendicular distance, which is the absolute value of the x-coordinate, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
