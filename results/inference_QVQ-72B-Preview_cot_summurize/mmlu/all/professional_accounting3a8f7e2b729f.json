                    "text": "So here's this problem about Simmons giving her child some stock, and then the child sells it later. There's talk about the basis and the fair market value, and no gift tax was paid. I need to figure out what the child's recognized gain or loss is when they sell the stock for $36,000. The options are A. $4,000 loss, B. No gain or loss, C. $6,000 gain, D. $36,000 gain.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Simmons gives her child publicly traded stock. The basis of the stock is $40,000, and its fair market value at the time of the gift is $30,000. Then, later, the child sells the stock for $36,000. I need to find out what the child's recognized gain or loss is from this sale.\n\nI remember that when someone gives stock as a gift, the basis for the recipient can be tricky. Normally, if you inherit stock, the basis is stepped up to the fair market value at the time of the donor's death, but this is a gift, not an inheritance. So, different rules apply.\n\nFor gifts, the basis is generally the same as the donor's basis, but there's a twist if the fair market value at the time of the gift is different from the donor's basis. In this case, the donor's basis is $40,000, and the fair market value is $30,000. So, the fair market value is less than the donor's basis.\n\nI think there's a rule that the recipient's basis is the fair market value at the time of the gift if it's less than the donor's adjusted basis. So, in this case, the child's basis would be $30,000, not $40,000.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. According to IRS rules, when you receive property as a gift, your basis is generally the same as the donor's adjusted basis. However, if the property has depreciated in value, your basis might be the fair market value at the time of the gift, but only up to the donor's adjusted basis.\n\nActually, I think the general rule is that the basis of property received as a gift is the same as the donor's adjusted basis, increased by any gift tax paid on the appreciation. But in this problem, it says no gift tax was paid.\n\nSo, if no gift tax was paid, and the donor's basis is $40,000, and the fair market value at the time of the gift is $30,000, which is less than the basis, does the recipient take the lower of the donor's basis or the fair market value?\n\nI think the recipient's basis is the fair market value at the time of the gift, which is $30,000, but only up to the donor's adjusted basis. Since $30,000 is less than $40,000, the child's basis should be $30,000.\n\nNow, the child sells the stock for $36,000. To find the recognized gain or loss, I need to subtract the basis from the selling price.\n\nSo, gain or loss = selling price - basis = $36,000 - $30,000 = $6,000 gain.\n\nLooking at the options, that would be C. $6,000 gain.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not missing something. The problem mentions that the basis is $40,000 and the fair market value is $30,000 at the time of the gift. If the child's basis is $30,000, and they sell it for $36,000, that should indeed be a $6,000 gain.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect this? For example, does the fact that no gift tax was paid have any impact on the basis calculation?\n\nI don't think so. The basis adjustment for gifts doesn't typically involve gift taxes, especially since no gift tax was paid in this scenario.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the stock has any built-in losses or something, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the child had any expenses or adjustments to the basis after receiving the gift, but the problem doesn't mention any of that.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, it seems that the child's basis is $30,000, and selling it for $36,000 results in a $6,000 gain.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $6,000 gain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
