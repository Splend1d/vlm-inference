                    "text": "Let's see here. Jason is cleaning swimming pools in a perfectly competitive market. He charges $10 per pool and can clean 9 pools per day. His total variable costs are $80, and total fixed costs are $20. I need to figure out which statement is true based on this information.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic concepts about perfect competition and profit maximization. In perfect competition, firms are price takers, meaning they have to accept the market price, which in this case is $10 per pool. Jason is a profit maximizer, so he'll produce the quantity where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). But since it's perfect competition, MR is equal to the price, which is $10.\n\nNow, to determine whether Jason should continue operating or shut down in the short run, I need to compare his total revenues with his total costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate his total revenue. If he cleans 9 pools at $10 each, his total revenue is 9 * $10 = $90.\n\nHis total costs are the sum of his fixed and variable costs. Total fixed costs are $20, and total variable costs are $80, so total costs are $20 + $80 = $100.\n\nHis economic profit is total revenue minus total costs, which is $90 - $100 = -$10. So, he's making an economic loss of $10.\n\nNow, in the short run, a firm should shut down if it cannot cover its variable costs. The shutdown rule is: shut down if price is less than average variable cost (AVC).\n\nSo, I need to find out the average variable cost and compare it to the price.\n\nFirst, total variable costs are $80, and he cleans 9 pools, so average variable cost is $80 / 9 \u2248 $8.89 per pool.\n\nThe price he charges is $10 per pool, which is greater than $8.89. So, since price is greater than AVC, he should continue operating in the short run.\n\nIf he were to shut down, he would still have to pay his fixed costs of $20, and his total losses would be $20 (since he's not covering his fixed costs).\n\nBut since he's operating, his total losses are $10, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, option C says he should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $20. But that's not matching our calculation; we found that his losses are $10.\n\nOption D says he should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10, which matches our calculation.\n\nOption A says he should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $20. But we determined he should operate because price > AVC.\n\nOption B says he should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10, which contradicts the fact that shutting down would mean he only incurs fixed costs, which are $20, but he's not operating, so no revenue.\n\nWait, if he shuts down, his losses would be equal to his fixed costs, which are $20, because he has to pay them regardless. So, shutting down would lead to losses of $20.\n\nBut since he's operating, his losses are $10, which is better than shutting down.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
