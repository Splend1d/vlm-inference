The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers. The state court has now scheduled a prompt hearing on this matter. In addition, the state court has indicated that it hopes to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks. Which of the following statements is correct concerning the federal court's adjudication of the candidate's suit?\n\nA. The federal court should hear the case on the merits.\nB. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nC. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.\nD. The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this scenario about a federal court case involving election laws. Let me try to wrap my head around it.\n\nSo, there's a state statute that requires voters who want to write in a candidate to print the candidate's full name and specify the office they're running for, all in ink, in a designated space on the ballot. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut then there's this write-in candidate for Attorney General who's Chinese-American and thinks he needs a lot of support from Chinese voters to win. The issue is that many of these voters might not be proficient in reading and writing English, so they might have trouble writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot.\n\nTo help with that, the campaign manager decides to mail tear-off stickers to every registered Chinese voter. These stickers have the candidate's name and the office of Attorney General printed on them. The idea is that voters can just stick this on the appropriate place on the ballot instead of writing it themselves.\n\nHowever, five months before the election, an election official tells the campaign committee that these stickers don't comply with the state statute. The official says that it's necessary for voters to write the candidate's name in ink, not use stickers.\n\nAs a result, the candidate files a lawsuit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, one of the candidate's opponents files a suit in state court trying to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots that have stickers.\n\nThe state court is moving quickly and plans to decide on this matter in the next three weeks. Now, the question is about what the federal court should do regarding the candidate's suit.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The federal court should hear the case on the merits.\n\nB. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.\n\nC. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.\n\nD. The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's at stake here is whether voters can use stickers instead of writing the candidate's name and office in ink on their ballots. The candidate argues that the election officials' interpretation of the state statute violates the Constitution.\n\nNow, federal courts generally have jurisdiction over cases involving federal questions, like constitutional challenges. So, on its face, this seems like a case that could be heard in federal court.\n\nBut there are doctrines that might counsel against hearing the case, at least for now.\n\nOption B mentions the political question doctrine. This doctrine generally applies when a case involves matters that are committed by the Constitution to another branch of government or when there's a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a different branch.\n\nDoes this case involve a political question? Well, it's about election procedures, which are typically regulated by states under their police powers. However, the candidate is claiming a constitutional violation, so it's not necessarily a political question. It's more of a legal question about the application of the Constitution to state election laws. So, I think option B is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C refers to the abstention doctrine. Abstention is when a federal court chooses not to hear a case because it believes that another forum, usually a state court, is better positioned to decide the issue, especially if the case involves novel or unsettled questions of state law.\n\nIn this scenario, there's already a state court case ongoing, and the state court is actively considering the issue. The state court has scheduled a prompt hearing and aims to decide the matter within three weeks.\n\nGiven that, maybe the federal court should abstain and let the state court decide the issue first.\n\nBut, there are different types of abstention doctrines. One is Pullman abstention, which applies when a case presents uncertain or unsettled questions of state law that, if clarified by the state court, could obviate the need to decide the federal constitutional issues.\n\nAnother is Younger abstention, which applies when there's a parallel state proceeding that involves an ongoing criminal prosecution, certain civil enforcement proceedings, or certain civil proceedings involving certain orders that are akin to injunctive relief.\n\nIn this case, there's a parallel state proceeding, but it's not clear if it falls under the categories covered by Younger abstention.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Pullman abstention is more applicable here, especially since the state court is already considering the issue and may clarify the state law soon.\n\nOption D suggests remanding the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue. But, generally, federal courts don't remand cases to state courts unless there are specific grounds for doing so, like a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nIn this case, the federal court has jurisdiction over the constitutional claim, so remanding to the state court isn't the typical approach.\n\nOption A says the federal court should hear the case on the merits. But considering that there's a parallel state court proceeding that's actively addressing the issue and may resolve it soon, it might be premature or inefficient for the federal court to proceed immediately to the merits.\n\nGiven that, I think the most appropriate course of action for the federal court would be to abstain under the Pullman doctrine, allowing the state court to clarify the state law first.\n\nThis way, if the state court determines that stickers are permissible under the state statute, the constitutional issue might become moot, or at least less contentious.\n\nAlternatively, if the state court upholds the election officials' interpretation, the federal court could then consider the constitutional challenge more clearly, with the state law issue settled.\n\nTherefore, I believe option C is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any reason why the federal court shouldn't hear the case on the merits right away?\n\nWell, for one, there's the principle of comity, which respects the roles of state courts in interpreting their own laws. Allowing the state court to decide the state law issue first aligns with that principle.\n\nAdditionally, since the state court is already involved and moving quickly, it makes sense to let them proceed, especially if their decision could resolve the federal constitutional issue.\n\nMoreover, there might be unique aspects of state election law that the state court is better equipped to consider.\n\nOption B, about the political question doctrine, doesn't seem applicable because this is a legal dispute, not a political one that's traditionally left to the legislative or executive branches.\n\nOption D, remanding to the state court, isn't typically how federal courts handle these situations. They might stay their hand via abstention but don't usually remand cases to state courts once they have jurisdiction.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: the federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
