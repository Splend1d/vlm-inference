                    "text": "So I have this question here about inventory management. It's asking what the process is called when you keep a running account of merchandise on hand. The options are A. perpetual inventory, B. economic order quantity, C. book inventory, and D. physical inventory. I need to pick the right term for this process.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means in the context of inventory management.\n\nStarting with option A, perpetual inventory. I think this has something to do with continuously tracking inventory levels. But I'm not entirely sure how it works.\n\nOption B is economic order quantity. I've heard of EOQ before. It's about figuring out the optimal amount of inventory to order each time to minimize costs related to ordering and holding inventory. So, it's more about deciding how much to order, not about keeping track of what's on hand.\n\nOption C is book inventory. This sounds like it might be related to recording inventory values in accounting books. Maybe it's the theoretical or recorded amount of inventory based on records, rather than an actual count.\n\nOption D is physical inventory. That sounds like actually counting the items on hand to verify the accuracy of the records. It's probably a periodic activity to check against the book inventory.\n\nSo, the question is about keeping a running account of merchandise on hand, meaning continuously knowing how much inventory you have at any given time.\n\nPerpetual inventory seems to fit this description. It's a system where inventory records are updated continuously as transactions occur, whether it's sales, purchases, or returns.\n\nEconomic order quantity is more about optimization of order sizes, not about tracking the inventory levels.\n\nBook inventory refers to the inventory value recorded in the accounts, which may or may not be up to date depending on the system used.\n\nPhysical inventory is the actual count of items in stock, usually done periodically to reconcile with the book inventory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. perpetual inventory, because it involves continuously updating the inventory records to reflect the current on-hand quantities.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. In perpetual inventory systems, every time there's a transaction that affects inventory, like a sale or a purchase, the inventory records are immediately updated to show the new balance. This way, you can always check the current inventory levels.\n\nEconomic order quantity is a formula to determine the most cost-efficient quantity to order, but it doesn't involve keeping a running account of inventory.\n\nBook inventory is just the inventory value as recorded in the books, which could be based on either a perpetual system or a periodic system.\n\nPhysical inventory is a count of actual items in stock, typically done to verify the book inventory.\n\nSo, yes, the process of keeping a running account of merchandise on hand is indeed called perpetual inventory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
