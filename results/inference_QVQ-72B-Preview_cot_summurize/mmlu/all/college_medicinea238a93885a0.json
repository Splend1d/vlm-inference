                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)\u2082, is slowly dissolved in 500 mL of water at 25 degrees Celsius until the solution becomes fully saturated. Then, when 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added, I need to figure out what happens. The options are:\n\nA. MgCl\u2082 precipitates\n\nB. Mg(OH)\u2082 precipitates\n\nC. Ksp for Mg(OH)\u2082 increases\n\nD. [H\u2082O] increases\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Mg(OH)\u2082 is a slightly soluble salt. Its dissolution in water can be represented by the equilibrium:\n\nMg(OH)\u2082(s) \u21cc Mg\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2OH\u207b(aq)\n\nAt 25 degrees Celsius, it dissolves until it reaches its solubility product constant, Ksp.\n\nKsp for Mg(OH)\u2082 is given by:\n\nKsp = [Mg\u00b2\u207a][OH\u207b]\u00b2\n\nNow, when HCl is added, which is a strong acid, it will react with the OH\u207b ions in the solution.\n\nThe reaction is:\n\nH\u207a + OH\u207b \u2192 H\u2082O\n\nThis will remove some of the OH\u207b ions from the solution.\n\nSince OH\u207b is being removed, let's see how that affects the dissolution equilibrium of Mg(OH)\u2082.\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if we remove a product from an equilibrium, the reaction will shift to produce more of that product.\n\nIn this case, by removing OH\u207b, the equilibrium of Mg(OH)\u2082 dissolution will shift to the right, dissolving more Mg(OH)\u2082 to restore the concentration of OH\u207b.\n\nSo, more Mg(OH)\u2082 will dissolve, increasing the concentration of Mg\u00b2\u207a and OH\u207b in the solution.\n\nNow, let's look at the options again:\n\nA. MgCl\u2082 precipitates\n\nWait, MgCl\u2082 is soluble in water. Normally, MgCl\u2082 doesn't precipitate in water because it's highly soluble.\n\nBut let's think about it. When HCl is added, it reacts with OH\u207b to form water, as we just discussed.\n\nThe products are Mg\u00b2\u207a and Cl\u207b ions.\n\nMgCl\u2082 is soluble, so it shouldn't precipitate. Instead, it would remain in solution.\n\nSo, option A seems unlikely.\n\nB. Mg(OH)\u2082 precipitates\n\nBut according to Le Chatelier's principle, removing OH\u207b should cause more Mg(OH)\u2082 to dissolve, not precipitate.\n\nIf more is dissolving, perhaps less is precipitating, but I think the main effect is increased dissolution.\n\nSo, maybe not option B.\n\nC. Ksp for Mg(OH)\u2082 increases\n\nKsp is an equilibrium constant, and it depends on temperature.\n\nSince the temperature is constant at 25 degrees Celsius, Ksp should remain the same.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nD. [H\u2082O] increases\n\nWell, H\u2082O is everywhere in the solution, and it's being produced by the reaction of H\u207a and OH\u207b.\n\nBut [H\u2082O] is already very high in aqueous solutions, and adding a little more shouldn't significantly increase its concentration.\n\nMoreover, H\u2082O is a pure liquid, and its concentration is constant in dilute solutions.\n\nSo, option D seems unlikely.\n\nHmm, maybe none of these are directly correct based on my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe have a saturated solution of Mg(OH)\u2082, so:\n\nMg(OH)\u2082(s) \u21cc Mg\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2OH\u207b(aq)\n\nWhen HCl is added, it reacts with OH\u207b:\n\nH\u207a + OH\u207b \u2192 H\u2082O\n\nThis removes OH\u207b, shifting the equilibrium to the right, dissolving more Mg(OH)\u2082.\n\nSo, the concentration of Mg\u00b2\u207a increases.\n\nNow, the added Cl\u207b ions combine with Mg\u00b2\u207a to form MgCl\u2082, but as I thought before, MgCl\u2082 is soluble and shouldn't precipitate.\n\nUnless the concentration becomes too high, but in this case, with only 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl added to 500 mL of solution, it's not likely to cause precipitation of MgCl\u2082.\n\nLet me calculate the amount of HCl added.\n\n10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl contains:\n\n(10.0 mL) * (0.1 mol/L) = 1.0 mmol of HCl\n\nEach mmol of HCl reacts with 1 mmol of OH\u207b to form 1 mmol of H\u2082O.\n\nSo, 1.0 mmol of OH\u207b is removed.\n\nNow, in the original saturated solution, we have:\n\n[Mg\u00b2\u207a] = s M\n\n[OH\u207b] = 2s M\n\nWhere s is the solubility of Mg(OH)\u2082.\n\nAfter removing 1.0 mmol of OH\u207b, the concentration of OH\u207b decreases by (1.0 mmol / 500 mL) = 0.002 M\n\nSo, new [OH\u207b] = 2s - 0.002 M\n\nNow, according to the dissolution equilibrium:\n\nKsp = [Mg\u00b2\u207a][OH\u207b]\u00b2 = s * (2s - 0.002)\u00b2\n\nBut since s is very small (Mg(OH)\u2082 is slightly soluble), 2s is still small compared to 0.002 M.\n\nWait, actually, s for Mg(OH)\u2082 is around 1.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 M at 25\u00b0C.\n\nSo, 2s = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 M\n\nSubtracting 0.002 M gives approximately 2s - 0.002 \u2248 -0.00176 M, which doesn't make sense because concentration can't be negative.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I need to set up an ICE table for this equilibrium.\n\nLet's define:\n\nInitial: s M for Mg\u00b2\u207a and 2s M for OH\u207b\n\nChange: -x M for OH\u207b removed (where x is the amount of OH\u207b that reacts with HCl)\n\nEquilibrium: s M for Mg\u00b2\u207a and (2s - x) M for OH\u207b\n\nBut since x is much larger than s, we need to consider that some Mg(OH)\u2082 dissolves to replenish the OH\u207b.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to set up the equilibrium expression after the addition.\n\nAfter adding HCl, the concentration of OH\u207b decreases, leading to more dissolution of Mg(OH)\u2082 to restore the equilibrium.\n\nLet me try to calculate the new concentrations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the amount of Mg(OH)\u2082 that dissolves after HCl addition as \u2018y\u2019 moles.\n\nThen:\n\nMg(OH)\u2082 dissolved: y moles\n\nMg\u00b2\u207a produced: y moles\n\nOH\u207b produced: 2y moles\n\nHCl added: 1.0 mmol, which is 1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol\n\nOH\u207b removed: 1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol\n\nTotal volume: 500 mL = 0.5 L\n\nInitial moles of Mg\u00b2\u207a: s \u00d7 0.5 L = 0.5s mmol\n\nInitial moles of OH\u207b: 2s \u00d7 0.5 L = s mmol\n\nAfter addition:\n\nMoles of Mg\u00b2\u207a: 0.5s + y mmol\n\nMoles of OH\u207b: s - 1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 + 2y mmol\n\nWe need to find the new equilibrium concentrations.\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKsp = [Mg\u00b2\u207a][OH\u207b]\u00b2\n\nBut since the system is still at equilibrium after the addition, this should hold.\n\nWait, but we added HCl, which consumed some OH\u207b, so the system will adjust to maintain equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the reaction quotient Q and see how it compares to Ksp.\n\nInitially, Q = [Mg\u00b2\u207a][OH\u207b]\u00b2 = s * (2s)\u00b2 = s * 4s\u00b2 = 4s\u00b3\n\nWhich equals Ksp.\n\nAfter adding HCl, some OH\u207b is removed, so [OH\u207b] decreases, and Q becomes less than Ksp.\n\nTo restore equilibrium, more Mg(OH)\u2082 dissolves, increasing [Mg\u00b2\u207a] and [OH\u207b].\n\nThis process continues until Q = Ksp again.\n\nThis suggests that the solubility s increases slightly, but not enough to cause precipitation of MgCl\u2082.\n\nTherefore, none of the options seem directly correct based on this reasoning.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the formation of other species or changes in pH.\n\nWait, adding HCl will consume OH\u207b, decreasing pH, making the solution more acidic.\n\nBut Mg(OH)\u2082 is a base, and its dissolution is pH-dependent.\n\nAt lower pH, its solubility increases.\n\nSo, perhaps the solubility s increases, leading to higher [Mg\u00b2\u207a] and [OH\u207b].\n\nBut again, this doesn't directly answer the question.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\nA. MgCl\u2082 precipitates\n\nAs MgCl\u2082 is soluble, and the concentrations are not high enough to precipitate it, I don't think this is likely.\n\nB. Mg(OH)\u2082 precipitates\n\nGiven that more Mg(OH)\u2082 dissolves to restore equilibrium, it's unlikely to precipitate more.\n\nC. Ksp for Mg(OH)\u2082 increases\n\nKsp is temperature-dependent and doesn't change unless temperature changes, which it doesn't here.\n\nD. [H\u2082O] increases\n\nWhile it's true that H\u2082O is being produced by the reaction of H\u207a and OH\u207b, the concentration of H\u2082O in solution is already very high (~55.5 M), and adding a tiny amount more wouldn't significantly increase its concentration.\n\nPerhaps none of the options are correct, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the addition of HCl leads to a common ion effect or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the reaction between HCl and Mg(OH)\u2082 directly.\n\nHCl can react with Mg(OH)\u2082 to form MgCl\u2082 and H\u2082O:\n\nMg(OH)\u2082(s) + 2HCl(aq) \u2192 MgCl\u2082(aq) + 2H\u2082O(l)\n\nBut in this problem, we're dealing with a saturated solution of Mg(OH)\u2082, and adding a small amount of HCl.\n\nGiven that MgCl\u2082 is soluble, and the amount of HCl added is small, it's unlikely to cause precipitation of MgCl\u2082.\n\nInstead, it might dissolve more Mg(OH)\u2082 to consume the added H\u207a ions.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that Mg(OH)\u2082 dissolves more, but none of the options reflect that directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pH change affects the solubility product.\n\nWait, Ksp is only temperature-dependent, so it shouldn't change.\n\nBut perhaps the solubility increases due to the common ion effect in reverse.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we have a saturated solution of Mg(OH)\u2082.\n\nAdding HCl reacts with OH\u207b, reducing [OH\u207b].\n\nAccording to the solubility equilibrium:\n\nMg(OH)\u2082(s) \u21cc Mg\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2OH\u207b(aq)\n\nRemoving OH\u207b shifts the equilibrium to the right, dissolving more Mg(OH)\u2082.\n\nSo, [Mg\u00b2\u207a] increases, and [OH\u207b] decreases.\n\nBut since MgCl\u2082 is soluble, no precipitation of MgCl\u2082 occurs.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B suggests Mg(OH)\u2082 precipitates, but actually, more dissolves.\n\nOption C says Ksp increases, but Ksp is constant at constant temperature.\n\nOption D says [H\u2082O] increases, which is not significant in this context.\n\nSo, perhaps none of the options are correct, or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the formation of H\u2083O\u207a ions.\n\nWhen HCl dissolves in water, it produces H\u2083O\u207a and Cl\u207b ions.\n\nH\u2083O\u207a can react with OH\u207b:\n\nH\u2083O\u207a + OH\u207b \u2192 2H\u2082O\n\nThis reaction consumes OH\u207b, shifting the Mg(OH)\u2082 dissolution equilibrium to the right.\n\nAgain, leading to increased [Mg\u00b2\u207a] and [OH\u207b], but no precipitation of MgCl\u2082.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the increased concentration of Cl\u207b affects the solubility.\n\nBut MgCl\u2082 is soluble, so adding Cl\u207b shouldn't affect Mg\u00b2\u207a precipitation.\n\nUnless there's a specific concentration where MgCl\u2082 becomes insoluble, which I don't think is the case.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the activity coefficients or something, but that seems beyond the scope here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pH change affects the solubility product expression.\n\nBut Ksp is only temperature-dependent, so it shouldn't change.\n\nWait, option C says Ksp for Mg(OH)\u2082 increases.\n\nBut Ksp is a constant at a given temperature, so unless the temperature changes, which it doesn't, Ksp remains the same.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D suggests [H\u2082O] increases.\n\nWhile it's true that H\u2082O is being produced by the reaction of H\u207a and OH\u207b, the concentration of H\u2082O in solution is already very high, and adding a tiny amount more wouldn't significantly increase its concentration.\n\nTherefore, option D is also incorrect.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, none of the options A, B, C, or D are correct.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the question, or I'm missing something crucial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that Mg(OH)\u2082 dissolves more, but that's not listed.\n\nGiven that, I would say that none of the provided options occur as a direct result of adding 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl to the saturated Mg(OH)\u2082 solution.\n\nHowever, since I have to choose one, and considering that the addition of HCl might lead to a local increase in Mg\u00b2\u207a concentration that could potentially cause MgCl\u2082 precipitation, but that seems unlikely given the solubility of MgCl\u2082, I would lean towards option A being the least incorrect.\n\nBut honestly, based on my understanding, I don't think any of the options accurately describe what happens in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
