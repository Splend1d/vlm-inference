                    "text": "So Maddie is going to ride her bike a total of 56 miles over 7 days, and she's going to ride the same number of miles each day. I need to figure out how many miles she rides each day. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that if she's riding for 7 days and the total distance is 56 miles, I can find out how much she rides each day by dividing the total miles by the number of days. So, 56 divided by 7 should give me the answer.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 56 \u00f7 7 = 8. So, 8 miles per day.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can multiply 8 miles by 7 days to see if I get back to 56. 8 times 7 is indeed 56. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's another way to look at this problem. For example, maybe using addition. If I add up the miles she rides each day for 7 days, it should equal 56. So, if she rides 8 miles each day, then 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 should equal 56. Let me add them up: 8 plus 8 is 16, plus 8 is 24, plus 8 is 32, plus 8 is 40, plus 8 is 48, plus another 8 is 56. Yep, that matches the total.\n\nIs there any other way this question could be interpreted? Well, maybe I should consider if the number of days is not all at once or if there are any other factors, but the problem seems straightforward. She rides the same number of miles each day for 7 days, totaling 56 miles.\n\nLet me also look at the units to make sure. Miles total divided by days should give miles per day. So, 56 miles \u00f7 7 days = 8 miles/day. That makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. So, the total number of miles Maddie will ride each day is 8 miles.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8\n\nB. 9\n\nC. 49\n\nD. 63\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 8} \\]"
