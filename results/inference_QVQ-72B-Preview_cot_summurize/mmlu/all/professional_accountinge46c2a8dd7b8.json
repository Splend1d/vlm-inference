                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here with Arno Co., and they didn't record a credit purchase of merchandise before the end of the year. But the merchandise was still included in the year-end physical inventory. I need to figure out what effect this omission had on their balance sheet at the end of the year, specifically looking at assets and liabilities. The options are:\n\nA. No effect No effect\n\nB. No effect Understated\n\nC. Understated No effect\n\nD. Understated Understated\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a credit purchase of merchandise is. A credit purchase means that Arno Co. bought merchandise from a supplier but didn't pay for it immediately. Instead, they probably have an account payable, which is a liability.\n\nNow, they didn't record this purchase in their books. That means that when they should have debited (increased) their inventory account and credited (increased) their accounts payable, they didn't do that.\n\nBut, the merchandise was still there in the physical inventory count at the end of the year. So, in their inventory records, this merchandise is included as an asset.\n\nWait a minute, if they didn't record the purchase, how did the merchandise get included in the inventory? Maybe during the physical count, they just counted it as part of their stock, but they didn't have a corresponding entry in their records for the purchase.\n\nHmm, that seems like an inconsistency. Normally, if you have a physical inventory count, you should have records matching what's on hand.\n\nBut in this case, they didn't record the purchase, but the merchandise is still in inventory. So, in their books, their inventory account might be overvalued or undervalued depending on how they handled it.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Arno Co. purchases merchandise on credit.\n\n- Should record:\n\nInventory (Debit)\n\nAccounts Payable (Credit)\n\nStep 2: They don't record this purchase in their books.\n\n- So, their inventory account doesn't have this new purchase added.\n\n- Also, their accounts payable don't have this liability recorded.\n\nStep 3: At year-end, they do a physical inventory count and include this merchandise in their inventory.\n\n- Now, their inventory count shows more merchandise than what's recorded in their books.\n\n- But since they didn't record the purchase, there's a discrepancy.\n\nI think what's happening here is that if they include the merchandise in inventory but haven't recorded the purchase, their inventory account in the books is understated because they have more merchandise than what's been recorded.\n\nWait, no. If they didn't record the purchase, their inventory account in the books doesn't include the new merchandise that was purchased on credit.\n\nBut in the physical inventory count, this new merchandise is included. So, if they adjust their books based on the physical count, they would adjust the inventory account to include this merchandise.\n\nBut, since they didn't record the purchase, they might not have adjusted the inventory account properly.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at it from the perspective of the matching principle and revenue recognition.\n\nThe matching principle says that expenses should be matched with revenues. So, if they have purchased merchandise but haven't recorded it, and assuming they haven't sold it yet (since it's still in inventory), then perhaps the impact is only on the balance sheet, not yet on the income statement.\n\nBut, more importantly, in the balance sheet, assets should equal liabilities plus equity.\n\nIn this case, assets would include inventory, and liabilities would include accounts payable for the merchandise purchased.\n\nSince they didn't record the purchase, their inventory account might not reflect the actual amount of merchandise they have, and their accounts payable are not recorded.\n\nBut, the problem states that the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. So, presumably, during the inventory count, they accounted for all the merchandise on hand, including the unrecorded purchase.\n\nNow, if they adjusted their inventory records to match the physical count, they would increase the inventory account to include the new merchandise.\n\nBut, they didn't record the corresponding increase in accounts payable.\n\nSo, in their books:\n\n- Inventory (Asset) is correctly stated because it's based on the physical count.\n\n- Accounts Payable (Liability) is understated because they didn't record the liability for the credit purchase.\n\nWait, but if they increased inventory without increasing accounts payable, doesn't that mean that their assets are correctly stated, but their liabilities are understated?\n\nThat would suggest that option B: No effect Understated is correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nSuppose Arno Co. had inventory of $100 before the new purchase. They purchased $50 of merchandise on credit but didn't record it. So, their actual inventory is now $150.\n\nDuring the physical inventory count, they correctly count $150 of inventory and adjust their records accordingly.\n\nBut, since they didn't record the purchase, they didn't increase accounts payable by $50.\n\nSo, in their books:\n\n- Inventory: $150 (correct)\n\n- Accounts Payable: $0 (should be $50)\n\nTherefore, liabilities are understated by $50, while assets are correctly stated at $150.\n\nIf they had recorded the purchase properly, their inventory would be $150 and accounts payable $50.\n\nSo, in reality:\n\n- Actual Inventory: $150\n\n- Actual Accounts Payable: $50\n\nIn their books:\n\n- Recorded Inventory: $150\n\n- Recorded Accounts Payable: $0\n\nThus:\n\n- Assets (Inventory): Correct at $150\n\n- Liabilities (Accounts Payable): Understated by $50\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nB. No effect Understated\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other impact.\n\nSince they didn't sell the merchandise yet, there's no impact on revenue or cost of goods sold in the income statement for this period.\n\nHowever, in the next period, if they sell the merchandise, they might incorrectly record the cost of goods sold because their inventory account is now not matched with the corresponding purchase.\n\nBut that's a issue for the next period. For the current year-end balance sheet, the effect is only on liabilities being understated.\n\nSo, the answer is B. No effect Understated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
