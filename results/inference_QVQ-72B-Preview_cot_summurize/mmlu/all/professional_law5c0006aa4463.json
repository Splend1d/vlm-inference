                    "text": "So I've got this case here where a landlord is being sued because a tenant's four-year-old daughter fell from a second-floor outdoor stairway. The stairway was supposedly negligently constructed and maintained, with issues like a steep incline, loose steps, and an insufficient railing that didn't prevent the child from falling. The jury already found the landlord negligent, but now the landlord is appealing based on some immunity doctrine, and the tenant didn't assert any exceptions to that immunity.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what this \"landlord immunity\" is all about. From what I recall, traditionally, landlords had certain protections and weren't always responsible for everything that happened on their property, especially once they rented it out. There's this idea of \"lessee beware,\" meaning the tenant takes the property \"as is\" and is responsible for maintaining it.\n\nBut times have changed, and the law has evolved. The question here is whether the modern rule still grants landlords this kind of immunity or if they can be held liable for negligent design and maintenance of their properties.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, the landlord is strictly liable for the abnormally dangerous condition that he knowingly allowed to exist.\n\nHmm, strict liability is a bit different from negligence. Strict liability doesn't require proof of negligence; it's about the activity itself being so dangerous that the person engaging in it is liable regardless of fault. But in this case, the tenant sued for negligence, not strict liability. So, this option seems a bit off track.\n\nB. Yes, the modern rule is that the landlord, like anyone else, has a duty to use due care to protect its tenants and others from injury caused by a foreseeable risk of harm.\n\nThis sounds more in line with negligence principles. If the landlord has a duty to maintain the property safely and foreseeable risks aren't addressed, they could be held liable for injuries resulting from those risks.\n\nC. No, because the landlord still enjoys the common law protection of the doctrine of \"lessee beware,\" and residential property is generally still rented \"as is.\"\n\nThis suggests that the traditional view persists, where landlords aren't responsible for all defects and dangers on the property once it's rented out. But I think this has changed in many places, especially concerning safety issues that could harm tenants or their guests.\n\nD. No, because a landlord cannot be held liable for negligent design or maintenance, even under the modern rule.\n\nThis seems pretty absolute. If the modern rule doesn't allow landlords to be sued for negligent design or maintenance, then the appeal would likely succeed. But I doubt that's the case in modern law.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully. Let's consider the duties of landlords in general.\n\nLandlords have a responsibility to provide a habitable and safe living environment. This includes maintaining the property in a way that doesn't pose risks to the health and safety of the tenants and their guests.\n\nIn the case of the stairway, if it was poorly designed or maintained, leading to an injury, it seems reasonable that the landlord could be held liable.\n\nBut perhaps there are limitations based on who was using the stairway and under what circumstances.\n\nWait a minute, the child was four years old. Was she unsupervised? If so, maybe there's some contributory negligence on the part of the parents for not supervising her properly.\n\nHowever, that might be a separate issue. The main focus here is the condition of the stairway and whether the landlord was negligent in constructing or maintaining it.\n\nAlso, the railing was insufficient to keep the baby from falling. That sounds like a design flaw or maintenance issue.\n\nI should consider the concept of attractive nuisances. That's when something on the property, like a swimming pool or construction equipment, attracts children who might not realize the danger. Landlords have to take extra precautions against such hazards.\n\nMaybe the stairway was an attractive nuisance if it was part of the building's architecture or design that might attract children to play there.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies here. The stairway was outdoor and presumably part of the building's access, so it's not like it was something left out that children would be drawn to play with.\n\nLet me think about the duty of care that landlords owe to their tenants and guests.\n\nGenerally, landlords are required to exercise reasonable care to make sure that common areas are safe. The outdoor stairway sounds like a common area since it's outside and presumably used by multiple tenants.\n\nSo, if the stairway was poorly designed or maintained, and that led to an injury, the landlord could be held liable for negligence.\n\nBut perhaps there are exceptions or limitations based on the age of the child or the foreseeability of the injury.\n\nWait, the jury already found that the landlord was negligent in design and maintenance, and that the stairway was dangerous due to its steep incline, loose steps, and insufficient railing.\n\nThe landlord is appealing based on immunity from suit and the tenant's failure to assert any exception to that immunity.\n\nSo, the question is whether the landlord has immunity from being sued for such claims, and if the tenant needed to overcome that immunity by asserting specific exceptions.\n\nI need to understand what this immunity is.\n\nThe term \"landlord immunity\" isn't a standard legal term, but perhaps it refers to the historical doctrine where landlords were not liable for defects in the premises once they were leased to a tenant.\n\nThis was based on the idea that the tenant had exclusive possession and control over the property and was therefore responsible for its condition.\n\nHowever, over time, courts have eroded this immunity, especially in cases involving injuries to tenants or their guests due to the landlord's negligence in maintaining common areas or failing to make necessary repairs.\n\nSo, in modern law, landlords are generally held to a standard of care to maintain common areas in a safe condition and to make repairs of known dangerous conditions within a reasonable time.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to suggest that the common law protection still fully applies, but I think that's outdated in many jurisdictions.\n\nOption D says that under the modern rule, landlords cannot be held liable for negligent design or maintenance. That seems contrary to what I know about current landlord-tenant law.\n\nOption B seems the most accurate, stating that landlords have a duty to use due care to protect tenants and others from foreseeable risks of harm.\n\nOption A talks about strict liability, which isn't directly related to the negligence claim in this case.\n\nTherefore, I think the appellate court would affirm the jury's verdict against the landlord, based on the modern rule that landlords have a duty to maintain their properties safely.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Yes, the modern rule is that the landlord, like anyone else, has a duty to use due care to protect its tenants and others from injury caused by a foreseeable risk of harm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
