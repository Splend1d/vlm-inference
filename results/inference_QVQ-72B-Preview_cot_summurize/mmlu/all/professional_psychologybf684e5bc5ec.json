                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this problem about type I and type II errors in hypothesis testing. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, let's recall what these terms mean:\n\n- **Type I error**: This is the error of rejecting a true null hypothesis. The probability of making a type I error is denoted by \u03b1 (alpha), which in this case is given as 0.05.\n\n- **Type II error**: This is the error of failing to reject a false null hypothesis. The probability of making a type II error is denoted by \u03b2 (beta).\n\n- **Statistical power**: This is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, which is 1 - \u03b2. It's given as 0.85 in this problem.\n\nSo, from the information given:\n\n- \u03b1 = 0.05\n\n- Power = 0.85\n\nTherefore, \u03b2 = 1 - Power = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The probability of making a type I error is 0.15.\n\nBut wait, \u03b1 is given as 0.05, so this can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nB. The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.\n\nWe have \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 0.15. So \u03b2 > \u03b1, which means this statement is true.\n\nC. The probability of making a type II error is 0.85.\n\nNo, \u03b2 is 0.15, not 0.85. Power is 0.85, which is 1 - \u03b2.\n\nD. The probability of type I and type II errors cannot be computed from the information given.\n\nActually, we were able to compute both \u03b1 and \u03b2 from the given information, so this statement is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to double-check these concepts.\n\nIn hypothesis testing:\n\n- \u03b1 is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (type I error).\n\n- \u03b2 is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (type II error).\n\n- Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, which is 1 - \u03b2.\n\nGiven that, and the values provided:\n\n- \u03b1 = 0.05\n\n- Power = 0.85\n\nTherefore, \u03b2 = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. The probability of making a type I error is 0.15.\n\nBut \u03b1 is 0.05, not 0.15. So this is incorrect.\n\nB. The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.\n\n\u03b2 = 0.15 and \u03b1 = 0.05, so indeed \u03b2 > \u03b1. This seems correct.\n\nC. The probability of making a type II error is 0.85.\n\nNo, \u03b2 is 0.15, not 0.85. So this is incorrect.\n\nD. The probability of type I and type II errors cannot be computed from the information given.\n\nWe were able to compute both, so this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nIs it possible that with the given information, we can't determine \u03b2 directly? Well, in standard hypothesis testing, if we know the significance level (\u03b1) and the power (1 - \u03b2), we can directly compute \u03b2. So, I think it's safe to conclude that \u03b2 = 0.15.\n\nTherefore, since 0.15 > 0.05, the probability of making a type II error is higher than that of a type I error.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
