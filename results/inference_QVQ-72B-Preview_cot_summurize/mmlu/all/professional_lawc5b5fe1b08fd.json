                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether certain testimony will be admissible in court. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThere's a married couple who bought a house through a real estate broker. The broker supposedly promised them that if they bought the house right away, they'd get a $15,000 rebate from the sellers at closing. But when they went to closing, the sellers denied knowing anything about this promise and didn't pay the rebate. Now, the couple is suing the broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract.\n\nIn the trial, the couple subpoenas one of the broker's agents. This agent testifies that he was in a meeting with the buyers and heard the broker make the same promise about the rebate. The broker is objecting to this testimony, saying it's hearsay.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall what hearsay is. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally not admissible unless there's an exception that applies.\n\nIn this case, the agent is testifying about what the broker said during a meeting. So, the statement being offered is something the broker said, which is being repeated by the agent.\n\nNow, the broker is objecting on hearsay grounds. But wait a minute, the broker is a party to the lawsuit, right? And the statement being offered is something the broker said, which could be considered a party admission.\n\nI remember that statements made by a party to the litigation are generally admissible against that party, even if they're hearsay, because the party has the opportunity to explain or contradict the statement.\n\nBut in this case, the broker is objecting, so maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me look at the options provided:\n\nA. The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\n\nB. The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.\n\nC. The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.\n\nD. The testimony is admissible \u2014 even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.\n\nAlright, let's analyze these one by one.\n\nOption A suggests that the testimony is admissible because it's a party admission made through an authorized agent within the scope of employment.\n\nIn this scenario, the broker is the party, and the agent is testifying about what the broker said. If the agent was acting within the scope of his employment and was authorized to speak on behalf of the broker, then the broker's statements could be considered admissions by the party.\n\nBut wait, the agent is testifying about what the broker said, not what the agent himself said. So, it's the broker's statement being offered through the agent's testimony.\n\nI think the key here is whether the broker's statement is being offered against the broker as a party admission.\n\nOption B says the testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.\n\nBut in this case, it's not the agent's statement that's being offered for the truth of the matter asserted; it's the broker's statement that's being offered through the agent's testimony.\n\nSo, even if the agent wasn't authorized to speak for the broker, the broker's own statement could still be admissible as a party admission.\n\nHmm.\n\nOption C says the testimony is inadmissible because it's pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter in dispute.\n\nWell, the statement is being offered to prove that the broker made the promise about the rebate, which is relevant to whether the broker breached the contract or misrepresented facts.\n\nBut since it's the broker's own statement, and the broker is a party, it should be admissible as a party admission, which is an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nSo, according to that, option C might not be correct.\n\nOption D says the testimony is admissible even though it's hearsay because the broker is available to be cross-examined.\n\nWell, the broker being available for cross-examination might be relevant in some contexts, but in this case, since it's the broker's own statement being offered against them, it's more directly covered by the party admission exception.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is Option A: the testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\n\nThe agent was likely acting within the scope of his employment as a real estate agent, and if he was present during the meeting where the promise was made, his testimony about what the broker said should be admissible as evidence of the broker's admission.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it's the broker's statement being offered, not the agent's.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the party admission exception applies.\n\nOption D is somewhat confusing because it suggests that the testimony is admissible despite being hearsay because the broker can be cross-examined. But in reality, the party admission exception allows the statement to be admitted without needing to consider cross-examination in the same way.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is Option A.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check.\n\nIs the agent testifying about what the broker said, and the broker is the party being sued. If the broker made a statement that is being offered against them, and the agent is simply recounting that statement, then yes, it should be admissible as a party admission.\n\nI don't think the agent's authorization to speak for the broker is directly relevant here, because it's the broker's statement that's being offered, not the agent's.\n\nUnless there's some agency issue where the agent wasn't authorized to make that statement, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nNo, I think Option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
