                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the expression is \u221225 \u2212 (\u221211). Hmm, subtracting a negative, that always trips me up a bit. But I think I get it.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what subtracting a negative really means. My teacher said that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. So, \u2212(\u221211) should be the same as +11. Is that right? Let me confirm that.\n\nIf I have negative twenty-five and I subtract negative eleven, that's like saying I'm removing a debt of eleven, which is the same as gaining eleven. So, yes, it should be negative twenty-five plus eleven.\n\nOkay, so now I have \u221225 + 11. That seems simpler. But I still need to be careful with the signs.\n\nI can think of this as starting at negative twenty-five on a number line and then moving eleven units to the right. Because adding a positive number should shift me to the right on the number line.\n\nLet me visualize that: starting at \u221225, and then moving 11 units to the right. So, from \u221225 to \u221214, that's 11 units. Wait, let's count: \u221225 to \u221224 is one, to \u221223 is two, to \u221222 is three, to \u221221 is four, to \u221220 is five, to \u221219 is six, to \u221218 is seven, to \u221217 is eight, to \u221216 is nine, to \u221215 is ten, and to \u221214 is eleven. Yep, exactly eleven units.\n\nSo, \u221225 + 11 brings me to \u221214. That means the answer should be \u221214.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it another way. Maybe using the concept of absolute values or something.\n\nThe absolute difference between 25 and 11 is 14. So, if I'm subtracting 11 from \u221225, it's like adding 11 to \u221225, which is the same as moving 11 units on the number line, as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the operation in terms of addition and subtraction of integers. Since subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive, \u221225 \u2212 (\u221211) is indeed \u221225 + 11.\n\nLet me consider the rules for adding positive and negative integers. When adding a positive and a negative number, I subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and keep the sign of the larger absolute value.\n\nSo, 25 (absolute value of \u221225) is 25, and 11 is already positive. Subtracting 25 - 11 gives 14, and since 25 is larger and negative, the result is \u221214.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. Good, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider an example with smaller numbers to verify the concept. Say, \u22123 \u2212 (\u22122). That should be the same as \u22123 + 2, which is \u22121. Yeah, that checks out because subtracting a negative is like adding a positive.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the concept of opposites. The opposite of \u221211 is 11, so subtracting \u221211 is the same as adding 11.\n\nSo, all signs point to \u221214 being the correct answer.\n\nLet me check the options again to be sure:\n\nA. \u221236\n\nB. \u221214\n\nC. 14\n\nD. 36\n\nGiven that \u221225 \u2212 (\u221211) equals \u221214, the correct choice is B. \u221214.\n\nI think that's it. I've approached the problem from different angles and each time I arrive at the same answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-14} \\]"
