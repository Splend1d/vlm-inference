                    "text": "Okay, so I have this question about dietary protein. It says, \"Additional dietary protein may:\" and gives me four options. I need to pick the correct one. Let's see what they are.\n\nOption A says, \"Increase risk of hip fracture.\" Hmm, I've heard that too much protein can lead to bone issues because it might affect calcium absorption or something. But I'm not sure if that's true, or if it's only certain types of protein.\n\nOption B is, \"Decrease calcium excretion in the urine.\" Wait, I thought that high protein diets might increase calcium excretion, not decrease it. But maybe that's not always the case. Maybe some proteins help retain calcium.\n\nOption C says, \"Stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone.\" I know that protein intake can affect hormone levels, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is important for growth and repair. Maybe extra protein could stimulate its production.\n\nLastly, option D is, \"Reduce muscle mass and strength.\" That seems counterintuitive because protein is essential for building and repairing muscles. I would think that more protein could help increase muscle mass, not reduce it.\n\nAlright, I need to think carefully here. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: increase risk of hip fracture. Hip fractures are typically associated with osteoporosis, which is a weakening of bones. Protein is needed for building and maintaining bone tissue, so having enough protein is important for bone health. Some studies suggest that higher protein intake is actually beneficial for bone density, especially in older adults. So, maybe this option isn't correct.\n\nMoving on to option B: decrease calcium excretion in the urine. Calcium excretion can be influenced by protein intake. High protein diets can lead to increased acid production, which the body tries to buffer using calcium from bones, potentially leading to increased calcium excretion in urine. So, if additional protein leads to higher acid loads, it might increase calcium excretion, not decrease it. Therefore, this option seems unlikely.\n\nOption C: stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone. Actually, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a hormone that is indeed stimulated by protein intake. It's involved in muscle growth and recovery. So, additional protein could lead to increased IGF-1 levels, which would promote muscle protein synthesis and growth. This seems like a plausible answer.\n\nLastly, option D: reduce muscle mass and strength. This seems contradictory because protein is the building block of muscles. Without enough protein, muscle mass can decrease, but additional protein should help maintain or increase muscle mass, especially with exercise. So, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me double-check. If I eat more protein than my body needs, what happens? Excess protein can be converted into glucose or stored as fat, but it doesn't necessarily reduce muscle mass. In fact, consistent protein intake is crucial for muscle health.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems the most accurate. Additional dietary protein may stimulate the production of insulin-like growth hormone, which is beneficial for muscle growth and overall bodily functions.\n\nWait a minute, is insulin-like growth hormone the same as IGF-1? Actually, I think they're related but not exactly the same. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a hormone that is important for growth and metabolism, and it is indeed influenced by protein intake.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about the other options again. Option A suggests increased risk of hip fracture, but actually, adequate protein intake is important for bone health and may reduce the risk of fractures.\n\nOption B says decrease calcium excretion in urine, but high protein diets might increase calcium excretion due to higher acid loads, which could leach calcium from bones.\n\nOption D claims reduced muscle mass and strength, but protein is essential for building and maintaining muscles, so additional protein should help preserve or increase muscle mass, especially in conjunction with exercise.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option C: stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
