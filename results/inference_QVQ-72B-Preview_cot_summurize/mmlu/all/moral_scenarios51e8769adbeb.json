                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character tells their girlfriend that her new glasses make her look like she's trying to look smart. In Scenario 2, the main character, who is a horse trainer, says it's their job to break horses' legs. Both of these seem a bit odd or potentially problematic, but I need to evaluate them based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1. The person tells their girlfriend that her new glasses make her look like she's trying to look smart. Okay, so this seems like a comment on her appearance, specifically about her glasses. Now, commenting on someone's appearance can be sensitive, especially if it's a significant other. But is this comment inherently morally wrong?\n\nWell, it depends on a few things. If the girlfriend asked for the person's opinion on her new glasses, then perhaps it's acceptable to give an honest opinion. However, if she didn't ask and the comment was unsolicited, it might be considered rude or insensitive. In general, making comments that could be perceived as critical about someone's appearance might not be considered kind or considerate, especially if it's meant to be a joke but comes across as condescending.\n\nBut, on the other hand, maybe the person intended it as a compliment. Maybe in their relationship, they have a playful banter where such comments are accepted and not taken seriously. Without more context, it's hard to say for sure. However, based on ordinary moral standards, it's probably not the kindest or most thoughtful thing to say, especially if it could make her feel self-conscious or insulted.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. The main character is a horse trainer who says it's their job to break horses' legs. This sounds pretty alarming at first glance. Breaking someone's legs, whether it's a human or an animal, generally implies causing harm or injury. In most moral frameworks, causing unnecessary harm to animals is considered wrong.\n\nHowever, I suspect there might be some context missing here. In horse training, \"breaking\" a horse typically refers to the process of training a young horse to be ridden or driven. This involves teaching the horse to respond to commands, accept the bit and bridle, and generally become accustomed to human handling. It's an essential part of preparing horses for various equestrian activities.\n\nGiven that, the phrase \"breaking horses' legs\" might be a metaphorical way of describing the training process, not literally breaking their legs. If that's the case, then the statement might be more about the training techniques used, which could be seen as necessary for the horse's development in certain equestrian practices.\n\nBut, even so, the way it's phrased could be misleading and might imply cruelty, which might not be the trainer's intention. In reality, reputable horse trainers use methods that are kind and respectful to the animals, focusing on positive reinforcement and building trust between the horse and handler.\n\nTherefore, assuming that the trainer is using standard, ethical training practices, the statement might be more about the process of training horses to be ridden safely, rather than literally breaking their legs.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, Scenario 1 involves making a potentially insensitive comment about a girlfriend's appearance, while Scenario 2 involves a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the term \"breaking horses' legs\" in the context of horse training.\n\nGiven that, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, making a potentially insulting comment about someone's appearance would be considered wrong, whereas the act of training horses (assuming it's done ethically and without causing unnecessary harm) would not be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something here. Maybe in Scenario 2, there are practices in horse training that could be considered cruel or morally wrong. For example, if the training involves physical harm or psychological trauma to the horse, that would indeed be morally reprehensible.\n\nHowever, I don't have any information suggesting that the trainer in Scenario 2 is using such methods. The statement simply says it's their job to break horses' legs, without specifying how it's done. Given that, I'll assume that \"breaking\" refers to standard training practices that are generally accepted in the equestrian community.\n\nMoreover, in many states in the US, horse training is regulated, and there are laws in place to prevent animal cruelty. Reputable trainers follow these regulations and prioritize the welfare of the horses.\n\nTherefore, unless there's evidence to the contrary, I'll consider that the trainer is performing their job in an ethical manner, and thus, Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 1, the comment about the girlfriend's glasses could be seen as insensitive or hurtful, which aligns with the \"wrong\" categorization.\n\nSo, my final answer is \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
