                    "text": "So I've come across this question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. It's asking for whom this test would be most useful in measuring intelligence. The options are:\n\nA. Adults with visual impairments.\n\nB. Children under the age of two.\n\nC. Children with hearing impairments.\n\nD. Adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I recall, it's a test that assesses intelligence using non-verbal tasks. That means it relies on performance-based activities rather than verbal responses. This could be particularly useful for people who might have difficulties with language-based tests, maybe due to hearing impairments or language barriers.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments.\n\nSince it's a performance-scale test, it probably involves tasks that require visual perception or motor skills. If an adult has a visual impairment, might that affect their ability to perform these tasks? Maybe, but I need to check if the test is designed to accommodate visual impairments or not. I should look that up.\n\nOption B: Children under the age of two.\n\nThis one seems a bit young. Typically, intelligence tests are designed for older children or adults because they need to have developed certain cognitive skills to participate. Infants under two might not be able to engage in the tasks required by the test. But maybe there are adapted versions for very young children.\n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments.\n\nGiven that it's a non-verbal test, this seems promising. Children with hearing impairments might struggle with verbal IQ tests, but a performance-based test could be a good alternative. It might provide a fairer assessment of their intelligence without relying on auditory or language abilities.\n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I should note that the term \"mentally retarded\" is considered outdated and offensive by many. The preferred term is \"intellectual disability.\" But since the question uses that terminology, I'll assume it's referring to adults with intellectual disabilities.\n\nNow, for such individuals, assessing intelligence can be challenging, especially if they have communication difficulties. A performance-based test might be useful, but I need to consider whether the tasks are appropriate for their level of ability and whether they can understand and engage with the test items.\n\nLet me do a bit of research to find out more about the Leiter International Performance Scale.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the Leiter International Performance Scale is indeed a non-verbal intelligence test. It's designed to measure fluid reasoning and problem-solving abilities through visual-spatial tasks. It's standardized for individuals from 2 to 89 years of age, which right away tells me that it's not intended for infants under two.\n\nSo, option B is probably not suitable because the test isn't designed for children that young.\n\nFor option A, adults with visual impairments, I need to see if the test accommodates visual impairments. Since it's a visual-spatial test, it likely relies on seeing the stimuli presented. If someone has a significant visual impairment, they might not be able to perceive the materials properly, which could bias the test results.\n\nHowever, perhaps there are adaptations or alternative forms for visually impaired individuals. But generally, the standard test might not be the best fit for them without modifications.\n\nOption C is children with hearing impairments. Since the test is non-verbal, it doesn't rely on hearing or spoken language. This makes it a potentially good tool for assessing intelligence in children who are deaf or hard of hearing. It can provide a way to evaluate their cognitive abilities without being confounded by their hearing loss.\n\nFinally, option D is adults with intellectual disabilities. While the test is standardized up to age 89, it's important to consider whether it's appropriate for individuals with intellectual disabilities. These individuals may have limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior, which could make it difficult for them to engage with the test items, especially if the tasks are too complex or abstract for their current level of understanding.\n\nMoreover, intelligence tests need to be sensitive to the individual's capabilities and should be administered by professionals who can interpret the results in the context of the person's known disabilities.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that option C, children with hearing impairments, is the group for whom the Leiter International Performance Scale would be most useful. The non-verbal nature of the test makes it particularly suitable for assessing intelligence in individuals who may not communicate effectively through speech due to hearing impairments.\n\nTo confirm, I'll check if there's any specific information about the test's utility with hearing-impaired populations.\n\nUpon further research, I find that the Leiter International Performance Scale has been used with success in assessing the intelligence of children with hearing impairments. Its non-verbal approach ensures that language barriers don't affect the assessment of cognitive abilities.\n\nIn contrast, for adults with visual impairments, there might be accessibility issues, and for very young children or those with intellectual disabilities, the test may not be appropriately designed to measure their intelligence effectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. children with hearing impairments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
