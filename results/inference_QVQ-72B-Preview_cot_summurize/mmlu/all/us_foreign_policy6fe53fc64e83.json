US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865\n\nC. US expansion was limited to Latin America post-1865\n\nD. US expansion ended after 1865\n\nI need to figure out what the key difference is between US expansion before and after 1865.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what was happening before and after that year. 1865 is a significant year in American history because it's when the Civil War ended. The Civil War was fought over many issues, but slavery was a major one. After 1865, the US started to rebuild, and there were shifts in its approach to expansion.\n\nLet me think about US expansion before 1865. In the early years, the US acquired territories through purchases like the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, which doubled the size of the country. There was also westward expansion, with settlers moving across the continent, and conflicts with Native American tribes. Manifest Destiny was a popular idea in the 19th century, which promoted the idea that the US was destined to spread across North America.\n\nDuring this time, expansion was largely about acquiring new lands and establishing sovereignty over them. There was also an element of establishing markets, but I think territory was the primary focus.\n\nAfter 1865, things changed. The US started to look beyond North America for expansion. There was increased interest in overseas territories and markets. For example, the US acquired Hawaii in 1898 and Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines after the Spanish-American War in the same year.\n\nIn this period, the focus seemed to shift more towards controlling strategic locations and accessing foreign markets rather than just acquiring new lands to settle. This was part of a larger trend of imperialism among Western powers at the time.\n\nSo, comparing before and after 1865, it seems like before, expansion was more about territorial acquisition for settlement and manifest destiny, while after 1865, it was more about acquiring strategic territories and opening up new markets.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. US expansion was based on territory rather than markets post-1865\n\nB. US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865\n\nC. US expansion was limited to Latin America post-1865\n\nD. US expansion ended after 1865\n\nOption A suggests that after 1865, expansion was still based on territory rather than markets, but from what I recall, the focus shifted more towards markets and strategic positions after that time.\n\nOption B says expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865, which seems to align with what I thought earlier.\n\nOption C claims that expansion was limited to Latin America after 1865, but that doesn't seem right. The US expanded into places like Hawaii, the Philippines, and Guam, which are not in Latin America.\n\nOption D says that expansion ended after 1865, but that's not true. The US continued to expand its influence and acquire territories after that date.\n\nBased on this, I think option B is the correct answer. US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about some specific examples.\n\nAfter 1865, the US was involved in several actions that suggest a focus on markets and economic interests:\n\n- The Open Door Policy in China (1899), which aimed to keep Chinese ports open to trade from all countries, preventing any single power from monopolizing China's markets.\n\n- The acquisition of the Philippines, which gave the US a foothold in Southeast Asia and access to valuable trade routes.\n\n- The building of the Panama Canal, which was strategic for trade and military purposes, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\n- The intervention in Latin American affairs, sometimes for protecting American business interests.\n\nAll these examples point towards a focus on markets and economic interests rather than just territorial acquisition for settlement.\n\nOn the other hand, there were still instances of territorial expansion for strategic reasons, but even those often had economic motivations underlying them.\n\nSo, I think option B is the best answer. US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
