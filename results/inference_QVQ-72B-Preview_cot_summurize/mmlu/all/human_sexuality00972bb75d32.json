                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which theory uses terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain how exposure to erotica can affect a person's behavior. The options are sociobiology, psychoanalytic theory, script theory, and social learning theory. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, sociobiology. I remember that sociobiology is a field that tries to explain social behaviors in terms of evolutionary advantages. It looks at how genes might influence social traits and behaviors. But I don't recall it specifically using terms like \"modelling\" or \"imitation.\" Maybe it touches on learning from others, but it seems more focused on genetic influences.\n\nNext, psychoanalytic theory. This is Freud's theory, right? It focuses on unconscious motives and early childhood experiences shaping personality and behavior. While it does talk about learning through identification with parents or caregivers, I don't think it emphasizes \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" in the same way some other theories do. It might be indirectly related, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThen there's script theory. I'm not as familiar with this one. I think it relates to how we learn and use sequences of behavior, like scripts, in social situations. Maybe it involves learning behaviors through observation and imitation, but I'm not sure if it specifically uses those terms.\n\nLastly, social learning theory. This one sounds promising. Social learning theory, as I understand it, emphasizes how people learn by observing others. It's famous for the concept of modelling, where individuals imitate the behaviors they see in others, especially if those behaviors are reinforced. Bandura's experiments with the Bobo doll come to mind, where children who observed aggressive behavior were more likely to act aggressively themselves.\n\nGiven that, social learning theory seems to directly use the terms \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain how behaviors are learned and replicated. So, it probably applies to exposure to erotica as well\u2014suggesting that if someone is exposed to certain behaviors in erotica, they might imitate or model those behaviors in their own life.\n\nLet me double-check. Sociobiology is more about evolution and genes influencing behavior. Psychoanalytic theory is about unconscious motives and early childhood experiences. Script theory seems to involve sequences of learned behaviors, possibly through observation, but it's not as clearly focused on modelling and imitation as social learning theory.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be D. social learning theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
