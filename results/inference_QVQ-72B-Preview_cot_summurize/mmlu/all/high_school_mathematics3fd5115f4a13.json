                    "text": "Let's see how many numbers are in this list: 25, 26, 27, all the way up to 99, and 100. I need to find out how many numbers are there in total, including both 25 and 100.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how to calculate the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence because these numbers are increasing by 1 each time, which is a common difference.\n\nI remember that an arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Here, the first term a1 is 25, the last term an is 100, and the common difference d is 1.\n\nThe formula for the number of terms n in an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nn = (an - a1)/d + 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nn = (100 - 25)/1 + 1\n\nn = 75/1 + 1\n\nn = 75 + 1\n\nn = 76\n\nSo, there are 76 numbers in the list.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes, I might make a mistake in counting the first and last terms.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the sequence starting from 25 to 100, inclusive. If I subtract 24 from each number, the sequence becomes 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 76, since 100 - 24 = 76. But that doesn't seem right because 100 - 24 is 76, but that doesn't account for the starting point correctly.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can list out a smaller version and see the pattern.\n\nSuppose the list was from 1 to 5:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nThat's 5 numbers.\n\nUsing the formula: n = (5 - 1)/1 + 1 = 4/1 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nOkay, that matches.\n\nAnother example: from 10 to 20:\n\n10, 11, 12, ..., 20\n\nNumber of terms: n = (20 - 10)/1 + 1 = 10/1 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\n\nCounting them: 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 \u2013 indeed 11 numbers.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nApplying it back to the original problem: n = (100 - 25)/1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 76.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nMaybe using the formula for the last term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nPlugging in:\n\n100 = 25 + (n - 1)*1\n\n100 = 25 + n - 1\n\n100 = 24 + n\n\nn = 100 - 24 = 76\n\nYes, again, n = 76.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that from 25 to 100, inclusive, is a range of 100 - 25 + 1 = 76 numbers.\n\nThis makes sense because from 25 to 100, if I include both ends, the total count is 100 - 25 + 1 = 76.\n\nSo, all methods point to 76 being the correct count.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the sequence as a list of integers starting at 25 and ending at 100, with each step being 1. This is a simple arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1.\n\nIn sequences where the common difference is 1, the number of terms is simply the difference between the last term and the first term, plus 1.\n\nSo, again, n = 100 - 25 + 1 = 76.\n\nThis reinforces that the answer is 76.\n\nI think I might have initially doubted my calculation because I was thinking about the range from 25 to 100 and wasn't sure if both endpoints are included correctly. But now, with multiple confirmations, I'm confident that 76 is the right answer.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. 75\n\nB. 76\n\nC. 22\n\nD. 23\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 76.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question that might lead to a different answer.\n\nIs there any possibility of miscounting because the sequence might have a different step size? No, the problem specifies that the sequence increases by 1 each time, so the common difference is indeed 1.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the sequence is inclusive of both endpoints, which it is, as stated: \"25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100.\"\n\nTherefore, there's no reason to doubt the calculation further.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of numbers in the list from 25 to 100, inclusive, with a step of 1, is 76.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{76} \\]"
