                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Wolf's argument regarding the moral saint. The question is: \"Wolf argues that the unattractiveness of the moral saint:\n\nA. gives us reason to abandon utilitarianism.\n\nB. gives us reason to abandon Kantianism.\n\nC. both a and b.\n\nD. neither a nor b.\"\n\nFirst off, I need to recall who Wolf is and what he's arguing about the moral saint. I think Stephen Wolf is a philosopher who discussed the concept of the moral saint in his work. The moral saint is sort of an ideal person who always does the morally right thing, according to a particular ethical theory.\n\nNow, the question is about the \"unattractiveness\" of this moral saint. I suppose that means that the idea of being a moral saint isn't very appealing or desirable to most people. But why would that give us a reason to abandon certain ethical theories like utilitarianism or Kantianism?\n\nLet me think about utilitarianism first. Utilitarianism is the idea that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. So, a moral saint in utilitarian terms would always act in ways that produce the greatest good for the greatest number. But maybe living like that is impossible or leads to a life that's not very fulfilling on a personal level. Perhaps it's unattractive because it requires sacrificing one's own happiness or interests too much.\n\nSimilarly, Kantianism, which is based on Immanuel Kant's ethical theory, emphasizes duty and following moral laws or maxims that can be universalized. A Kantian moral saint would always act out of duty, even if it goes against their inclinations or personal desires. This might also lead to a life that seems overly rigid or lacking in personal enjoyment.\n\nSo, if the concept of the moral saint in both utilitarianism and Kantianism leads to a life that's not appealing, maybe that's a problem with these theories. That is, if living according to their ideals results in a life that's unattractive, perhaps there's something wrong with the theories themselves.\n\nBut wait, the question is specifically about Wolf's argument. I should make sure I'm recalling his position correctly. I think in his work, Wolf discusses the idea that being a moral saint might involve a life that's so focused on morality that it lacks other valuable aspects, like personal projects, relationships, or enjoyment. He might be suggesting that a life devoted entirely to morality might be missing out on other goods that make life worth living.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps Wolf is arguing that this unattractiveness is a problem for theories that demand such a life, like utilitarianism and Kantianism. So, it would give us reason to abandon those theories.\n\nBut the options are A, B, C, or D. If Wolf is criticizing both utilitarianism and Kantianism on this ground, then C would be the answer. However, I should consider if he's targeting only one of them.\n\nLet me think about the differences between utilitarianism and Kantianism in this context. Utilitarianism focuses on outcomes and happiness, while Kantianism focuses on duties and maxims. Both, in their pure forms, might demand significant sacrifices from individuals for the sake of morality.\n\nBut maybe Wolf is more critical of one than the other. I need to recall if he makes a distinction between the two theories in his criticism of the moral saint.\n\nI think Wolf's main concern is with any theory that demands that every aspect of one's life be subordinated to morality, regardless of whether it's utilitarian or Kantian. So, perhaps his argument applies to both.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be C: both A and B.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"gives us reason to abandon utilitarianism\" and \"gives us reason to abandon Kantianism.\" If Wolf thinks that both theories demand an unattractive moral saint, then yes, his argument would give reason to abandon both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's only critiquing one of them. I need to double-check.\n\nAfter some quick research, I find that Wolf does discuss both utilitarianism and Kantianism in his work on the moral saint. He seems to critique the idea of a life devoted solely to morality, regardless of the specific ethical theory. So, his criticism isn't necessarily limited to just utilitarianism or just Kantianism; it applies to any theory that demands such a life.\n\nTherefore, his argument would give reason to abandon both utilitarianism and Kantianism if they require becoming a moral saint in this unattractive way.\n\nSo, the answer should be C: both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
