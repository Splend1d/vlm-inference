                    "text": "Let's see here. So, the county government is giving out coupons to parents to subsidize the cost of daycare for their children. I need to figure out what effect this would have on the market for daycare services. The options are about changes in demand or supply, and how that affects the market price.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic economics. Demand is the willingness and ability of consumers to buy a product at a certain price, while supply is the willingness and ability of producers to sell a product at a certain price. When there's a change in one of these, it affects the equilibrium price and quantity in the market.\n\nNow, the government is providing coupons that subsidize the cost of daycare. A subsidy typically makes a service more affordable for consumers because they're paying less than the full cost. In this case, parents are getting a coupon that reduces their out-of-pocket expense for daycare.\n\nSo, from the parents' perspective, the effective price of daycare goes down because of the subsidy. That should make daycare more attractive to them, meaning they might want to use more daycare services than before, right? So, that sounds like an increase in demand.\n\nWait, but is this a shift in demand or just a movement along the demand curve? A subsidy that directly reduces the price would cause a movement along the demand curve, but since the subsidy is through coupons and doesn't directly affect the price set by the daycare providers, maybe it's different.\n\nLet me think differently. The subsidy reduces the cost for parents, so they can afford to send their children to daycare more easily. That should increase the quantity demanded at the existing price level. So, demand increases.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The demand for daycare falls, lowering the market price.\n\nThis seems opposite to what I just thought. If demand falls, yes, the market price would likely decrease, but I think demand increases in this scenario.\n\nB. The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nThis aligns with what I thought. If demand increases, and supply remains constant, the equilibrium price should increase.\n\nC. The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\n\nWait, the subsidy is given to parents, not to daycare providers. So, it's affecting the demand side, not the supply side. If anything, the subsidy increases demand, not supply. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nD. The supply of daycare falls, increasing the market price.\n\nAgain, the subsidy is to parents, which should affect demand, not supply. So, this also doesn't seem relevant.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct one. The demand for daycare rises, which increases the market price.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nSuppose the subsidy makes daycare more affordable, so more parents want to send their children to daycare. That increases the number of children parents want to enroll, which shifts the demand curve to the right. With the supply curve remaining the same, the equilibrium price should increase.\n\nWait, but is there any possibility that the subsidy could affect the supply side as well? For example, if daycares receive more children because of increased demand, maybe they expand their capacity, which would shift the supply curve to the right. But that seems like a secondary effect.\n\nActually, in the short run, the supply of daycare might be relatively fixed, so the primary effect would be on demand. In the long run, if demand increases, suppliers might respond by increasing supply, but that's not immediate.\n\nGiven that, the immediate effect of the subsidy would be to increase demand, leading to a higher market price.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\nIs there any chance that the subsidy could decrease demand? No, because making something cheaper usually increases demand.\n\nCould the subsidy somehow affect supply directly? Not really, since it's targeted at parents, not directly at daycares.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward answer is that demand increases, leading to an increase in the market price.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
