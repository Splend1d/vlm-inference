Let me try to wrap my head around it.\n\nWe have sets A and B, and functions f: A \u2192 B and g: B \u2192 A. The key condition is that for all a in A, g(f(a)) = a. I need to determine whether this condition implies that g is injective and/or surjective.\n\nFirst, let's recall what injective and surjective mean:\n\n- **Injective (one-to-one):** A function h is injective if different inputs map to different outputs. In other words, if h(x) = h(y), then x = y.\n\n- **Surjective (onto):** A function h is surjective if every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. So, for every y in the codomain, there exists an x in the domain such that h(x) = y.\n\nGiven that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, this looks like g composed with f is the identity function on A, denoted as id_A(a) = a.\n\nSo, g \u2218 f = id_A.\n\nNow, I need to see what this implies about g being injective or surjective.\n\nLet me start by thinking about injectivity of g.\n\n**Statement 1: The function g must necessarily be injective.**\n\nTo prove that g is injective, I need to show that if g(b1) = g(b2), then b1 = b2 for any b1, b2 in B.\n\nLet\u2019s assume g(b1) = g(b2).\n\nI need to show that b1 = b2.\n\nSince f maps from A to B, for any b in B, there might or might not be an a in A such that f(a) = b. That depends on whether f is surjective or not.\n\nBut I don't have information about whether f is surjective or not from the given condition.\n\nWait, but the condition is that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. This tells me that f is surjective because for every b in B, there exists an a in A such that f(a) = b, since g(f(a)) is defined for all a in A.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A tells me that for every a in A, f(a) is in B and g maps it back to a. This implies that f is surjective because for every b in B, there exists an a in A such that f(a) = b, since g(f(a)) is defined for all a in A.\n\nBut hold on, is that necessarily true?\n\nLet me think carefully.\n\nSuppose f is not surjective, meaning there exists some b in B such that there is no a in A with f(a) = b.\n\nIn that case, g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, but for those b's not in the image of f, g(b) is still defined (since g: B \u2192 A), but we don't have any restriction on what g(b) should be for those b's.\n\nHowever, the condition only specifies g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, which doesn't directly tell us about the behavior of g on B outside of the image of f.\n\nWait, but since g is a function from B to A, it must be defined for all b in B.\n\nBut the condition only ties g(f(a)) to a for a in A.\n\nSo, perhaps f is surjective, because g(f(a)) is defined for all a in A, implying that f(a) covers all of B.\n\nWait, no. Actually, g(f(a)) is defined because f(a) is in B, and g is defined on B. The condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A doesn't guarantee that f is surjective because it only tells us about the values of f(a) for a in A, not about all of B.\n\nSo, f might not be surjective. There could be elements in B not in the image of f.\n\nTherefore, g is defined on all of B, but for those b not in the image of f, g(b) could be anything in A, and the condition doesn't restrict them.\n\nSo, f being surjective is not guaranteed by the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.\n\nTherefore, I can't assume that f is surjective.\n\nNow, going back to proving that g is injective.\n\nI need to show that if g(b1) = g(b2), then b1 = b2 for any b1, b2 in B.\n\nGiven that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, I need to see if this implies that g is injective.\n\nLet me consider two cases:\n\n1. b is in the image of f, i.e., there exists a in A such that b = f(a).\n\n2. b is not in the image of f.\n\nIn the first case, if b1 = f(a1) and b2 = f(a2), and g(b1) = g(b2), then g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)).\n\nBut since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, this implies a1 = a2. Therefore, b1 = f(a1) = f(a2) = b2.\n\nSo, in this case, g is injective on the image of f.\n\nBut what about b's not in the image of f?\n\nIf there exists b in B such that b is not equal to f(a) for any a in A, then g(b) could be anything in A, and the condition g(f(a)) = a doesn't restrict g(b).\n\nTherefore, for b1 and b2 not in the image of f, g(b1) could equal g(b2) even if b1 \u2260 b2.\n\nFor example, suppose A = {1,2}, B = {a,b,c}, f(1)=a, f(2)=b, and g(a)=1, g(b)=2, g(c)=1.\n\nThen g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1, and g(f(2)) = g(b) = 2, which satisfies the condition.\n\nBut g(b) = g(c) = 2, yet b \u2260 c.\n\nSo, in this case, g is not injective because g(b) = g(c) but b \u2260 c.\n\nTherefore, g does not necessarily have to be injective.\n\nHence, Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, let's consider Statement 2: The function g must necessarily be surjective.\n\nTo prove that g is surjective, I need to show that for every a in A, there exists a b in B such that g(b) = a.\n\nGiven that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, this directly implies that for every a in A, there exists at least one b in B, namely f(a), such that g(b) = a.\n\nTherefore, g is surjective.\n\nWait, is that sufficient?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nGiven any a in A, g(f(a)) = a. So, for each a in A, there is at least one b in B, specifically b = f(a), such that g(b) = a.\n\nTherefore, every element in A is the image under g of some element in B.\n\nHence, g is surjective.\n\nIs there any way g could fail to be surjective given this condition?\n\nFrom the definition of surjectivity, it requires that every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain.\n\nSince for every a in A, there is a b in B (namely f(a)) such that g(b) = a, it seems that g is indeed surjective.\n\nLet me consider an example.\n\nSuppose A = {1,2}, B = {a,b}, f(1)=a, f(2)=b, g(a)=1, g(b)=2.\n\nThen g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1, and g(f(2)) = g(b) = 2, which satisfies the condition.\n\nIn this case, g is surjective because both elements of A are hit by g.\n\nAnother example: suppose A = {1}, B = {a,b}, f(1)=a, g(a)=1, g(b)=1.\n\nThen g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1, which satisfies the condition.\n\nIn this case, g is still surjective because g maps to every element in A.\n\nIs there an example where g is not surjective?\n\nWait, in this last example, g is surjective because g(a)=1 and g(b)=1, and 1 is the only element of A, so it's covered.\n\nSo, it seems that in all examples, g is surjective.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought that f might not be surjective, but that doesn't affect the surjectivity of g in this context.\n\nBecause even if f is not surjective, g is still mapping from B to A, and the condition g(f(a)) = a ensures that every element of A is hit by g via f(a).\n\nBut what if there are elements in B not hit by f? Does that matter for g being surjective?\n\nNo, because g needs to map all of B to A, and the condition only specifies that g maps f(a) to a for all a in A.\n\nElements in B not in the image of f can be mapped to any a in A, but as long as for every a in A, there is at least one b in B (specifically f(a)) such that g(b) = a, then g is surjective.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Statement 1: The function g must necessarily be injective. This is false, as shown by the counterexample where g(b) = g(c) but b \u2260 c.\n\n- Statement 2: The function g must necessarily be surjective. This is true, as the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A ensures that every element in A is hit by g.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.\n\nWait, but in the options, C is True, False, but according to my reasoning, Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, so it should be False, True, which is D.\n\nWait, let's check the options again:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nGiven that, and my reasoning, it seems that D. False, True is the correct answer.\n\nBut in my earlier thought process, I might have misremembered the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to double-check the options.\n\nOption C is True, False, which corresponds to Statement 1 being true and Statement 2 being false.\n\nBut according to my reasoning, Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, which would be Option D.\n\nMaybe I misread the options initially.\n\nIn any case, based on my reasoning, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
