                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. We have two objects, A and B, both with equal charge and equal mass. They're not moving because the gravitational force and the electrostatic force between them balance each other out. So, right now, everything is in equilibrium.\n\nNow, the problem says that if the mass of Object A is halved, we need to figure out what change to Object B will maintain this equilibrium. The options are:\n\nA. The charge on Object A were doubled\n\nWait, but Object A's charge is being changed? But the problem says \"the charge on Object A were doubled,\" but earlier it says both objects have equal charge initially. Maybe I need to read this carefully.\n\nActually, the problem says: \"if the mass of Object A is halved, equilibrium will be maintained if...\"\n\nAnd then lists options A through D:\n\nA. the charge on Object A were doubled\n\nB. the charge on Object B were halved\n\nC. the charge on Object B were doubled\n\nD. the mass on Object B were halved\n\nFirst, I need to understand the forces involved. There's gravitational force and electrostatic force acting between A and B.\n\nInitially, they are in equilibrium, meaning these two forces cancel each other out:\n\nF_gravity = F_electrostatic\n\nWe know that gravitational force between two masses is given by:\n\nF_g = G * (m_A * m_B) / r^2\n\nAnd the electrostatic force between two charges is given by:\n\nF_e = k * (q_A * q_B) / r^2\n\nWhere:\n\n- G is the gravitational constant\n\n- k is Coulomb's constant\n\n- m_A and m_B are the masses of objects A and B\n\n- q_A and q_B are the charges of objects A and B\n\n- r is the distance between them\n\nGiven that initially m_A = m_B and q_A = q_B, and the forces are equal:\n\nG * (m^2) / r^2 = k * (q^2) / r^2\n\nWhere m is the initial mass and q is the initial charge.\n\nWe can cancel r^2 from both sides:\n\nG * m^2 = k * q^2\n\nNow, if the mass of Object A is halved, m_A becomes m/2, while m_B remains m.\n\nWe need to find out what change to Object B (either its charge or its mass) will maintain the equilibrium, meaning F_g = F_e again.\n\nSo, let's write the new forces:\n\nNew gravitational force:\n\nF_g_new = G * (m_A * m_B) / r^2 = G * (m/2 * m) / r^2 = G * (m^2 / 2) / r^2 = G * m^2 / (2 r^2)\n\nNew electrostatic force:\n\nThis depends on what we do with Object B's charge or mass.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The charge on Object A were doubled.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the charge on Object A were doubled,\" but in the scenario, only mass of A is changed, not its charge. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's considering changing charge of A additionally. But the problem seems to suggest that only mass of A is halved, and then we need to adjust something about B to maintain equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's implying that to maintain equilibrium, we need to adjust B's properties, and option A is suggesting changing A's charge, which seems contradictory because A's charge isn't being changed in the scenario.\n\nLet me re-read the problem to make sure.\n\n\"Two objects, A and B, have equal charge and equal mass. Neither body is in motion because the gravitational and electrostatic forces between them are equal. If the mass of Object A is halved, equilibrium will be maintained if:\"\n\nThen, options are about changing B's charge or mass.\n\nSo, perhaps the idea is that only A's mass is halved, and we need to adjust B's charge or mass to maintain equilibrium.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed.\n\nInitial equilibrium:\n\nG * m^2 / r^2 = k * q^2 / r^2 \u21d2 G * m^2 = k * q^2\n\nAfter halving A's mass, m_A = m/2, m_B = m\n\nNew gravitational force:\n\nF_g_new = G * (m/2 * m) / r^2 = G * m^2 / (2 r^2)\n\nWe need this to equal the new electrostatic force, F_e_new.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nOption A: The charge on Object A were doubled.\n\nBut according to the problem, only mass of A is halved, not its charge. So, if q_A remains q, and we're not changing it, then F_e_new = k * (q * q_B) / r^2 = k * (q * q) / r^2 = k * q^2 / r^2\n\nBut wait, this is the same as the initial F_e, but m_A is now m/2, so F_g_new is smaller. So, to maintain equilibrium, F_e_new should also be smaller. But keeping q_A and q_B the same would mean F_e_new remains the same, which would not balance F_g_new.\n\nSo, option A seems irrelevant because it's about changing q_A, which isn't being changed in the scenario.\n\nOption B: The charge on Object B were halved.\n\nSo, q_B becomes q/2.\n\nThen, F_e_new = k * (q * q/2) / r^2 = k * (q^2 / 2) / r^2 = k * q^2 / (2 r^2)\n\nNow, compare F_g_new and F_e_new:\n\nF_g_new = G * m^2 / (2 r^2)\n\nF_e_new = k * q^2 / (2 r^2)\n\nFrom initial equilibrium, G * m^2 = k * q^2\n\nSo, F_g_new = F_e_new, which means equilibrium is maintained.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be a possible answer.\n\nOption C: The charge on Object B were doubled.\n\nSo, q_B becomes 2q.\n\nThen, F_e_new = k * (q * 2q) / r^2 = 2 k * q^2 / r^2\n\nBut from initial equilibrium, k * q^2 / r^2 = G * m^2 / r^2\n\nSo, F_e_new = 2 * (G * m^2 / r^2) = 2 F_g_initial\n\nBut F_g_new = G * m^2 / (2 r^2)\n\nSo, F_e_new = 2 * (G * m^2 / r^2) \u2260 G * m^2 / (2 r^2)\n\nTherefore, F_e_new \u2260 F_g_new, so equilibrium is not maintained.\n\nOption D: The mass on Object B were halved.\n\nSo, m_B becomes m/2.\n\nThen, F_g_new = G * (m/2 * m/2) / r^2 = G * m^2 / (4 r^2)\n\nFrom initial equilibrium, G * m^2 = k * q^2\n\nSo, F_g_new = k * q^2 / 4 r^2\n\nBut F_e_new = k * (q * q) / r^2 = k * q^2 / r^2\n\nSo, F_e_new \u2260 F_g_new, unless k * q^2 / r^2 = k * q^2 / (4 r^2), which is not true.\n\nTherefore, equilibrium is not maintained in this case.\n\nSo, the only option that maintains equilibrium is Option B: the charge on Object B were halved.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
