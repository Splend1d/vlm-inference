                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out who owns this vacant lot based on some past transactions and conditions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the shopkeeper owns the lot in \"fee simple absolute,\" which means they have the highest possible ownership interest in the property, with no restrictions or conditions attached. So, in 1960, they convey the property by a general warranty deed. The deed says: \"The grantor hereby conveys the vacant lot to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25.\"\n\nOkay, so the primary grant is to the friend, but there's a condition subsequent related to the use of the property for church purposes. If that happens, then the property is to go to the children of the grantor's sister who are at least 25 years old.\n\nNow, at the time of the conveyance, the sister was single but later married and had two sons. One of these sons died in an automobile accident, and then three years later, she had a daughter. Now, in an action to determine the ownership rights, with all minors represented, we need to figure out who holds the title.\n\nLet's consider the type of estate the friend received. The conveyance was \"to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25.\" This seems like a fee simple determinable estate because there's a condition that could terminate the friend's interest if the property is used for church purposes.\n\nHowever, the use of \"if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25\" sounds more like a condition subsequent because it specifies that upon the occurrence of a certain event (using the property for church purposes), the interest will transfer to another party.\n\nBut in property law, when you have a grant to A, then to B if C happens, it's typically considered a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. So, the friend has a fee simple subject to the condition that if the property is used for church purposes, then the interest will vest in the children of the grantor's sister who are at least 25.\n\nNow, the sister was single at the time of the conveyance but later married and had two sons. One son died, and then she had a daughter. So, the children of the sister are these two sons and the daughter.\n\nThe condition is that the property will go to the children of the grantor's sister who reach the age of 25. So, for each child, their interest is contingent upon reaching the age of 25.\n\nBut wait, one of the sons has already died. So, what happens to his interest? Well, if he died before reaching 25, his interest would not have vested, and thus, his interest would fail.\n\nThe daughter was born after the son's death, so her interest is also contingent on reaching 25.\n\nSo, in the current action, we have the friend, who still holds the property unless the condition has been triggered, and the potential takers are the children of the sister who reach 25.\n\nBut, the one son has already died before reaching 25, so his interest fails. The other son and the daughter are still alive and could potentially reach 25.\n\nHowever, the question is about the current ownership, not future interests.\n\nAssuming the property has not been used for church purposes, then the friend still holds the fee simple subject to the condition.\n\nIf the property has been used for church purposes, then the friend's interest terminates, and the property vests in the children of the sister who have reached 25.\n\nBut, considering that one son has died, and the daughter is still a minor, we need to see who among them have reached 25.\n\nLet's assume that the surviving son has reached 25, and the daughter has not yet.\n\nSo, if the property has been used for church purposes, the title would vest in the surviving son who has reached 25.\n\nBut the question says \"in an appropriate action to determine the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented,\" which suggests that the property may have been used for church purposes, triggering the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friend is still the owner, and the children of the sister have future interests.\n\nBut the question is asking for current ownership.\n\nOption A says the friend only. That would be the case if the property has not been used for church purposes, and thus, the condition has not been triggered.\n\nOption B says the friend, the son, and the daughter. That would imply that the friend still has an interest, and the children also have interests, perhaps in some capacity.\n\nOption C says the friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born during her lifetime. This seems to suggest that the friend has a life estate, and the children have remainders, but that doesn't align with the original deed.\n\nOption D says the friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son. This seems to be referencing the Rule Against Perpetuities, which generally requires that future interests must vest, if at all, within 21 years after the death of some life in being at the creation of the interest.\n\nIn this case, the interest in the children of the sister is created in 1960, so the perpetuity period would be 21 years after the death of any person alive in 1960.\n\nBut the sister had children after 1960, so they are not lives in being at the creation of the interest.\n\nWait, the sister was single in 1960, so she wasn't alive in 1960? Wait, no, the sister was alive; she was single, but she was alive.\n\nSo, the lives in being at the creation of the interest would include the sister, assuming she was alive in 1960.\n\nAssuming the sister was alive in 1960, then the perpetuity period would be 21 years after her death.\n\nSo, unless the sister has died, any children born after her death would not be able to take within the perpetuity period.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether the sister is still alive or not.\n\nWait, it says the sister married and had two sons, then one son died, then she had a daughter.\n\nSo, the sister is still alive, assuming she hasn't died between having the daughter and the current time.\n\nIf the sister is still alive, then the perpetuity period hasn't started yet, because it's 21 years after her death.\n\nSo, any children born during her lifetime could potentially take, as long as they reach 25.\n\nBut in the current action, we're dealing with the children who are already born and are minors.\n\nSo, the surviving son and the daughter are both minors, and one son has already died before reaching 25.\n\nSo, if the property has been used for church purposes, the friend's interest terminates, and the property vests in the surviving children who have reached 25.\n\nBut, if none of them have reached 25 yet, does the property wait until they reach 25?\n\nOr does it pass to those who have reached 25?\n\nAssuming the son has reached 25, then his interest vests immediately.\n\nIf the daughter hasn't reached 25, her interest is contingent on reaching that age.\n\nBut in the current action, if the son has reached 25, his interest vests now, and the daughter's interest is a contingent remainder.\n\nBut the question is about current ownership, so only the son who has reached 25 would have a current interest.\n\nBut option B says the friend, the son, and the daughter, which suggests that the friend still has an interest, and the children have some interest.\n\nOption C includes any additional children born during the sister's lifetime, which could be future children.\n\nOption D includes any additional children born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son, which might be relevant if the sister has died.\n\nBut without knowing the sister's status, it's hard to determine.\n\nWait, perhaps the best answer is A, the friend only, because unless the property has been used for church purposes, the friend retains the fee simple subject to the condition.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify that the property has been used for church purposes, we can assume that the friend still holds the property.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. the friend only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
