                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario about negligent hiring. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst off, there's a plumbing company that hired a worker to work at different construction sites. The worker used his own truck for these jobs, but the company added a rack to carry plumbing pipes. They paid him for traveling between their warehouse and the sites but not for commuting to and from work. Got it.\n\nNow, because he had to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the sites, the company asked him if he had a valid driver's license before hiring him. But his license was actually suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. So, he lied and said he had a valid license, and the company didn't check.\n\nThen, while driving to work one morning in his truck, he caused a collision due to carelessness, and a woman was injured. She's suing the plumbing company based on negligent hiring. The question is whether she's likely to prevail.\n\nOkay, so negligent hiring is when an employer fails to exercise reasonable care in hiring someone who, because of their history or background, poses a risk of causing harm in the position they're being hired for.\n\nIn this case, the worker had a history of reckless driving leading to collisions, and his license was suspended because of that. The company asked if he had a valid license but didn't verify it.\n\nSo, the company did ask about his license, but they didn't follow up to confirm if he was telling the truth. Does that matter legally?\n\nI think that employers have a duty to reasonably verify the information provided by job applicants, especially when it comes to qualifications that affect safety, like having a valid driver's license for a job that requires driving.\n\nIf the company didn't verify the worker's driver's license, and he didn't actually have one, that could be seen as a failure to exercise due diligence in the hiring process.\n\nMoreover, given that the worker's job involved driving with a truck carrying plumbing pipes, which could be hazardous if not handled properly, the company should have been particularly careful in ensuring that the worker was qualified and safe to perform that aspect of the job.\n\nNow, the injury occurred while the worker was driving to work, which is generally considered outside the scope of employment. Usually, employers are not liable for employees' actions that are outside the scope of their employment.\n\nBut in this case, the negligent act was hiring someone who wasn't qualified to drive in the first place, which led to the injury during the commute.\n\nSo, the argument might be that even though the accident happened outside of work hours, the company's negligent hiring led to the risk of such an accident occurring whenever the worker was driving, including to and from work.\n\nI need to think about whether the company's duty to hire competent drivers extends only to actions taken within the scope of employment or if it's broader.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, the employer's duty to hire competent employees extends to foreseeable risks that the employee poses, even if the harmful act occurs outside the scope of employment.\n\nSo, if it's foreseeable that an employee with a suspended license and a history of reckless driving could cause an accident while driving to work, then the company might be liable for negligent hiring.\n\nOn the other hand, if the company had no reason to know that the worker would be driving to and from work in a way that posed a risk, they might not be liable.\n\nBut in this scenario, the company knew or should have known that the worker would be driving as part of his job, and they specifically asked about his driver's license because of that.\n\nAlso, the company fitted the truck with a pipe rack, which suggests they were integrating the worker's vehicle into their operations, making it more than just a personal commute.\n\nOption A says that the company's duty extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment. But as I thought earlier, if the risk was foreseeable, even during commuting, the company might still be liable.\n\nOption B says no because the worker was an independent contractor. But from the description, it seems like he's an employee since the company is directing where he works and paying him for travel between sites.\n\nOption C says yes because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack. That might be a factor, but I don't think it's the deciding factor here.\n\nOption D says yes because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is D: Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the company required the worker to drive as part of his job and asked about his driver's license, they had a responsibility to verify that information. By not verifying and hiring someone without a valid license, they breached that duty, leading to the injury.\n\nEven though the accident occurred during the commute, which is generally outside the scope of employment, the negligent act was the hiring decision, which created the risk.\n\nTherefore, the woman is likely to prevail in her action against the plumbing company based on negligent hiring.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
