                    "text": "So I have this question about the simplest alkene. Alkenes are a class of hydrocarbons that have at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The simplest one should be the one with the fewest carbon atoms while still having a double bond. Let me think about that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an alkene is. Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons, meaning they have fewer hydrogen atoms than alkanes, which are saturated hydrocarbons. The general formula for alkenes is C_nH_{2n}, where n is the number of carbon atoms. So, for the simplest alkene, n should be as small as possible.\n\nI think the simplest alkene is ethene, also known as ethylene, which has two carbon atoms. Its formula is C_2H_4. So, that fits the general formula with n=2.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. At least two pi bonds.\n\nI know that in a carbon-carbon double bond, there is one sigma bond and one pi bond. So, in ethene, which has one double bond, there is one pi bond. So, does the simplest alkene have at least two pi bonds? No, it has one pi bond.\n\nB. At least four sigma bonds.\n\nIn ethene, each carbon atom is connected to three other atoms: one carbon and three hydrogens. Each sigma bond counts as one bond. So, each carbon has one sigma bond to the other carbon and three sigma bonds to hydrogen atoms. So, total sigma bonds would be four per carbon, but since there are two carbons, that would be eight sigma bonds in total. Wait, but that seems too many.\n\nWait, maybe I'm double-counting. Actually, each bond is between two atoms, so in ethene, C2H4, the sigma bonds are:\n\n- One C-C sigma bond\n\n- Four C-H sigma bonds\n\nSo, total of five sigma bonds in the molecule. Wait, but earlier I thought each carbon has four sigma bonds, but that can't be right because that would make eight bonds in total, which is incorrect.\n\nLet me draw the structure to make sure.\n\nEthene: H2C=CH2\n\nEach carbon is double-bonded to the other carbon and single-bonded to two hydrogen atoms. So, the bonds are:\n\n- One C=C double bond, which consists of one sigma and one pi bond.\n\n- Four C-H single bonds, each being a sigma bond.\n\nSo, total sigma bonds: four C-H bonds plus one C-C sigma bond, totaling five sigma bonds.\n\nSo, does the simplest alkene have at least four sigma bonds? Well, it has five sigma bonds in total. So, yes, it has at least four sigma bonds.\n\nC. A tetrahedral configuration.\n\nI know that carbon atoms typically have a tetrahedral geometry around them when they are sp\u00b3 hybridized, like in alkanes. However, in alkenes, the carbon atoms are sp\u00b2 hybridized due to the double bond. In sp\u00b2 hybridization, the bond angles are approximately 120 degrees, and the geometry is trigonal planar.\n\nSo, in ethene, the two carbon atoms and the four hydrogen atoms are all in the same plane, with the carbon atoms sp\u00b2 hybridized and the hydrogen atoms bonded to them in a planar arrangement.\n\nTherefore, it's not tetrahedral; it's planar.\n\nD. Cis-trans isomers.\n\nCis-trans isomers, also known as geometric isomers, occur in alkenes when there are two different groups attached to each carbon of the double bond. This restricts the rotation around the double bond, leading to different spatial arrangements.\n\nIn ethene, both carbons have the same groups attached: one hydrogen and one methyl group. Wait, no, ethene is H2C=CH2, so both carbons have two hydrogen atoms attached.\n\nSo, in ethene, both carbons are identical and have the same groups, which are hydrogen atoms. Therefore, there is no possibility for cis-trans isomerism in ethene.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct option seems to be B. At least four sigma bonds, since ethene has five sigma bonds, which is certainly more than four.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the simplest alkene has\"\n\nOption B says \"at least four sigma bonds.\"\n\nWell, as I calculated, ethene has five sigma bonds, so yes, it has at least four sigma bonds.\n\nBut is there any alkene that has fewer than four sigma bonds? Let's see.\n\nThe general formula for alkenes is C_nH_{2n}. The smallest n is 2, which is ethene, C2H4.\n\nLet's consider if there's any alkene with n=1. Well, that would be CH2, but that's not a stable compound; it's called carbene, which is highly reactive and not a stable alkene.\n\nSo, the smallest alkene is ethene, C2H4, which has five sigma bonds, as I calculated.\n\nTherefore, it has at least four sigma bonds, so option B is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ethene has only one pi bond.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the configuration is planar, not tetrahedral.\n\nOption D is incorrect because ethene does not exhibit cis-trans isomerism.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the simplest alkene has\"\n\nAnd it's multiple choice with A, B, C, D.\n\nGiven that, and my analysis, B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other alkene with fewer carbon atoms that might have fewer sigma bonds?\n\nAs I thought earlier, n=1 would be CH2, which isn't a stable alkene.\n\nSo, ethene is the simplest alkene, and it has five sigma bonds, which is indeed at least four sigma bonds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
