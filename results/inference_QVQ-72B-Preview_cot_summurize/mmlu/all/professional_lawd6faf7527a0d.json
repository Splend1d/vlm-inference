                    "text": "So I've got this property ownership problem to figure out. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a woman who owns a tract of land in the Midwest. On June 1, 2005, she sells an undivided one-half interest in this land to a husband and wife for $100,000. The deed says it's to them \"as tenants by the entirety,\" which I believe is a type of joint ownership that only married couples can have, where neither can sell or transfer their interest without the other's consent, and when one dies, the surviving spouse gets the whole interest.\n\nSo, after this sale, the ownership is split into two halves:\n\n1. The husband and wife together own one-half as tenants by the entirety.\n\n2. The woman still owns the other one-half.\n\nThen, on June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining one-half interest to the husband and his brother for $125,000. The husband pays $80,000 and the brother pays $45,000. The deed says it's to them \"as joint tenants and not as tenants in common.\"\n\nJoint tenancy is similar to tenancy by the entirety in that it has rights of survivorship, meaning when one joint tenant dies, their share passes to the surviving joint tenants. However, joint tenancy can be between anyone, not just married couples.\n\nSo now, the ownership is supposed to be:\n\n- The husband and wife own one-half as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- The husband and his brother own the other one-half as joint tenants.\n\nBut wait, there might be some complexity here because the husband is involved in both transactions.\n\nLet me think about this. The first sale was an undivided one-half interest to the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. That means they own that one-half together, and neither can sell their interest without the other's consent.\n\nThen, the woman sells her remaining one-half to the husband and his brother as joint tenants. So now, theoretically, there are two separate one-half interests being owned by different parties.\n\nBut since the husband is involved in both, does that change anything?\n\nWell, the husband's interest in the first sale is as a tenant by the entirety with his wife, and in the second sale, it's as a joint tenant with his brother. These are separate interests.\n\nNow, the husband conveys all his right, title, and interest under both deeds to his cousin. So, we need to figure out what exactly he owns from both transactions.\n\nFrom the first sale, he owns an undivided one-half interest as a tenant by the entirety with his wife. Since it's tenants by the entirety, he can't unilaterally convey his interest without his wife's consent, but in this scenario, he's conveying \"all his right, title, and interest,\" which suggests he's trying to transfer his entire interest, whatever that may be.\n\nFrom the second sale, he owns an undivided one-half interest as a joint tenant with his brother.\n\nSo, in total, the husband owns:\n\n- Half of the property as a tenant by the entirety with his wife.\n\n- Half of the property as a joint tenant with his brother.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like he owns the whole property, but that can't be right. Let's think more carefully.\n\nActually, the property is divided into two halves:\n\n1. One-half owned by the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety.\n\n2. One-half owned by the husband and his brother as joint tenants.\n\nSo, the husband's total interest is:\n\n- Half as a tenant by the entirety with his wife.\n\n- Half as a joint tenant with his brother.\n\nBut in the first half, he and his wife together own it as tenants by the entirety. So, individually, each of them owns a portion of that half, but it's undivided, meaning they both own the whole half together.\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, he and his brother own it as joint tenants, each presumably owning a portion of that half.\n\nBut since it's joint tenancy, upon the death of one joint tenant, the surviving joint tenant gets the whole interest.\n\nNow, the husband conveys all his interest under both deeds to his cousin. So, what does that mean?\n\nFirst, for the first deed: he owns an undivided one-half interest as a tenant by the entirety with his wife. If he conveys \"all his right, title, and interest,\" that should include his interest in the tenants by the entirety ownership.\n\nBut tenants by the entirety is typically not conveyable without the consent of the other spouse, because it's designed to protect the marital property. However, the deed says he conveys \"all his right, title, and interest,\" so assuming that's legally possible, his interest in that first half is transferred to the cousin.\n\nSimilarly, his interest in the second half as a joint tenant with his brother is also conveyed to the cousin.\n\nSo now, the cousin holds the husband's interests from both deeds.\n\nBut what exactly does that mean in terms of ownership percentage?\n\nLet's try to calculate it.\n\nFirst, the property is divided into two halves:\n\n1. One-half owned by the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety.\n\n2. One-half owned by the husband and his brother as joint tenants.\n\nNow, the husband conveys his interest in both halves to the cousin.\n\nIn the first half, the husband and wife own it together as tenants by the entirety. So, if the husband conveys his interest, the cousin now holds the husband's interest in that first half.\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, the husband and his brother own it as joint tenants. The husband conveys his interest in that half to the cousin.\n\nNow, the brother dies, and then the husband dies.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman. The husband then dies. The brother then dies. The cousin is thus the owner of...\"\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n1. Husband conveys his interests to cousin.\n\n2. Husband dies.\n\n3. Brother dies.\n\nWe need to determine the cousin's ownership after these events.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first half owned by the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety.\n\nWhen the husband conveys his interest in this half to the cousin, assuming that's valid, the cousin now holds the husband's interest in this half, and the wife retains her interest.\n\nBut in tenants by the entirety, neither can convey their interest without the other's consent, except to the other spouse. However, in this case, the husband has conveyed his interest to the cousin.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about how this works in practice. Maybe the conveyance effectively severs the tenancy by the entirety, and the cousin now holds the husband's interest, while the wife holds her interest.\n\nBut in tenancy by the entirety, severance is generally only possible by agreement of both spouses or by divorce. So, if the husband unilaterally conveys his interest, it might not be valid without the wife's consent.\n\nHowever, for the sake of this problem, let's assume that the conveyance is effective, and the cousin now holds the husband's interest in the first half.\n\nSo, now the first half is owned by the cousin and the wife, presumably as tenants in common, since the tenancy by the entirety has been severed.\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, the husband and his brother owned it as joint tenants. The husband conveys his interest to the cousin, so now the cousin and the brother own this half as joint tenants.\n\nThen, the husband dies. But since he has already conveyed his interests to the cousin, his death shouldn't affect the ownership, because the interests have already been transferred.\n\nThen, the brother dies. Since the cousin and the brother own the second half as joint tenants, upon the brother's death, the cousin would inherit the brother's interest in that half.\n\nWait, but the deed says \"as joint tenants and not as tenants in common.\" So, in joint tenancy, upon the death of one joint tenant, the surviving joint tenant inherits the deceased's interest.\n\nTherefore, when the brother dies, the cousin inherits his interest in the second half.\n\nSo, now, in the second half, the cousin owns the entire half as the surviving joint tenant.\n\nIn the first half, the cousin owns the husband's interest, and the wife owns her interest, presumably as tenants in common.\n\nSo, overall, the cousin owns:\n\n- The husband's interest in the first half.\n\n- The entire second half.\n\nBut what is the husband's interest in the first half?\n\nIn the first half, the husband and wife own it together as tenants by the entirety. So, their interests are undivided, meaning they both own the whole half together.\n\nIf the husband conveys his interest, it's like he's conveying his share, which could be considered half of that half, meaning a quarter interest.\n\nWait, no. In tenancy by the entirety, the interests are undivided, and typically, each spouse is considered to own the whole property together.\n\nSo, if the husband conveys his interest, it's his entire interest in that half, which is half of the half, meaning a quarter.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in tenancy by the entirety, each spouse is considered to own the whole property together, but neither can convey without the other's consent.\n\nIf the husband conveys his interest, it's his entire interest in the property, which is half of the half, meaning a quarter.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet's consider that the first half is owned by the husband and wife together as tenants by the entirety. So, together they own 50% of the property.\n\nWhen the husband conveys his interest, he is conveying his share in that 50%. Assuming it's equally divided, his share is 25% (half of the 50%).\n\nSo, the cousin now owns 25% of the property from the first sale.\n\nIn the second sale, the husband and his brother own the other half as joint tenants. The husband pays $80,000 and the brother pays $45,000, totaling $125,000.\n\nAssuming that the payment reflects their ownership shares, the husband owns 80/125 = 64% of that half, and the brother owns 45/125 = 36% of that half.\n\nSo, the husband conveys his 64% of that half to the cousin.\n\nThen, the brother dies, and since it's joint tenancy, the cousin, as the surviving joint tenant, inherits the brother's 36% of that half.\n\nSo, in the second half:\n\n- Cousin starts with 64% (the husband's share).\n\n- Brother dies, and cousin inherits the brother's 36%, so cousin now owns 100% of the second half.\n\nIn the first half:\n\n- Cousin owns 25% (the husband's share).\n\n- The wife owns 25% (her share).\n\nWait, but in the first half, it was sold as an undivided one-half interest to the husband and wife together. So, they own it together as tenants by the entirety, meaning they both own the whole half together.\n\nIf the husband conveys his interest, it's his entire interest in that half, which is half of the half, meaning 25%.\n\nSo, the cousin owns 25% of the first half, and the wife owns the other 25%.\n\nWait, but in reality, in tenancy by the entirety, their interests are undivided, and each is considered to own the whole together.\n\nBut if the husband conveys his interest, it's his entire interest in that half, which is half of the half, meaning 25%.\n\nSo, now, in the first half:\n\n- Cousin: 25%\n\n- Wife: 25%\n\nIn the second half:\n\n- Cousin: 100% (after the brother dies)\n\nSo, overall, the cousin owns:\n\n- 25% of the first half\n\n- 100% of the second half\n\nNow, the entire property is divided into two halves:\n\n- First half: 50%\n\n- Second half: 50%\n\nSo, the cousin owns:\n\n- 25% of the first half (which is 25% of 50% = 12.5%)\n\n- 100% of the second half (which is 100% of 50% = 50%)\n\nSo, total ownership by the cousin is 12.5% + 50% = 62.5% of the entire property.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So, perhaps my calculation is wrong.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe instead of calculating percentages of halves, I should consider the entire property as 100%, and see what portions the cousin owns.\n\nInitially, the property is 100%, divided into two halves for the sake of the sales.\n\nAfter the first sale, the woman sells one-half to the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety.\n\nAfter the second sale, she sells the other half to the husband and his brother as joint tenants.\n\nThen, the husband conveys all his interests under both deeds to the cousin.\n\nThen, the husband dies, and then the brother dies.\n\nSo, in the first half:\n\n- The husband and wife own it as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- The husband conveys his interest to the cousin, so now the cousin owns the husband's interest in that half.\n\n- The wife retains her interest.\n\nIn the second half:\n\n- The husband and brother own it as joint tenants.\n\n- The husband conveys his interest to the cousin, so now the cousin and the brother own it as joint tenants.\n\n- Then, the brother dies, so the cousin inherits the brother's interest in that half.\n\n- Then, the husband dies, but since he has already conveyed his interests to the cousin, his death doesn't affect the ownership.\n\nSo, now:\n\n- In the first half:\n\n- Cousin: the husband's interest (25%?)\n\n- Wife: her interest (25%?)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in the first half, the husband and wife own it together as tenants by the entirety, meaning they both own the whole half together.\n\nIf the husband conveys his interest, it's his entire interest in that half, which is half of the half, meaning 25%.\n\nSo, in the first half:\n\n- Cousin: 25%\n\n- Wife: 25%\n\nIn the second half:\n\n- Cousin: 100% (after the brother dies)\n\nSo, overall, the cousin owns:\n\n- 25% of one half (which is 12.5% of the whole property)\n\n- 100% of the other half (which is 50% of the whole property)\n\nTotal: 12.5% + 50% = 62.5%\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding how the interests are divided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first half, since the husband and wife own it together as tenants by the entirety, and the husband conveys his interest to the cousin, the cousin now owns half of that half, meaning 25% of the whole property.\n\nIn the second half, the cousin owns the entire half, meaning 50% of the whole property.\n\nSo, total ownership by the cousin is 25% + 50% = 75%.\n\nThat matches option D: an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first half, the cousin owns 25% and the wife owns 25%, making the cousin's interest in the first half 25%.\n\nIn the second half, the cousin owns 100%.\n\nSo, overall, the cousin owns 25% + 100% = 125% of the property, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cousin's interest in the first half is 25% of the whole property, and in the second half is 50% of the whole property, totaling 75%.\n\nThat seems more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cousin owns half of the first half (25%) and all of the second half (50%), totaling 75%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
