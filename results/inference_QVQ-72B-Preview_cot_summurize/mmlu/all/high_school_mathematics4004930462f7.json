                    "text": "So I have this problem: \"What is the shortest distance from the origin to the circle defined by \\(x^2 - 24x + y^2 + 10y + 160 = 0\\)?\" And the options are 10, 16, 24, and 12. Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the equation of the circle. The standard form of a circle's equation is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center of the circle, and \\(r\\) is its radius. The given equation is \\(x^2 - 24x + y^2 + 10y + 160 = 0\\). I need to complete the square to get it into standard form.\n\nFor the \\(x\\) terms: \\(x^2 - 24x\\). To complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is \\(-12\\), and square it to get \\(144\\). So, \\(x^2 - 24x + 144 = (x - 12)^2\\).\n\nFor the \\(y\\) terms: \\(y^2 + 10y\\). Half of 10 is 5, and \\(5^2 = 25\\). So, \\(y^2 + 10y + 25 = (y + 5)^2\\).\n\nNow, rewrite the equation with these completed squares:\n\n\\((x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 + 160 - 144 - 25 = 0\\).\n\nSimplify the constants: \\(160 - 144 - 25 = -9\\). Wait, that can't be right because the left side should equal the radius squared, which should be positive. Maybe I messed up the signs when completing the square.\n\nLet me try that again. When completing the square, I added 144 and 25 to the equation to make the perfect squares, so:\n\n\\(x^2 - 24x + 144 + y^2 + 10y + 25 + 160 - 144 - 25 = 0\\).\n\nThis simplifies to \\((x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 + 160 - 144 - 25 = 0\\), which is \\((x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 + 9 = 0\\), but that would mean \\((x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = -9\\), which isn't possible since squares can't be negative.\n\nWait a minute, I think I messed up the signs when completing the square. Let's try completing the square again.\n\nStarting with \\(x^2 - 24x + y^2 + 10y + 160 = 0\\), I'll group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms:\n\n\\((x^2 - 24x) + (y^2 + 10y) = -160\\).\n\nNow, complete the square for each:\n\nFor \\(x^2 - 24x\\), half of \\(-24\\) is \\(-12\\), and \\((-12)^2 = 144\\).\n\nFor \\(y^2 + 10y\\), half of 10 is 5, and \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n\nAdd and subtract these inside the equation:\n\n\\((x^2 - 24x + 144) + (y^2 + 10y + 25) = -160 + 144 + 25\\).\n\nSo, \\((x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9\\).\n\nAh, now it makes sense. The equation should be \\((x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9\\), which means the circle has a center at \\((12, -5)\\) and a radius of \\(3\\) (since \\(9 = 3^2\\)).\n\nNow, I need to find the shortest distance from the origin \\((0,0)\\) to this circle. The shortest distance would be the distance from the origin to the center of the circle minus the radius.\n\nSo, first, find the distance from the origin to the center \\((12, -5)\\).\n\nThe distance formula is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\nPlugging in the points:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{(12 - 0)^2 + (-5 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\\).\n\nSo, the distance from the origin to the center is 13 units. Since the circle has a radius of 3, the shortest distance to the circle would be \\(13 - 3 = 10\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, 10 is one of them. But wait, is there anything I'm missing here?\n\nLet me double-check the radius. The equation is \\((x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9\\), which indeed means radius \\(r = 3\\).\n\nAlso, confirming the center is at \\((12, -5)\\), and the distance from origin is \\(\\sqrt{12^2 + (-5)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\\).\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance should be \\(13 - 3 = 10\\).\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the distance formula directly.\n\nThe general formula for the distance from a point to a circle is the distance from the point to the center of the circle minus the radius, provided the point is outside the circle, which the origin is in this case since 13 > 3.\n\nAlternatively, if the origin were inside the circle, the shortest distance would be the negative of that, but in this case, it's outside, so it's positive.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 10 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's see why other options might be wrong. Option B is 16, which is the distance from the origin to the center minus the radius in the other direction, but that doesn't make sense here. Option C is 24, which seems too large compared to the radius and the center's coordinates. Option D is 12, which is the same as the distance from the origin to the center minus the radius, but we already have 13 - 3 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
