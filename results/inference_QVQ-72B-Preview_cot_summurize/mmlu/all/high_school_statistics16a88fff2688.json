                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about electronic parts and their lifespans. It says that 60% of the parts last over 3 years, and 70% last less than 6 years. And I need to find the mean and standard deviation assuming the lifespans are normally distributed. The options are given, but I want to figure this out myself.\n\nFirst, I know that in a normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation completely define the distribution. So, if I can find values for the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) that satisfy both the given percentages, I should be able to match them to one of the options.\n\nLet me start by understanding what these percentages mean in terms of the normal distribution. The 60% of parts lasting over 3 years means that the probability P(X > 3) = 0.60, where X is the lifespan of a part. Similarly, 70% lasting less than 6 years means P(X < 6) = 0.70.\n\nIn a normal distribution, probabilities are symmetric around the mean. So, if I can find the Z-scores corresponding to these probabilities, I can relate them back to the mean and standard deviation.\n\nFirst, let's find the Z-scores for these probabilities. I need to standardize the values of X to find Z.\n\nThe formula for Z is:\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nI need to find Z such that P(Z > Z1) = 0.60 and P(Z < Z2) = 0.70.\n\nWait, actually, P(X > 3) = 0.60 translates to P(Z > (3 - \u03bc)/\u03c3) = 0.60.\n\nSimilarly, P(X < 6) = 0.70 translates to P(Z < (6 - \u03bc)/\u03c3) = 0.70.\n\nI can look up the Z-scores corresponding to these probabilities using the standard normal table.\n\nFirst, for P(Z > Z1) = 0.60, that means P(Z < Z1) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.\n\nSo, Z1 is the Z-score where the cumulative probability is 0.40.\n\nLooking at the Z-table, 0.40 corresponds to approximately Z1 \u2248 -0.25.\n\nSimilarly, for P(Z < Z2) = 0.70, that means P(Z < Z2) = 0.70.\n\nSo, Z2 is approximately Z2 \u2248 0.52.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nActually, 0.70 corresponds to Z \u2248 0.52 from the Z-table.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(3 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.25\n\nAnd\n\n(6 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = 0.52\n\nNow, I can set up two equations:\n\nEquation 1: (3 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.25\n\nEquation 2: (6 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = 0.52\n\nLet me solve these equations to find \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\nFirst, from Equation 1:\n\n3 - \u03bc = -0.25\u03c3\n\nSo, \u03bc = 3 + 0.25\u03c3\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\n6 - \u03bc = 0.52\u03c3\n\nSubstitute \u03bc from Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n\n6 - (3 + 0.25\u03c3) = 0.52\u03c3\n\n6 - 3 - 0.25\u03c3 = 0.52\u03c3\n\n3 - 0.25\u03c3 = 0.52\u03c3\n\n3 = 0.52\u03c3 + 0.25\u03c3\n\n3 = 0.77\u03c3\n\nSo, \u03c3 = 3 / 0.77 \u2248 3.896\n\nNow, plug \u03c3 back into Equation 1 to find \u03bc:\n\n\u03bc = 3 + 0.25 * 3.896 \u2248 3 + 0.974 \u2248 3.974\n\nSo, \u03bc \u2248 3.974 and \u03c3 \u2248 3.896\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \u03bc = 3.677, \u03c3 = 3.561\n\nB. \u03bc = 3.977, \u03c3 = 3.861\n\nC. \u03bc = 4.177, \u03c3 = 3.561\n\nD. \u03bc = 4.377, \u03c3 = 3.261\n\nMy calculations give \u03bc \u2248 3.974 and \u03c3 \u2248 3.896, which is closest to option B: \u03bc = 3.977, \u03c3 = 3.861.\n\nBut before I jump to conclude, I should check if my Z-score lookups are accurate enough, since slight differences can occur due to approximation.\n\nLet me verify with more precise Z-table values.\n\nFirst, for P(Z > Z1) = 0.60, which is P(Z < Z1) = 0.40.\n\nLooking up Z for 0.40 in the standard normal table, Z1 \u2248 -0.25.\n\nSimilarly, for P(Z < Z2) = 0.70, Z2 \u2248 0.524.\n\nSo, equations become:\n\n(3 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.25\n\n(6 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = 0.524\n\nSolving again:\n\nFrom first equation:\n\n3 - \u03bc = -0.25\u03c3 \u21d2 \u03bc = 3 + 0.25\u03c3\n\nFrom second equation:\n\n6 - \u03bc = 0.524\u03c3\n\nSubstitute \u03bc:\n\n6 - (3 + 0.25\u03c3) = 0.524\u03c3\n\n6 - 3 - 0.25\u03c3 = 0.524\u03c3\n\n3 - 0.25\u03c3 = 0.524\u03c3\n\n3 = 0.524\u03c3 + 0.25\u03c3\n\n3 = 0.774\u03c3\n\n\u03c3 = 3 / 0.774 \u2248 3.876\n\nThen, \u03bc = 3 + 0.25 * 3.876 \u2248 3 + 0.969 \u2248 3.969\n\nSo, \u03bc \u2248 3.969 and \u03c3 \u2248 3.876, which is even closer to option B: \u03bc = 3.977, \u03c3 = 3.861.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. \u03bc = 3.977, \u03c3 = 3.861.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
