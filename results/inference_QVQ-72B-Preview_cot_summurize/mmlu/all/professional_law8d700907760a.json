                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether a motion to dismiss should be granted based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a shop owner in State A who's suing a distributor in federal district court in State A for breaching a contract. The shop owner is claiming $100,000 in damages because the goods provided by the distributor were allegedly defective. Now, the distributor is incorporated in State B and has its principal place of business in State C. So, the distributor is from a different state than the shop owner, which might be relevant for jurisdiction purposes.\n\nNext, the distributor brings in a third-party defendant, which is the wholesaler that supplied the goods to the distributor. The distributor is saying that the wholesaler should indemnify them if the shop owner wins the lawsuit. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, same as the distributor, but its principal place of business is in State A, same as the shop owner.\n\nNow, the wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue. And the distributor has moved to dismiss this counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. So, the question is whether the court has the power to hear this counterclaim.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.\n\nB. No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\n\nC. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\n\nD. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.\n\nAlright, let's think about this. Jurisdiction in federal courts is based on either federal question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction. Since this seems to be a contract dispute, it's likely based on diversity jurisdiction, which requires that all plaintiffs and all defendants be citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\n\nIn this case, the shop owner is from State A, the distributor is from State B and State C, and the wholesaler is from State B and State A. Wait, actually, for determining citizenship for corporations, they are citizens of the state where they are incorporated and the state where they have their principal place of business.\n\nSo, distributor: incorporated in State B, principal place of business in State C. So, it's a citizen of both State B and State C.\n\nWholesaler: incorporated in State B, principal place of business in State A. So, it's a citizen of State B and State A.\n\nShop owner: domiciled in State A, so citizen of State A.\n\nAlright, so between the shop owner and the distributor, there is diversity of citizenship because the shop owner is from State A and the distributor is from State B and State C.\n\nBut when the distributor brings in the wholesaler as a third-party defendant, the wholesaler is from State B and State A. So, between the wholesaler and the distributor, they share State B as a common citizenship. That means there is no diversity between them.\n\nNow, the wholesaler is asserting a counterclaim against the distributor. For the court to have jurisdiction over this counterclaim, there needs to be some basis for jurisdiction.\n\nOption C says yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler. That seems to align with what I just thought. Since they share State B as a common citizenship, there is no diversity between them.\n\nOption D says yes, because there is no diversity between the shop owner and the wholesaler. But the shop owner is from State A, and the wholesaler is from State B and State A. So, they do have diversity (since the wholesaler is from State B, which is different from the shop owner's State A). But the counterclaim is between the wholesaler and the distributor, not between the wholesaler and the shop owner.\n\nOption A says no, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse. Wait, the wholesaler's principal place of business is in State A, and the distributor's is in State C, so yes, they are diverse in that sense. But their citizenship includes both incorporation and principal place of business. The wholesaler is citizen of State B and State A, and the distributor is citizen of State B and State C. So, they share State B. So, option A is incorrect because they do share citizenship.\n\nOption B says no, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim. Supplemental jurisdiction allows federal courts to hear claims that are part of the same case or controversy as claims over which they have original jurisdiction. In this case, the original claim is between the shop owner and the distributor, based on diversity.\n\nThe third-party claim by the distributor against the wholesaler is related to the same contract and the same goods, so it's part of the same case or controversy. Therefore, the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the third-party claim.\n\nBut the counterclaim by the wholesaler against the distributor is also part of the same case or controversy. So, perhaps the court has supplemental jurisdiction over that as well.\n\nWait, but supplemental jurisdiction generally applies to claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy. So, if the third-party claim is within the original action's jurisdiction, then the counterclaim by the wholesaler against the distributor might also be within the court's jurisdiction under the same umbrella.\n\nBut, there's a catch. Supplemental jurisdiction requires that the amount in controversy for the additional claims does not exceed $75,000 unless it's another diversity claim.\n\nIn this case, the wholesaler's counterclaim is for $60,000, which is less than $75,000. So, perhaps that's not an issue.\n\nBut, I think the key issue here is that the counterclaim is between parties who are not diverse, since both the wholesaler and the distributor are citizens of State B.\n\nWait, but the wholesaler is also a citizen of State A because of its principal place of business. So, does that mean that the wholesaler is a citizen of both State B and State A, and the distributor is a citizen of State B and State C. So, they share State B as a common citizenship. Therefore, there is no complete diversity between them.\n\nIn such a case, the court would not have diversity jurisdiction over the counterclaim between the wholesaler and the distributor.\n\nBut, could the court exercise supplemental jurisdiction over this counterclaim since it's related to the main action?\n\nI think that's possible. Supplemental jurisdiction allows the court to hear claims that are part of the same case or controversy as the original jurisdictional basis. Since the counterclaim arises from the same transaction or occurrence as the third-party claim, which is related to the main action, the court might have supplemental jurisdiction over it.\n\nHowever, there might be limitations on supplemental jurisdiction when there is no independent basis for jurisdiction over the added claims, especially if they involve non-diverse parties.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nThe main action is between the shop owner and the distributor, with diversity jurisdiction based on their citizenship and the amount in controversy.\n\nThen, the distributor brings in the wholesaler as a third-party defendant, alleging that the wholesaler should indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. This third-party claim is likely based on the same contract and the same defective goods at issue in the main action.\n\nThe wholesaler then asserts a counterclaim against the distributor for payment of the goods, which is also related to the same contract and goods.\n\nSo, all these claims are interconnected and arise from the same set of facts.\n\nNow, for the third-party claim by the distributor against the wholesaler, there is diversity between the distributor (citizen of State B and State C) and the wholesaler (citizen of State B and State A), but they share State B as a common citizenship. So, no complete diversity.\n\nSimilarly, for the counterclaim by the wholesaler against the distributor, same issue: they share State B as a common citizenship.\n\nSo, for both the third-party claim and the counterclaim, there is no complete diversity between the parties.\n\nHowever, in federal court, when a party brings a third-party claim in a diversity action, and the third-party claim lacks diversity, the court may still exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the third-party claim if it is part of the same case or controversy.\n\nSimilarly, the counterclaim by the wholesaler against the distributor is also part of the same case or controversy.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim, even if there is no independent diversity between the wholesaler and the distributor.\n\nBut, I need to check if there are any exceptions or limitations to this.\n\nOne thing I recall is that in diversity cases, when a party brings in a third-party defendant who is not diverse, the court may still exercise jurisdiction over the third-party claim under supplemental jurisdiction, provided that the third-party claim is so related to the original action that it forms part of the same case or controversy.\n\nSimilarly, in such a situation, counterclaims between the third-party defendant and the original defendant can also be heard under supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should be denied, because the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A says no, because the wholesalers' and the distributors' principal places of business are diverse. But as I thought earlier, their citizenship includes both incorporation and principal place of business, and they share State B, so they are not completely diverse. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C says yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler. That's true, but that alone doesn't decide whether the court has jurisdiction over the counterclaim.\n\nOption D says yes, because there is no diversity between the shop owner and the wholesaler. But that's not directly relevant to the counterclaim between the wholesaler and the distributor.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure. Is supplemental jurisdiction applicable to counterclaims in third-party actions in diversity cases? I think it is, but I want to make sure.\n\nLet me consider this: in federal court, when a party files a third-party complaint, and the third-party defendant files a counterclaim against the original defendant, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that counterclaim if it arises from the same case or controversy as the original action.\n\nGiven that, and considering that all these claims are interconnected and arise from the same contract and goods, it seems reasonable to conclude that the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.\n\nTherefore, the motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should be denied, and the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
