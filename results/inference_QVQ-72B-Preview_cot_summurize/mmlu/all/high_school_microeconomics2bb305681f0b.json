                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a firm deciding how to allocate its resources between labor and capital. The prices are given: labor costs $2 per unit, and capital costs $1 per unit. The marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50. I need to figure out what the firm should do to maximize its production, given these costs and marginal products.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the principle of marginal productivity and how it relates to input allocation. I think the firm should allocate its inputs in a way that equalizes the marginal product per dollar spent on each input. In other words, I should look at the marginal product per dollar for labor and capital and make sure they are equal.\n\nSo, for labor: marginal product is 200, and the price is $2. The marginal product per dollar for labor would be 200 divided by 2, which is 100.\n\nFor capital: marginal product is 50, and the price is $1. So, the marginal product per dollar for capital is 50 divided by 1, which is 50.\n\nCurrently, the marginal product per dollar for labor is higher than that for capital (100 vs. 50). This suggests that the firm is getting more output per dollar spent on labor compared to capital. So, to maximize production, the firm should adjust its inputs to make these ratios equal.\n\nSince labor is more efficient in terms of marginal product per dollar, the firm should probably use more labor and less capital. But I need to think about what happens to the marginal products when I do that.\n\nI remember that as I increase the use of one input, its marginal product might decrease due to diminishing marginal returns. Conversely, decreasing an input might increase its marginal product.\n\nSo, if I increase labor and decrease capital, I would expect the marginal product of labor to decrease slightly and the marginal product of capital to increase slightly.\n\nBut according to the options, some suggest that increasing capital and decreasing labor would make the marginal product of capital fall and the marginal product of labor rise.\n\nHmm, that seems counterintuitive. If I increase capital, wouldn't the marginal product of capital decrease, not rise?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the relationship between inputs and their marginal products more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the concept of marginal productivity and the condition for maximizing output for a given cost.\n\nThe firm should allocate inputs such that the marginal product per dollar spent on each input is equalized.\n\nSo, set MP_L / P_L = MP_K / P_K.\n\nGiven the current values:\n\nMP_L = 200, P_L = $2 \u2192 MP_L / P_L = 200/2 = 100\n\nMP_K = 50, P_K = $1 \u2192 MP_K / P_K = 50/1 = 50\n\nSince 100 > 50, the firm is not in equilibrium.\n\nTo equalize these ratios, the firm should substitute capital for labor, meaning increase capital and decrease labor.\n\nBut wait, increasing capital might lead to a decrease in its marginal product due to diminishing returns, while decreasing labor might increase its marginal product.\n\nSo, option A says increase capital and decrease labor so that MP_K falls and MP_L rises.\n\nOption B says increase capital and decrease labor so that MP_K rises and MP_L falls.\n\nOption C says decrease capital and increase labor so that MP_K rises and MP_L falls.\n\nOption D says decrease capital and increase labor so that MP_K falls and MP_L rises.\n\nGiven that increasing capital would likely lead to a decrease in MP_K (due to diminishing returns), and decreasing labor would likely increase MP_L, option A seems plausible.\n\nBut option B suggests that increasing capital would increase MP_K, which doesn't make sense because of diminishing marginal returns.\n\nSimilarly, decreasing capital might increase MP_K, but that might not be the case, depending on the production function.\n\nOption C suggests decreasing capital and increasing labor, which would increase MP_K and decrease MP_L, but this might not help in equalizing the marginal product per dollar ratios.\n\nOption D suggests decreasing capital and increasing labor, leading to MP_K falling and MP_L rising, which might help in equalizing the ratios.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about the specific production function.\n\nAssuming a Cobb-Douglas production function, where outputs are diminishing for each input when the other is held constant.\n\nSo, if I increase capital while decreasing labor, MP_K would likely decrease, and MP_L would likely increase.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to align with this, but I need to confirm if this would help in equalizing the marginal product per dollar ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the specific numerical values.\n\nLet's suppose the firm increases capital and decreases labor.\n\nAs capital increases, MP_K decreases, say from 50 to 40, and as labor decreases, MP_L increases, say from 200 to 210.\n\nThen, MP_L / P_L = 210 / 2 = 105, and MP_K / P_K = 40 / 1 = 40.\n\nThis is still not equal; MP_L per dollar is still higher.\n\nSo, the firm should continue to substitute capital for labor until the ratios are equal.\n\nBut according to option A, it's increasing capital and decreasing labor, which seems to be moving towards equalizing the ratios, as MP_K decreases and MP_L increases.\n\nOption B suggests increasing capital and decreasing labor, but claims that MP_K rises and MP_L falls, which contradicts the diminishing marginal returns principle.\n\nOption C suggests decreasing capital and increasing labor, which would likely increase MP_K and decrease MP_L, but this might make the MP_L per dollar ratio even higher relative to MP_K per dollar.\n\nOption D suggests decreasing capital and increasing labor, leading to MP_K falling and MP_L rising, which seems similar to option A but with different expected changes in MP.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the firm's goal is to maximize output for a given cost, or minimize cost for a given output.\n\nGiven the current marginal products and prices, the firm is not optimizing its input allocation.\n\nTo optimize, it should adjust inputs until MP_L / P_L = MP_K / P_K.\n\nCurrently, MP_L / P_L = 100 and MP_K / P_K = 50.\n\nSo, 100 > 50.\n\nTo make them equal, the firm should use more capital and less labor.\n\nBut, as it does so, MP_K might decrease and MP_L might increase, which would help in making the ratios closer.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct: increase capital and decrease labor so that MP_K falls and MP_L rises.\n\nOption B suggests increasing capital and decreasing labor, but claims that MP_K rises and MP_L falls, which doesn't align with diminishing marginal returns.\n\nOption C suggests decreasing capital and increasing labor, which would likely increase MP_K and decrease MP_L, making the MP_L per dollar ratio even higher.\n\nOption D suggests decreasing capital and increasing labor, leading to MP_K falling and MP_L rising, which seems similar to option A but with different wording.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the most accurate description of what the firm should do.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the firm increases capital and decreases labor, MP_K decreases and MP_L increases, moving towards equalizing the marginal product per dollar ratios.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
