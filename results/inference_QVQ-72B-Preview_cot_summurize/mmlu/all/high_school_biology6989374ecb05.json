                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about population shifts and selection types. It says that in a population, really tall and really short individuals are decreasing in frequency compared to those of medium size, and this is due to a change in resource availability. I need to figure out which type of selection this is.\n\nOkay, first things first, I should recall what different types of selection are. There's directional selection, stabilizing selection, disruptive selection, and sympatric speciation is also an option here, but I think that's more about species formation rather than selection pressures.\n\nDirectional selection is when one extreme of a trait becomes more common over time. Like, if tall plants are favored over short ones, or vice versa, and the average shifts in that direction.\n\nStabilizing selection, on the other hand, favors the average or median traits and selects against extremes. So, in this case, if medium-sized individuals are more common because they're better adapted, and both very tall and very short individuals are less common because they're less adapted to the new resource availability, that sounds like stabilizing selection.\n\nDisruptive selection is the opposite; it favors extremes and selects against the average. So, if both very tall and very short individuals are more successful than medium ones, that would be disruptive selection.\n\nSympatric speciation is when a new species develops from an existing one without geographic separation, maybe due to niche differentiation or something, but that doesn't seem directly related to this scenario.\n\nGiven that the really tall and really short individuals are decreasing in frequency, and medium-sized ones are more common, it seems like the population is being 'stabilized' around the medium size. So, that points towards stabilizing selection.\n\nLet me think of an example to confirm. Suppose there's a population of birds, and the size of their beaks varies. If there's a change in available food sources, like if medium-sized seeds become more abundant and easier to eat for medium-sized beaks, while very large or very small seeds are harder to come by or require more energy to process, then birds with medium-sized beaks would have an advantage. As a result, the extreme beak sizes would decrease in frequency, and the medium sizes would increase. That sounds like stabilizing selection.\n\nAnother example could be human birth weights. If babies with birth weights around a certain optimal range have higher survival rates, while those who are much lighter or much heavier have lower survival rates, then over time, the population would be selected for babies in that optimal weight range. This would lead to a decrease in the frequency of extreme birth weights.\n\nSo, based on these examples, it seems like the scenario described in the question aligns with stabilizing selection.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check. Directional selection would involve the population shifting towards one extreme, like if taller individuals were more successful, leading to an increase in average height. That's not what's happening here. Similarly, disruptive selection would favor both very tall and very short individuals, leading to an increase in variance, not a decrease in extreme types.\n\nSympatric speciation involves the formation of a new species within the same geographic area, which isn't directly addressed by the scenario provided. The question is about selection pressure affecting the frequencies of certain traits, not about the formation of new species.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. stabilizing selection.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the definitions again:\n\n- **Directional selection:** Selects for one extreme of a trait, leading to a shift in the population mean over time.\n\n- **Stabilizing selection:** Selects for the mean or average phenotype, reducing variance by selecting against extremes.\n\n- **Disruptive selection:** Selects for multiple phenotypic extremes, increasing variance by selecting against intermediate phenotypes.\n\n- **Sympatric speciation:** The evolution of a new species from an existing one in the same geographic region, often due to niche differentiation or reproductive isolation mechanisms.\n\nGiven these definitions, the scenario described in the question clearly fits with stabilizing selection, as it involves selection against extremes and in favor of intermediate traits.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. stabilizing selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
