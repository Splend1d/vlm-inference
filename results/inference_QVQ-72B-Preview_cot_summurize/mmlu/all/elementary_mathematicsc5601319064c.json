                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: 13 over 4 equals x over 7. And I need to solve for x. The options are 22.75, 23.25, 24.25, or none of these. Alright, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this equation is saying. It's a proportion, right? So, 13 over 4 is equal to x over 7. That means that these two fractions are equal. I think the way to solve this is to cross-multiply.\n\nSo, if 13/4 = x/7, then I can cross-multiply: 13 times 7 equals 4 times x. Let me calculate that.\n\n13 times 7 is 91, and 4 times x is 4x. So, I have 91 = 4x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 4.\n\nSo, x = 91 / 4.\n\nLet me calculate that. 91 divided by 4 is... well, 4 times 22 is 88, and 91 minus 88 is 3, so 22 and 3/4.\n\nSo, x = 22.75.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 22.75, B is 23.25, C is 24.25, and D is none of these.\n\nSo, it seems like A is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe by using cross-multiplication again or another method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about setting up the proportion as 13/4 = x/7 and think about what I'm being asked.\n\nMaybe I can think in terms of equivalent fractions. If 13 over 4 is equal to x over 7, then perhaps I can find a common multiple of 4 and 7 to make the denominators the same, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about scaling factors. Like, to go from 4 to 7, I need to multiply the denominator by 7/4, right? So, if I multiply the numerator by the same factor, I should get x.\n\nSo, x = 13 * (7/4).\n\nLet me calculate that. 13 times 7 is 91, and then divided by 4 is still 22.75.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous answer. So, that reinforces that x is 22.75.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of decimals right from the start.\n\nSo, 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, because 4 times 3 is 12, and 13 minus 12 is 1, so 3.25.\n\nAnd x divided by 7 equals 3.25. So, x = 3.25 * 7.\n\nWhat's 3.25 times 7? Well, 3 times 7 is 21, and 0.25 times 7 is 1.75, so added together that's 22.75.\n\nAgain, I get x = 22.75.\n\nI think that's solid. But just to be thorough, let's check if this makes sense with the original proportion.\n\nIf x = 22.75, then x/7 = 22.75 / 7.\n\nLet me calculate that. 22.75 divided by 7.\n\nWell, 7 times 3 is 21, and 22.75 minus 21 is 1.75. So, 3 and 1.75/7.\n\nBut 1.75 divided by 7 is 0.25, so overall, it's 3.25.\n\nSimilarly, 13 divided by 4 is indeed 3.25.\n\nSo, both sides equal 3.25, which confirms that x = 22.75 is the correct solution.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning, and multiple methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 22.75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 22.75} \\]"
