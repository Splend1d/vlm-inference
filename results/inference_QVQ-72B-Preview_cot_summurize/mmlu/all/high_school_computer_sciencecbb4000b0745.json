                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a bank that's trying to decide between two queueing systems: one with a single line feeding into multiple tellers, and another with separate lines for each teller. They want to minimize customer wait times, and they're planning to use a computer simulation to compare these options. The question is asking which statement is NOT true about this plan.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each option:\n\n1. **Single line, multiple tellers:** Customers form a single queue and the first person in line goes to the next available teller. This is a common setup in many banks and fast-food restaurants, where customers don't have to worry about choosing the \"right\" line.\n\n2. **Multiple lines, one per teller:** Each teller has their own queue, and customers choose which line to stand in. This is typical in some supermarkets and post offices.\n\nThe bank is considering using a simulation to determine which setup results in lower average wait times for customers.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.\n\nB. The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.\n\nC. The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.\n\nD. The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.\n\nI need to identify which of these statements is NOT true.\n\nLet's analyze each one:\n\n**Option A:** Can the bank incorporate other factors like the number of tellers into the simulation?\n\nWell, simulations are versatile tools that can model various parameters. In queueing theory, which is what this scenario is about, we can adjust the number of servers (tellers), the arrival rate of customers, the service time per teller, and other variables. So, yes, it's possible to incorporate the number of tellers into the simulation. This seems true.\n\n**Option B:** Can the bank use the simulation to study the options without inconveniencing customers?\n\nSimulation is a great way to test different scenarios without implementing them in real life, which could potentially cause issues like longer wait times if the chosen system isn't efficient. By simulating, the bank can make an informed decision based on data without affecting actual customers. This also seems true.\n\n**Option C:** Might the bank consider new alternatives based on the simulation results?\n\nThis is plausible. Sometimes, simulations reveal that neither of the considered options is optimal, leading to the exploration of new ideas. For example, maybe combining both systems in some way could be better. So, this could be true.\n\n**Option D:** Will the simulation not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available?\n\nThis is an important point. Simulations rely on accurate input data to produce meaningful outputs. If the bank doesn't have real customer data, such as arrival rates and service times, the simulation might not be as reliable. However, they could use industry averages or make educated guesses to start. But, generally, simulations without real data might not be as accurate, but they can still provide useful insights.\n\nBut the statement says the simulation will NOT produce usable results. That seems a bit absolute. Even without perfect data, simulations can still offer trends and comparative analyses that can be useful for decision-making.\n\nTherefore, I think Option D is NOT true. The simulation can produce usable results even without actual customer data, though the accuracy might be limited.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Wait a minute, let me double-check.**\n\nIn queueing theory, there are standard models like M/M/c, where M stands for Markovian (Poisson arrivals or exponential service times), and c is the number of servers. These models can be used to calculate various performance measures, such as average wait time, without needing specific customer data.\n\nHowever, for more accurate results, having actual data on arrival rates and service times is ideal. But even without that, simulations can still be useful for comparative purposes.\n\nTherefore, it's not necessarily true that the simulation will not produce usable results without actual customer data. They can still be informative.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options might also be potentially not true.**\n\nOption A: It is indeed possible to vary the number of tellers in a simulation. This is a standard feature in queueing simulations.\n\nOption B: Simulations are specifically useful for testing scenarios without real-world implementation, which aligns with the bank's goal of not inconveniencing customers.\n\nOption C: Considering new alternatives based on simulation results is a common practice. If the results suggest that neither option is satisfactory, the bank might look for innovative solutions.\n\nTherefore, all of A, B, and C seem to be true, leaving D as the not-true statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
