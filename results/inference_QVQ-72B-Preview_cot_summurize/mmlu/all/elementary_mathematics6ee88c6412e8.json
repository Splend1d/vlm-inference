                    "text": "So Tayshawn has 56 marbles, and he's sorting them into equal groups with no marbles left over. That means he's dividing the 56 marbles into groups where each group has the same number of marbles, and there are no marbles remaining after this division.\n\nThe question is asking which of the given statements could be true for these groups. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says there are 6 groups of marbles with 8 marbles in each group. So, if there are 6 groups and each has 8 marbles, the total number of marbles would be 6 multiplied by 8. Let's calculate that: 6 times 8 is 48. But Tayshawn has 56 marbles in total. So, 48 is less than 56, which means this can't be correct because he wouldn't have enough marbles to make 6 groups of 8 each.\n\nOption B suggests there are 7 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group. So, 7 times 7 is 49. Now, Tayshawn has 56 marbles. If he makes 7 groups of 7, that would only account for 49 marbles. But he has 56 marbles, so there would be 56 minus 49, which is 7 marbles left over. The problem states that there are no marbles left over, so this can't be right either.\n\nOption C proposes there are 8 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group. So, 8 multiplied by 7 is 56. That adds up exactly to the total number of marbles Tayshawn has. So, this seems like a possible correct answer because it accounts for all 56 marbles without any left over.\n\nOption D suggests there are 9 groups of marbles with 6 marbles in each group. So, 9 times 6 is 54. Tayshawn has 56 marbles, so that would leave 56 minus 54, which is 2 marbles left over. Again, since the problem says there are no marbles left over, this can't be correct.\n\nSo, after checking all the options, only option C correctly accounts for all 56 marbles without any left over. Therefore, the correct statement is that there are 8 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Tayshawn could have made different numbers of groups with different numbers of marbles, but the options provided are specific. For example, maybe he could make 4 groups of 14 each, but that's not one of the options. Or 14 groups of 4 each, but again, not among the given choices.\n\nLooking back, option C is the only one that perfectly accounts for all 56 marbles with no remainder. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other context or if maybe the problem is testing something else. The problem says \"which statement could be true,\" meaning that among the options provided, which one is possible.\n\nGiven that, and considering that only option C results in the total number of marbles being exactly 56, I'm confident that it's the correct choice.\n\nSo, the answer is C. There are 8 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
