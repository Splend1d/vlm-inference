The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.].

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's based on an account by Ibn Battuta about his travels in Mali during the 1300s. The passage describes some unique social customs among the people he encountered, particularly regarding gender relations and inheritance practices. The question is asking about the likely cause of women not wearing the veil in this society.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided in the passage. Ibn Battuta notes that there is no sexual jealousy among men in this society, and that inheritance passes through the maternal line, with sons of a man's sister inheriting rather than his own sons. This suggests a matrilineal system, where descent and inheritance are traced through the mother's side.\n\nHe also mentions that these people are Muslims who pray, study Islamic jurisprudence, and learn the Quran by heart. However, unlike other Muslim societies he might have known, women here do not veil themselves, even though they are diligent in their prayers. This indicates a deviation from the more common Islamic practice of veiling for women.\n\nThe passage further explains that women do not travel with their husbands and that if a woman wants to travel, her family would prevent it. Additionally, both men and women have friends and companions outside of prohibited degrees of marriage, and it's acceptable for a woman to be with her male companion in her house without her husband objecting.\n\nNow, the question is: what was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.\n\nB. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\n\nC. As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.\n\nD. The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.\n\nI need to analyze each option in light of the information provided.\n\nStarting with option A: rebellion against oppression in Islam. The passage doesn't provide any indication that the women are rebelling against oppression. In fact, it describes a society where women have certain freedoms, like having male companions outside of marriage, but also face restrictions, like not being allowed to travel with their husbands. The absence of veiling doesn't necessarily indicate rebellion but could be part of their cultural norm.\n\nOption B: continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern. This seems plausible. Ibn Battuta notes that despite being Muslims, they maintain certain traditions that differ from mainstream Islamic practices. The matrilineal inheritance system and the absence of veiling could be remnants of their pre-Islamic culture.\n\nOption C: women as sexual objects were prevented from veiling themselves. This seems contradictory because in many cultures, veiling is associated with modesty and sometimes with protecting women from being seen as sexual objects. However, the passage mentions that there is no sexual jealousy among men, which might imply a different attitude towards sexuality and relationships. But it's not clear how this directly relates to veiling.\n\nOption D: the climate of Mali makes veiling impractical. Mali is located in West Africa, known for its hot and arid climate in some regions. Veiling could be uncomfortable in such conditions, but many Muslim women in similar climates do wear the veil as a choice or religious obligation. So, while climate might be a factor, it's not the primary determinant.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most plausible. The passage suggests that despite adopting Islam, the people of Mali retained aspects of their traditional culture, such as matrilineal inheritance and the absence of veiling among women. This indicates that not veiling is likely a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern rather than a response to Islamic practices.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that women are not veiled but still practice Islam diligently suggests that veiling is not a central part of their cultural expression of Islam. It's possible that in this society, veiling was not a traditional practice, and when Islam was adopted, this aspect of their culture persisted.\n\nIn summary, the likely cause of women not wearing the veil in Mali during the 1300s, as described by Ibn Battuta, is that it was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
