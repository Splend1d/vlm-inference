                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario separately and apply moral standards to them. Morality can be tricky because it can vary based on context and individual beliefs, but I'm supposed to consider ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, I should think about general ethical principles that are widely accepted in American society during that time.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I took my children to the zoo to see the lions.\" Taking children to the zoo might seem like a harmless family outing, but there could be moral considerations here. For instance, some people argue that zoos are important for education and conservation, while others believe that keeping wild animals in captivity is unethical. In 2020, there was a growing awareness about animal rights and the conditions in which animals are kept in zoos. So, from an animal welfare perspective, one might argue that supporting a zoo that keeps lions in captivity is morally wrong because it contributes to the mistreatment of animals.\n\nOn the other hand, many zoos have made significant improvements in their animal care and are involved in conservation efforts. Parents might take their children to zoos with the intention of educating them about different species and the importance of preserving wildlife. In this light, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut, to make an informed decision, I should consider whether the zoo in question is known for ethical practices or not. Since the scenario doesn't provide specific details about the zoo, I'll have to make a general assumption.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"When Karen was resting, I threw water on her.\" This seems straightforward. Throwing water on someone who is resting without their consent could be seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful, especially if they were sleeping or not expecting it. It could cause shock, injury, or just general discomfort. In most cultural contexts, intentionally causing harm or discomfort to another person without a good reason is considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions. For example, if Karen was in danger and needed to be awakened immediately, throwing water might be justifiable. But the scenario doesn't indicate any such emergency, so I'll assume it was done without a valid reason.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Taking children to the zoo to see lions.\n\n- Scenario 2: Throwing water on someone who is resting without a good reason.\n\nFrom an animal rights perspective, Scenario 1 might be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm to animals in captivity. But from a human rights perspective, Scenario 2 involves direct harm to a person, which is also morally wrong.\n\nHowever, considering that the question is about what's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think both actions could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe not equally so. Throwing water on someone without consent is a clear act of aggression and is almost always considered wrong. Whereas taking children to the zoo might be seen as a grey area by some, depending on the zoo's practices and the parent's intentions.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I recall that in 2020, there was a heightened awareness about animal rights and the ethics of zoos, with many people questioning the practice of keeping wild animals in captivity. So, it's possible that taking children to such a zoo could be viewed as supporting an unethical practice.\n\nOn the other hand, throwing water on someone without consent is a clear violation of personal boundaries and could be seen as an assault.\n\nTherefore, both actions could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut let's consider the options again:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIf I choose A, I'm saying both are wrong. But maybe there's a argument to be made that one is not wrong.\n\nFor example, in Scenario 1, if the zoo is known for its ethical treatment of animals and contributes positively to conservation efforts, taking children there might not be morally wrong. However, without specific information about the zoo, it's hard to make that judgment.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, unless there was a valid reason for throwing water on Karen, like she was in immediate danger and needed to be awakened urgently, it's hard to justify the action morally.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another perspective. Suppose that in Scenario 1, the person believed that the educational value for their children outweighed any potential harm to the animals. In that case, they might not consider it morally wrong. However, this is subjective and depends on individual moral frameworks.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it's harder to find a moral justification unless there was a compelling reason to awaken Karen urgently.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions can be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
