                    "text": "So I have this question about meiosis, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that meiosis produces two haploid gametes. Hmm, I think I remember that meiosis actually produces four haploid cells, but in reality, in organisms like humans, these cells develop into gametes. But does it produce two gametes? No, in humans, oogenesis produces one large ovum and three smaller polar bodies, while spermatogenesis produces four sperm cells. So, it's not exactly two gametes; it's more than that. Maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nOption B says that homologous chromosomes join during synapsis. I recall that during prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up, which is called synapsis. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C states that sister chromatids separate during meiosis I. Wait, I think sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, similar to mitosis. In meiosis I, it's the homologous chromosomes that separate, not the sister chromatids. So, this might be another incorrect statement.\n\nOption D says that crossing-over increases genetic variation in gametes. Crossing-over is when homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material during meiosis I, which does indeed increase genetic diversity. So, this seems correct.\n\nSo, between options A and C, both seem to have inaccuracies. Let me double-check.\n\nIn meiosis, the process goes through two divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, and crossing-over occurs during prophase I. In meiosis II, sister chromatids separate, similar to mitosis. In terms of gamete production, in animals, one primary oocyte in females produces one ovum and three polar bodies, and one primary spermatocyte in males produces four sperm cells.\n\nSo, option A is not entirely accurate because meiosis produces four haploid cells, which then become gametes, not just two gametes. Option C is also incorrect because sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, not during meiosis I.\n\nBut the question asks for the statement that is NOT true. So, if I have to choose one, I should pick the one that is most clearly incorrect.\n\nOption A says meiosis produces two haploid gametes. As I've recalled, it actually produces four haploid cells that become gametes. So, in reality, it's more than two gametes. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nOption C says sister chromatids separate during meiosis I. Actually, they separate during meiosis II. So, this statement is also false.\n\nBut the question likely expects only one answer, so I need to decide between A and C.\n\nPerhaps the key is to consider whether the statement is completely false or just misleading. Option A is completely false because meiosis does not produce only two gametes. Option C is also false, but in a different way: sister chromatids do separate, but during meiosis II, not meiosis I.\n\nI think the best answer is Option A because it's a straightforward factual error: meiosis produces four haploid cells, not two gametes. In some organisms, like female humans, it's one functional gamete and three polar bodies, which are eventually degraded. In males, it's four functional gametes.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most clearly incorrect statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
