                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which law of negligence should be applied in this case. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a truck driver from State A and a bus driver from State B. They had a collision in State B, and the truck driver was injured. The truck driver then filed a federal diversity action in State B based on negligence, seeking $100,000 in damages from the bus driver.\n\nOkay, so this is a federal diversity action. I remember that diversity jurisdiction in federal courts allows lawsuits between citizens of different states when the amount in controversy exceeds a certain threshold, which is $75,000. Here, the truck driver is seeking $100,000, so that meets the amount requirement. Also, since the truck driver is from State A and the bus driver is from State B, there's diversity of citizenship.\n\nNow, the question is about which law of negligence should be applied. Negligence is typically a matter of state law, not federal law. So, the federal court is going to have to apply state law in this case.\n\nOption A says the court should apply federal common law of negligence. But I think I recall that federal common law is generally not used in areas where state law adequately addresses the issue. Since negligence is well-covered by state laws, it's unlikely that federal common law would be applied here.\n\nOption B suggests applying the negligence law of State A, where the truck driver is from. But that seems a bit odd because the accident happened in State B, and both drivers are from different states. Generally, in tort cases like negligence, the law of the place where the tort occurred is applied. That would be State B in this case.\n\nOption C says the court should consider the negligence laws of both State A and State B and apply the one that most appropriately governs the action. This sounds like a choice of law analysis, where the court looks at which state's law should apply based on factors like where the injury occurred, where the parties are from, etc.\n\nOption D says the court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action. This seems similar to Option C but perhaps more specific. It's suggesting that the federal court should look to how State B's courts would handle the choice of law issue and follow that approach.\n\nHmm, so between Options C and D, which one is correct? Well, in federal diversity cases, federal courts are supposed to apply the substantive law that would be applied by the courts of the forum state. The forum state here is State B, since that's where the federal court is located.\n\nSo, in choice of law questions, federal courts sitting in diversity should apply the choice of law rules that the state's highest court would apply. That means, the federal court should look to how State B's highest court would determine which state's negligence law to apply in this situation.\n\nTherefore, the court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and then apply that law in this action.\n\nWait a minute, but Option C seems to suggest that the court itself decides which law to apply based on some analysis, whereas Option D says the court should apply whatever law a State B court would apply.\n\nI think Option D is more accurate because in diversity cases, federal courts are bound to follow the substantive law that the state court would apply. So, if State B's courts would apply State A's negligence law, then the federal court should do the same. If State B's courts would apply State B's negligence law, then the federal court should follow that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option D: the court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. In Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, the Supreme Court held that federal courts must apply state substantive law in diversity cases. So, substantive law includes things like negligence standards, statutes of limitations, and other matters that define the rights and liabilities of the parties.\n\nChoice of law is also considered substantive in this context. So, the federal court must apply the choice of law rules that the state court of the forum state would apply.\n\nIn this case, the forum state is State B, so the federal court should look to how State B's courts would resolve the choice of law issue and apply the negligence law that State B's courts would choose.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think Option C is correct because it implies that the federal court is making an independent choice of law determination, which isn't aligned with Erie's requirement to apply state law in diversity cases.\n\nOption A is definitely incorrect because negligence is a matter of state law, not federal common law.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because, generally, the law of the place where the tort occurred should apply, which is State B, not State A.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
