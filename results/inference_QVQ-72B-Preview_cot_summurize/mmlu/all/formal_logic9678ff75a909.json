                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here. I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick which option presents a counterexample. The argument is:\n\nT \u2228 U\n\nW \u00b7 T\n\nTherefore, U\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these symbols mean. \u2228 is the disjunction, which means \"or,\" and \u00b7 is the conjunction, meaning \"and.\" So the argument is:\n\nT or U\n\nAnd W and T\n\nTherefore, U\n\nI need to make a truth table for these premises and the conclusion. I have three propositions: T, U, and W. So, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of truth values for T, U, and W.\n\nLet me list all possible truth value combinations for T, U, and W:\n\n1. T is true, U is true, W is true\n\n2. T is true, U is true, W is false\n\n3. T is true, U is false, W is true\n\n4. T is true, U is false, W is false\n\n5. T is false, U is true, W is true\n\n6. T is false, U is true, W is false\n\n7. T is false, U is false, W is true\n\n8. T is false, U is false, W is false\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion for each of these combinations.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n1. T \u2228 U (T or U)\n\n2. W \u00b7 T (W and T)\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\nU (U)\n\nI'll evaluate the premises and the conclusion for each combination.\n\nLet's do combination 1:\n\nT is true, U is true, W is true\n\nT \u2228 U: true \u2228 true = true\n\nW \u00b7 T: true \u00b7 true = true\n\nConclusion: U = true\n\nSo, premises are both true, and conclusion is true.\n\nCombination 2:\n\nT is true, U is true, W is false\n\nT \u2228 U: true \u2228 true = true\n\nW \u00b7 T: false \u00b7 true = false\n\nConclusion: U = true\n\nHere, one premise is false, but the conclusion is true.\n\nCombination 3:\n\nT is true, U is false, W is true\n\nT \u2228 U: true \u2228 false = true\n\nW \u00b7 T: true \u00b7 true = true\n\nConclusion: U = false\n\nNow, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This seems like a counterexample.\n\nCombination 4:\n\nT is true, U is false, W is false\n\nT \u2228 U: true \u2228 false = true\n\nW \u00b7 T: false \u00b7 true = false\n\nConclusion: U = false\n\nOne premise is false, conclusion is false.\n\nCombination 5:\n\nT is false, U is true, W is true\n\nT \u2228 U: false \u2228 true = true\n\nW \u00b7 T: true \u00b7 false = false\n\nConclusion: U = true\n\nOne premise is false, conclusion is true.\n\nCombination 6:\n\nT is false, U is true, W is false\n\nT \u2228 U: false \u2228 true = true\n\nW \u00b7 T: false \u00b7 false = false\n\nConclusion: U = true\n\nAgain, one premise is false, conclusion is true.\n\nCombination 7:\n\nT is false, U is false, W is true\n\nT \u2228 U: false \u2228 false = false\n\nW \u00b7 T: true \u00b7 false = false\n\nConclusion: U = false\n\nHere, the first premise is false, and the second is false, conclusion is false.\n\nCombination 8:\n\nT is false, U is false, W is false\n\nT \u2228 U: false \u2228 false = false\n\nW \u00b7 T: false \u00b7 false = false\n\nConclusion: U = false\n\nBoth premises are false, conclusion is false.\n\nNow, looking back, in combination 3, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. That means the argument is invalid because there is at least one case where the premises are true but the conclusion is false.\n\nSo, the argument is invalid.\n\nNow, I need to choose which option presents a counterexample.\n\nOption B: Invalid. Counterexample when T and W are true and U is false.\n\nLooking back, that's combination 3:\n\nT true, W true, U false.\n\nIn this case, both premises are true, and conclusion is false. So, this is a counterexample.\n\nOption C: Invalid. Counterexample when T is true and W and U are false.\n\nThat's combination 4:\n\nT true, W false, U false.\n\nIn this case, one premise is false (since W \u00b7 T is false), so it's not a counterexample because both premises need to be true for it to be a counterexample.\n\nOption D: Invalid. Counterexample when W is true and T and U are false.\n\nThat's combination 7:\n\nT false, W true, U false.\n\nAgain, one premise is false (T \u2228 U is false), so not a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option B: Invalid. Counterexample when T and W are true and U is false.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
