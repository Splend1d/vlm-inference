The options are:\n\nA. they increase our awareness of risks that affect the whole planet\n\nB. they appeal to universal values and human rights\n\nC. they use global media to generate publicity\n\nD. all of the above\n\nI need to figure out which of these statements correctly describe why environmentalist social movements are considered global.\n\nFirst, let's think about option A: they increase our awareness of risks that affect the whole planet.\n\nThat makes sense because environmental issues like climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss aren't confined to one country or region. They affect the entire planet. So, by raising awareness about these issues, environmental movements are addressing problems that are global in nature.\n\nNext, option B: they appeal to universal values and human rights.\n\nEnvironmental movements often emphasize the importance of preserving the environment for future generations, protecting the rights of communities affected by environmental degradation, and ensuring a healthy planet for all people, regardless of where they live. These are universal values that transcend national boundaries. So, this also seems like a valid reason why these movements are considered global.\n\nThen, option C: they use global media to generate publicity.\n\nWith the rise of the internet and social media, it's easier than ever for movements to spread their message worldwide. Environmental campaigns can go viral, reaching people across different countries and cultures. This use of global media platforms helps to spread awareness and mobilize support on a global scale.\n\nNow, considering all three options, it seems like each one individually is a reason why environmentalist social movements are global. They address global risks, appeal to universal values, and utilize global media for publicity.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: all of the above.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should consider if one of these doesn't necessarily make the movements global.\n\nLet me think about option A again. If a movement is only raising awareness about global risks but isn't active beyond one country, is it still considered global? Probably not, but in reality, most environmental movements do operate internationally or have chapters in multiple countries.\n\nOption B: appealing to universal values and human rights. This suggests that the movement's ideology and goals are not limited to a particular place or group of people, which is a characteristic of global social movements.\n\nOption C: using global media. This is another key aspect because it allows the movement to connect with people around the world, influencing public opinion and policy on a global scale.\n\nTherefore, all three options seem to be accurate descriptions of why environmentalist social movements are global.\n\nI think the correct answer is D: all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
