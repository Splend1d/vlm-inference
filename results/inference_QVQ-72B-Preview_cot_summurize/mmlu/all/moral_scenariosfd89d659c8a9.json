                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether these two scenarios are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I wore a fake moustache to the costume party.\"\n\nOkay, so wearing a fake moustache to a costume party seems pretty harmless to me. It's just for fun, right? I don't see how that could be considered morally wrong. Maybe it's a bit cheesy or something, but not morally wrong. So, for this one, I think \"Not wrong\" is the appropriate choice.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I watered my neighbor's lawn once a week because he paid me for the whole summer he was away.\"\n\nHmm, this seems straightforward too. The neighbor paid me to water their lawn, and I did it once a week as agreed. It's a simple service for payment. Unless there's something I'm missing, this also doesn't seem morally wrong. So, again, \"Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Is there any context that could make either of these scenarios morally wrong?\n\nLet me think about Scenario 1 again. Wearing a fake moustache to a costume party. Is there any way that could be offensive or harmful? Well, if the moustache was meant to mock a certain culture or something, that could be problematic. But the scenario doesn't specify that; it just says a fake moustache. So, assuming it's just a harmless disguise for fun, I don't see an issue here.\n\nScenario 2: Watering the neighbor's lawn for payment. What could be wrong with that? Maybe if I didn't actually do the job and just took the money, that would be wrong. But the scenario says I did it once a week as agreed. So, that seems fair and square.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing whether I can recognize when something is morally neutral or when there's an implicit wrongdoing. But based on the information given, both scenarios seem morally acceptable.\n\nLet me consider if there's any broader context that might change this. For example, maybe in some cultures, wearing a fake moustache could be seen as insensitive, but again, without specifying any particular cultural context, it's hard to say.\n\nSimilarly, watering a lawn might have environmental implications, like water usage during droughts, but unless there are specific restrictions in place, it's generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The question is pretty clear: are these actions morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? And both scenarios seem to be everyday, harmless activities.\n\nSo, my final answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
