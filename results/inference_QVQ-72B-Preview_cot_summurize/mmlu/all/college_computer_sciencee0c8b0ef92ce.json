The options are round-robin, priority queuing, shortest job first, and youngest job first. I need to understand what starvation-free means and how each of these policies handles the scheduling of jobs.\n\nFirst off, starvation-free means that no job has to wait indefinitely for service. So, in other words, once a job is waiting to be processed, it should eventually get its turn, no matter how long it has to wait.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with round-robin (RR). In RR scheduling, each job gets a fixed time slot, called a quantum, in a cyclic order. So, every job gets a turn every round. This seems pretty fair because each job gets a chance in each cycle. So, I don't think starvation can occur in RR because every job is guaranteed a turn in each cycle, as long as it's in the queue. So, RR should be starvation-free.\n\nNext is priority queuing. In priority queuing, jobs are scheduled based on their priority levels. Higher priority jobs are served before lower priority ones. Now, if a job has a very low priority, and higher priority jobs keep arriving, it's possible that the low-priority job might have to wait indefinitely if higher priority jobs never end or keep coming in endlessly. So, in this case, priority queuing can lead to starvation for lower priority jobs. Therefore, priority queuing is not starvation-free.\n\nMoving on to shortest job first (SJF). In SJF, the job with the smallest remaining processing time is scheduled next. This policy can lead to starvation for longer jobs. If shorter jobs keep arriving, they will always be prioritized over the longer jobs that are already waiting. So, the longer jobs might never get executed, leading to starvation. Hence, SJF is not starvation-free.\n\nLastly, youngest job first. I'm assuming this means that the most recently arrived job is scheduled first. So, newer jobs are favored over older ones. This could lead to older jobs being postponed indefinitely if newer jobs keep coming in. This is similar to priority inversion or the problem of indefinite postponement in priority scheduling. Therefore, youngest job first is not starvation-free.\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems that round-robin is the only option among the given choices that guarantees no job will wait indefinitely for service. It's designed to prevent starvation by giving each job a fair share of the processor's time in a cyclic manner.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. In RR, even if a job requires more time than the quantum, it will be resumed in the next cycle until it's completed. So, as long as the quantum is set appropriately, no job should starve. In contrast, in priority queuing, SJF, and youngest job first, there are scenarios where certain jobs could be indefinitely delayed or starved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Round-robin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
