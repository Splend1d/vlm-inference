The symbols are:\n\n- c: Cathy\n\n- l: Leo\n\n- Txy: x is taller than y\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Tlc\n\nB. Tcl\n\nC. lTc\n\nD. cTl\n\nOkay, so the statement is about Leo being taller than Cathy. So, in predicate logic, it should be something like \"T(leo, cathy)\" because T is the relation where the first variable is taller than the second variable.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Tlc \u2013 Hmm, this looks like T applied to l and c. So, T(l, c), which would be \"Leo is taller than Cathy.\" That seems right.\n\nB. Tcl \u2013 This looks like T applied to c and l. So, T(c, l), which would be \"Cathy is taller than Leo.\" But that's the opposite of what the statement says.\n\nC. lTc \u2013 This seems like l is related to c through T, so again, lTc is similar to T(l, c), which is \"Leo is taller than Cathy.\"\n\nD. cTl \u2013 This would be similar to T(c, l), which is \"Cathy is taller than Leo,\" which is not what the statement says.\n\nSo, between options A and C, both seem to suggest T(l, c), which matches the statement \"Leo is taller than Cathy.\"\n\nBut let's double-check the standard way of writing predicate logic. Typically, in predicate logic, the relation comes first, followed by the variables in parentheses. So, T(l, c) would be written as T(l, c), which corresponds to option A: Tlc.\n\nOption C: lTc seems a bit different. It might be read as l is taller than c, which is the same meaning, but in standard predicate logic, the relation should be followed by variables in parentheses.\n\nWait a minute, maybe in some texts, they write it as lTc without parentheses. But I think the more standard form is T(l, c), which would be Tlc without commas or spaces.\n\nGiven that, option A seems the most straightforward and standard translation of \"Leo is taller than Cathy\" into predicate logic.\n\nOption C, lTc, might be acceptable in some contexts, but it's less standard than T(l, c) or Tlc.\n\nOptions B and D suggest that Cathy is taller than Leo, which contradicts the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option A: Tlc.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
