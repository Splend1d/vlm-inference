                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs for short. The problem states that G is a finite DAG with at least one edge, and it asks which of the three statements must be true. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what a DAG is. A DAG is a directed graph that has no directed cycles. That means if you follow the direction of the edges, you can't end up where you started without backtracking. Also, it's finite and has at least one edge, so it's not empty.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. G has a vertex with no incoming edges.\n\nII. G has a vertex with no outgoing edges.\n\nIII. G has an isolated vertex, meaning one with neither incoming nor outgoing edges.\n\nI need to determine which of these must be true for any finite DAG with at least one edge.\n\nLet's start with statement I: G has a vertex with no incoming edges.\n\nHmm, in a DAG, since there are no cycles, there must be at least one vertex that doesn't have any incoming edges. If every vertex had at least one incoming edge, you could start from any vertex and keep following the incoming edges indefinitely, which would imply a cycle, contradicting the acyclic property. So, statement I must be true.\n\nWait, but let's think about a simple DAG. Suppose we have three vertices: A, B, and C, with edges A -> B and B -> C. Here, vertex A has no incoming edges, and vertex C has no outgoing edges. But what if the graph only has one vertex and one edge, like a loop? Oh, but the problem states that it's a DAG, and a loop would create a cycle, which isn't allowed in a DAG. So, in this case, since there are no cycles, there must be at least one vertex without any incoming edges. So, statement I seems correct.\n\nNow, statement II: G has a vertex with no outgoing edges.\n\nIs this necessarily true? Again, in the simple DAG I thought of earlier, vertex C has no outgoing edges. But is this always the case?\n\nConsider a DAG with a single source and a single sink, where all edges are directed towards the sink. In this case, the sink would have no outgoing edges. But what if the graph is more complex? Is it possible to have a DAG without any vertices that have no outgoing edges?\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose every vertex has at least one outgoing edge. Then, starting from any vertex, you can always follow an outgoing edge to another vertex, and so on. Since the graph is finite and acyclic, this process must eventually terminate at a vertex with no outgoing edges. So, even in this scenario, there must be at least one vertex without outgoing edges. Wait, does that make sense?\n\nActually, no. Consider a DAG where every vertex has at least one outgoing edge, and the graph is structured like a tree where each node has multiple children, but no cycles. In such a case, there would be no \"sink\" vertex with no outgoing edges, because every vertex has at least one outgoing edge. But wait, in a tree, the leaves have no outgoing edges. Is that right?\n\nWait, in a tree, which is a special case of a DAG, the leaves have no incoming edges because they're at the bottom of the hierarchy. For example, in a rooted tree, the root has no incoming edges, and the leaves have no outgoing edges. But in a more general DAG, it's possible to have vertices with no incoming or outgoing edges.\n\nBut let's consider a DAG where all vertices have at least one outgoing edge. Suppose we have a DAG with vertices arranged in layers, like a pyramid, where each vertex points to multiple vertices in the layer below, and the bottom layer has multiple vertices with no outgoing edges. In this case, the bottom layer vertices have no outgoing edges.\n\nBut is it possible to have a DAG where no vertex has no outgoing edges? Let's try constructing such a graph.\n\nSuppose we have a graph with three vertices: A, B, and C, with edges A -> B and B -> C. Here, A has no incoming edges, C has no outgoing edges. But what if we add an edge from C back to A? Oh, but that would create a cycle, which isn't allowed in a DAG.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we have a graph with vertices A, B, C, and D, with edges A -> B, B -> C, and C -> D. Here, A has no incoming edges, D has no outgoing edges. If we add an edge from D to A, again, that would create a cycle.\n\nWait, but if every vertex has at least one outgoing edge, does that necessarily mean there must be a vertex with no outgoing edges? I don't think so. For example, consider a graph where all vertices point to some other vertices, forming a kind of infinite descending chain, but since the graph is finite, that's not possible.\n\nActually, in a finite DAG, if every vertex has at least one outgoing edge, then there must be at least one vertex with no outgoing edges. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Consider a graph where all vertices form a chain: A -> B -> C -> D, and so on, with each vertex pointing to the next one. In this case, the last vertex has no outgoing edges. So, in this scenario, statement II holds.\n\nBut what if the graph is more interconnected? Suppose we have a DAG where every vertex points to multiple other vertices, but no vertex is a \"sink.\" Is that possible? Let's think about it.\n\nImagine a graph where each vertex points to all vertices except its predecessors. For example, in a layered graph where each layer points to the layer below, the bottom layer would have no outgoing edges. So, in this case, statement II is true.\n\nBut is there a DAG where no vertex has no outgoing edges? I don't think so, because in a finite DAG, the process of following outgoing edges must eventually terminate at a vertex with no outgoing edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of termination. Since the graph is acyclic and finite, any path following outgoing edges must eventually stop at a vertex with no outgoing edges. Therefore, statement II must be true.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, statement I and statement II must both be true.\n\nNow, statement III: G has an isolated vertex, meaning one with neither incoming nor outgoing edges.\n\nIs this necessarily true? An isolated vertex is one that is not connected to any other vertex via directed edges. In a DAG with at least one edge, is it possible to have such a vertex?\n\nConsider a simple DAG with two vertices: A and B, with an edge A -> B. Here, there are no isolated vertices. Alternatively, in a larger DAG, it's possible to have isolated vertices if they are not connected to any other vertices.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the graph has at least one edge, so it's not empty. Therefore, it's possible to have a DAG without isolated vertices, as long as every vertex has at least one incoming or outgoing edge.\n\nFor example, consider a DAG where all vertices are connected in a chain: A -> B -> C -> ... -> Z. In this case, A has no incoming edges, Z has no outgoing edges, and all other vertices have both incoming and outgoing edges. Here, there are no isolated vertices.\n\nTherefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, based on this, statements I and II must be true, but statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"must be true,\" meaning that for any finite DAG with at least one edge, these statements hold.\n\nFrom my reasoning above, statement I and statement II must be true, but statement III does not have to be true.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II only\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, the correct answer should be D. I and II only.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst, statement I: in a DAG, there must be at least one vertex with no incoming edges. This is because if every vertex had incoming edges, there would be a cycle, which contradicts the acyclic property. So, yes, statement I must be true.\n\nSecond, statement II: there must be at least one vertex with no outgoing edges. This is also true because in a finite DAG, following outgoing edges must eventually terminate at a vertex with no outgoing edges. Otherwise, you could have an infinite path, which isn't possible in a finite graph.\n\nThird, statement III: it's possible to have isolated vertices, but it's not necessary. As shown in the chain example, a DAG can have no isolated vertices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
