                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"The element (4, 2) of Z_12 x Z_8 has order...\" and then there are options A. 4, B. 8, C. 12, D. 6. I need to find the order of this element in the direct product of these two cyclic groups.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the order of an element in a group means. In group theory, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that when you apply the group operation n times to that element, you get the identity element of the group.\n\nSo, in Z_12 x Z_8, the group operation is addition component-wise, and the identity element is (0,0). Therefore, I need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n*(4,2) = (0,0).\n\nSince Z_12 and Z_8 are both cyclic groups, their elements correspond to integers modulo 12 and modulo 8, respectively. So, (4,2) means (4 mod 12, 2 mod 8).\n\nTo find n such that n*(4,2) = (0,0), I can look at each component separately because the operations are independent.\n\nFirst, consider the first component: 4 in Z_12.\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integer n such that 4*n \u2261 0 mod 12.\n\nSimilarly, for the second component: 2 in Z_8, find the smallest positive integer n such that 2*n \u2261 0 mod 8.\n\nLet's solve these one by one.\n\nStarting with 4*n \u2261 0 mod 12.\n\nThis means that 4*n is a multiple of 12. To find the smallest such n, I can divide 12 by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 12.\n\nThe GCD of 4 and 12 is 4, so n = 12 / 4 = 3.\n\nSo, the first component will be 0 after 3 steps.\n\nNow, for the second component: 2*n \u2261 0 mod 8.\n\nSimilarly, find the smallest n such that 2*n is a multiple of 8.\n\nThe GCD of 2 and 8 is 2, so n = 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nSo, the second component will be 0 after 4 steps.\n\nNow, since these are components of a direct product, the order of the element (4,2) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its components.\n\nSo, LCM of 3 and 4.\n\nWhat's the LCM of 3 and 4?\n\nLet's list the multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12\n\nAnd the multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12\n\nThe smallest common multiple is 12.\n\nTherefore, the order of (4,2) in Z_12 x Z_8 is 12.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 12 seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the first component, 4 in Z_12.\n\nLet's compute 4*1 = 4\n\n4*2 = 8\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2261 0 mod 12\n\nSo, yes, order 3 for the first component.\n\nSecond component, 2 in Z_8.\n\n2*1 = 2\n\n2*2 = 4\n\n2*3 = 6\n\n2*4 = 8 \u2261 0 mod 8\n\nSo, order 4 for the second component.\n\nLCM of 3 and 4 is indeed 12.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently.\n\nIn a direct product of groups, the order of an element (a,b) is the LCM of the orders of a and b.\n\nSo, order of a is 3, order of b is 4, LCM is 12.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 12.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there's a smaller n that could work.\n\nSuppose n=6.\n\nThen, 6*(4,2) = (6*4, 6*2) = (24, 12)\n\nIn Z_12, 24 \u2261 0, and in Z_8, 12 \u2261 4 mod 8.\n\nSo, (0,4) \u2260 (0,0). Not the identity.\n\nn=4.\n\n4*(4,2) = (16, 8) = (4,0) in Z_12 x Z_8. Not (0,0).\n\nn=3.\n\n3*(4,2) = (12, 6) = (0,6) in Z_12 x Z_8. Not (0,0).\n\nn=2.\n\n2*(4,2) = (8,4) = (8,4) in Z_12 x Z_8. Not (0,0).\n\nn=1.\n\n(4,2). Not (0,0).\n\nSo, indeed, the smallest n is 12.\n\nTherefore, the order is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
