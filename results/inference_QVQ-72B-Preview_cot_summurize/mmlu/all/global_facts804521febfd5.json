                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two statements, and I need to decide which ones are true or false as of 2020. Let me try to understand each statement one by one.\n\nThe first statement is: \"As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction.\" So, it's about the relationship between a country's wealth and the happiness or life satisfaction of its people.\n\nI've heard mixed things about this. On one hand, it makes sense that if a country is richer, people might have better access to resources, healthcare, education, and so on, which could lead to higher life satisfaction. But on the other hand, I've also heard that after a certain point, more money doesn't necessarily buy more happiness.\n\nI think there's something called the \"Easterlin paradox,\" which suggests that once basic needs are met, additional increases in income don't lead to proportional increases in happiness. So, maybe in poorer countries, increases in wealth lead to higher happiness, but in richer countries, the relationship isn't as strong.\n\nBut, as of 2020, what's the general consensus? I need to find some recent data or studies on this topic.\n\nLet me search for some information. I found that the World Happiness Report, which is released annually, looks at factors like GDP per capita, social support, health, and others to rank countries based on life satisfaction.\n\nLooking at the 2020 World Happiness Report, it seems that wealthier countries do tend to score higher on the happiness index. For example, Nordic countries like Finland, Denmark, and Norway, which are quite wealthy, consistently rank at the top.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. Some wealthy countries don't rank as high as expected, and some middle-income countries perform better than their GDP would suggest.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a general positive correlation, but it's not the only factor, and there might be diminishing returns.\n\nBut for the sake of this question, if I have to choose between true and false for this statement, I'd lean towards true, because on average, richer countries do report higher life satisfaction.\n\nNow, moving on to the second statement: \"Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact.\"\n\nThis is interesting. I know that major life events can cause significant changes in our lives, and they might affect our happiness in the short term. For example, getting married might make someone very happy initially, but over time, they might return to their baseline level of happiness.\n\nI think there's a concept called \"hedonic adaptation,\" which suggests that people tend to adapt to their circumstances over time and return to a relatively stable level of happiness.\n\nSo, according to this, even though events like marriage or divorce can cause spikes or drops in happiness, these effects are often temporary, and people tend to revert to their baseline levels in the long run.\n\nThere's research to support this. For instance, a study found that the long-term impact of marriage on happiness is smaller than often assumed, and that many people adapt to their marital status over time.\n\nSimilarly, with divorce, while it can be a traumatic event, most people do recover and return to their previous happiness levels after a period of time.\n\nSo, based on this, the statement seems accurate. Important life events do affect happiness, but their long-term impact is surprisingly little.\n\nTherefore, for the second statement, I would say it's true.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the first statement is true, and the second statement is true, so the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me see if there's any contrary evidence or different perspectives.\n\nFor the first statement, while there might be debates about the strength of the relationship between wealth and happiness, especially in very rich countries, the general trend seems to be that richer countries do have higher average life satisfaction.\n\nFor the second statement, the idea of hedonic adaptation is well-established in positive psychology and has been supported by multiple studies.\n\nSo, I think my conclusion is solid. The answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
