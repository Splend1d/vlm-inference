I'm not great with dates and calendars, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many weeks are in 706 days and what the remainder is, because there are 7 days in a week. The remainder will tell me how many days past a full week cycle the 706 days represent.\n\nLet me do the division: 706 divided by 7.\n\n7 times 100 is 700, but that's too much. Wait, 7 times 100 is 700, but that's more than 706. Wait, no, 7 times 100 is 700, which is less than 706.\n\nSo, 7 times 100 is 700, subtract that from 706, and the remainder is 6 days.\n\nSo, 706 days is equal to 100 weeks and 6 days.\n\nSince 100 weeks is a multiple of 7 days, it brings us back to the same day of the week. So, adding 6 more days to that will give us the final day.\n\nCarlos was born on Saturday. So, 100 weeks later, it's still Saturday, and then adding 6 days from Saturday would take us to Friday.\n\nLet me count the days to be sure:\n\nDay 1: Saturday + 1 day = Sunday\n\nDay 2: Sunday + 1 day = Monday\n\nDay 3: Monday + 1 day = Tuesday\n\nDay 4: Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday\n\nDay 5: Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday\n\nDay 6: Thursday + 1 day = Friday\n\nSo, after adding 6 days to Saturday, we end up on Friday.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Like leap years or anything? The problem seems to be just about counting 706 days from November 9, 2002, without considering any other calendar complexities.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answer should be Friday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Friday}} \\]"
