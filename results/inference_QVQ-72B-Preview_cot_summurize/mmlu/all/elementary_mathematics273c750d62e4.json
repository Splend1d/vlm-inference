                    "text": "So the teacher bought 5 boxes of red folders, with each box containing 36 folders. So, the total number of red folders is 5 times 36. Let me calculate that first.\n\n5 multiplied by 30 is 150, and 5 times 6 is 30. So, 150 plus 30 gives me 180 red folders.\n\nNext, the teacher bought 6 boxes of blue folders, with each box containing 32 folders. So, the total number of blue folders is 6 times 32.\n\nLet me compute that. 6 times 30 is 180, and 6 times 2 is 12. So, 180 plus 12 equals 192 blue folders.\n\nNow, to find the total number of red and blue folders, I need to add the number of red folders to the number of blue folders. That is, 180 plus 192.\n\n180 plus 100 is 280, plus 92 is 372.\n\nSo, the total number of folders is 372.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 275\n\nB. 380\n\nC. 440\n\nD. 550\n\n372 is closest to option B, which is 380.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the red folders: 5 boxes times 36 folders each. 5 times 30 is 150, and 5 times 6 is 30, total 180. That seems correct.\n\nThen, blue folders: 6 boxes times 32 folders each. 6 times 30 is 180, and 6 times 2 is 12, total 192. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding them up: 180 plus 192. 180 plus 100 is 280, plus 92 is 372.\n\nNow, among the options, 372 is closest to 380. So, option B should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there's a different way to approximate or if the question allows for estimation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for an exact calculation, but since it's about finding the closest number, maybe estimation is acceptable.\n\nIn any case, based on my calculations, 372 is closest to 380.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe estimating before calculating.\n\n5 boxes of 36 is roughly 5 times 40, which is 200, but that's not exact. Actual calculation is 5 times 36, which is 180, as I did before.\n\n6 boxes of 32 is roughly 6 times 30, which is 180, plus 6 times 2, which is 12, totaling 192.\n\nAdding 180 and 192 gives 372, which is closest to 380.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider rounding each before adding:\n\n5 times 36 is 180, which is exact.\n\n6 times 32 is 192, which is exact.\n\nAdding them gives 372, which rounds to 370 or 380 depending on the context.\n\nBut since 372 is closer to 380 than to 370, I think 380 is the best answer.\n\nWait, actually, 372 is closer to 370 than to 380. 372 minus 370 is 2, and 380 minus 372 is 8. So, technically, it's closer to 370, but since 370 isn't an option, and 380 is the next closest, I would still choose B. 380.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact calculation, but since it's asking for the closest number, I think B. 380 is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
