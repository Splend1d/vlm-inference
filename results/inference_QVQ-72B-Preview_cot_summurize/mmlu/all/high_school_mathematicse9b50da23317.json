                    "text": "So I've got this problem here that defines a new operation called \"#\". It gives me three properties:\n\n1. \\( r \\# 0 = r \\)\n\n2. \\( r \\# s = s \\# r \\)\n\n3. \\( (r + 1) \\# s = (r \\# s) + s + 1 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( 11 \\# 5 \\). The options are 11, 12, 64, and 71.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this \"#\" operation does. It's not a standard operation like addition or multiplication, so I have to figure out how it works based on the properties given.\n\nThe first property says that any number \"#\" 0 is just the number itself. So, for example, \\( 11 \\# 0 = 11 \\). That seems straightforward.\n\nThe second property says that the operation is commutative, meaning the order of the numbers doesn't matter. So \\( r \\# s = s \\# r \\). That's helpful because it means I can swap the numbers around if that makes calculations easier.\n\nThe third property is a bit more complex: \\( (r + 1) \\# s = (r \\# s) + s + 1 \\). This seems like a recursive definition, where the result of incrementing the first operand by 1 is related to the previous result plus some adjustment involving \\( s \\).\n\nI need to find \\( 11 \\# 5 \\), so maybe I can express this in terms of operations where one of the operands is 0, since I know that \\( r \\# 0 = r \\).\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a general formula for \\( r \\# s \\).\n\nStarting with small values of \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), maybe I can see a pattern emerging.\n\nLet's start with \\( s = 0 \\):\n\n\\( r \\# 0 = r \\), by the first property.\n\nNow, let's consider \\( s = 1 \\):\n\nUsing the third property:\n\n\\( (r + 1) \\# 1 = (r \\# 1) + 1 + 1 = (r \\# 1) + 2 \\)\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it.\n\nLet me try to find \\( r \\# 1 \\) in terms of \\( r \\).\n\nIf I set \\( r = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 0 \\# 1 = ? \\)\n\nI don't know \\( 0 \\# 1 \\) yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the commutativity.\n\nSince \\( r \\# s = s \\# r \\), then \\( 0 \\# 1 = 1 \\# 0 \\).\n\nAnd \\( 1 \\# 0 = 1 \\), by the first property.\n\nSo \\( 0 \\# 1 = 1 \\).\n\nNow, using the third property:\n\n\\( (0 + 1) \\# 1 = (0 \\# 1) + 1 + 1 \\)\n\nWhich is \\( 1 \\# 1 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nNow, \\( (1 + 1) \\# 1 = (1 \\# 1) + 1 + 1 \\)\n\nWhich is \\( 2 \\# 1 = 3 + 2 = 5 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( 3 \\# 1 = 5 + 2 = 7 \\), and so on.\n\nSo it seems like \\( r \\# 1 = 1 + 2r \\)\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFor \\( r = 0 \\): \\( 0 \\# 1 = 1 \\), which is \\( 1 + 2*0 = 1 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nFor \\( r = 1 \\): \\( 1 \\# 1 = 3 \\), which is \\( 1 + 2*1 = 3 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nFor \\( r = 2 \\): \\( 2 \\# 1 = 5 \\), which is \\( 1 + 2*2 = 5 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nFor \\( r = 3 \\): \\( 3 \\# 1 = 7 \\), which is \\( 1 + 2*3 = 7 \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nSo it seems that \\( r \\# 1 = 1 + 2r \\)\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nNow, let's try to find a general formula for \\( r \\# s \\).\n\nMaybe I can look for a pattern or derive a formula based on the properties given.\n\nLet me consider fixing \\( s \\) and seeing how \\( r \\# s \\) changes as \\( r \\) increases by 1 each time.\n\nFrom the third property: \\( (r + 1) \\# s = (r \\# s) + s + 1 \\)\n\nThis suggests that each time I increase \\( r \\) by 1, \\( r \\# s \\) increases by \\( s + 1 \\).\n\nThis looks like an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is \\( s + 1 \\).\n\nSo, if I know \\( r \\# s \\) for some \\( r \\), then for \\( r + 1 \\), it's just \\( r \\# s + s + 1 \\).\n\nThis is similar to how in arithmetic sequences, each term is the previous term plus a constant difference.\n\nSo, if I can find \\( r \\# s \\) in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), perhaps it's a linear function in \\( r \\), with the slope being \\( s + 1 \\).\n\nWait, but \\( s \\) is also varying, so maybe it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( r \\# s = r + s + r \\times s \\), but let's check if this satisfies the properties.\n\nFirst property: \\( r \\# 0 = r + 0 + r \\times 0 = r \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nSecond property: \\( r \\# s = s \\# r \\) \u2014 in my guess, \\( r + s + r s = s + r + s r \\), which is the same \u2014 correct.\n\nThird property: \\( (r + 1) \\# s = (r + 1) + s + (r + 1) s = r + 1 + s + r s + s = r + s + r s + 1 + s \\)\n\nAnd \\( (r \\# s) + s + 1 = (r + s + r s) + s + 1 = r + s + r s + s + 1 \\)\n\nWhich matches \\( (r + 1) \\# s \\).\n\nSo my guess seems to satisfy all three properties.\n\nTherefore, \\( r \\# s = r + s + r s \\)\n\nNow, let's compute \\( 11 \\# 5 \\):\n\n\\( 11 \\# 5 = 11 + 5 + 11 \\times 5 = 11 + 5 + 55 = 71 \\)\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 11\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 64\n\nD. 71\n\nSo, the answer should be 71.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if \\( r \\# s = r + s + r s \\) really satisfies all properties.\n\nFirst property: \\( r \\# 0 = r + 0 + r \\times 0 = r \\) \u2014 correct.\n\nSecond property: \\( r \\# s = s \\# r \\) \u2014 yes, since addition is commutative.\n\nThird property: \\( (r + 1) \\# s = (r + 1) + s + (r + 1) s = r + 1 + s + r s + s = r + s + r s + 1 + s \\)\n\nAnd \\( (r \\# s) + s + 1 = (r + s + r s) + s + 1 = r + s + r s + s + 1 \\), which matches \u2014 correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( r \\# s = r + s + r s \\) is valid, and \\( 11 \\# 5 = 71 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{71} \\]"
