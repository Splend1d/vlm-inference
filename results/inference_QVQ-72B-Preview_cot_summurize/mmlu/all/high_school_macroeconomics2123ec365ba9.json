                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. I remember that the aggregate demand curve shows the total demand for goods and services in an economy at different price levels. A rightward shift means that there's an increase in demand at every price level. Let's think through each option.\n\nOption A says an increase in the price level. Hmm, that sounds like it would move us along the aggregate demand curve rather than shifting it. If the price level increases, we'd move upwards along the same curve, not shift the whole curve. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B is depreciation in the international value of the dollar. So, if the dollar depreciates, that means it's worth less compared to other currencies. That should make American exports cheaper for foreigners and imports more expensive for Americans. This could lead to increased net exports because exports rise and imports fall. Increased net exports would increase aggregate demand. Yeah, that sounds like it would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n\nOption C is an increase in personal income tax rates. If personal income taxes increase, people have less disposable income. That might lead them to spend less, which would decrease consumption and, consequently, aggregate demand. So, this should shift the aggregate demand curve to the left, not to the right.\n\nOption D is an increase in interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which could dampen investment spending by businesses and consumers. decreased investment would likely lead to a decrease in aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the left.\n\nBased on this thinking, it seems like option B, depreciation in the international value of the dollar, is the one that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that depreciation could lead to higher prices domestically, which might offset the increase in net exports? Well, if depreciation leads to higher import prices, that could increase the general price level, but that would be more of a supply-side effect, possibly leading to cost-push inflation. However, in the context of aggregate demand, the primary effect of depreciation is to improve the trade balance, thereby increasing aggregate demand.\n\nSo, I think my initial conclusion is correct. Option B is the right answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could indirectly lead to a rightward shift in aggregate demand.\n\nOption A: Increase in the price level. This is more about moving along the aggregate demand curve due to changes in the price level itself, not about shifting the curve.\n\nOption C: Increase in personal income tax rates. This directly reduces disposable income and likely consumption, which is a component of aggregate demand. So, it should shift the curve left.\n\nOption D: Increase in interest rates. This makes borrowing more expensive, reducing investment and possibly consumption, which are both parts of aggregate demand. So, this should also shift the curve left.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies a rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve is option B: depreciation in the international value of the dollar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
