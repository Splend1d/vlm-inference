                    "text": "So Theo loses his job at the public swimming pool when it closes for the winter. I need to figure out what type of unemployment this is. The options are cyclical unemployment, discouraged worker, seasonal unemployment, and frictional unemployment.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each type of unemployment means.\n\nStarting with cyclical unemployment: I think this has to do with the business cycle. Like, when the economy is in a recession, more people lose their jobs because companies can't afford to keep everyone. So, it's related to the overall health of the economy. In this case, Theo losing his job because the pool closes for the winter doesn't seem directly related to the economy's health. It's more about the time of year.\n\nNext, discouraged worker. I've heard this term before. It's when people give up looking for work because they think there are no jobs available for them. They might be unemployed but stop actively searching. But in this scenario, Theo has lost his job, but it doesn't say anything about him giving up looking for work. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nThen there's seasonal unemployment. This sounds plausible. Seasonal unemployment is when people lose their jobs because of seasonal changes in demand for certain jobs. For example, ski instructors might be out of work in the summer, or lifeguards in the winter when pools close. So, Theo losing his job at the swimming pool during winter fits this description. It's directly related to the season changing and the pool closing as a result.\n\nLastly, frictional unemployment. I think this is when people are between jobs, maybe they've quit one job and are looking for another. It's a temporary state while they search for something better-suited to their skills. For Theo, he lost his job because the pool closed for the winter, which seems more tied to the season rather than him actively choosing to look for a new job.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like seasonal unemployment is the most appropriate category for Theo's situation. The fact that the pool closes for the winter indicates that his job loss is directly related to the time of year, which is a characteristic of seasonal unemployment.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Could it be frictional unemployment if Theo decides to look for a different job now that the pool is closed? Well, possibly, but the question states that he loses his job because the pool closes for the winter. It doesn't mention him seeking another job, so it's more accurate to attribute his unemployment to the seasonal closure of the pool.\n\nI don't think it's cyclical unemployment because it's not related to the overall economic conditions, but rather to a specific seasonal factor affecting his workplace. And since he hasn't given up looking for work, it's not a discouraged worker.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. seasonal unemployment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
