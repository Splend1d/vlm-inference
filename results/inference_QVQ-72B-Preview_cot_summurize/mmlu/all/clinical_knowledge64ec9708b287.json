                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What is the pH of water?\" and there are four options to choose from: A. 3.5, B. 7, C. 12, D. 6.25. I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, I think I remember that pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. The scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above 7 is basic. So, pure water should be neutral, right? That would mean the pH is 7. But let me think carefully.\n\nI recall that in pure water, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) is equal to the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-). At 25\u00b0C, this concentration is 1 x 10^-7 moles per liter. The pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. So, pH = -log[H+]. Plugging in the value, pH = -log(1 x 10^-7) = 7. Yeah, that makes sense. So, option B. 7 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any factors that could affect the pH of water. For example, if there are dissolved substances in the water, that could change its pH. However, the question specifies \"water,\" which I assume means pure water without any dissolved substances. In that case, the pH should indeed be 7.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the temperature can affect the ionization of water. At higher temperatures, the ionization constant increases, which means the concentrations of H+ and OH- increase, and consequently, the pH decreases slightly. For instance, at 37\u00b0C, the pH of pure water is about 6.8. But since the question doesn't specify the temperature, I think it's safe to assume standard conditions, which is 25\u00b0C, where pH is 7.\n\nAlso, I should remember that carbon dioxide from the air can dissolve in water to form carbonic acid, which can lower the pH. But again, in pure water, this effect is minimal, and the pH remains close to 7.\n\nLet me also look at the other options to see why they might be incorrect. Option A is 3.5, which is on the acidic side. This might be the pH of some natural waters like rainwater, which can have a pH around 5.6 due to dissolved carbon dioxide, but not pure water.\n\nOption C is 12, which is basic. This might be the pH of some alkaline solutions or soils, but not water.\n\nOption D is 6.25. This is slightly acidic, which doesn't correspond to pure water under standard conditions.\n\nSo, based on all this, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 7.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall the definition of pH again. pH is a measure of the activity of hydrogen ions in a solution. In pure water, the activity of H+ equals the activity of OH-, and this balance points to a neutral pH of 7. Therefore, the pH of water is 7.\n\nI think that's it. No further confusion here. The answer is B. 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 7} \\]"
