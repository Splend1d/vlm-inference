                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about how civilized societies treated barbarian peoples in different time periods. The reference is to something called \"Germania\" by Publius Cornelius Tacitus from around 98 C.E., which talks about various Germanic tribes and their interactions with the Romans. The question is asking which of the given options is a similar treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. and then from 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being described in the passage. It seems like there were some tribes, like the Tencteri, Bructeri, Chamavi, and Angrivarii, and there were conflicts and power shifts among them. The Bructeri were driven out and exterminated by the Chamavi and Angrivarii with help from neighboring tribes. Then, there was a battle where over sixty thousand people fell, and the author is glad that this happened without Roman intervention, almost as a spectacle for the Romans to enjoy. The author hopes that these tribes continue to hate each other rather than unite against the Romans.\n\nSo, in this context, the \"civilized society\" is likely the Roman Empire, and the \"barbarian peoples\" are these Germanic tribes. The treatment here seems to involve conflict, exploitation of divisions, and benefiting from their mutual animosities.\n\nNow, the question is asking for a treatment that was similar in both time periods: from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. and from 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\n\nThis could be possible in some cases. For example, during the Christianization of Europe, many barbarian tribes were converted to Christianity. But was this a consistent treatment across both time periods?\n\nIn the earlier period, from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., there were various religious changes, including the spread of Christianity, which did involve converting barbarian tribes. In the later period, from 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E., Christianity continued to spread into northern Europe, converting more barbarian tribes like the Vikings and Slavs.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if this was a universal treatment or just one aspect of the interaction.\n\nB. Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\n\nThis is also plausible. The Roman Empire often recruited barbarian soldiers into their army, especially in the later periods when the empire was facing manpower shortages. These were known as auxiliaries or foederati.\n\nIn the later period, from 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E., this practice continued in various forms. For example, during the medieval period, many European kingdoms employed mercenaries who were often from neighboring barbarian groups.\n\nSo, this seems like a consistent treatment across both time periods.\n\nC. Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\n\nThis suggests that barbarians were legally considered servants or slaves in the societies that hosted them.\n\nIn the Roman Empire, there were certainly slaves who were captured barbarians, but not all barbarians were slaves. Some barbarians held positions of influence or were integrated as citizens.\n\nIn the later period, from 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E., serfdom became common in medieval Europe, but again, this wasn't uniformly applied to all barbarian peoples.\n\nSo, this option seems too absolute.\n\nD. Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n\nThis implies that barbarian leaders were invited to take over the government of civilized societies.\n\nWhile there are examples of barbarian kings being invited to rule over former Roman territories, like the Visigoths in Spain or the Franks in Gaul, this wasn't a widespread or consistent practice across both time periods.\n\nIn the earlier period, from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., there are some instances of barbarian leaders being granted land or positions in exchange for their loyalty, but inviting them to rule the entire society was more common in the late Roman Empire and the early medieval period.\n\nSo, this might be more specific to the later part of the first time period and the beginning of the second time period.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most consistent across both time periods. Both the Roman Empire and medieval European kingdoms utilized barbarian soldiers in their armies.\n\nBut I should think about whether this was truly a treatment imposed by civilized societies on barbarian peoples or whether it was a voluntary arrangement.\n\nIn the case of the Roman Empire, barbarian soldiers often volunteered for service in exchange for pay, land, and sometimes citizenship. Similarly, in medieval times, mercenaries from barbarian groups were hired for their military skills.\n\nSo, it was more of a reciprocal arrangement rather than a forced treatment.\n\nOption A, conversion to the host society's religion, also occurred in both periods, but it was more of a cultural integration rather than a direct treatment imposed by the state.\n\nOption C, relegating barbarians to servile status, seems too broad and not uniformly applicable across both time periods.\n\nOption D, inviting barbarians to rule, was more exceptional and not a general treatment.\n\nTherefore, the treatment that was similar in both time periods is option B: barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
