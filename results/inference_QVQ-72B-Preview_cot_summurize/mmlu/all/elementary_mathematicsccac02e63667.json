                    "text": "So I have this set of numbers: 23, 13, 18, 29, 32, 25. And I need to find the median. From what I remember, the median is the middle value when they're all ordered from least to greatest. Since there are six numbers, an even amount, there should be two middle numbers, and then I think I have to take the average of those two numbers to get the median.\n\nFirst, I should order these numbers from smallest to largest. Let's see: 13 is the smallest, then 18, then 23, then 25, then 29, and finally 32. So the ordered list is: 13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32.\n\nNow, since there are six numbers, the positions of the middle numbers are the 3rd and 4th numbers in the ordered list. So that's 23 and 25.\n\nTo find the median, I need to find the average of these two middle numbers. So I'll add 23 and 25 and then divide by 2.\n\n23 plus 25 is 48, and 48 divided by 2 is 24.\n\nSo, the median should be 24.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. I ordered the numbers correctly: 13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32. For an even set, the median is indeed the average of the two middle numbers. And 23 and 25 are the third and fourth numbers in the ordered list. Their average is indeed 24.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be B. 24.\n\nWait a minute, let's see if there's any other way to approach this. Maybe I can think about the definition again. The median is supposed to be the middle value, so in a set with an even number of observations, it's the arithmetic mean of the two central numbers. Yeah, that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for finding the position of the median in an ordered list. For n observations, the median is at position (n+1)/2 if n is odd, or at positions n/2 and n/2 +1 if n is even, and then you average those two values.\n\nIn this case, n=6, which is even. So, the positions are 6/2 = 3 and 3+1 = 4. Which are 23 and 25, and their average is 24.\n\nEverything seems consistent. I don't think I made a mistake here.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other method or perspective that might lead to a different conclusion, but I can't think of any. The straightforward way is to order the data and take the average of the two middle values, which is what I did.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 24} \\]"
