So, in the short run, if aggregate demand decreases, what happens to GDP and the price level?\n\nFirst, in the short run, if AD decreases, I think GDP would decrease because less is being demanded at every price level. But wait, at full employment, the AS curve is vertical, so changes in AD shouldn't affect GDP in the long run. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about this again. In the short run, with flexible wages and prices, a decrease in AD would lead to a decrease in both GDP and the price level. So, short-run GDP falls, and short-run price level falls.\n\nNow, in the long run, since the economy is at full employment, the long-run AS curve is vertical. So, in the long run, a decrease in AD should only affect the price level, not GDP. So, long-run GDP should stay the same, and long-run price level should fall.\n\nWait, but option A says short-run GDP falls, short-run price level falls, long-run GDP no change, and long-run price level falls. That seems consistent with what I just thought.\n\nOption B says both short-run and long-run GDP and price level fall. But if the AS curve is vertical in the long run, GDP shouldn't change in the long run. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption C says short-run GDP no change, short-run price level falls, long-run GDP no change, and long-run price level no change. But in the short run, if AD decreases, GDP should decrease, not stay the same.\n\nOption D says short-run GDP falls, short-run price level falls, long-run GDP no change, and long-run price level no change. So, this is similar to option A, except option A has long-run price level falling, while option D has it staying the same.\n\nI think I need to recall the long-run effects of a decrease in AD. In the long run, with flexible wages and prices, if AD decreases, the price level should adjust downward, but since the LRAS is vertical, GDP should remain at its full employment level.\n\nSo, short-run: GDP falls, price level falls.\n\nLong-run: GDP returns to full employment (no change), and price level falls.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct.\n\nWait, but option D says long-run price level no change. If in the long run, with flexible wages and prices, and LRAS is vertical, and AD decreases, shouldn't the price level adjust downward to bring the economy back to full employment?\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in the long run, the price level would fall, and GDP would return to its full employment level.\n\nSo, option A is correct: short-run GDP falls, short-run price level falls, long-run GDP no change, and long-run price level falls.\n\nOption D says long-run price level no change, which I think is incorrect because the price level should adjust downward in the long run to restore equilibrium at full employment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
