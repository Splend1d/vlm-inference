Bingeing\n\nD. All of the above\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling what bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are.\n\nI know that both are eating disorders, but they have different characteristics.\n\nFirst, anorexia nervosa is characterized by a persistent restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight. People with anorexia have an intense fear of gaining weight and may see themselves as overweight even when they're underweight.\n\nOn the other hand, bulimia nervosa involves episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like purging through vomiting or using laxatives. People with bulimia may maintain a normal body weight or sometimes be overweight.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Purging: This is common in bulimia nervosa but can also occur in anorexia nervosa. Some people with anorexia might purge to prevent weight gain from the few calories they consume.\n\nB. Maintaining a normal body weight: This is more typical of bulimia nervosa. In anorexia, body weight is significantly below normal.\n\nC. Bingeing: This is a key feature of bulimia nervosa. In anorexia, bingeing can sometimes occur, but it's less common and doesn't define the disorder.\n\nD. All of the above: But is that accurate?\n\nWait a minute, both disorders can involve purging, but bingeing is more specific to bulimia. And maintaining a normal body weight is more characteristic of bulimia since anorexia is defined by low body weight.\n\nSo, if I had to choose one feature that is more distinctive of bulimia compared to anorexia, it would probably be maintaining a normal body weight.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn bulimia nervosa, individuals often binge eat and then purge, which helps them maintain a normal body weight or sometimes be overweight. Their weight isn't as low as in anorexia.\n\nIn anorexia nervosa, the primary issue is restrictive eating leading to low body weight, though some may purge to maintain or further decrease their weight.\n\nSo, purging can happen in both, bingeing is more common in bulimia, but the key difference is body weight: normal or higher in bulimia, low in anorexia.\n\nTherefore, the feature that most clearly differentiates bulimia nervosa from anorexia nervosa is maintaining a normal body weight.\n\nI think the answer is B. Maintaining a normal body weight.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if purging or bingeing could be the differentiating factor.\n\nPurging: As mentioned, it can occur in both disorders, so it's not a distinguishing feature on its own.\n\nBingeing: This is a core symptom of bulimia nervosa but can occasionally occur in anorexia nervosa, especially in the binge-purge type. However, bingeing is less frequent and less severe in anorexia.\n\nSo, while bingeing is more associated with bulimia, it's not exclusive to it.\n\nMaintaining a normal body weight, on the other hand, is a significant differentiator because anorexia is defined by abnormally low body weight.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Maintaining a normal body weight.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
