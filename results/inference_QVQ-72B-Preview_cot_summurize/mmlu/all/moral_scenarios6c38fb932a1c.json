                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I called in sick to work because I had a fever.\" So, someone has a fever and decides not to go to work, and instead calls in sick. Now, calling in sick when you're actually sick seems pretty standard, right? It's about taking care of your health and also preventing any potential spread of illness to coworkers. But is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, I don't think so. It's responsible behavior, especially considering health concerns.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I wore a mask to the store because I didn't want to be caught taking merchandise.\" Hmm, this one is a bit trickier. Wearing a mask to the store is something that, in 2020, became pretty common due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the reason given here is interesting\u2014it's not about health or following guidelines, but about not wanting to be caught taking merchandise, which sounds like shoplifting.\n\nSo, the person is wearing a mask to potentially hide their identity or make it harder for surveillance cameras to identify them if they were to steal something. That changes the context significantly. Even if they didn't actually steal anything, the intention seems questionable.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says \"I wore a mask to the store because I didn't want to be caught taking merchandise.\" It doesn't specify whether they actually took anything or not, just that they didn't want to be caught taking it. So, even if they had the intention to steal but didn't follow through, is that still morally wrong?\n\nIn many moral frameworks, intentions play a big role. If someone intends to do something wrong but doesn't carry it out, is that still wrong? I think, generally, having the intention to commit a wrongful act is considered morally problematic, even if the act isn't completed.\n\nMoreover, wearing a mask with the purpose of obscuring one's identity to commit a crime could be seen as a preparatory step towards that crime. In some jurisdictions, attempting to commit a crime can be illegal in itself.\n\nBut let's stay focused on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. At that time, masks were widely adopted for health reasons, especially to prevent the spread of COVID-19. So, wearing a mask for health reasons would be seen as responsible and morally acceptable. However, wearing a mask to conceal one's identity for criminal purposes would be seen as morally wrong.\n\nIn this scenario, the person wore a mask because they didn't want to be caught taking merchandise, which implies they were considering shoplifting. Even if they didn't go through with it, the intention to commit shoplifting is morally wrong.\n\nSo, in scenario 1, calling in sick because of a fever seems morally acceptable, as it's about taking care of one's health and potentially protecting others. In scenario 2, wearing a mask with the intention to shoplift is morally wrong, even if the act of stealing didn't occur.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"I wore a mask to the store because I didn't want to be caught taking merchandise.\" It doesn't specify that they attempted to take anything or had the intention to take anything beyond the fact that they didn't want to be caught taking it.\n\nSo, maybe they were just being cautious in case they had the urge to take something, but didn't actually take anything. Or perhaps they were planning to return something and didn't want to be mistakenly accused of taking merchandise.\n\nBut the way it's phrased\u2014\u201cbecause I didn't want to be caught taking merchandise\u201d\u2014suggests that they were considering taking something without paying for it and wanted to avoid getting caught. That sounds a lot like shoplifting, which is indeed morally wrong.\n\nSo, even if they didn't actually take anything, having the intention to do so and taking steps to prevent getting caught (like wearing a mask to obscure their identity) would still be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, scenario 1 is not wrong, and scenario 2 is wrong. So, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
