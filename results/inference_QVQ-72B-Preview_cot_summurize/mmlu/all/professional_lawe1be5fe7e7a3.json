                    "text": "So I've got this contract dispute between a builder and a homeowner. They agreed in writing that the builder would construct a small greenhouse on the homeowner's property for $20,000, and the payment was supposed to be made once the job was done. But things went wrong before the greenhouse was finished.\n\nLet me try to understand what happened step by step.\n\nFirst, the builder started working and spent $9,000 on framing the greenhouse. Then, they bought some materials for $1,000 that weren't yet used in the construction. So, in total, the builder has spent $10,000 up to that point ($9,000 + $1,000).\n\nBut then, the homeowner told the builder to stop work, and this was wrongfully done, meaning the homeowner breached the contract.\n\nAfter that, the builder resold the unused materials for $1,000 to another contractor. So, they got back that $1,000 they had spent on the unused materials.\n\nAt the time the work was stopped, it would have cost the builder an additional $5,000 to complete the project. That means, if they had finished the greenhouse, the total cost would have been $15,000 ($9,000 + $1,000 + $5,000), and they would have been paid $20,000, so their profit would have been $5,000 ($20,000 - $15,000).\n\nAlso, the partially built greenhouse increased the value of the homeowner's property by $3,000.\n\nNow, the builder is suing the homeowner. I need to figure out how much the builder is likely to recover in this lawsuit.\n\nI know that in contract breaches, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages that put them in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed. This is called expectation damage.\n\nSo, the builder expected to make a profit of $5,000 if the job was completed and paid for. But since the homeowner breached the contract, the builder is entitled to that expected profit.\n\nHowever, there are other factors to consider.\n\nFirst, the builder has already spent $10,000 on the project, but they resold the unused materials for $1,000, which might offset some of their costs.\n\nAlso, the partially completed greenhouse added $3,000 to the homeowner's property value, which might be relevant.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nIf the contract price is $20,000, and the cost to complete would have been $15,000, then the profit is $5,000, as I said.\n\nBut the homeowner breached the contract, so the builder didn't get to finish the job and earn that profit.\n\nTherefore, the builder should be compensated for the profit they lost, which is $5,000.\n\nAdditionally, the builder has already spent $10,000 on the project, and they resold the unused materials for $1,000, so their net expenditure is $9,000 ($10,000 - $1,000).\n\nSo, the builder has $9,000 in actual expenses that aren't recovered yet.\n\nBut wait, if the contract was for $20,000 and they only did part of the work, maybe they should get a prorated amount for the work they did complete.\n\nHowever, since the homeowner has already benefited from the partial work, which increased the property value by $3,000, perhaps that should be considered as part of the payment.\n\nWait, no. The contract was for the entire greenhouse for $20,000, and only part of it is done. So, the builder is entitled to the cost they've incurred plus their expected profit, minus any benefits the homeowner gained.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the builder can claim the cost they've incurred plus their expected profit, less any amounts they saved by reselling the materials.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. $3,000, the increase in the value of the homeowner's property.\n\nBut that seems too low. The builder spent $10,000 and expected to make $5,000 profit. So, $3,000 doesn't cover their costs or their expected profit.\n\nB. $10,000, the total cost expended by the builder at the time of the breach.\n\nBut this doesn't account for the expected profit or the resale of the unused materials.\n\nC. $14,000, which is the total cost expended by the builder ($10,000) plus the builder's expected profit ($5,000), minus the loss avoided by the resale of the unused materials ($1,000).\n\nThis seems reasonable. The builder spent $10,000, expected to make $5,000 profit, and saved $1,000 by reselling the materials. So, $10,000 + $5,000 - $1,000 = $14,000.\n\nBut wait, does the $1,000 resale reduce the damages? I think it does because it's a mitigation of damages. The builder tried to minimize their loss by selling the unused materials.\n\nSo, $14,000 seems like a fair amount.\n\nBut let's consider option D: $15,000, which is the contract price ($20,000) minus the costs saved by the breach ($5,000).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The contract price is $20,000, and the costs saved by the breach are $5,000, but what does that mean?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"costs saved by the breach\" refers to the $5,000 that the builder would have spent to complete the project but didn't have to because of the breach.\n\nSo, if the builder would have spent $15,000 in total and was paid $20,000, profit $5,000.\n\nBut they only spent $10,000 and didn't get to finish, so they should be compensated for their actual expenditure plus their expected profit, less any mitigation.\n\nSo, $10,000 (expenditure) + $5,000 (expected profit) - $1,000 (resale) = $14,000.\n\nOption C seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the builder spent $10,000 and would have spent another $5,000 to complete the job, totaling $15,000, and was to be paid $20,000, their profit would be $5,000.\n\nBut because the homeowner breached the contract, the builder didn't get to finish the job and earn that profit.\n\nTherefore, the builder should be compensated for their actual expenditure ($10,000) plus their expected profit ($5,000), totaling $15,000.\n\nHowever, the builder mitigated their damages by reselling the unused materials for $1,000, so that amount should be subtracted from the total damages.\n\nThus, $15,000 - $1,000 = $14,000.\n\nWait, but option D says $15,000, which is the contract price minus the costs saved by the breach.\n\nThe costs saved by the breach are the $5,000 that the builder would have spent to complete the project but didn't have to because of the breach.\n\nSo, $20,000 (contract price) - $5,000 (costs saved) = $15,000.\n\nBut this doesn't account for the builder's actual expenditure and expected profit.\n\nI think option D is incorrect because it doesn't consider the builder's actual costs and expected profit.\n\nOption C seems more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the builder is entitled to the value added to the property ($3,000) plus their actual expenditure ($10,000), totaling $13,000, but that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, no. The value added to the property is $3,000, but the builder's actual expenditure is $10,000, and they expected to make $5,000 profit.\n\nBut since the homeowner has already benefited from the $3,000 increase in property value, maybe that should be considered in the damages.\n\nBut typically, in construction contracts, the measure of damages is the cost to complete the work minus the contract price, but in this case, the work was stopped before completion.\n\nI need to recall the legal principles here.\n\nIn cases where the contractor has partially performed but is wrongfully prevented from completing the work, the damages typically include:\n\n1. The cost of the work performed plus\n\n2. The profit that would have been made on the entire contract minus\n\n3. Any avoidable costs or mitigation, such as the resale of unused materials.\n\nSo, in this case, it would be:\n\nCost of work performed: $10,000\n\nExpected profit: $5,000\n\nLess mitigation (resale of materials): $1,000\n\nTotal damages: $14,000\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, the measure of damages is the contract price minus the cost savings due to the breach.\n\nBut in this case, the contract price is $20,000, and the cost savings are $5,000, so $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000, which is option D.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't account for the builder's actual expenditure and expected profit properly.\n\nI think the correct approach is to consider the builder's actual expenditure plus their expected profit minus any mitigation.\n\nSo, $10,000 + $5,000 - $1,000 = $14,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $14,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
