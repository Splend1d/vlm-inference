The options are:\n\nA. 3 < 5\n\nB. 5 > 3\n\nC. -5 > -3\n\nD. -3 > -5\n\nAlright, let's go through these one by one.\n\nFirst, option A: 3 < 5. That means 3 is less than 5. Yeah, that's correct because 3 is smaller than 5.\n\nNext, option B: 5 > 3. This means 5 is greater than 3. That's also correct because 5 is bigger than 3.\n\nNow, option C: -5 > -3. This suggests that -5 is greater than -3. Hmm, I need to be careful here. When dealing with negative numbers, the larger the absolute value, the smaller the number. So, -5 is actually smaller than -3 because 5 is larger than 3, but since both numbers are negative, -5 is less than -3. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nLastly, option D: -3 > -5. This means -3 is greater than -5. Following the same logic as above, since both numbers are negative, and 3 is less than 5, -3 is larger than -5. So, this statement is true.\n\nSo, the false statement is option C: -5 > -3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nI know that on a number line, numbers increase as you move to the right. So, negative numbers are on the left side, and they increase as you move towards zero. So, -5 is to the left of -3, which means -5 is smaller than -3. So, -5 > -3 is incorrect because actually, -3 > -5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, the false statement is indeed option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider all options again:\n\nA. 3 < 5 - True\n\nB. 5 > 3 - True\n\nC. -5 > -3 - False\n\nD. -3 > -5 - True\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
