                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal conundrum. So, two years ago, a developer sold a lot to a woman via a warranty deed. She bought an owner's policy of title insurance before closing. But here's the catch: the title insurance company messed up and didn't list a county tax lien on the property as an exception to the insurance coverage. Last year, the woman sold the lot to a friend for a cheap price using a quitclaim deed. The friend paid cash, didn't check the title, and didn't get title insurance. Now, the county is trying to foreclose on the tax lien, and the friend is trying to get the woman's title insurance company to pay for the lien amount. The question is, does the title insurance company have to pay the friend's claim?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a title insurance policy covers. An owner's policy of title insurance protects the buyer against losses due to defects in the title that weren't discovered during the title search. In this case, the title insurance company failed to list a county tax lien as an exception, which means that the lien shouldn't affect the woman's ownership, at least in theory.\n\nBut then the woman sells the property to her friend via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property but doesn't guarantee that the title is clear. So, the friend takes the property \"as is,\" without any warranty from the woman about the title's validity.\n\nNow, the county is foreclosing on the tax lien. A tax lien is a claim against the property for unpaid taxes. If the lien is foreclosed, it could mean that the property might be sold to satisfy the debt, which would be bad news for the friend.\n\nThe friend is making a claim against the woman's title insurance policy, asking for reimbursement of the tax lien amount. The question is whether the title insurance company is obligated to pay this claim.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. The title insurance policy was issued to the woman, not to the friend. Typically, title insurance protects the insured, which is the woman in this case, and not subsequent owners unless there's some endorsement that says otherwise.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something about the transfer of the property that affects the coverage.\n\nB. No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.\n\nI don't think title insurance policies expire. They are usually in force as long as the insured has an interest in the property. But since the woman conveyed the property to the friend, her interest may have changed. However, generally, title insurance protects the insured against defects that existed at the time of issuance, regardless of whether the property is sold later.\n\nC. Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.\n\nThis seems compelling. If the title insurance company failed to list the tax lien as an exception, then in theory, the policy should cover it. But again, the policy was issued to the woman, not the friend.\n\nD. Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.\n\nThis option suggests that the woman might have breached her obligation to the friend by not disclosing the lien, and that the title insurance should cover any resulting loss to the friend.\n\nAlright, let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, the woman bought the property with title insurance. The title insurance company didn't list a tax lien as an exception, which means that the policy should cover claims related to that lien.\n\nHowever, the woman then sold the property to her friend via a quitclaim deed, which doesn't guarantee a clear title. So, the friend took the property with whatever liens or encumbrances were attached to it.\n\nNow, the county is foreclosing on the tax lien. The friend is out of pocket for the lien amount and is trying to recoup that from the woman's title insurance policy.\n\nBut the friend isn't the insured under that policy. The policy was issued to the woman. So, generally, the friend wouldn't have standing to make a claim under the woman's policy.\n\nOption A seems plausible: no, because the friend isn't the named insured.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the friend could sue the woman for breach of some covenant related to the sale, and then the title insurance would cover the woman's liability to the friend.\n\nWait, but the sale was via a quitclaim deed, which typically doesn't include covenants of title. The woman didn't warranty that the title was clear; she just transferred whatever interest she had.\n\nSo, unless there was some separate agreement or warranty made by the woman to the friend, the friend might not have a strong case against the woman.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the title insurance company would be obligated to pay the friend's claim directly.\n\nOption B says the policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend. I don't think that's accurate. Title insurance typically doesn't expire and continues to protect the insured as long as they have an interest in the property.\n\nOption C says yes because the tax lien wasn't listed as an exception. But again, the policy was issued to the woman, not the friend.\n\nOption D suggests that the woman is liable to the friend for breach of a covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's loss.\n\nBut given that it was a quitclaim deed, which generally doesn't include such covenants, I'm not sure if that holds water.\n\nPerhaps the friend could argue that the woman misrepresented the state of the title or was negligent in not disclosing the lien, but that's a separate issue.\n\nIn any case, the direct claim against the title insurance policy by the friend seems unwarranted because the friend isn't the insured.\n\nSo, my best answer is Option A: no, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
