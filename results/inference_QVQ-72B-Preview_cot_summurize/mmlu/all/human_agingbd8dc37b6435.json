                    "text": "So I've got this question here about retirement income, and it's referring to something called the \"three-legged stool.\" I think I've heard of that before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. The question is asking which leg of the three-legged stool most retirees have. The options are A. Pension, B. Social Security, C. Savings, D. Assets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the three-legged stool represents. From what I recall, it's a metaphor used to describe the three main sources of income for retirees. The three legs are supposed to provide stability and support during retirement, much like a stool needs three legs to stand firmly.\n\nLet me list out the three legs as I understand them:\n\n1. Social Security: This is a government-funded program that provides income to retired workers. It's based on the contributions made throughout their working years.\n\n2. Pensions: These are employer-sponsored retirement plans that pay a fixed income to retirees. They are typically based on years of service and salary history.\n\n3. Personal savings and investments: This includes money that individuals have saved and invested on their own, such as in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, or other investment vehicles.\n\nSo, the three legs are Social Security, Pensions, and Personal savings.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these most retirees have. I need to think about this in terms of what the majority of retirees rely on for their income.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Pension\n\nPensions used to be a common part of retirement plans, especially in the public sector and some large corporations. However, in recent years, many employers have shifted from traditional defined-benefit pension plans to defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s, which are more aligned with personal savings. This means that not as many workers today have a traditional pension waiting for them in retirement.\n\nOption B: Social Security\n\nSocial Security is a federal insurance program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. It's funded through payroll taxes paid by employees and employers. Almost every worker in the United States is covered by Social Security, and it's often considered the foundation of retirement income for many Americans.\n\nOption C: Savings\n\nThis includes individual savings and investments that people set aside specifically for retirement. This could be through IRAs, 401(k)s, or other types of investment accounts. While many people do save for retirement, the amount can vary widely based on income, savings habits, and other factors.\n\nOption D: Assets\n\nAssets could include things like home equity, rental properties, or other investments that can provide income during retirement. Not everyone owns assets that can generate income, so this might not be a universal source of retirement income.\n\nGiven these considerations, I need to determine which of these legs most retirees have.\n\nLet me think about it statistically. According to various studies and reports, Social Security is the primary source of income for the majority of elderly Americans. In fact, the Social Security Administration reports that about 90% of individuals age 65 and older receive Social Security benefits.\n\nOn the other hand, pension coverage has been declining over the years. While still significant, especially in certain industries and for public sector employees, it's not as prevalent as it once was.\n\nPersonal savings vary widely. Some people are diligent about saving for retirement and have substantial nest eggs, while others may have limited savings due to various constraints like low income or high debt.\n\nAssets like home equity or investment properties are even less universal, as not everyone owns a home or has investments that can generate income.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, it seems that Social Security is the most widespread source of retirement income among retirees.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. I recall reading that in some cases, pensions can be a significant source of income, especially for those who worked for the government or in certain large corporations.\n\nBut overall, considering the entire retiree population, Social Security still remains the most common and often the largest source of income for retirees.\n\nAnother point to consider is that many retirees rely on a combination of these sources. However, the question is specifically asking which leg most retirees have, implying a single primary source.\n\nGiven that, and considering the reach and coverage of Social Security, I think the answer is B. Social Security.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider some examples.\n\nTake a hypothetical retiree who worked in the private sector all their life without any pension plan other than the mandatory Social Security contributions. They might have some personal savings and perhaps some assets, but their primary source of retirement income would be Social Security.\n\nAnother retiree who worked for the government might have a pension and Social Security, but even in this case, Social Security could still be a significant part of their income.\n\nSomeone who was self-employed might have only Social Security and their personal savings to rely on.\n\nAnd then there are retirees who have substantial personal savings and investments, but even they typically receive Social Security benefits.\n\nSo, across different scenarios, Social Security seems to be a consistent element.\n\nMoreover, not everyone qualifies for a pension, and not everyone has substantial personal savings or assets. But nearly everyone who has worked and paid into the system qualifies for Social Security benefits.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Social Security is the leg of the three-legged stool that most retirees have.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
