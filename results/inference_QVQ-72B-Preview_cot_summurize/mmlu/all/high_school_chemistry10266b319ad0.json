                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a 25 g sample of a liquid that's heated to 95 \u00b0C and then quickly transferred to an insulated container with 100 g of water at 26 \u00b0C. After mixing, the final temperature is 37 \u00b0C. We need to figure out which statement is correct based on this information.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some thermodynamics principles. Since the container is insulated, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings. So, the heat lost by the sample should equal the heat gained by the water. That's the law of conservation of energy, right?\n\nLet me write down the equations for the heat lost and gained.\n\nThe heat lost by the sample is:\n\nq_sample = m_sample * c_sample * (T_initial_sample - T_final)\n\nWhere:\n\n- m_sample = 25 g\n\n- c_sample is the specific heat capacity of the sample (which we don't know)\n\n- T_initial_sample = 95 \u00b0C\n\n- T_final = 37 \u00b0C\n\nSo,\n\nq_sample = 25 * c_sample * (95 - 37) = 25 * c_sample * 58\n\nSimilarly, the heat gained by the water is:\n\nq_water = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water)\n\nWhere:\n\n- m_water = 100 g\n\n- c_water = specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g\u00b0C)\n\n- T_initial_water = 26 \u00b0C\n\n- T_final = 37 \u00b0C\n\nSo,\n\nq_water = 100 * 4.18 * (37 - 26) = 100 * 4.18 * 11 = 418 * 11 = 4598 J\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy:\n\nq_sample = -q_water\n\nSo,\n\n25 * c_sample * 58 = 4598\n\nFrom this equation, I can solve for c_sample:\n\nc_sample = 4598 / (25 * 58) = 4598 / 1450 \u2248 3.17 J/g\u00b0C\n\nBut wait, I don't think I need to find the exact value of c_sample to answer the question. The problem is asking to identify which statement is correct based on the temperature changes and the heat energies involved.\n\nLet's look at option A:\n\nA. The sample lost more heat energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\n\nHmm, the sample temperature changed from 95 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C, which is a change of 58 \u00b0C, and the water changed from 26 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C, which is 11 \u00b0C. So, yes, the sample temperature changed more.\n\nBut does that mean the sample lost more heat energy? Not necessarily, because heat energy depends on both the mass and the specific heat capacity of the substance.\n\nWait, according to the law of conservation of energy, in a closed system, the heat lost by one should equal the heat gained by the other. So, actually, the heat lost by the sample should equal the heat gained by the water.\n\nBut in option A, it says the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained. That can't be right, because in an insulated container, the total heat should be conserved.\n\nSo, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B:\n\nB. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average starting temperature.\n\nAverage T = (95 + 26) / 2 = 111 / 2 = 55.5 \u00b0C\n\nThe final temperature is 37 \u00b0C, which is less than 55.5 \u00b0C.\n\nBut what does this have to do with an equilibrium constant?\n\nI'm confused here. In chemistry, an equilibrium constant relates to reversible reactions and the concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium. But this problem is about thermal equilibrium, not a chemical equilibrium.\n\nMaybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the \"equilibrium constant\" mentioned in option B refers to the ratio of the final temperature to the average starting temperature or something similar.\n\nBut given that this is a physics problem about heat transfer, talking about an equilibrium constant seems out of place. Maybe there's a typo or mis phrasing in the option.\n\nIn any case, since the problem is about heat transfer and temperature changes, option B doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nOption C:\n\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\n\nWait, heat capacity is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a substance by one degree Celsius. Specific heat capacity is per unit mass.\n\nBut in this case, we have masses and temperature changes.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nThe heat lost by the sample is q_sample = m_sample * c_sample * \u0394T_sample\n\nSimilarly, q_water = m_water * c_water * \u0394T_water\n\nGiven that \u0394T_sample = 58 \u00b0C and \u0394T_water = 11 \u00b0C, and m_sample = 25 g, m_water = 100 g.\n\nOption C says that because the sample temperature changed more, its heat capacity must be greater than that of water.\n\nBut heat capacity depends on both the mass and the specific heat capacity.\n\nLet's see:\n\nq_sample = 25 * c_sample * 58\n\nq_water = 100 * 4.18 * 11\n\nAnd q_sample = -q_water (conservation of energy)\n\nSo, 25 * c_sample * 58 = -100 * 4.18 * 11\n\nThus, c_sample = -(100 * 4.18 * 11) / (25 * 58)\n\nBut since we're dealing with magnitudes, the negative sign isn't necessary.\n\nSo, c_sample = (100 * 4.18 * 11) / (25 * 58) \u2248 (418 * 11) / (25 * 58) = 4598 / 1450 \u2248 3.17 J/g\u00b0C\n\nComparing to water's specific heat capacity, which is 4.18 J/g\u00b0C, c_sample is less than that of water.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect because it claims the sample's heat capacity is greater than water's, but our calculation shows the opposite.\n\nOption D:\n\nD. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy.\n\nThis seems to align with the law of conservation of energy. In an insulated system, the heat lost by one substance must equal the heat gained by the other, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings.\n\nGiven that, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nWe calculated q_sample = 25 * c_sample * 58\n\nAnd q_water = 100 * 4.18 * 11\n\nAnd set q_sample = -q_water\n\nSo, yes, the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water, not more.\n\n- Option B is irrelevant because it mentions an equilibrium constant, which doesn't apply to this scenario.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because the sample's specific heat capacity is less than that of water.\n\n- Option D correctly states that the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
