                    "text": "So I've got this question here about ethical guidelines, and it's asking which option is most likely a violation. There are four scenarios, and I need to pick the one that's ethically problematic. Let me think through each one carefully.\n\nOption A is about a brochure with client testimonials mailed to potential attendees at a conference for adult children of alcoholics. Hmm, client testimonials can be tricky because confidentiality is really important in therapy. If clients are giving their approval for their testimonials to be used, that might be okay, but there could be issues with anonymity and privacy. Still, it's a mailed brochure, which seems pretty standard for marketing purposes in a professional setting.\n\nOption B mentions an advertisement offering a free initial therapy session published in a campus newspaper just before final exams. Colleges are often places where mental health services are advertised, especially during stressful times like exams. This seems like a standard ad, and offering a free session could be a way to introduce students to mental health resources. I don't see an immediate ethical violation here.\n\nOption C talks about uninvited in-person solicitations for therapy to hurricane victims who have lost their homes. This sounds a bit invasive. These people are likely in a state of shock and distress, and approaching them directly without an invitation could be seen as taking advantage of their vulnerability. It feels like bad timing and could be perceived as predatory. That seems ethically questionable.\n\nOption D is about a display ad for psychotherapy services in the yellow pages of the local telephone directory. This is a common way for professionals to advertise their services. It's straightforward and doesn't seem to target a specific vulnerable group in a way that's unethical.\n\nComparing all these options, Option C stands out as the most likely ethical violation. Approaching hurricane victims who have lost their homes without an invitation and soliciting them for therapy seems insensitive and potentially exploitative. It's important to respect people's privacy, especially during times of crisis and grief.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
