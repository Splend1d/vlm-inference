I think it was something like \"Mini-Me\" or \"Little Me.\" Wait, no, I think it was \"Mini-Me.\" Yeah, that sounds familiar. He was this small, evil version of Dr. Evil, like a miniature him. I remember that he was played by Verne Troyer, who also played Griphook in the Harry Potter movies. He was quite small, only like a meter tall or something. Anyway, in the movie, Dr. Evil created this clone of himself, but smaller, and he called him Mini-Me. I think that's the right name. Let me just double-check. Maybe I'm confusing it with another character. No, I'm pretty sure it's Mini-Me. So, the answer should be B. Mini-Me. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think it was called Little Buddy or Small Fry. And definitely not Dr Evil Jr, because that would imply a son, not a clone. So, B. Mini-Me is the correct answer."
