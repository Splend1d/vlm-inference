                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this tort law scenario. There's a husband and wife shopping in a department store, and the wife, who weighs over 300 pounds, sees a dress she likes but can't find her size. She asks a clerk if they have it in her size, and the clerk responds in a really insulting way, comparing her to a hippopotamus and saying they don't carry the dress in \"hippo size.\" Another customer hears this and laughs, and the wife gets really upset and leaves the store.\n\nNow, the wife wants to bring a tort action against the department store based on the clerk's actions. The question is asking whether she will win or lose, and gives four options:\n\nA. Win, because the statement was overheard by another customer.\n\nB. Win, because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nC. Lose, because the clerk was merely stating an opinion.\n\nD. Lose, because the wife only suffered hurt feelings.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to recall what constitutes a tort in this context. Tort law deals with civil wrongs that harm someone, and one common type is intentional infliction of emotional distress. That seems relevant here because the clerk's actions were intentional and caused the wife emotional distress.\n\nOption A says she wins because the statement was overheard by another customer. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Just because someone else heard the insult doesn't necessarily make it a actionable tort. Maybe it adds to the embarrassment, but it's not the primary issue here.\n\nOption B says she wins because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous. This sounds like it's referring to the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, which requires that the defendant's conduct be extreme and outrageous. I need to think about whether calling someone a hippopotamus in a store qualifies as extreme and outrageous behavior.\n\nOption C says she loses because the clerk was merely stating an opinion. But is this just an opinion? It seems more like a direct insult and a discriminatory remark based on her size. Opinions are usually subjective statements, whereas this is a derogatory comparison.\n\nOption D says she loses because she only suffered hurt feelings. But in tort law, emotional distress can be a valid basis for a claim, especially if it's severe enough. So, maybe that's not accurate.\n\nLet me think about the elements required for a successful claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Generally, there are four elements:\n\n1. The defendant's conduct must be extreme and outrageous.\n\n2. The conduct must be intentional or reckless.\n\n3. It must cause severe emotional distress.\n\n4. The emotional distress must be directly caused by the defendant's conduct.\n\nIn this case, the clerk's statement seems intentionally insulting and could be considered extreme and outrageous, especially in a public setting like a department store. The wife became very upset and left the store, which suggests she was severely distressed by the comment.\n\nMoreover, the clerk's statement was directed specifically at her, and it was based on her appearance, which could also touch on issues of discrimination or harassment.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that another customer overheard the comment and laughed. While this might add to the wife's embarrassment, it's not clear how this affects her tort claim directly. Maybe it could be relevant in showing that the clerk's behavior was publicly humiliating, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that the fact that another customer overheard the comment is the reason she wins, but that doesn't seem right. The harm is primarily to the wife, not to her reputation in front of others, although being embarrassed in public could be a significant part of the emotional distress.\n\nOption C says she loses because it's just an opinion. But as I thought earlier, this doesn't seem like a typical opinion; it's a direct insult. In tort law, insults can be actionable if they cause severe emotional distress and meet the other criteria.\n\nOption D says she loses because she only suffered hurt feelings. But emotional distress can be a valid basis for a tort claim, especially if it's severe. So, that doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption B seems the most accurate. The clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous, which aligns with the requirements for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other torts that could apply here. For example, defamation, but that's about false statements that harm someone's reputation. In this case, the clerk's statement was an insult, not necessarily a false statement about a fact. So, defamation might not apply.\n\nWhat about invasion of privacy? Well, that usually involves intrusion into someone's private affairs or public disclosure of private facts. In this scenario, the clerk's comment was made in a public setting, but it was directed at the wife. It might not fit neatly into invasion of privacy.\n\nPerhaps the closest fit is intentional infliction of emotional distress, which seems to align with the facts presented.\n\nLet me consider if there's any case law that might be relevant here. I recall a case called \"Restatement (Second) of Torts\" section 46, which outlines the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress. It defines extreme and outrageous conduct as conduct that goes beyond all possible bounds of decency and is regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\n\nIn this scenario, calling someone a hippopotamus in a public setting could be considered beyond the bounds of decency, especially since it's based on physical appearance and delivered in a demeaning manner.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that another customer overheard the comment and laughed might not directly impact the tort claim, but it could be relevant in showing the public nature of the insult and the extent of the wife's embarrassment.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that the wife would have a strong case under the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, and therefore, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any defenses the department store could raise. One possible defense is that the clerk was acting within the scope of their employment, and therefore, the store might be vicariously liable for the clerk's actions. However, employers are generally liable for the actions of their employees if those actions are within the scope of their employment.\n\nIn this case, the clerk was likely acting in their capacity as an employee when they made the comment, so the store could be held liable.\n\nAnother defense might be that the conduct was not extreme and outrageous, but given the nature of the insult and the public setting, that seems unlikely to hold up.\n\nAlso, the store might argue that the wife's emotional distress was not severe enough, but the fact that she became very upset and left the store suggests that it was substantial.\n\nOverall, it appears that the wife would win based on the clerk's extreme and outrageous conduct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
