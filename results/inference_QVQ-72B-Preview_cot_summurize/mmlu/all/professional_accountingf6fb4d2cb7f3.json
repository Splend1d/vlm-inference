                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Darv Co. has a current ratio of 3-to-1 and a quick ratio of 1-to-1, and their current liabilities are $322,000. I need to find the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what these ratios mean. The current ratio is a measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term debts with its short-term assets. It's calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. So, if the current ratio is 3-to-1, that means current assets are three times current liabilities.\n\nGiven that current liabilities are $322,000, I can find the current assets by multiplying by 3.\n\nCurrent Assets = Current Ratio \u00d7 Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets = 3 \u00d7 $322,000\n\nCurrent Assets = $966,000\n\nOkay, so current assets are $966,000.\n\nNext, there's the quick ratio, which is 1-to-1. The quick ratio, also known as the acid-test ratio, is a more stringent measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. It excludes less liquid assets like inventory and prepaid expenses from current assets.\n\nThe quick ratio is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities\n\nSo, Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities\n\nGiven that the quick ratio is 1-to-1, this means:\n\n(Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities = 1\n\nI can plug in the values I have:\n\n($966,000 - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / $322,000 = 1\n\nNow, I need to solve for Inventory + Prepaid Expenses.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n$966,000 - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses = $322,000\n\nNow, subtract $322,000 from both sides to solve for Inventory + Prepaid Expenses:\n\n$966,000 - $322,000 = Inventory + Prepaid Expenses\n\n$644,000 = Inventory + Prepaid Expenses\n\nSo, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $322,000\n\nB. $644,000\n\nC. $966,000\n\nD. $1,288,000\n\nIt seems like the answer should be B. $644,000.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with current assets:\n\nCurrent Ratio = 3-to-1\n\nCurrent Liabilities = $322,000\n\nCurrent Assets = 3 \u00d7 $322,000 = $966,000\n\nQuick Ratio = 1-to-1\n\nQuick Ratio formula: (Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities = 1\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n($966,000 - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / $322,000 = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by $322,000:\n\n$966,000 - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses = $322,000\n\nNow, subtract $966,000 from both sides:\n\n- Inventory - Prepaid Expenses = $322,000 - $966,000\n\nWait a second, that doesn't make sense. I must have messed up the subtraction.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\n$966,000 - $322,000 = Inventory + Prepaid Expenses\n\n$966,000 - $322,000 = $644,000\n\nSo, Inventory + Prepaid Expenses = $644,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently to verify.\n\nCurrent Assets = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable + Inventory + Prepaid Expenses\n\nQuick Assets = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable\n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 1\n\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities = 3\n\nSo, Quick Assets = Current Liabilities = $322,000\n\nCurrent Assets = 3 \u00d7 $322,000 = $966,000\n\nTherefore, Inventory + Prepaid Expenses = Current Assets - Quick Assets = $966,000 - $322,000 = $644,000\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. $644,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that \"current assets\" include other items that I haven't considered? For example, fixed assets or long-term investments? No, by definition, current assets are assets that can be converted into cash within one year, and typically include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses.\n\nSo, I don't think there's any reason to include anything else in current assets for this problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the quick ratio excludes only inventory or also prepaid expenses. Sometimes, the quick ratio is defined differently depending on the context. For example, sometimes it's defined as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities, excluding only inventory, or sometimes as (Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses).\n\nIn standard accounting practices, the quick ratio excludes inventory and sometimes other less liquid current assets, like prepaid expenses.\n\nGiven that, I think it's safe to assume that in this problem, the quick ratio excludes inventory and prepaid expenses.\n\nTherefore, my calculation stands, and the answer is B. $644,000.\n\nI don't see any error in this reasoning, so I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
