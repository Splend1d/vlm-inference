                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I refilled the drink for the lady that had come over for dinner.\" So, someone came over for dinner, and I refilled their drink. Hmm, refilling a drink seems pretty harmless, right? Like, if someone's drink is empty, it's considerate to refill it, especially if they're a guest. But wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the lady didn't want her drink refilled, or maybe there was something in the drink that shouldn't be refilled. But the scenario doesn't specify any of that. It just says I refilled the drink for the lady who came over for dinner.\n\nThinking about it, in most dinner settings, refilling a guest's drink is a hospitable act. It shows that you're attentive to their needs and want them to feel comfortable. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like a nice thing to do, not something wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I squirted a lemon into the customer's eye.\" Okay, this one sounds a lot more problematic. Squirting a lemon into someone's eye is aggressive and harmful. Lemons are acidic, and getting acid in someone's eye can cause serious injury, like pain, inflammation, or even vision damage. It's also an intentional act; you don't accidentally squirt a lemon into someone's eye. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's context missing. Maybe the customer was being difficult or something, but even then, responding with harm is not justified. In any case, without additional context, squiring a lemon into someone's eye appears to be a deliberate act of harm, which is against ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, the first one seems morally acceptable, while the second one is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in the first scenario. Refilling a drink\u2014 is there any way that could be considered wrong? Well, perhaps if the lady didn't want her drink refilled, or if there was a reason not to do so, like if she was driving or something. But the scenario doesn't provide any information to suggest that refilling the drink was inappropriate. So, based on the information given, it's not wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario, squiring a lemon into someone's eye is definitely wrong, regardless of the context. It's a harmful action, and harming others without justification is against moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
