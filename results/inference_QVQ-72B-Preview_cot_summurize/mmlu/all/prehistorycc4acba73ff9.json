                    "text": "So I've got this question here about ancient migrations in the Arctic. It's asking which culture used hide boats and spread across the Arctic, from Alaska to Greenland, starting about 700 years ago. This is supposed to be part of a third wave of migration from the Old World into the New World. The options are Paleo-Eskimos, Dorset, Thule, and Clovis.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these terms refers to. I know that the Eskimo-Aleut peoples, or Inuit as they're often called, have a long history in the Arctic regions. The Paleo-Eskimos sound like one of the earlier groups, maybe the first to migrate into the Arctic. But the question mentions a third wave, so there must have been at least two earlier migrations.\n\nLet me think about the timeline. If we start with the first humans crossing from Asia to North America, that was probably around 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, give or take. These would be the Paleo-Indians, but that's not one of the options here. So, the Paleo-Eskimos must have come after that, but I'm not sure exactly when.\n\nThen there's the Dorset culture. I recall that the Dorset people were present in the Arctic, particularly in what is now Canada and Greenland, from around 500 BCE to about 1500 CE. They were known for their sophisticated tools and adaptations to the harsh Arctic environment. But again, I need to place them in the sequence of migrations.\n\nThe Thule culture is another option. I've heard of the Thule people being prominent in the Arctic, especially known for their whaling and seafaring abilities. They are often credited with developing the umiak, which is a type of skin-covered boat, and the kayak, which is also a small, covered boat made from animal skins. This sounds promising because the question mentions hide boats.\n\nClovis is the last option, and I believe Clovis refers to a culture that was present in North America around 13,000 years ago, known for their distinctive projectile points. While Clovis is part of the early human history in the Americas, it doesn't seem directly related to the Arctic or the use of hide boats.\n\nSo, eliminating Clovis as not fitting the description, I'm left with Paleo-Eskimos, Dorset, and Thule. Now, I need to figure out which of these cultures spread across the Arctic from Alaska to Greenland beginning about 700 years ago.\n\nLet me consider the Thule culture first. I remember that the Thule people were highly adept at maritime activities, using umiaks and kayaks for hunting and transportation. They had a significant impact on the Arctic region and are considered ancestors of the modern Inuit people. Their culture flourished from around 1000 CE onward, which would place their expansion around the time frame mentioned in the question.\n\nThe Dorset culture, on the other hand, was present from around 500 BCE to 1500 CE. That overlaps somewhat with the Thule expansion, but the Dorset people were more terrestrial in their adaptations, focusing on hunting and tool-making suited to land-based activities rather than maritime endeavors.\n\nAs for the Paleo-Eskimos, they were earlier still, with some estimates placing their presence from around 2500 BCE to 800 CE. They were among the first groups to inhabit the Arctic regions after the last ice age, developing technologies like the harpoon and other tools for hunting marine mammals.\n\nGiven the time frame of about 700 years ago, which would be around 1300 CE, the Thule culture seems the most fitting choice. The Thule people were known for their seafaring capabilities and use of hide boats, which aligns with the description in the question. Moreover, their expansion across the Arctic, from Alaska to Greenland, occurred during this period.\n\nTo double-check, I can look up some references to confirm the timing and characteristics of each culture.\n\nFirst, Paleo-Eskimos:\n\n- Lived from about 2500 BCE to 800 CE\n\n- Known for early hunting technologies adapted to Arctic conditions\n\n- Not primarily associated with hide boats or large-scale maritime activities\n\nNext, Dorset culture:\n\n- Thrived from around 500 BCE to 1500 CE\n\n- Focused on terrestrial hunting and tool-making\n\n- While they may have used some watercraft, they weren't known for extensive seafaring or hide boats in the same way as the Thule\n\nThen, Thule culture:\n\n- Emerged around 1000 CE\n\n- Known for their advanced maritime skills, including the use of umiaks and kayaks made from animal skins (hide boats)\n\n- Their culture spread across the Arctic, including to Greenland, where they coexisted and eventually assimilated with the Norse settlers\n\nFinally, Clovis culture:\n\n- Present in North America around 13,000 years ago (11,500 BCE)\n\n- Known for distinctive stone tools\n\n- Not directly related to the Arctic region or the time frame in question\n\nBased on this information, the Thule culture is the most appropriate choice for the description provided in the question.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there are any other cultures that might fit the description. For instance, the Norse Vikings reached Greenland and even established short-lived settlements in North America around the same time frame. However, the Vikings were not using hide boats; their vessels were wooden ships like longships and knarrs.\n\nMoreover, the question specifies a \"third wave\" of migration from the Old World into the New World. The Thule expansion is often considered a significant migration wave in Arctic prehistory, following the Paleo-Eskimos and the Dorset people.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Thule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
