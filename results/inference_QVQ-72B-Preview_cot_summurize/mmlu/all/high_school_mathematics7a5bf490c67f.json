                    "text": "So I've got this quadratic equation here: \\(2x^{2} + 5x + 12 = 19 - 7x\\). The problem says there are two solutions, and I need to find the positive difference between them. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to get the equation into standard quadratic form. That means everything on one side, usually set equal to zero. So, I'll move all the terms to the left side:\n\n\\(2x^{2} + 5x + 12 - 19 + 7x = 0\\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\(2x^{2} + 12x - 7 = 0\\)\n\nAlright, now it's in the form \\(ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 12\\), and \\(c = -7\\).\n\nI know that for a quadratic equation, the solutions can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nBut before I jump into that, maybe I should check if this quadratic factors nicely. Let's see if I can factor this.\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to \\(a \\times c = 2 \\times (-7) = -14\\) and add up to \\(b = 12\\). Hmm, let's think: two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to 12.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n1 and -14: sum is -13\n\n2 and -7: sum is -5\n\n7 and -2: sum is 5\n\n14 and -1: sum is 13\n\nNone of these add up to 12. Maybe this quadratic doesn't factor nicely, or I'm missing something. Maybe I should just use the quadratic formula instead.\n\nAlright, plugging into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{12^{2} - 4 \\times 2 \\times (-7)}}{2 \\times 2}\\]\n\nLet's compute the discriminant first:\n\n\\[d = b^{2} - 4ac = 12^{2} - 4 \\times 2 \\times (-7) = 144 - (-56) = 144 + 56 = 200\\]\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{200}}{4}\\]\n\nSimplify \\(\\sqrt{200}\\):\n\n\\[\\sqrt{200} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 2} = 10\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-12 \\pm 10\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\]\n\nSimplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-6 \\pm 5\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the two solutions are:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-6 + 5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-6 - 5\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the positive difference between these two solutions. Let's subtract the second from the first:\n\n\\[\\left( \\frac{-6 + 5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{-6 - 5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{-6 + 5\\sqrt{2} + 6 + 5\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSo, the positive difference between the two solutions is \\(5\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\nC. \\(5\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\nD. 5\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option C. \\(5\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the original equation:\n\n\\(2x^{2} + 5x + 12 = 19 - 7x\\)\n\nMoving all terms to the left:\n\n\\(2x^{2} + 5x + 12 - 19 + 7x = 0\\)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\(2x^{2} + 12x - 7 = 0\\)\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - (-56)}}{4} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{200}}{4} = \\frac{-12 \\pm 10\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 5\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\nDifference between solutions:\n\n\\[\\frac{-6 + 5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{-6 - 5\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSeems correct. So, the answer is indeed \\(5\\sqrt{2}\\), which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
