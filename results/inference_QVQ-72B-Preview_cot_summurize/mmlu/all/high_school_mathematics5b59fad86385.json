                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that a point in space (x, y, z) is randomly selected such that -1 \u2264 x \u2264 1, -1 \u2264 y \u2264 1, and -1 \u2264 z \u2264 1. And I need to find the probability that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 1. The options are a bunch of fractions involving \u03c0, like \u03c0/24, \u03c0/12, \u03c0/6, and \u03c0/3.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the regions defined by these inequalities. The point (x, y, z) is selected from the region where each coordinate is between -1 and 1. That sounds like a cube. Yeah, it's a cube centered at the origin with sides of length 2, since x, y, and z each go from -1 to 1.\n\nSo, the total volume from which the point can be selected is the volume of this cube. The side length is 2, so the volume should be 2\u00b3 = 8.\n\nNow, the condition x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 1 defines another region. This looks like the equation of a sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin. The equation for a sphere is (x - a)\u00b2 + (y - b)\u00b2 + (z - c)\u00b2 = r\u00b2, where (a, b, c) is the center. In this case, a = b = c = 0, and r = 1, so it's x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 1.\n\nI need to find the probability that a randomly selected point from the cube lies inside this sphere. Probability is generally defined as the favorable outcomes over the total possible outcomes. Here, the favorable outcomes are the points inside the sphere, and the total possible outcomes are the points inside the cube.\n\nSo, the probability should be the volume of the sphere divided by the volume of the cube.\n\nI know the volume of the cube is 8. The volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Here, r = 1, so volume of the sphere is (4/3)\u03c0(1)\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be (4/3)\u03c0 / 8 = (4/3)\u03c0 * (1/8) = (4/24)\u03c0 = (1/6)\u03c0.\n\nLooking back at the options, \u03c0/6 is one of them. So, it seems like the answer is \u03c0/6.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The cube goes from -1 to 1 in each direction, centered at the origin, so the sphere is entirely contained within the cube. There are no parts of the sphere outside the cube, right? Yeah, because the sphere has a radius of 1, and the cube goes out to 1 in each direction.\n\nAlso, the volume calculations seem correct: cube volume is 2\u00b3 = 8, and sphere volume is (4/3)\u03c0.\n\nSo, probability is indeed (4/3)\u03c0 / 8 = \u03c0/6.\n\nAlright, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{6}} \\]"
