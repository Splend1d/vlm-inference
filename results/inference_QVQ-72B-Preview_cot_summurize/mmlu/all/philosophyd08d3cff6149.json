                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Brandt's version of utilitarianism. The options are:\n\nA. The consequences of particular acts.\n\nB. The actual and recognized rules of society.\n\nC. Ideal rules.\n\nD. Whether or not one's maxim can be universalized.\n\nAnd the question is, which of these does Brandt defend as making rightness a function of?\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Brandt is. I think Richard Brandt was a philosopher who worked on ethical theory, particularly on rule utilitarianism. So, utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests actions are right if they promote the greatest amount of utility, usually understood as happiness or well-being, for the greatest number of people.\n\nNow, there are different types of utilitarianism. The two main kinds are act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism.\n\nAct utilitarianism says that each particular act is right if it produces the best possible consequences. So, for each individual action, you consider what the outcomes would be and choose the one that maximizes utility.\n\nRule utilitarianism, on the other hand, suggests that we should follow rules that, if generally adopted, would produce the best overall consequences. So, instead of evaluating each act separately, you have general rules that guide your behavior, and these rules are justified because following them leads to the best outcomes overall.\n\nGiven that, I think Brandt was a proponent of rule utilitarianism. So, he would argue that rightness is based on rules that, if followed by everyone, would maximize utility.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The consequences of particular acts \u2013 this sounds more like act utilitarianism.\n\nB. The actual and recognized rules of society \u2013 this seems more about existing social norms, not necessarily about ideal rules that maximize utility.\n\nC. Ideal rules \u2013 this could be interpreted as rules that are ideal in the sense that following them would lead to the best possible outcomes, which aligns with rule utilitarianism.\n\nD. Whether or not one's maxim can be universalized \u2013 this sounds more like Kant's categorical imperative, which is a deontological ethical theory, not utilitarianism.\n\nSo, option D seems unlikely because that's more associated with Kantian ethics, not utilitarianism.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, I think C. Ideal rules, is the most accurate because Brandt's rule utilitarianism emphasizes following rules that, if universally adopted, would produce the best outcomes. These rules are \"ideal\" in the sense that they are optimal for maximizing utility when followed by everyone.\n\nOption A is more about the consequences of particular acts, which is act utilitarianism, and while utilitarianism overall focuses on consequences, Brandt's specific view is that it's about following the best rules, not evaluating each act individually.\n\nOption B refers to the actual rules of society, but Brandt's theory is not about following current social rules; it's about following ideal rules that would lead to the best possible outcomes if everyone followed them.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Ideal rules.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more.\n\nIn rule utilitarianism, the rightness of an action is determined by whether it conforms to a rule that, if generalized, would produce the maximum amount of good. So, it's not about the particular act's consequences, but about whether the act adheres to a rule that, if followed by everyone, would lead to the best overall outcomes.\n\nSo, in this sense, \"ideal rules\" would be those rules that, if followed by everyone, would maximize utility. Therefore, acting rightly means following these ideal rules.\n\nOption A is about particular acts' consequences, which is more aligned with act utilitarianism, not rule utilitarianism.\n\nOption B is about the actual and recognized rules of society, which could be related to ethical theories like social contract theory or perhaps even cultural relativism, but not specifically to Brandt's rule utilitarianism.\n\nOption D is clearly Kantian, as it refers to universalizing one's maxim, which is a key concept in Kant's ethics.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I'm confident that C. Ideal rules is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
