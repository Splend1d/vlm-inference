                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the energy involved in forming a solution, and it's broken down into three steps. I need to figure out which step is exothermic and which is endothermic. Exothermic means energy is released, right? Like when something burns or reacts and gives off heat. Endothermic is the opposite; it means energy is absorbed from the surroundings, like when you dissolve sugar in water and it cools down a bit.\n\nSo, step 1 is about separating solvent molecules to make space for the solute. I think separating molecules requires energy because you're fighting against the intermolecular forces between them. So, that should be endothermic because you're putting energy in to pull the solvent molecules apart.\n\nStep 2 is separating solute molecules so they can fit into the spaces in the solvent. Again, separating molecules should need energy because you're breaking the bonds or interactions between them. So, this should also be endothermic.\n\nStep 3 is bringing the separated solute and solvent together, filling in the spaces. I think this should release energy because when molecules come together and form new interactions, energy is usually given off. So, this should be exothermic.\n\nWait, does that mean steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic? That sounds like option B.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it. Is there any chance that step 3 could be endothermic? No, I don't think so. When you bring molecules together, they form bonds or interactions, which releases energy.\n\nOption A says steps 1 and 2 are exothermic and step 3 is endothermic. But based on my reasoning, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says all three steps are exothermic, which contradicts my understanding that separating molecules should be endothermic.\n\nOption D says all three steps are endothermic, which also doesn't align with my reasoning that step 3 should be exothermic.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B: steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the process again. In step 1, the solvent molecules are separated to make space for the solute. This involves overcoming the intermolecular forces between solvent molecules, which is endothermic.\n\nIn step 2, the solute molecules are separated to fit into the solvent spaces. Similarly, this requires overcoming intermolecular forces in the solute, making it endothermic as well.\n\nIn step 3, the separated solute and solvent molecules come together and form new interactions, which should release energy, making it exothermic.\n\nYes, this seems consistent. So, the answer should be B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
