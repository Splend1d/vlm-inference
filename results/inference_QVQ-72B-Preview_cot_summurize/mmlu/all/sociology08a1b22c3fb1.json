                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Frank's view from 1967 on 'underdeveloped' societies. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that correctly represents his claim. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nOption A says these societies are insufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy. Option B suggests they're reluctant to give up their traditional ways of life. Option C states they're economically dependent on wealthy countries that exploit them. And Option D says they're the 'metropoles' to which 'satellite' countries are attached.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall who Frank is. I think Immanuel Wallerstein is a famous figure in world systems theory, but I'm not sure if that's the right Frank. Wait, no, Immanuel Wallerstein is known for the World Systems Theory, which divides the world into core, periphery, and semi-periphery countries. But the name Frank rings a bell; maybe it's Andre Gunder Frank?\n\nLet me assume it's Andre Gunder Frank, who was known for his dependency theory. He argued that underdeveloped countries were not failing to develop because of internal factors like culture or tradition, but rather because of their position in the global economy, particularly their dependence on more developed countries.\n\nGiven that, Option A says they're insufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy. But if Frank was a dependency theorist, he would likely argue that they're too involved in the capitalist economy, but in a way that's exploitative and detrimental to their development.\n\nOption B says they're reluctant to surrender their traditional ways of life. That sounds a bit like cultural resistance or something, but Frank's focus was more on economic structures and less on cultural reluctance.\n\nOption C says they're economically dependent on wealthy countries that exploit them. This sounds a lot like dependency theory, which Frank was associated with. He argued that the global economy was structured in such a way that peripheral countries were dependent on core countries, and this dependency perpetuated underdevelopment.\n\nOption D says they're the 'metropoles' to which 'satellite' countries are attached. Metropole usually refers to the core countries, like imperial powers, and the satellite countries are the periphery. So, underdeveloped countries would be the satellites, not the metropoles.\n\nGiven this, Option D doesn't seem right because it suggests that underdeveloped countries are the metropoles, which contradicts common understanding.\n\nSo, between Options A, B, and C, C seems the most accurate based on Frank's theories. He emphasized the economic dependency and exploitation by core countries.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me think about it differently. If I were to summarize Frank's view, it would be that underdeveloped countries are trapped in a relationship where they provide raw materials to developed countries and receive finished goods in return, often at terms that are unfavorable and keep them poor.\n\nThis sounds a lot like Option C: economically dependent on wealthy countries that exploit them.\n\nOption A suggests they're not involved enough in the capitalist economy, but Frank would likely argue the opposite\u2014they're too involved, but in a way that harms their development.\n\nOption B seems unrelated to his main arguments, as he focused more on economic structures than cultural resistance.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider another perspective. Maybe there's a different Frank who wrote about underdevelopment in 1967? I recall that Andre Gunder Frank wrote \"Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America\" in 1967, which aligns with the dependency theory perspective.\n\nIn that work, Frank argued that underdevelopment was a direct result of the capitalist system and the integration of these countries into the world economy on terms set by the developed countries. So, again, this points towards Option C.\n\nOption A, insufficient involvement, doesn't align with Frank's views, because he saw underdevelopment as a result of too much involvement, but in a exploitative relationship.\n\nOption B, reluctance to surrender traditional ways of life, doesn't fit with his economic focus.\n\nOption D, being the metropoles, is incorrect because metropoles are the core countries, not the periphery.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that the correct answer is Option C: economically dependent on wealthy countries that exploit them.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
