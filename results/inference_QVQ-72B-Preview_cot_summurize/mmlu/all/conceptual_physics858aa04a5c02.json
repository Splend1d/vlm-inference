                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a 10-\u03a9 resistor carries 10 A, and I need to find the voltage across the resistor. The options are A. 0, B. more than 0 but less than 10 V, C. 10 V, D. more than 10 V.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling Ohm's law, which relates voltage, current, and resistance. Ohm's law states that the voltage (V) across a resistor is equal to the current (I) flowing through the resistor multiplied by its resistance (R). So, mathematically, V = I \u00d7 R.\n\nGiven that, I have a 10-\u03a9 resistor and a current of 10 A. Plugging these into the formula, V = 10 A \u00d7 10 \u03a9 = 100 V.\n\nWait a minute, that would be 100 volts, which isn't one of the options directly. But option C says 10 V, which seems way off from my calculation. Did I do something wrong?\n\nLet me double-check. Ohm's law is V = I \u00d7 R, right? Yes, that seems correct. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nIs the question trying to trick me by giving an incomplete statement? Let's read it again: \"A 10-\u03a9 resistor carries 10 A. The voltage across the resistor is...\"\n\nNo, it seems straightforward. No mentions of multiple resistors or anything like that. So, perhaps the confusion is in interpreting the options.\n\nOption A is 0. That can't be right because if there's a current flowing through a resistor, there should be a voltage drop across it, unless it's a superconductor, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption B says more than 0 but less than 10 V. That also doesn't match my calculation of 100 V.\n\nOption C is 10 V, which is way below what I calculated.\n\nOption D is more than 10 V. Well, 100 V is definitely more than 10 V, but I need to see if there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe the units are being played with. The resistor is 10 \u03a9, and the current is 10 A. V = I \u00d7 R = 10 A \u00d7 10 \u03a9 = 100 V. That seems consistent.\n\nPerhaps the confusion is in the way the options are phrased. Maybe there's a misinterpretation of the question.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other formula that could be applied here. Power, maybe? Power (P) is V \u00d7 I, and also P = I\u00b2 \u00d7 R. But the question is specifically about voltage, so maybe not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a consideration of direction or something, but in DC circuits, resistance is a scalar quantity, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the resistor isn't the only component, or perhaps there's a series connection implied, but the question doesn't specify that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is trying to say that the resistor is part of a larger circuit, but it doesn't specify that. It just says \"a 10-\u03a9 resistor carries 10 A.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a misinterpretation of the current value. Is the current 10 A or 10 mA? Sometimes, people confuse milliamperes (mA) with amperes (A).\n\nIf the current were 10 mA, then V = 10 mA \u00d7 10 \u03a9 = 0.1 V, which is more than 0 but less than 10 V, which would be option B. But the problem clearly states 10 A, not 10 mA.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the options, and option C should be 100 V instead of 10 V. But since that's not the case, I have to go with what's given.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation of V = 10 A \u00d7 10 \u03a9 = 100 V, which is more than 10 V, I would choose option D: more than 10 V.\n\nBut wait, 100 V is indeed more than 10 V, but is there a possibility that the voltage is even higher? No, because with R = 10 \u03a9 and I = 10 A, V = 100 V is the exact value.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: more than 10 V.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
