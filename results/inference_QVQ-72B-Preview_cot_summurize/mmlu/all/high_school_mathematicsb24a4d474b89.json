                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Morgan and her friends on a social networking site. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nMorgan has 60 female friends and 50 male friends. That means she has a total of 60 + 50 = 110 friends. Out of these, some live in town and some live out of town. I need to find out how many out-of-town friends she has.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many female friends live in town. The problem says that 30% of her female friends live in town. So, 30% of 60 female friends would be 0.30 * 60 = 18 female friends in town.\n\nSimilarly, for male friends, 40% live in town. So, 40% of 50 male friends is 0.40 * 50 = 20 male friends in town.\n\nNow, the total number of friends in town would be the sum of female and male friends in town, which is 18 + 20 = 38 friends in town.\n\nSince the total number of friends is 110, the out-of-town friends would be the total friends minus the friends in town. So, 110 - 38 = 72 out-of-town friends.\n\nWait a minute, there's something about social groups here. She belongs to 5 social groups, but I'm not sure if that's relevant to the number of friends. Maybe it's just additional information.\n\nLooking back at the question, it says: \"She has 60 female friends and 50 male friends and belongs to 5 social groups. If 30% of her female friends live in town and 40% of her male friends live in town, how many out-of-town friends does she have on the social networking site?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify that the social groups affect the number of friends or their locations, so probably, the number of social groups is extraneous information.\n\nSo, my calculation is 72 out-of-town friends.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 38\n\nB. 72\n\nC. 110\n\nD. 360\n\nSo, option B. 72 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nTotal friends: 60 female + 50 male = 110 friends.\n\nFriends in town: 18 female + 20 male = 38 friends.\n\nOut-of-town friends: 110 - 38 = 72.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nI think the answer is B. 72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
