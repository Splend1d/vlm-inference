                    "text": "So I have this question about Tay-Sachs disease. It says that Tay-Sachs disease is caused by the deficiency of an enzyme, and I need to pick the correct one from four options: Alpha-L-iduronidase, Glucose-6-phosphatase, Hexosaminidase A, or Homogentisic acid oxidase. I need to remember which enzyme is associated with Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Tay-Sachs disease is. I know that it's a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, especially in infants. It's a type of lysosomal storage disease, which means that there's an enzyme deficiency that leads to the buildup of certain substances in the cells, causing damage over time.\n\nNow, I need to think about which enzyme is responsible for breaking down GM2 ganglioside, because I believe that's the substance that accumulates in Tay-Sachs disease. If the enzyme that breaks it down is deficient, GM2 ganglioside starts to build up in the lysosomes, particularly in the nerve cells, leading to their degeneration.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Alpha-L-iduronidase: I think this enzyme is involved in breaking down mucopolysaccharides. Deficiency of this enzyme causes Hunter syndrome, which is another lysosomal storage disease but not Tay-Sachs.\n\nB. Glucose-6-phosphatase: This enzyme is important in glucose metabolism, especially in the liver and kidneys. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to glycogen storage disease type 1, not Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nC. Hexosaminidase A: This sounds familiar in relation to Tay-Sachs disease. I think hexosaminidase A is the enzyme that breaks down GM2 ganglioside. So, if this enzyme is deficient, GM2 ganglioside accumulates, leading to Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nD. Homogentisic acid oxidase: This enzyme is part of the pathway that breaks down amino acids, specifically phenylalanine and tyrosine. Deficiency of this enzyme causes alkaptonuria, which is characterized by the accumulation of homogentisic acid and can lead to arthritis and darkening of connective tissues, but not Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be C. Hexosaminidase A.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my knowledge. Tay-Sachs disease is indeed caused by a deficiency in hexosaminidase A, which leads to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the lysosomes of nerve cells. This accumulation causes progressive neurological deterioration, which is consistent with the symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nThe other options:\n\n- Alpha-L-iduronidase is involved in Hunter syndrome.\n\n- Glucose-6-phosphatase is related to glycogen storage disease type 1.\n\n- Homogentisic acid oxidase is associated with alkaptonuria.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Hexosaminidase A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
