                    "text": "Is there a mistake in this question? The first statement seems off. If the sum of the absolute values diverges, but the sum of a_i equals 2, and there's a rearrangement that sums to 4. But I thought if a series converges absolutely, then any rearrangement converges to the same value. But here, it's saying the sum of a_i is 2, but the sum of absolute values diverges, which would mean the series is conditionally convergent. So, for conditionally convergent series, rearrangements can sum to different values. So, maybe it's possible to have a rearrangement sum to 4 if the original sum is 2.\n\nWait, but I need to think carefully. If \u2211|a_i| diverges and \u2211a_i = 2, then the series is conditionally convergent. In that case, rearrangements can sum to any real number, including 4. So, the first statement should be true.\n\nNow, for the second statement: There exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f: X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \"closed and bounded.\"\n\nHmm, in metric spaces, if X is compact, which closed and bounded implies in some spaces like R^n, and f is continuous, then f(X) should be compact too, which means closed and bounded. So, I think this statement is false. But I need to think about it more carefully.\n\nLet me recall: In Euclidean spaces like R^n, closed and bounded sets are compact by the Heine-Borel theorem. And continuous functions map compact sets to compact sets. So, if X is closed and bounded in R^n, and Y is another Euclidean space, then f(X) should also be closed and bounded.\n\nBut maybe in more general metric spaces, this isn't always true. Maybe there are metric spaces where closed and bounded doesn't imply compactness.\n\nWait, yes, in general metric spaces, closed and bounded does not necessarily imply compactness. So, perhaps there are counterexamples where X is closed and bounded but not compact, and then f(X) isn't closed and bounded.\n\nLet me try to find an example.\n\nConsider X = [0, 1] with the discrete metric. In the discrete metric, every subset is open and closed. So, X is closed. But in the discrete metric, the only compact sets are finite sets. So, X is not compact.\n\nNow, let Y be R with the usual metric. Define f: X \u2192 Y by f(x) = x for all x in X.\n\nThen f is continuous because in the discrete metric, all functions are continuous.\n\nNow, f(X) = [0, 1], which is closed and bounded in R. So, in this case, f(X) is closed and bounded.\n\nBut maybe I need a different example.\n\nAlternatively, consider X = {1/n : n \u2208 N} with the usual metric. This set is closed and bounded in R, but it's not compact because it's not complete (it doesn't contain its limit point 0).\n\nLet Y = R, and define f(x) = x for all x in X.\n\nThen f(X) = {1/n : n \u2208 N}, which is also closed and bounded in R.\n\nBut again, f(X) is closed and bounded.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to choose X in a different metric space.\n\nLet me consider X = [0, 1] with the usual metric, which is closed and bounded, hence compact. Let Y be any metric space, and f: X \u2192 Y continuous.\n\nSince X is compact and f is continuous, f(X) should be compact in Y, which implies f(X) is closed and bounded in Y, assuming that in Y, compact sets are closed and bounded.\n\nBut in general metric spaces, compact sets are closed and bounded, but the converse isn't always true.\n\nWait, in general metric spaces, closed and bounded doesn't imply compactness, but compact sets are always closed and bounded.\n\nSo, if X is compact and f is continuous, then f(X) is compact in Y, which means it's closed and bounded in Y.\n\nTherefore, in this case, f(X) is always closed and bounded.\n\nBut maybe there are metric spaces where closed and bounded doesn't imply compactness, and then f(X) isn't necessarily compact.\n\nWait, but if X is compact and f is continuous, then f(X) is compact, regardless of the metric space Y.\n\nSo, perhaps the second statement is false.\n\nLet me check: If X is closed and bounded, and in some metric spaces, closed and bounded implies compactness, then f(X) would be compact, hence closed and bounded in Y.\n\nBut if the metric space Y doesn't have the property that closed and bounded implies compactness, then even if f(X) is compact, Y might not consider it closed and bounded.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me recall that in metric spaces, compact sets are always closed and bounded, but the converse is not always true.\n\nHowever, if X is compact and f is continuous, then f(X) is compact in Y, which means it's closed and bounded in Y, provided that in Y, compact sets are considered closed and bounded.\n\nBut in some metric spaces, like complete metric spaces, closed and bounded might not imply compactness, but compact sets are always closed and bounded.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nPerhaps in general metric spaces, if X is compact and f is continuous, then f(X) is compact in Y, which should be closed and bounded in Y.\n\nTherefore, the second statement is false because if X is compact (which closed and bounded implies in some spaces, like R^n), then f(X) is compact and hence closed and bounded.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be True, False.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst statement: If \u2211|a_i| diverges and \u2211a_i = 2, then there exists a rearrangement with sum 4.\n\nThis is true because for conditionally convergent series, rearrangements can sum to any real number.\n\nSecond statement: There exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f: X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT closed and bounded.\n\nThis seems false because if X is compact (which closed and bounded implies in some spaces), and f is continuous, then f(X) is compact in Y, which should be closed and bounded in Y.\n\nTherefore, the answer is True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
