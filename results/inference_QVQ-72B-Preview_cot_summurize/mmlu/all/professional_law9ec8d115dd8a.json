                    "text": "Let's dive into this real estate law scenario. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, in 1996, a developer buys a 100-acre tract in a northern county and creates a subdivision plan with 100 one-acre residential lots. This plan is recorded in 1997. Over the next few years, the developer sells 60 of these lots to individual buyers. Each deed includes a covenant that says no house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision.\n\nThen, in 2003, the developer sells the remaining 40 lots to a builder, and this deed also includes the same covenant about mobile homes. The builder then sells all 40 lots by 2008, but interestingly, these deeds don't include the covenant about mobile homes; they just identify each lot as part of the subdivision.\n\nNow, in January 2009, one of the buyers who purchased from the builder puts a mobile home on their property. The question is asking which statement is the least accurate regarding the buyer's deed.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\n\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\n\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\n\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what a covenant running with the land means. Generally, a covenant runs with the land when it affects the use of the property and binds subsequent owners. For a covenant to run with the land, there usually needs to be privity of estate, meaning a direct conveyance from one party to another in the chain of title.\n\nBut in this case, the covenant was initially included in the deeds from the developer to the original 60 buyers and to the builder, but not in the deeds from the builder to the subsequent buyers.\n\nSo, for the builder, who bought from the developer, the covenant was in their deed, meaning it should bind them. But when the builder sells the lots without including the covenant, does that mean the covenant doesn't run with the land to the new buyers?\n\nI think that's what option A is suggesting: the covenant ran as far as the builder, but not to the buyer. So, perhaps the covenant is enforceable against the builder but not against the buyer who didn't receive the covenant in their deed.\n\nBut wait, covenants can sometimes run with the land beyond just privity of estate, especially if they're recorded and touch all lots in a subdivision.\n\nIn this scenario, the subdivision plan was recorded, and all lots are part of the same subdivision. The initial covenant was recorded with the county recorder's office, which might give it constructive notice to subsequent buyers.\n\nOption C says the buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes. Since the subdivision plan was recorded, and the original covenant was part of the developer's deeds, which were also recorded, a subsequent buyer should have checked the public records and found this covenant.\n\nBut the buyer's deed from the builder didn't include the covenant. Does that mean the buyer isn't bound by it, or does the recording of the original covenant affect all lots in the subdivision?\n\nI need to think about how covenants run with the land in a subdivision context.\n\nGenerally, when a developer creates a subdivision and imposes covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs), these can bind all lots in the subdivision, provided they are properly recorded and the covenants are intended to benefit the entire subdivision.\n\nIn this case, the original covenant was included in the deeds of the first 60 buyers and the builder, but not in the deeds of the buyers from the builder.\n\nHowever, if the covenant was part of the recorded subdivision plan or was otherwise recorded as part of the original deeds, it might still bind the subsequent buyers through the doctrine of constructive notice.\n\nOption C suggests the buyer had constructive notice, meaning that because the covenant was part of the public record, the buyer is presumed to know about it, even if it wasn't included in their specific deed.\n\nBut wait, the buyer's deed doesn't include the covenant. So, would the buyer still be bound by it?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a covenant is recorded and affects the property, subsequent buyers are bound by it, even if it's not included in their specific deed, as long as it was properly recorded and they had constructive notice.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is accurate, meaning the buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction.\n\nNow, option B says the covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\n\nGenerally, in a subdivision with recorded covenants, any lot owner can enforce the covenants against other lot owners, provided the covenants are valid and run with the land.\n\nGiven that the original covenant was recorded and affected all lots in the subdivision, it's likely that any lot owner could enforce it against any other lot owner.\n\nSo, option B seems accurate.\n\nOption D says all subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n\nPrivity of estate typically means a direct relationship in the chain of title, meaning that only those who received the property directly from the party who was bound by the covenant are bound by it.\n\nIn this case, the builder bought from the developer, who included the covenant in the deed to the builder. Then, the builder sold to buyers without including the covenant in their deeds.\n\nSo, the subsequent grantees of the builder (the buyers) are not in privity with the developer regarding the covenant, because they didn't receive the property directly from the developer.\n\nHowever, since the covenant was recorded, it might bind them through constructive notice, regardless of privity.\n\nSo, option D might be misleading because while privity of estate exists between the builder and the buyers, it doesn't necessarily mean that the covenant runs to the buyers via privity, since they didn't receive the covenant directly in their deeds.\n\nBut the key here is that the covenant was recorded, giving constructive notice to all subsequent buyers.\n\nWait, maybe option D is trying to say that all grantees of the builder are in privity with the builder, but not necessarily with the developer regarding the covenant.\n\nBut the question is about the buyer's deed, so perhaps it's referring to privity between the builder and the buyer.\n\nIn that case, since the builder sold to the buyer, there is privity between them, but the covenant wasn't passed on in the deed.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the recording acts. In most jurisdictions, when a deed or covenant is recorded, it provides constructive notice to subsequent buyers. So, even if the covenant isn't included in the subsequent deed, the recording of the original covenant should bind the subsequent buyers.\n\nIn this scenario, the original covenant was recorded in 1997 when the subdivision plan was recorded. So, any subsequent buyer, including those who bought from the builder, should have been aware of the covenant through the public records.\n\nTherefore, even though the covenant wasn't included in the buyer's deed from the builder, the buyer should still be bound by it due to constructive notice.\n\nGiven that, option C seems accurate: the buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction.\n\nOption A says the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer. But given that the covenant was recorded, it should bind the buyer through constructive notice.\n\nOption B says any subdivision lot owner can enforce the covenant, which seems accurate.\n\nOption D says all subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate. Well, privity of estate typically requires a direct conveyance, so the builder's grantees are in privity with the builder, but not necessarily with the developer regarding the covenant, since they didn't receive it directly.\n\nHowever, again, the recording of the covenant gives constructive notice, which might override the privity requirement.\n\nI think the key here is the recording of the covenant. It provides constructive notice to all subsequent buyers, regardless of whether the covenant was included in their specific deed.\n\nTherefore, the buyer should be bound by the covenant, despite it not being in their deed, because of the recording and constructive notice.\n\nGiven that, option C seems accurate, and options A and D might be misleading.\n\nBut the question is asking for the least accurate statement.\n\nLet me see if I can find which one is the least accurate.\n\nOption A says the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer. Well, if the covenant is enforceable against the buyer through constructive notice, then this statement might be inaccurate.\n\nOption B says any subdivision lot owner can enforce the covenant, which seems accurate.\n\nOption C says the buyer had constructive notice, which seems accurate.\n\nOption D says all subsequent grantees of the builder are in privity of estate. While this is technically true (the buyers are in privity with the builder), it might not directly relate to the enforceability of the covenant, given that the covenant was recorded and provides constructive notice.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is the least accurate because privity of estate between the builder and the buyer might not be the determining factor in whether the covenant binds the buyer, since the recording provides constructive notice to all buyers, regardless of privity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option A is the least accurate because it suggests that the covenant didn't run to the buyer, but in reality, due to constructive notice, it does run to the buyer.\n\nWait, but option A says \"the covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\" If the covenant is enforceable against the buyer through constructive notice, then this statement is inaccurate.\n\nOption B and C seem accurate, while option D might be a bit off because privity of estate between the builder and the buyer exists, but it's the recording that makes the covenant binding on the buyer, not necessarily privity.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overthinking this.\n\nLet me consider that in real estate law, covenants recorded with the property generally bind all subsequent buyers through constructive notice, regardless of whether the covenant is included in their specific deed.\n\nTherefore, the buyer should be bound by the covenant, despite it not being in their deed from the builder, because of the recording of the original covenant.\n\nGiven that, option A is suggesting that the covenant didn't run to the buyer, which is contrary to the principle of constructive notice.\n\nOption B is accurate because any lot owner can enforce the covenant.\n\nOption C is accurate because the recording provides constructive notice.\n\nOption D says all subsequent grantees of the builder are in privity of estate, which is technically true, but it might not be the primary factor in binding the buyer to the covenant, since the recording provides broader binding effect.\n\nTherefore, perhaps option D is the least accurate because it focuses on privity of estate, which, while existing between the builder and the buyer, isn't the mechanism through which the covenant binds the buyer in this scenario.\n\nInstead, it's the recording and constructive notice that bind the buyer to the covenant, even without privity to the original covenant.\n\nSo, maybe option D is the least accurate statement regarding the buyer's deed.\n\nAlternatively, option A directly contradicts the principle of constructive notice, stating that the covenant didn't run to the buyer, which is incorrect based on the recording.\n\nSo, between options A and D, option A is more directly contradictory to the legal principle of constructive notice, while option D is more about privity of estate, which is a separate concept.\n\nPerhaps option A is the least accurate because it directly asserts that the covenant doesn't run to the buyer, which, given the recording, it does.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the least accurate statement regarding the buyer's deed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
