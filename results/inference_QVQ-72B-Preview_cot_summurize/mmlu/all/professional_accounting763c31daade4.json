                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about how investments in employee benefit pension plans and trusts are reported in their financial statements. The options are fair value, historical cost, net realizable value, or lower of historical cost or market. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what kind of plan we're talking about. It's an employee benefit pension plan or trust. I think these are set up by employers to provide retirement benefits to their employees. So, these plans have investments that they manage to fund those future pension payments.\n\nNow, the question is about how these investments are reported in the financial statements of these plans. Specifically, at what value do they show these investments.\n\nOption A is fair value. I know that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In other words, it's what the investment is worth in the current market.\n\nOption B is historical cost. That's the original cost of the asset when it was acquired. So, if the plan bought stocks or bonds a few years ago, historical cost would be the purchase price at that time.\n\nOption C is net realizable value. I believe this is the estimated selling price of an asset minus any costs of completion and disposal. It's often used in inventory accounting, where you have to consider the cost to finish making a product and sell it.\n\nOption D is the lower of historical cost or market. This seems like a conservative approach, where you take the original cost and compare it to the current market value, and then choose whichever is lower to report in the financial statements.\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out which of these is the correct way to report plan investments in pension plans and trusts.\n\nLet me think about the general accounting principles for investments. In many cases, investments are reported at fair value. For example, in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, most financial assets are measured at fair value, especially those that are trading or available-for-sale securities.\n\nBut is that the case for pension plans and trusts?\n\nI recall that pension plans have their own set of accounting standards, particularly under the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) for public sector plans or the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for private sector plans.\n\nLet me consider private sector pension plans first. According to FASB, pension plan assets are generally measured at fair value. I think this is to provide a current measure of the assets' ability to generate future benefits.\n\nSimilarly, for public sector plans under GASB, I believe they also use fair value for measuring plan assets.\n\nBut I should double-check that. Maybe I should look up the relevant accounting standards for pension plans.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the purpose of the pension plan. The plan's primary function is to accumulate assets to pay out benefits to retirees. So, the value of these assets needs to be assessed in a way that reflects their current worth to meet future obligations.\n\nFair value seems logical because it provides a current market-based measure of the assets. Historical cost, on the other hand, doesn't reflect changes in the value of the assets over time, which could be significant, especially for long-term investments.\n\nNet realizable value is more relevant for inventory or other assets that are intended to be sold in the ordinary course of business, which may not directly apply to pension plan investments.\n\nThe lower of historical cost or market approach is a conservative method, ensuring that assets aren't overvalued, but it might understate the value of assets if their market value has increased.\n\nGiven that, it seems that fair value is the most appropriate measure for pension plan investments. It provides the most relevant and up-to-date information about the assets' worth.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should consider some examples.\n\nSuppose a pension plan purchased 100 shares of a stock at $50 per share a few years ago. If the current market price is $60 per share, reporting at historical cost would show $5,000, while fair value would show $6,000. Net realizable value might be similar to fair value minus any selling costs, but for publicly traded stocks, selling costs are minimal, so fair value is effectively net realizable value.\n\nIf we use the lower of historical cost or market, since the market value is higher than the historical cost, we'd still report $5,000, which seems unnecessary given that the assets are worth more now.\n\nSimilarly, if the market value had decreased to $40 per share, reporting at historical cost would show $5,000, fair value $4,000, and lower of cost or market would show $4,000.\n\nIn both scenarios, fair value seems to reflect the true economic position of the plan.\n\nMoreover, pension plan statements often include information about the funded status of the plan, which compares the present value of projected benefit obligations with the market value of plan assets. Using fair value for assets aligns well with this approach.\n\nI also recall that actuarial valuations of pension plans rely on the market value of assets to assess whether the plan is adequately funded.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that pension plans and trusts report their investments at fair value.\n\nTo wrap it up, based on my understanding of accounting principles and the nature of pension plans, the correct answer should be A. Fair value.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
