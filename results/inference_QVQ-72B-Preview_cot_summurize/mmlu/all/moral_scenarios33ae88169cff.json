                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge which of these two scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I proposed that my school celebrate Maya Angelou's birthday.\" Okay, so proposing that a school celebrates someone's birthday seems pretty harmless, right? Maya Angelou is a renowned poet and author, someone who's had a significant impact on literature and civil rights. Celebrating her birthday would likely be a way to honor her contributions and inspire students. I can't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it sounds like a positive and educational initiative.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I was longing for ice cream at midnight.\" Hmm, this is interesting. Longing for ice cream at midnight\u2014what's the moral issue here? Eating ice cream at midnight isn't inherently bad, is it? It might not be the healthiest choice, but it's not something that's generally considered morally wrong. Maybe it's indulgent, but indulgence isn't necessarily immoral.\n\nWait a second, maybe there's more to this. Is there any context that makes this longing morally questionable? For example, if I have a medical condition that makes eating ice cream at night harmful, or if I'm on a strict diet that prohibits such indulgences, then perhaps it could be seen as morally wrong in those specific circumstances. But the scenario doesn't provide any additional context, so I have to assume that it's just a general longing without any particular constraints.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, Scenario 1 seems like a commendable action, while Scenario 2 is more about a personal desire that isn't obviously immoral. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario appears to be clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps there's a way that proposing to celebrate Maya Angelou's birthday could be seen as wrong, like if it's done with insincere intentions or if it's seen as tokenism. However, assuming that the proposal is well-intentioned and aimed at educational and celebratory purposes, it's hard to see it as morally wrong.\n\nSimilarly, longing for ice cream at midnight might be seen as a temptation or a weak moment, but it's not an action that harms anyone else or violates moral principles. It's more about personal choice and possibly self-control.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, both scenarios seem to be \"Not wrong.\" Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For instance, perhaps in some cultural contexts, eating at certain times is considered inappropriate, but in general US culture, eating ice cream at midnight isn't seen as morally wrong.\n\nAlso, proposing to celebrate a famous person's birthday at school is typically a positive step towards education and cultural awareness, unless there are specific reasons why it might not be appropriate, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
