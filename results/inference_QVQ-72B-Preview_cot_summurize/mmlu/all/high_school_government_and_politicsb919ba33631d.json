                    "text": "So I have this question here about a Supreme Court decision that established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine for state-sponsored racial segregation. The options are Plessy v. Ferguson, McCulloch v. Maryland, Gibbons v. Ogden, and Brown v. Board of Education. I need to pick the one that established this doctrine.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the \"separate but equal\" doctrine is. From what I recall, it's a legal principle that allowed for racial segregation as long as the facilities provided for different races were equal in quality. So, the idea was that separate doesn't necessarily mean unequal, as long as they're equivalent.\n\nNow, I need to find out which Supreme Court case established this principle.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Plessy v. Ferguson. I think this is a significant case related to segregation. Let me remember the details. This case involved Homer Plessy, a man of mixed race who sat in a \"whites only\" railroad car in Louisiana in 1892. He was arrested for violating the state's segregation laws, and he challenged the law in court, arguing that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled against Plessy in 1896, upholding the constitutionality of segregated facilities if they were equal. Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote the majority opinion, introducing the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nNext, B. McCulloch v. Maryland. I remember this is a important case about federalism and the power of the federal government versus the states. It had to do with the Second Bank of the United States and whether states could tax it. The Supreme Court ruled in 1819 that the federal government had implied powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, and that states could not tax federal institutions.\n\nThis doesn't sound related to racial segregation or the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nC. Gibbons v. Ogden. I think this was a case about interstate commerce. It involved a dispute over steamboat navigation rights between New York and New Jersey. The Supreme Court ruled in 1824 that the regulation of interstate commerce was exclusively a federal power under the Commerce Clause.\n\nAgain, this seems unrelated to segregation or the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nLastly, D. Brown v. Board of Education. I know this is a landmark case that overturned segregation in public schools. It was decided in 1954, and the Supreme Court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This case effectively overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nSo, this can't be the answer because it's the case that ended segregation, not established it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Plessy v. Ferguson was indeed the case where the Supreme Court established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which provided the legal basis for racial segregation until it was overturned by Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nYes, that seems accurate. So, I'm confident that A. Plessy v. Ferguson is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
