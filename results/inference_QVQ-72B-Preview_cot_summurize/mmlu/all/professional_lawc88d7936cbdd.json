                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about estates and conditions. It says that a client has an estate that reads: \"To A on condition that if drugs are ever used on premises, B shall have the right to reenter and retake the premises.\" And the question is, what is NOT true about this kind of estate?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. It is a fee simple determinable, and title ends automatically if drugs are used.\n\nB. It is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which requires a reentry first before title can end.\n\nC. Estate does not revert automatically.\n\nD. Grantor must exercise the right of reentry.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the difference between a fee simple determinable and a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nFrom what I remember, a fee simple determinable is an estate that will automatically end upon the occurrence of a specified event. So, if the condition is violated, the estate reverts back to the grantor without any action needed from the grantor.\n\nOn the other hand, a fee simple subject to condition subsequent also has a condition, but in this case, the grantor has to take some action to end the estate if the condition is violated. Usually, that action is reentry or bringing a lawsuit to reclaim the property.\n\nLooking at the language in the estate, it says, \"on condition that if drugs are ever used on premises, B shall have the right to reenter and retake the premises.\"\n\nSo, it seems like there's a condition, and if that condition is violated, B has the right to reenter and retake the premises. That sounds like a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because it requires B to exercise their right to reenter and retake the property if drugs are used.\n\nIn a fee simple determinable, the estate would just end automatically without any action from B.\n\nSo, option A says it's a fee simple determinable and title ends automatically if drugs are used. But according to the language, it seems like B has to do something (reenter and retake) for the estate to end.\n\nWait, but sometimes, the language can be tricky. Maybe \"shall have the right to reenter and retake\" is just giving B the option, but the estate still ends automatically.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn a fee simple determinable, the estate ends automatically upon the happening of the condition. In a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the estate doesn't automatically end; instead, the grantor has the right to terminate it by taking some action, like reentry.\n\nGiven that, the language here seems to suggest that B has the right to reenter and retake, which implies that it's not automatic; B needs to take action.\n\nSo, option A might be incorrect because it says the title ends automatically, but according to the estate's terms, B has to reenter and retake.\n\nOption B says it's a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which requires a reentry first before title can end. That seems to align with the language in the estate.\n\nOption C says the estate does not revert automatically. That seems consistent with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because it doesn't revert unless B takes action.\n\nOption D says the grantor must exercise the right of reentry. That also seems consistent with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be incorrect because it characterizes the estate as a fee simple determinable with automatic termination, whereas the estate's language suggests that B has to take action (reenter and retake) for the estate to end.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the phrase \"shall have the right to reenter and retake\" is just giving B the power to do so, but the estate still ends automatically.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because if the estate ends automatically, why would B need to reenter and retake? It would already be theirs without any action.\n\nSo, I think the better interpretation is that it's a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, where B has to exercise the right of reentry to terminate A's estate.\n\nTherefore, option A is not true.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any other options could also be incorrect.\n\nOption C says the estate does not revert automatically. That seems correct for a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nOption D says the grantor must exercise the right of reentry, which also seems correct.\n\nSo, among these, option A is the one that doesn't align with the estate's terms.\n\nI think the answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
