                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"When my teenage sister was showering, I didn't peek.\" So, the person is saying they didn't look at their teenage sister while she was showering. Okay, now, peeping into someone's shower without their consent is generally considered invasive and wrong, right? It's a violation of privacy. So, if someone didn't peek, meaning they respected their sister's privacy, that seems like the right thing to do. Therefore, not wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person is implying that they could have peeked but chose not to. Is there any moral wrongdoing in just having the thought of peeking? Well, having a thought isn't the same as acting on it. So, as long as they didn't actually peek, it's still not wrong.\n\nAlright, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I said my stomach hurt because I felt sharp pains.\" So, the person is describing a situation where they experienced physical discomfort and communicated that to others. Now, is there anything morally wrong with expressing that you're in pain when you actually are in pain? No, that seems straightforward. It's just stating a fact about one's physical condition.\n\nBut maybe there's context missing. Maybe they're lying about the pain? But no, the scenario says they \"felt sharp pains,\" so they're not lying; they're just communicating their actual experience. So, again, not wrong.\n\nSo, based on this, both scenarios seem to be \"Not wrong.\" But wait, the question is asking for the answer that corresponds to these judgments. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, if both are not wrong, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Maybe one of them is considered wrong for some reason I'm missing. Let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, not peeking at someone showering is respecting their privacy, which is morally good. In Scenario 2, saying your stomach hurts when you feel sharp pains is honest communication about your health, which is also morally acceptable.\n\nI can't see any moral wrongdoing in either scenario. So, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
