The question is asking what it's called when the Supreme Court shows a willingness to change public policy and alter judicial precedent. The options are judicial activism, due process, judicial restraint, and ex post facto lawmaking. Hmm, let's see which one fits best.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of the Supreme Court's role.\n\nStarting with judicial activism: I've heard this term before. It's generally referred to when judges make decisions that might go beyond the strict letter of the law, often based on their own political or personal views. So, if the Supreme Court is willing to change public policy and alter judicial precedent, that sounds a lot like judicial activism. But let me make sure.\n\nDue process is another option. Due process is more about the fair treatment through the normal judicial system, especially as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. It's about ensuring that laws are applied fairly and that individuals get a fair trial. That doesn't seem directly related to changing public policy or altering judicial precedent.\n\nNext is judicial restraint. This seems like the opposite of judicial activism. Judicial restraint is when judges try to limit their own power and avoid making decisions based on their personal preferences, instead sticking closely to the text of the law and precedent. So, if the Court is engaging in changing public policy and altering precedent, that would be the opposite of judicial restraint.\n\nLastly, ex post facto lawmaking. This term refers to laws that apply retroactively, meaning they criminalize actions that were legal when done or impose heavier penalties than those in place at the time of the crime. The U.S. Constitution prohibits ex post facto laws. So, this doesn't seem relevant to the question about changing public policy and altering judicial precedent.\n\nGiven these definitions, it seems that judicial activism is the most fitting answer. Judicial activism involves judges making decisions that may change existing policies and precedents based on their interpretation, which can include a willingness to overturn previous decisions and shape new policies through their rulings.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider an example. Suppose the Supreme Court decides to overturn a previous ruling and establishes a new precedent that changes a aspect of public policy. This action would be seen as judicial activism because it's actively shaping the law beyond just interpreting it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Court were to adhere strictly to precedent and avoid making changes to public policy unless absolutely necessary, that would be judicial restraint.\n\nDue process is more about the procedures and fairness in the legal system, not about the Court's role in making or changing policy.\n\nEx post facto lawmaking is specifically about retroactive application of laws, which isn't directly related to the Court's approach to precedent and policy-making.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. judicial activism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ judicial activism}} \\]"
