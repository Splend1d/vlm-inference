The activation-synthesis theory is related to dreams, right? It's about how dreams are formed based on brain activity during sleep.\n\nOption A says that the brain counteracts a strong positive emotion by evoking a negative emotion. Hmm, that sounds more like some kind of emotional regulation mechanism, but I don't recall activation-synthesis theory being directly about emotional regulation in this way. Maybe it's not the right choice.\n\nOption B says that dreams result from the mind's attempt to make sense of random neural activity from the brainstem. That sounds familiar. I think the activation-synthesis theory proposes that dreams are the brain's way of interpreting and incorporating the random signals it receives during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. So, this seems relevant to the theory.\n\nOption C mentions that happiness depends on comparing one's present circumstances with one's past circumstances. While interesting, this seems more related to satisfaction or contentment rather than directly to the activation-synthesis theory, which is primarily about dreams.\n\nOption D suggests that particular facial expressions induce particular emotional experiences. This reminds me of the facial feedback hypothesis, which is a different concept. The activation-synthesis theory isn't about facial expressions influencing emotions.\n\nSo, based on what I remember, option B seems to be the correct answer. It directly refers to the activation-synthesis theory, explaining that dreams are the mind's way of making sense of random neural activity during sleep.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. I found that the activation-synthesis theory was proposed by Hobson and McCarley in the 1970s. They suggested that during REM sleep, the brainstem sends signals to the cerebral cortex, which then tries to make sense of these signals and synthesizes them into a coherent dream narrative. So, yes, that matches with option B.\n\nOption A seems to be more related to some kind of emotional balancing act, which isn't directly associated with the activation-synthesis theory. Option C is about happiness and personal comparisons, which is more related to subjective well-being theories. Option D is about facial expressions and emotions, which is related to the facial feedback hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option B: dreams result from the mind's attempt to make sense of random neural activity from the brainstem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
