                    "text": "So I have this question here about a Mars mission that's supposed to land on May 25, 2008, and its goal is to dig a trench into ice-rich soil. The options are ExoMars, Mars Exploration Rovers, Mars Science Laboratory, and Phoenix Mars Lander. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these missions was scheduled to land on that date and dig into ice-rich soil.\n\nFirst, let's think about the Mars Exploration Rovers. I remember that Spirit and Opportunity were part of that mission, and they landed in 2004. So, that was way before 2008. And their main goal was to explore the surface of Mars and look for signs of past water activity. Digging into ice-rich soil doesn't sound like their primary objective. Maybe they found some ice, but I don't think they were specifically designed to dig trenches for that purpose. So, probably not the answer.\n\nNext, Mars Science Laboratory. That sounds familiar. I think it's the one that landed Curiosity rover on Mars. But when did it land? Let me recall... Curiosity landed on Mars on August 6, 2012. That's after 2008, so it can't be the one landing on May 25, 2008. Nope, not this one.\n\nNow, ExoMars. I've heard of ExoMars, but I think it was a more recent mission. Let me see, ExoMars was launched in 2016, and its lander, Schiaparelli, attempted to land on Mars in 2016 as well. So, that's also after 2008. Doesn't match the landing date in the question.\n\nThat leaves the Phoenix Mars Lander. I have a vague recollection of this mission. I think it was designed to study the ice deposits on Mars. Let me try to remember: Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25, 2008, and it had a robotic arm that it used to dig into the Martian soil to sample any ice that might be present. Yeah, that sounds right. So, that matches both the landing date and the objective of digging into ice-rich soil.\n\nTo make sure, let's quickly eliminate any doubts. The Mars Exploration Rovers landed in 2004, Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity landed in 2012, and ExoMars' landing was in 2016. So, none of these match the landing date of May 25, 2008. Therefore, the correct answer must be the Phoenix Mars Lander.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check what Phoenix was actually supposed to do. As far as I know, it was sent to the northern polar region of Mars to investigate the history of water and ice in that area. It had a trench-digging capability to reach the icy layers beneath the surface. So, yes, that aligns perfectly with the description in the question.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is D. Phoenix Mars Lander.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
