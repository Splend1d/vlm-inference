                    "text": "So I have this question here about the effects of building freeways. It says, \"The construction of freeways leads to all but which of the following results?\" And the options are:\n\nA. Urban sprawl\n\nB. Traffic increase\n\nC. Traffic congestion\n\nD. Decreased dependency on cars\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. I need to figure out which one of these is not a result of building freeways.\n\nFirst off, what is a freeway? A freeway is a high-speed road, like a highway or motorway, that's designed for long-distance travel, usually with limited access points. So, building more of these is meant to improve transportation and connectivity.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Urban sprawl: This is when urban areas spread out over a larger area, often leading to lower population densities. Building freeways might make it easier for people to live farther from city centers and still commute to work, which could encourage sprawl. So, this seems like a possible result.\n\nB. Traffic increase: If more freeways are built, might that lead to more cars being on the road overall, either because it's now easier to drive longer distances or because development follows the freeways, increasing traffic volumes. This also seems plausible.\n\nC. Traffic congestion: This is a bit trickier. Freeways are built to handle heavy traffic and reduce congestion. However, sometimes, building more roads can actually attract more traffic, leading to congestion again over time. This is called induced demand. So, it's possible that congestion could increase despite building more freeways.\n\nD. Decreased dependency on cars: This is the one that seems out of place. If freeways are being built, which are primarily for car traffic, wouldn't that encourage more car use rather than less? Building more roads might make driving more convenient, thereby increasing people's reliance on cars rather than decreasing it.\n\nLet me think about this again. If freeways are built, do they make public transportation options like buses or trains more or less viable? Well, freeways can sometimes be used by buses, which might improve public transit, but generally, building freeways is more associated with increased car use.\n\nMoreover, in many places, the expansion of freeway systems has been correlated with decreased use of public transport and increased dependency on automobiles. So, it seems counterintuitive to suggest that building freeways would decrease dependency on cars.\n\nPerhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe in some contexts, building freeways could lead to better public transit options or make alternative modes of transportation more attractive. For example, if freeways are built with dedicated lanes for buses or carpools, that might encourage less single-occupancy vehicle use.\n\nHowever, the question is asking about the general result of building freeways, not specific cases where particular policies are implemented alongside them.\n\nI think, on balance, that decreased dependency on cars is not a typical result of building freeways. In fact, it's more common for freeways to lead to increased car dependency.\n\nTherefore, I would choose D. Decreased dependency on cars as the option that is not a result of building freeways.\n\nTo summarize my thoughts:\n\n- Urban sprawl: Likely increased due to easier commuting from farther distances.\n\n- Traffic increase: Likely due to improved infrastructure attracting more drivers.\n\n- Traffic congestion: Could be reduced initially but might increase again due to induced demand.\n\n- Decreased dependency on cars: Unlikely, as building freeways generally promotes car use.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Decreased dependency on cars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
