                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about economic policies. It says that if expansionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policy are used at the same time, which of the following is true?\n\nOption A: Unemployment will increase.\n\nOption B: Real GDP will decrease.\n\nOption C: Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\nOption D: Inflation will decrease dramatically.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are and how they affect the economy when used together.\n\nFirst, expansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes to stimulate economic growth. This should lead to an increase in aggregate demand in the economy. So, if the government spends more or reduces taxes, people have more money to spend, which should boost consumption and potentially increase production and employment.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy, or easy money policy, involves increasing the money supply or decreasing interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending. Lower interest rates make it cheaper for businesses to invest and for consumers to buy on credit, which again should increase aggregate demand.\n\nSo, both policies are aimed at increasing aggregate demand in the economy. When you combine them, you're essentially giving a double boost to demand.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible outcomes:\n\nOption A: Unemployment will increase.\n\nBut wait, if both policies are stimulating demand, businesses should be producing more and possibly hiring more workers. So, unemployment would likely decrease, not increase. Maybe this option is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Real GDP will decrease.\n\nAgain, with increased demand, we'd expect production to rise, which means real GDP should increase, not decrease. Perhaps this one is also incorrect.\n\nOption C: Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Expansionary monetary policy typically involves lowering interest rates. But if the economy is also being stimulated through fiscal policy, which increases demand and possibly inflation, that might put upward pressure on interest rates. So, depending on the central bank's reaction, interest rates might not change much, or they might even increase slightly. Maybe this could be a possible outcome.\n\nOption D: Inflation will decrease dramatically.\n\nBoth policies are likely to increase demand, which can lead to higher prices if supply doesn't keep up. So, inflation might increase, not decrease dramatically. This seems unlikely.\n\nLet me consider this more carefully. If both policies are expansionary, they should lead to higher aggregate demand. This typically results in higher output (real GDP), lower unemployment, and possibly higher inflation. However, if the economy is operating below its potential, meaning there's slack in the economy, then the increased demand could help close the output gap without causing much inflation.\n\nBut in the short term, simultaneous expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are likely to lead to higher output and lower unemployment. The effect on inflation is less clear and depends on various factors, including the responsiveness of supply.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\nA seems incorrect because unemployment should decrease.\n\nB seems incorrect because real GDP should increase.\n\nD seems incorrect because inflation is more likely to increase, not decrease dramatically.\n\nThat leaves option C: Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\nAs I thought earlier, expansionary monetary policy aims to lower interest rates, but the increased demand and potential inflationary pressure from expansionary fiscal policy might put upward pressure on rates. So, it's possible that interest rates don't change much, especially if the central bank adjusts its policy to balance these pressures.\n\nIn fact, in some cases, the central bank might allow interest rates to rise slightly to prevent overheating of the economy, but the overall impact might not be large, hence \"remain relatively constant.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the central bank is firmly committed to keeping interest rates low, they might continue their expansionary monetary policy even as fiscal policy stimulates the economy, effectively keeping interest rates stable.\n\nTherefore, option C seems like the most plausible answer among the given choices.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it differently. Suppose both policies are expansionary; fiscal policy increases demand through spending or tax cuts, and monetary policy supports lower interest rates to encourage more spending and investment.\n\nIf both are working together, they should lead to increased economic activity without necessarily causing a significant rise in interest rates, especially if the central bank is managing monetary policy to complement fiscal stimulus.\n\nIn summary, I think the correct answer is Option C: Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
