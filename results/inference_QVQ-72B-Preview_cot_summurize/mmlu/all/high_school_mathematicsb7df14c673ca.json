                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. We have a meteorologist who says there's a 30% probability of rain and no sun. Then, there's a 40% probability of no rain. We need to find the probability of both rain and sun.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the events here. Let's define:\n\n- R: It rains.\n\n- S: It's sunny.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- P(R and not S) = 0.30\n\n- P(not R) = 0.40\n\nAnd we need to find P(R and S).\n\nOkay, so from P(not R) = 0.40, I can find P(R) because P(R) = 1 - P(not R). So,\n\nP(R) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60\n\nSo, the probability of rain is 0.60.\n\nNow, I have P(R and not S) = 0.30. I need to relate this to P(R and S).\n\nI recall that P(R) can be broken down into P(R and S) + P(R and not S). That makes sense because R can happen either with S or without S.\n\nSo, P(R) = P(R and S) + P(R and not S)\n\nI know P(R) is 0.60 and P(R and not S) is 0.30. So, plugging in:\n\n0.60 = P(R and S) + 0.30\n\nTherefore, P(R and S) = 0.60 - 0.30 = 0.30\n\nWait, is that it? It seems almost straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check. If P(R) is 0.60, and P(R and not S) is 0.30, then yes, P(R and S) should be 0.60 - 0.30 = 0.30.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 0.30 is option C. So, the answer seems to be C. 0.30.\n\nHowever, maybe there's more to this. Let's consider if there's any overlap or other probabilities that could affect this.\n\nWe have P(R and not S) = 0.30 and P(not R) = 0.40.\n\nWait, P(not R) = 0.40 means that the probability of no rain is 0.40.\n\nThen, P(R or not S) could be something, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nImagine a Venn diagram with two circles: one for R (rain) and one for S (sun).\n\nThe area where R and S overlap is P(R and S), which is what we're trying to find.\n\nThen, P(R and not S) is the part of the R circle that doesn't overlap with S.\n\nSimilarly, P(not R and S) is the part of S that doesn't overlap with R.\n\nAnd P(not R and not S) is the area outside both circles.\n\nGiven that, we know:\n\nP(R) = P(R and S) + P(R and not S) = 0.60\n\nP(not R) = P(not R and S) + P(not R and not S) = 0.40\n\nAnd P(R and not S) = 0.30\n\nWe need to find P(R and S).\n\nFrom P(R) = P(R and S) + P(R and not S), we have:\n\n0.60 = P(R and S) + 0.30\n\nSo, P(R and S) = 0.60 - 0.30 = 0.30\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut I don't have information about P(S), so that might not help directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can express P(S) in terms of the other probabilities.\n\nLet me see.\n\nWe have:\n\nP(R) = 0.60\n\nP(not R) = 0.40\n\nP(R and not S) = 0.30\n\nP(S) = P(R and S) + P(not R and S)\n\nBut I don't have P(not R and S), so that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the total probability.\n\nThe total probability is P(R and S) + P(R and not S) + P(not R and S) + P(not R and not S) = 1\n\nWe know P(R and not S) = 0.30 and P(not R) = 0.40.\n\nFrom P(not R) = P(not R and S) + P(not R and not S) = 0.40\n\nAnd P(R) = P(R and S) + P(R and not S) = 0.60\n\nSo, P(R and S) = 0.60 - 0.30 = 0.30\n\nAgain, that's what I got earlier.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any other information I need to account for.\n\nIs there any dependency between R and S? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume they are independent, but that might not be necessary since we're dealing with conditional probabilities.\n\nWait, no, the problem gives probabilities of intersections, so maybe independence isn't assumed.\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability of both rain and sun is 0.30, which is option C.\n\nBut let me check the other options to see if any of them could possibly be correct.\n\nOption A is 0.16, which is less than what I calculated.\n\nOption B is 0.24, which is also less.\n\nOption D is 0.5, which is higher.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in my reasoning, I don't see a reason to choose any other option.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 0.30\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
