                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about Susan and her experiences with a pill on two different days, and I need to figure out which theory of emotion it's exemplifying. The options are the adaptation-level phenomenon, two-factor theory, James-Lange theory, and Cannon-Bard theory. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, let's recap what's happening with Susan. Today, she took a pill for her allergy, which caused her blood pressure to rise, her heart to beat faster, and her body temperature to increase. She's stuck in traffic and feels angry. Yesterday, similar things happened: she took the pill, her blood pressure rose, her heart sped up, she got hotter, and she felt amorous, but she was with her husband this time.\n\nOkay, so both days, she had similar physiological responses, but her emotional experiences were different: angry today and amorous yesterday. Hmm, that seems interesting. Maybe it's about how she interprets these bodily changes based on the context.\n\nLet me recall what each of these theories says about emotion.\n\nStarting with the James-Lange theory, which is one of the earliest theories of emotion. It suggests that our physiological arousal comes before our emotional experience. So, according to this theory, when our body reacts in certain ways, we interpret those reactions and label them as specific emotions. For example, if our heart is racing, we might feel excited or afraid, depending on the situation.\n\nNext, the Cannon-Bard theory proposes that emotions and physiological arousal occur simultaneously but independently. So, our emotional experience and our bodily reactions are both results of our brain processing the stimulus, but they don't directly influence each other. This means that our emotions and our physiological responses are parallel processes.\n\nThen there's the two-factor theory, which was proposed by Schachter and Singer. This theory combines elements of both the James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theories. It suggests that emotion has two components: physiological arousal and cognitive label. So, when we experience arousal, we look for clues in the environment to label that arousal as a specific emotion. The context in which the arousal occurs influences how we interpret and label our feelings.\n\nLastly, the adaptation-level phenomenon, which is more about how we adjust our expectations and perceptions based on our past experiences. It suggests that we have a baseline or a reference point, and we judge new stimuli relative to this baseline. So, if something is above or below this level, it\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\n\nNow, going back to Susan's situation, it seems like she has similar physiological arousal on both days but different emotional experiences based on the context. Today, she's stuck in traffic and feels angry, while yesterday, she was with her husband and felt amorous.\n\nThis sounds a lot like the two-factor theory, where the physiological arousal is the same, but the cognitive label changes based on the context. So, in traffic, she interprets her arousal as anger, and with her husband, as amorousness.\n\nLet me see if the other theories fit as well.\n\nJames-Lange would suggest that the physiological changes lead to the emotional experience. So, her body reacts, and she feels a certain way based on that. But in this case, her body reacted similarly on both days, but she felt different emotions. So, maybe it's not the best fit.\n\nCannon-Bard says that emotion and physiological arousal are separate but parallel processes. So, her emotions and her bodily reactions are happening independently. But in this scenario, it seems like her emotions are connected to her arousal, just interpreted differently based on context.\n\nThe adaptation-level phenomenon seems unrelated here because there's no mention of a baseline or reference point changing over time.\n\nSo, the two-factor theory seems to be the best fit. It explains why similar arousal leads to different emotions based on the situational context.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"this description exemplifies...\" and gives the options. It's probably expecting one answer, so I need to pick the one that fits best.\n\nI think the two-factor theory is the most appropriate choice here because it directly addresses the idea that similar arousal can be labeled differently based on the context.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe the James-Lange theory could be applied if we consider that the physiological changes lead to different emotions based on the situation, but the theory itself doesn't account for the contextual variation in emotion labels when arousal is similar.\n\nThe Cannon-Bard theory doesn't really explain why she would have different emotions with similar arousal, since it sees them as separate processes.\n\nThe adaptation-level phenomenon doesn't seem to apply here because there's no discussion of a baseline shifting over time.\n\nTherefore, the two-factor theory is the most suitable explanation for Susan's experiences.\n\nSo, my answer is B. two-factor theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
