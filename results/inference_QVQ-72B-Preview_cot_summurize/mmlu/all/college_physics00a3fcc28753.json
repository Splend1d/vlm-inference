                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about length contraction in special relativity. It says that a rod measures 1.00 meter in its rest system, and I need to find out how fast an observer has to move parallel to the rod to measure its length as 0.80 meters. The options are 0.50c, 0.60c, 0.70c, and 0.80c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the formula for length contraction. I remember that when an object is moving relative to an observer, its measured length along the direction of motion is shorter than its rest length. The formula for the contracted length is:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( L \\) is the length measured by the moving observer,\n\n- \\( L_0 \\) is the rest length of the object,\n\n- \\( v \\) is the relative velocity between the object and the observer,\n\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- \\( L = 0.80 \\) m (the length measured by the observer),\n\n- \\( L_0 = 1.00 \\) m (the rest length of the rod),\n\n- And I need to find \\( v \\).\n\nSo, I can plug these values into the formula and solve for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ 0.80 = 1.00 \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nAlright, let's solve this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 1.00:\n\n\\[ 0.80 = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nNext, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[ 0.80^2 = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.64 = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\nNow, subtract 0.64 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.64 = \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.36 = \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.36 \\)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to solve for \\( \\frac{v}{c} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{0.36} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = 0.6 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( v = 0.6c \\)\n\nLooking back at the options, that corresponds to choice B. 0.60c.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ 0.80 = 1.00 \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 1.00:\n\n\\[ 0.80 = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.80^2 = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.64 = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\nSubtract 0.64 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.64 = \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.36 = \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\nTake square roots:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = 0.6 \\]\n\nSo, \\( v = 0.6c \\)\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 0.60c.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem or if there's any potential confusion.\n\nI know that in special relativity, lengths are contracted in the direction of motion according to the Lorentz factor, gamma, which is:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nThe observed length is then:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{L_0}{\\gamma} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as the equation I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might get confused and think that time dilation is involved here, but no, because we're dealing with length contraction, not time dilation.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that the contraction only occurs in the direction of motion. So, if the observer is moving parallel to the rod, as stated in the problem, then the contraction should be along the direction of motion, which is exactly what the formula accounts for.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems straightforward. The problem provides the rest length and the observed length, and we're to find the velocity that causes the observed length to be 0.80 meters when the rest length is 1.00 meter.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me plug the value back into the formula to verify.\n\nGiven \\( v = 0.6c \\), let's compute \\( \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.36} = \\sqrt{0.64} = 0.8 \\]\n\nSo, indeed:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\times 0.8 = 1.00 \\times 0.8 = 0.80 \\) meters, which matches the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 0.60c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 0.60c} \\]"
