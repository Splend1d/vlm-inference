                    "text": "So I have this problem about Turing machines and decidability. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given:\n\n- M is a single-tape, deterministic Turing machine with a tape alphabet consisting of {blank, 0, 1}.\n\n- C is the computation of M starting with a blank tape.\n\n- The input to each problem is M and a positive integer n.\n\nWe need to determine which of the problems I, II, or III is decidable.\n\nLet's recall what it means for a problem to be decidable: there exists a Turing machine that will always halt and give the correct answer (yes or no) for any input.\n\nNow, let's look at each problem:\n\nI. The computation C lasts for at least n steps.\n\nSo, we need to decide whether M, starting with a blank tape, runs for at least n steps.\n\nHmm, for a given M and n, we can simulate M and see if it runs for at least n steps. Since n is a fixed positive integer, and M is deterministic, we can simulate M for n steps and check if it's still running.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the computation C lasts for at least n steps.\" Since C is the computation starting with a blank tape, and M is deterministic, the behavior is fixed.\n\nBut, there's a catch: M could run forever. If M loops infinitely, then for any finite n, the computation lasts at least n steps.\n\nBut the problem is to decide whether it lasts at least n steps, not to simulate the entire computation.\n\nSo, to decide this, we can simulate M for n steps and see if it hasn't halted yet. If it hasn't halted after n steps, then the computation lasts at least n steps; otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nBut, wait a minute, what if M halts before n steps? Then, it doesn't last at least n steps.\n\nIf M runs forever, then it certainly lasts at least n steps.\n\nSo, simulating M for n steps and checking if it's still running seems straightforward.\n\nBut, is there any issue with this approach?\n\nWell, if M runs forever, simulating it for n steps will terminate after n steps, and we can confirm that it hasn't halted, so it lasts at least n steps.\n\nIf M halts before n steps, we can confirm that it doesn't last at least n steps.\n\nSo, this seems decidable. We can always simulate M for n steps and check its state.\n\nTherefore, problem I is decidable.\n\nNow, problem II: The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.\n\nThis is a bit more involved.\n\nWe need to check two things:\n\n1. The computation lasts at least n steps.\n\n2. After the nth step, M prints a 1 at some point.\n\nFirst, to check if the computation lasts at least n steps, we can simulate M for n steps and see if it's still running, as in problem I.\n\nBut then, we need to check if, after the nth step, M prints a 1 at some point.\n\nThis seems tricky because it involves checking the behavior of M after n steps.\n\nIf M runs forever, and at some point after the nth step, it prints a 1, then the condition holds.\n\nIf M halts after n steps without printing a 1 after the nth step, then it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nBut, to decide this, we need to simulate M beyond n steps to see if it ever prints a 1 after the nth step.\n\nHowever, if M runs forever without printing a 1 after the nth step, we wouldn't know when to stop the simulation.\n\nWait, but the problem is to decide whether M prints a 1 after the nth step in the computation that lasts at least n steps.\n\nBut, since M could run forever without printing a 1 after the nth step, and we wouldn't know when to stop the simulation, this seems undecidable.\n\nBecause it touches on the halting problem: we need to know whether M will eventually print a 1 after n steps, which is similar to predicting the future behavior of M.\n\nTherefore, problem II is undecidable.\n\nNow, problem III: M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.\n\nSo, we need to check if, in the computation starting with a blank tape, M visits at least n different tape squares.\n\nGiven that the tape is initially blank, and M is deterministic, its movement is fixed.\n\nWe can simulate M and keep track of the tape squares it visits.\n\nSince the tape is infinite, M can move left or right indefinitely.\n\nBut, if M visits at least n distinct squares, we can confirm that by simulating it for a sufficient number of steps to ensure it has visited n distinct squares.\n\nHowever, if M loops in a finite region of the tape, visiting fewer than n distinct squares, we can detect that.\n\nBut, if M keeps moving to new squares without bound, it will eventually visit at least n distinct squares for any finite n.\n\nWait, but n is a fixed positive integer, so in simulation, we can keep track of the squares visited and stop once we've seen n distinct squares.\n\nIf M visits fewer than n distinct squares and enters a loop, we can detect that and conclude it doesn't visit at least n distinct squares.\n\nTherefore, this seems decidable.\n\nWe can simulate M, keep a set of visited squares, and stop once the set has at least n elements or detect if it's stuck in a loop visiting fewer than n squares.\n\nHence, problem III is decidable.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Problem I: decidable\n\n- Problem II: undecidable\n\n- Problem III: decidable\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
