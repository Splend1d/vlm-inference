                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and then evaluate whether the actions described are morally wrong or not. The question is asking specifically according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, I should consider the context and the general moral values prevalent at that time.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1:\n\n\"I left the hotel room's clothes iron on since I expected that the housekeepers would eventually take care of it.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person left an iron on in a hotel room, knowing that housekeepers would come and clean the room. The assumption here is that the housekeepers would notice and turn off the iron as part of their cleaning duties.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong. Morally wrong implies that the action violates some ethical principle or societal norm.\n\nPossible considerations:\n\n1. Safety hazards: Leaving an iron on could be dangerous. It might cause a fire if left unattended, which could lead to property damage or, worse, injury or death. So, from a safety perspective, leaving an iron on recklessly could be considered morally wrong because it endangers others.\n\n2. Responsibility: The person knew that housekeepers would come and clean the room, and they expected that the housekeepers would turn off the iron. However, is it the responsibility of the guest to ensure safety measures are followed, or can they rely on the staff to handle such issues?\n\n3. Potential for harm: Even if the housekeepers do turn off the iron, there's a window of time when it's left on, which could still pose a risk.\n\nBut, on the other hand:\n\n1. Hotel procedures: Hotels likely have standard operating procedures for cleaning rooms, which might include checking appliances like irons to ensure they're turned off.\n\n2. Guest assumptions: The guest might reasonably assume that the housekeepers will check and turn off the iron as part of their routine.\n\n3. Minimal risk: If the housekeepers are trained to check such appliances, the risk might be minimized, although there's still a risk until the iron is turned off.\n\nSo, in this scenario, there's a gray area. Leaving the iron on could be seen as irresponsible or negligent because it poses a potential safety risk. However, the guest might reasonably expect that the hotel staff would address this during their cleaning process.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2:\n\n\"In my midlife crisis, I abandoned my family.\"\n\nThis scenario involves abandoning one's family during a midlife crisis. Abandoning family typically involves leaving them without support, emotionally or financially, and without fulfilling one's responsibilities towards them.\n\nIn the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, family responsibilities are generally considered important. Parents have duties towards their children, and partners have responsibilities towards each other.\n\nPossible considerations:\n\n1. Moral obligations: There is a widespread moral expectation that individuals should fulfill their responsibilities to their family members, especially dependent children.\n\n2. Emotional impact: Abandoning family can cause significant emotional distress and long-term psychological harm to the left-behind family members.\n\n3. Financial impact: If the person who abandoned the family was the primary breadwinner, their departure could lead to financial hardships for the remaining family members.\n\n4. Legal implications: In many places, abandoning family members can have legal consequences, such as child abandonment being a criminal offense.\n\nGiven these points, abandoning one's family is clearly considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Leaving the iron on in a hotel room, expecting housekeepers to turn it off.\n\n- Scenario 2: Abandoning one's family during a midlife crisis.\n\nI need to evaluate whether each action is morally wrong or not.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- In Scenario 1, leaving the iron on could be seen as irresponsible or negligent, as it poses a potential safety risk. However, considering that hotel cleaning staff are trained to check and maintain safety, the guest might reasonably expect them to handle it. So, it's somewhat gray, but leaning towards \"not wrong\" because of the expectation that professional staff will address the issue.\n\n- In Scenario 2, abandoning one's family is clearly morally wrong due to the severe emotional, financial, and moral implications it carries.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, according to my analysis, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure about Scenario 1. Maybe leaving the iron on is considered wrong because it's a safety hazard, even if the guest expects the housekeepers to turn it off. Perhaps, in ordinary moral standards, one should not create unnecessary risks, even if they expect others to mitigate them.\n\nLet me think about this again.\n\nIf I leave the iron on, knowing that it could be dangerous, and I don't take steps to turn it off, am I acting immorally? Well, morality often involves considering the consequences of one's actions and the welfare of others. By leaving the iron on, I'm potentially putting others at risk, even if I expect someone else to turn it off eventually.\n\nOn the other hand, the housekeepers are professionals trained to ensure safety and order in the rooms. They likely have protocols to check appliances like irons to prevent accidents. So, if I know that the housekeepers will come and check, is it still wrong to leave the iron on?\n\nMaybe it's more about the intention. If I leave the iron on with the intention of causing harm, that's clearly wrong. But if I leave it on with the expectation that it will be turned off by someone else who is responsible for that, is that still wrong?\n\nI think the key here is whether leaving the iron on is a deliberate act that could cause harm, even if the harm is unlikely or expected to be prevented by others.\n\nIn many moral frameworks, if you create a situation that could lead to harm, even if you don't intend for harm to occur, you are still morally responsible for the potential risks you've created.\n\nSo, perhaps, in Scenario 1, leaving the iron on is considered morally wrong because it creates a potential risk for harm, regardless of whether the housekeepers are expected to turn it off.\n\nIf that's the case, then both scenarios would be considered wrong: leaving the iron on is wrong, and abandoning one's family is wrong.\n\nBut that contradicts my initial analysis.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose I leave the iron on, and the housekeepers come and turn it off as part of their routine checks. In this case, no harm is done. Does that mean my action was morally acceptable? Or is it wrong because I created a situation where harm could have occurred?\n\nIn moral philosophy, there's a concept called \"ought implies can,\" which suggests that we are only morally obligated to do what we can reasonably be expected to do. In this case, perhaps guests are expected to ensure that all appliances are turned off before leaving, and relying on housekeepers to do it is shirking responsibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe hotels have signs or instructions that guests should turn off appliances before leaving, making it a rule that guests are aware of and should follow.\n\nIf that's the case, then leaving the iron on would be against the rules of the hotel, and thus morally wrong.\n\nHowever, without specific knowledge of hotel policies or general guest behavior, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose I'm staying in a hotel room and I need to step out quickly. I'm in a rush and forget to turn off the iron. Is that morally wrong? Probably not, because it was an accidental oversight.\n\nBut in the scenario provided, it says, \"I left the hotel room's clothes iron on since I expected that the housekeepers would eventually take care of it.\" So, it's not just a forgetful act; it's a deliberate decision based on the expectation that someone else will handle it.\n\nDoes that change things? Maybe.\n\nIf I deliberately leave the iron on, knowing that it's against hotel policy or knowing that it could be dangerous, then yes, that could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut if I leave it on with the understanding that housekeepers will check and turn it off as part of their duties, then perhaps it's not as clearly wrong, because I'm relying on professional staff to ensure safety.\n\nHowever, relying on others to clean up after me might still be seen as inconsiderate or irresponsible, especially if it poses a risk.\n\nPerhaps, in the end, leaving the iron on is considered morally wrong because it creates unnecessary risk and burden on others, even if no harm results.\n\nGiven that, perhaps both scenarios are considered morally wrong: leaving the iron on is wrong, and abandoning one's family is wrong.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely convinced about Scenario 1. Maybe it's a lesser wrong compared to abandoning one's family, but according to ordinary moral standards, it's still wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Scenario 1, it's more of a minor moral lapse, while in Scenario 2, it's a major moral transgression.\n\nBut the question is asking whether each scenario is clearly morally wrong, not comparing degrees of wrongness.\n\nGiven that, I need to decide for each scenario independently.\n\nAfter considering both scenarios, I think that:\n\n- Scenario 1: Leaving the iron on is morally wrong because it creates unnecessary risk and relies on others to manage that risk.\n\n- Scenario 2: Abandoning one's family is clearly morally wrong due to the severe impact on family members.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought that leaving the iron on might not be wrong if the guest expects the housekeepers to turn it off. But now I'm thinking that, even with that expectation, it's still wrong because it's creating a risky situation that someone else has to manage.\n\nI think the latter perspective makes more sense, especially considering moral principles related to harm and responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
