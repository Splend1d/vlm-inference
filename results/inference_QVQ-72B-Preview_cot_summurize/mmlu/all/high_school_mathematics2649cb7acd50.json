                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have polynomials f(x), g(x), and h(x), with degrees 6, 3, and h(x) is what we need to find. The expression f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)) is supposed to be a polynomial of degree 36. We need to determine the degree of h(x).\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the degree of a composition of two polynomials works. If f(x) has degree 6 and g(x) has degree 3, then f(g(x)) should have degree 6 times 3, which is 18, right? Because when you compose two polynomials, their degrees multiply.\n\nSimilarly, g(h(x)) should have degree 3 times the degree of h(x), and h(f(x)) should have degree equal to the degree of h(x) times the degree of f(x), which is 6 times the degree of h(x).\n\nLet me denote the degree of h(x) as n. So, g(h(x)) has degree 3n, and h(f(x)) has degree 6n.\n\nNow, the entire expression is f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)), and this is supposed to be a polynomial of degree 36. The degree of this sum will be the highest degree among the three terms.\n\nSo, we have three possibilities for the leading term:\n\n1. f(g(x)) has degree 18.\n\n2. g(h(x)) has degree 3n.\n\n3. h(f(x)) has degree 6n.\n\nThe overall degree of the sum is 36, which should be the highest degree among these three. So, either 18, 3n, or 6n is equal to 36.\n\nWait a minute, 18 is less than 36, so the degree can't be 18. That means that either 3n or 6n must be 36.\n\nLet's consider both cases.\n\nFirst case: 3n = 36.\n\nSolving for n, we get n = 12.\n\nSecond case: 6n = 36.\n\nSolving for n, we get n = 6.\n\nBut we need to check which one makes sense in the context of the entire expression.\n\nIf n = 12, then g(h(x)) has degree 3*12 = 36, and h(f(x)) has degree 6*12 = 72.\n\nSo, the terms would have degrees 18, 36, and 72. The highest degree is 72, but the problem states that the entire expression is of degree 36, which would be contradicted by the term of degree 72.\n\nTherefore, n = 12 doesn't work because it would make the overall degree higher than 36.\n\nNow, if n = 6, then g(h(x)) has degree 3*6 = 18, and h(f(x)) has degree 6*6 = 36.\n\nSo, the terms have degrees 18, 18, and 36. The highest degree is 36, which matches the given degree of the entire expression.\n\nWait, but f(g(x)) has degree 18, g(h(x)) has degree 18, and h(f(x)) has degree 36. So, the leading term comes from h(f(x)), which is degree 36, matching the overall degree.\n\nBut I need to ensure that there isn't a way for the degree to be 36 with a higher degree for h(x).\n\nWait, but if n = 12 leads to a degree of 72 for one of the terms, which is higher than 36, and n = 6 leads to degree 36, which matches, it seems n = 6 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's check the options provided:\n\nA. 72\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 18\n\nD. 12\n\nSo, n = 6 seems to be the correct choice, corresponding to option B.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Maybe there's a way for higher degrees to cancel out.\n\nSuppose that in the sum f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)), the higher degree terms somehow cancel each other out, allowing a lower degree term to dominate.\n\nHowever, in standard polynomial addition, the degree is determined by the highest power with a non-zero coefficient, so cancellation can only happen if specific coefficients are chosen to make the leading terms cancel, but that seems unlikely in this general case.\n\nMoreover, the problem states that f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)) is a polynomial of degree 36, so we should consider that the leading term is intended to be of degree 36.\n\nGiven that, and considering the degrees:\n\n- f(g(x)) has degree 18.\n\n- g(h(x)) has degree 3n.\n\n- h(f(x)) has degree 6n.\n\nIf 6n = 36, then n = 6, which aligns with option B.\n\nAlternatively, if 3n = 36, then n = 12, but as we saw, that would make h(f(x)) have degree 72, which is higher than 36, so it wouldn't make sense unless there's cancellation, which isn't guaranteed.\n\nAdditionally, if n were 18, then g(h(x)) has degree 54, and h(f(x)) has degree 108, which again would make the overall degree higher than 36.\n\nSimilarly, n = 72 would make g(h(x)) have degree 216 and h(f(x)) have degree 432, which is much higher.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible option is n = 6.\n\nI think the answer is B. 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
