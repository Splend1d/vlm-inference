                    "text": "$$\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{108}+2\\sqrt{12}+2\\sqrt{27}}$$\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the radicals in the denominator. Let's look at each one:\n\n- $\\sqrt{108}$: I know that $108 = 36 \\times 3$, and $\\sqrt{36} = 6$. So, $\\sqrt{108} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 3} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n- $2\\sqrt{12}$: Similarly, $12 = 4 \\times 3$, and $\\sqrt{4} = 2$. So, $\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$, and therefore $2\\sqrt{12} = 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n- $2\\sqrt{27}$: $27 = 9 \\times 3$, and $\\sqrt{9} = 3$. So, $\\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}$, and $2\\sqrt{27} = 2 \\times 3\\sqrt{3} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, let's substitute these back into the denominator:\n\n$$\\sqrt{108} + 2\\sqrt{12} + 2\\sqrt{27} = 6\\sqrt{3} + 4\\sqrt{3} + 6\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nAdding these together:\n\n$$6\\sqrt{3} + 4\\sqrt{3} + 6\\sqrt{3} = (6 + 4 + 6)\\sqrt{3} = 16\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nSo, the original expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\\frac{4}{16\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n$$\\frac{4 \\div 4}{16\\sqrt{3} \\div 4} = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\nBut the problem asks to rationalize the denominator. To rationalize, I need to eliminate the radical in the denominator. I can do this by multiplying both numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4 \\times 3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$$\n\nSo, the simplified form of the original expression is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{33}$\n\nB. $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$\n\nC. $2\\sqrt{27}$\n\nD. $\\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nOur answer matches option B. $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there's another way to approach this or if I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInstead of simplifying the denominator first, I could try rationalizing the denominator directly. The denominator is $\\sqrt{108} + 2\\sqrt{12} + 2\\sqrt{27}$. To rationalize this, I would need to multiply by the conjugate. However, since all terms have $\\sqrt{3}$, this might not be the most efficient method.\n\nAnother thought: maybe there's a common factor in the denominator that can be factored out before rationalizing. For example, each term in the denominator has $\\sqrt{3}$, so perhaps factoring that out could simplify the expression.\n\nLet's try factoring $\\sqrt{3}$ out of the denominator:\n\n$$\\sqrt{108} + 2\\sqrt{12} + 2\\sqrt{27} = \\sqrt{3}(6 + 2 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 3) = \\sqrt{3}(6 + 4 + 6) = \\sqrt{3}(16) = 16\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nThis is the same as before. So, proceeding as earlier:\n\n$$\\frac{4}{16\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\nThen, rationalizing:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$$\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's a different way to simplify the original expression.\n\nPerhaps using properties of fractions or looking for a different conjugate to multiply by.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expressing all radicals in terms of exponents could help, but that seems unnecessary here.\n\nAnother idea: since all terms in the denominator have $\\sqrt{3}$, maybe there's a way to factor or simplify the expression differently.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can factor out a common factor from the denominator before simplifying.\n\nLooking back, I already factored out $\\sqrt{3}$ and got $16\\sqrt{3}$, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that $108 = 3^3 \\times 4$, $12 = 4 \\times 3$, and $27 = 3^3$, but I don't think that leads to a different simplification path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider combining the radicals before simplifying, but that seems less straightforward.\n\nGiven that both approaches I've taken lead to the same answer, I'm confident that $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$ is the correct simplified form.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}} \\]"
