He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nThe critiques offered by Voltaire through Candide are most closely shared by what other philosopher?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which philosopher among Cesare Beccaria, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, and David Hume shares the most similar critiques to Voltaire's in \"Candide.\" I need to recall what Voltaire was critiquing in this book and then see which of these philosophers also critiqued similar things.\n\nFirst off, \"Candide\" is a satirical novel by Voltaire, written in 1759. It's famous for its criticism of optimism, especially the philosophical optimism that was popular during the Enlightenment. The main character, Candide, is taught by his mentor Pangloss that \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,\" which is a phrase Voltaire uses to mock the idea that everything happens for a greater good and that the world is perfect as it is.\n\nThroughout the novel, Candide experiences one disaster after another\u2014war, earthquakes, slavery, and more\u2014but despite all this, he and Pangloss cling to the belief that everything is for the best. Voltaire uses this to satirize the\u76f2\u76ee\u4e50\u89c2ism of certain philosophers of his time, particularly those who followed Leibniz's philosophy, which suggested that God had created the best possible world.\n\nSo, Voltaire's critique in \"Candide\" is primarily aimed at\u76f2\u76ee\u4e50\u89c2istic philosophy and perhaps the excessive faith in reason and progress that characterized the Enlightenment.\n\nNow, let's look at each philosopher option to see who among them shares similar critiques.\n\nA. Cesare Beccaria: He was an Italian Enlightenment thinker who is best known for his treatise \"On Crimes and Punishments,\" which argued for legal reforms, including the abolition of torture and the death penalty. While Beccaria was critical of the harsh penal systems of his time, his focus was more on law and punishment rather than on philosophical optimism. So, while he was part of the Enlightenment, his critiques don't seem as closely aligned with Voltaire's in \"Candide.\"\n\nB. Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Rousseau was a prominent Enlightenment thinker who critiqued many aspects of society, including inequality and the corruption of civilization. He believed in the inherent goodness of humans and saw society as corrupting rather than improving human nature. While Rousseau was critical of some Enlightenment ideas, particularly the view that progress was inevitable, his focus was more on social and political issues rather than directly challenging philosophical optimism in the way Voltaire did in \"Candide.\"\n\nC. Adam Smith: Smith is often associated with economics and his influential work \"The Wealth of Nations,\" which laid the foundations for classical economics. He believed in free markets and the invisible hand that guides self-interest to promote general welfare. While Smith had critiques of government intervention and monopolies, his focus was primarily on economic systems rather than philosophical optimism.\n\nD. David Hume: Hume was a Scottish philosopher who is known for his skepticism and empiricism. He questioned the validity of causation and the existence of innate ideas, emphasizing instead the role of experience and observation in forming knowledge. Hume's philosophy introduced doubt into the Enlightenment's confidence in reason and science.\n\nConsidering Voltaire's critique in \"Candide,\" which targets\u76f2\u76ee\u4e50\u89c2istic philosophy and perhaps the overconfidence in reason, Hume seems like a strong candidate because of his skeptical approach. Hume challenged the Enlightenment's faith in reason by pointing out the limits of human understanding and the unreliable nature of causation.\n\nMoreover, in \"Candide,\" Voltaire also critiques the idea that everything happens for the best, which aligns with Hume's skepticism about such optimistic assumptions. Hume's philosophy encourages questioning and doubt, which is similar to Voltaire's satirical approach in challenging established ideas.\n\nIn contrast, Beccaria, Rousseau, and Smith had different focuses: Beccaria on law and punishment, Rousseau on social contracts and human nature, and Smith on economics. While all were Enlightenment thinkers with their own critiques, none of them share the same direct critique of philosophical optimism as Voltaire does in \"Candide.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. David Hume.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
