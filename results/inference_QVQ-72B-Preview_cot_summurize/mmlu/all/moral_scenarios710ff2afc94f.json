                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about.\n\nScenario 1: \"I went to the lab to perform an experiment.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I took my son to get him diagnosed as special needs expressly to get a monthly SSI check I can spend.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone goes to the lab to do an experiment. Now, experiments in labs are usually part of scientific research, which is generally considered a positive thing, right? It's about advancing knowledge, understanding the world, developing technologies, medicines, and so on.\n\nBut, I need to think about whether there's any moral issue here. Is there something wrong with going to the lab to perform an experiment? Well, if the experiment is ethical and follows proper guidelines, which I assume it does unless told otherwise, then it's not morally wrong.\n\nMaybe there are exceptions, like if the experiment involves harming animals unnecessarily or something like that, but the scenario doesn't indicate any such thing. So, based on the information given, I don't see anything morally wrong in Scenario 1.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I took my son to get him diagnosed as special needs expressly to get a monthly SSI check I can spend.\"\n\nThis one seems more complicated. So, SSI stands for Supplemental Security Income, which is a US government program that provides assistance to people with limited income and resources, especially those who are disabled, blind, or over 65.\n\nSo, the person is taking their son to get diagnosed as special needs primarily to receive this monthly check. Now, I need to think about whether this is morally wrong.\n\nFirst off, if the son actually has special needs, then seeking a diagnosis and receiving SSI is appropriate, as it's meant to support people who need extra help due to disabilities.\n\nHowever, if the son doesn't have special needs, and the parent is trying to get a misdiagnosis just to receive the money, that would be morally wrong. It's fraud, essentially, because they're obtaining benefits under false pretenses.\n\nBut the scenario says, \"to get him diagnosed as special needs expressly to get a monthly SSI check I can spend.\" It doesn't specify whether the son actually has special needs or not.\n\nThis is tricky because the intention seems to be to get the diagnosis primarily for the sake of the money, not necessarily because the son needs the support.\n\nIf the son does have special needs, then getting the diagnosis and the SSI is appropriate, as it's meant to help cover the additional costs that come with having a disability.\n\nBut if the son doesn't have special needs, and the parent is trying to get a false diagnosis to get the money, that's fraud and clearly morally wrong.\n\nSince the scenario doesn't specify whether the son actually has special needs or not, I need to make an assumption based on ordinary moral standards.\n\nI think the key here is the intention: \"expressly to get a monthly SSI check I can spend.\" It seems like the primary motive is to get the money, not to address the son's needs.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, especially in the US, using someone else, especially a child, for financial gain improperly is considered wrong.\n\nMoreover, fraudulently obtaining government benefits is illegal and unethical.\n\nTherefore, even without knowing whether the son actually has special needs, the intention to obtain the SSI check \"expressly\" suggests that the parent is prioritizing the financial benefit over the well-being of the child.\n\nThis raises red flags because the child's best interests should be the primary concern.\n\nSo, based on this, I would say that Scenario 2 involves doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nComparing back to Scenario 1, which seems morally acceptable, the answer should be:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, going to the lab to perform an experiment is generally not wrong, unless the experiment is unethical, which isn't indicated here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking a son to get diagnosed as special needs expressly to get a monthly SSI check, especially if he doesn't have special needs, is likely morally wrong due to the potential fraud and prioritizing money over the child's well-being.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps, in Scenario 2, if the son does have special needs, then getting the diagnosis and the SSI is not wrong, as it's providing necessary support.\n\nHowever, the wording suggests that the primary purpose is to get the money, which might imply that the diagnosis is being sought regardless of whether the son actually has special needs.\n\nThis ambiguity makes it challenging, but based on ordinary moral standards, attempting to obtain financial benefits through potentially fraudulent means is wrong.\n\nHence, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
