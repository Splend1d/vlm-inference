Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this, but I think I have some idea. Let me see.\n\nFirst off, the question is about a celebration where wealth is redistributed. So, it's probably referring to some cultural practice where people give away or exchange goods during a festivity. I remember learning about certain indigenous cultures that have ceremonies involving the distribution of goods as a way of showing status or maintaining social bonds.\n\nOption A is \"potlatch.\" I think the potlatch is a ceremony practiced by some Indigenous peoples in the Pacific Northwest of North America. In a potlatch, I recall that families or tribes would give away possessions to guests, sometimes destroying valuable items to display their wealth and status. This sounds like it involves redistributing wealth, so maybe this is the correct answer.\n\nOption B is \"kiva parties.\" I know that kivas are ceremonial structures used by Puebloan peoples in the American Southwest. They often hold ceremonies and gatherings in kivas. But I'm not sure if these parties specifically involve redistributing wealth. Maybe they involve sharing food or resources, but I don't recall it being the main purpose of the ceremonies.\n\nOption C is \"totem feasts.\" Totems are symbolic figures representing clans or families in many Indigenous cultures, especially in North America. Feasts celebrating totems might involve sharing food and perhaps exchanging gifts, but again, I don't think the primary purpose is to redistribute wealth. Totem feasts seem more about honoring ancestral spirits or reinforcing social identities.\n\nOption D is \"sinagua.\" I'm a bit unsure about this one. Sinagua is a term used to refer to an ancient culture that thrived in central Arizona from around 600 to 1400 CE. They were known for their agriculture and trade. I don't recall any specific celebrations or ceremonies associated with them that involved redistributing wealth. Maybe they had such practices, but I don't have enough information to confirm that.\n\nBased on what I know, the potlatch seems to be the most fitting answer. It's a well-documented practice among Indigenous peoples in the Pacific Northwest, and a key feature is the redistribution of wealth through giving away possessions during celebrations.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. I found that in some cultures, feasts or ceremonies do involve sharing resources, but the potlatch is particularly known for its elaborate displays of wealth distribution. For example, in a potlatch, hosts might give away blankets, food, or other valuable items to guests, which could be seen as redistributing wealth.\n\nIn contrast, kiva parties seem more focused on religious and communal activities rather than wealth redistribution. Totem feasts might involve gift-giving, but again, not necessarily on the same scale or with the same purpose as the potlatch.\n\nAs for the Sinagua culture, while they were known for their trade and exchange networks, I couldn't find any specific references to a celebration centered around redistributing wealth.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, I would say that A. potlatch is the correct answer to the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ potlatch}} \\]"
