                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what elite athletes should ideally consume during prolonged high-intensity exercise that lasts longer than 2.5 hours. The options are:\n\nA. 60 g glucose per hour\n\nB. 60 g glucose plus fructose per hour\n\nC. 90 g glucose per hour\n\nD. 90 g glucose plus fructose per hour\n\nFirst, I need to understand why athletes need to consume carbohydrates during exercise, especially in prolonged high-intensity activities.\n\nI know that during exercise, the body primarily uses carbohydrates and fats for energy. The longer the exercise duration and the higher the intensity, the more reliant the body becomes on carbohydrates, particularly glucose.\n\nGlucose is stored in the body as glycogen in the liver and muscles. During prolonged exercise, these glycogen stores can get depleted, leading to fatigue and a significant drop in performance. That's why it's important for athletes to replenish their glycogen stores during exercise.\n\nNow, the question is about the amount and type of carbohydrates to consume during such exercises.\n\nOption A suggests 60 grams of glucose per hour. That sounds like a standard recommendation for carbohydrate intake during exercise. I recall that the typical recommendation is around 30-60 grams of carbohydrates per hour during endurance exercise.\n\nBut this is for elite athletes engaging in high-intensity exercise for more than 2.5 hours, so maybe they need more than the standard 60 grams.\n\nOption B adds fructose to the 60 grams of glucose. Fructose is another type of sugar found in fruits and honey. It's metabolized differently than glucose; it's processed by the liver and can be converted into glucose or stored as glycogen.\n\nMaybe combining glucose and fructose can provide a better energy source or allow for higher rates of carbohydrate oxidation during exercise.\n\nOption C proposes 90 grams of glucose per hour. This is higher than the standard 60 grams. Perhaps elite athletes performing at high intensities for long durations require more carbohydrates.\n\nOption D combines 90 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour. This seems like a substantial amount of carbohydrates.\n\nI need to think about the research on carbohydrate intake during exercise.\n\nI remember a study that showed consuming a mixture of glucose and fructose can lead to higher rates of carbohydrate oxidation compared to glucose alone. This might be beneficial during prolonged high-intensity exercise.\n\nAlso, I think that consuming higher amounts of carbohydrates, like 90 grams per hour, might be necessary for elite athletes who are pushing their bodies to the limit for extended periods.\n\nBut is there a limit to how much carbohydrate the body can absorb and utilize during exercise?\n\nI think that the body can absorb around 60 grams of glucose per hour, but when you add fructose, it uses a different transport mechanism in the gut, allowing for higher total carbohydrate absorption rates, possibly up to 90 grams per hour.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option D seems plausible.\n\nBut I should also consider practical aspects. Consuming 90 grams of carbohydrates per hour might require a lot of fluid, which could lead to gastrointestinal discomfort or other issues.\n\nHowever, elite athletes often train their guts to handle higher carbohydrate intakes during exercise.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific guidelines for elite athletes in prolonged high-intensity exercise.\n\nI think that recent sports nutrition guidelines recommend that during endurance events lasting over 2.5 hours, athletes should aim for carbohydrate intakes of up to 90 grams per hour, and that using a combination of glucose and fructose can be beneficial.\n\nYes, I believe that the current evidence supports the use of multiple transportable carbohydrate sources to maximize carbohydrate oxidation rates during exercise.\n\nSo, based on that, option D seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any evidence against it.\n\nIs there any research showing that consuming more than 60 grams of glucose per hour doesn't provide additional benefits, or could even be harmful?\n\nWell, some studies have shown that higher carbohydrate intakes during exercise can lead to gastrointestinal issues like cramps, nausea, or diarrhea, especially if not enough fluid is consumed.\n\nHowever, elite athletes often adapt to higher carbohydrate intakes through training, and they might be able to handle higher amounts without issues.\n\nMoreover, the combination of glucose and fructose might help mitigate some of these issues by utilizing different absorption pathways in the gut.\n\nTherefore, for elite athletes engaging in prolonged high-intensity exercise, consuming 90 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour is likely the ideal approach to maintain performance.\n\nSo, my answer is D. 90 g glucose plus fructose per hour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
