                    "text": "Alright, I have this logic problem here. It says: \"If the university does not increase financial aid, either the president fails to approve it or the board of trustees prevents it.\" And I need to identify the antecedent of this conditional proposition. The options are:\n\nA. The university increases financial aid.\n\nB. The university does not increase financial aid.\n\nC. The board of trustees prevents it.\n\nD. The president fails to approve it.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what an antecedent is in a conditional statement. In logic, a conditional statement is typically of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. So, P is what comes before the \"then,\" and Q is what follows.\n\nLooking at the given statement: \"If the university does not increase financial aid, either the president fails to approve it or the board of trustees prevents it.\"\n\nHere, the \"if\" part is \"the university does not increase financial aid.\" So, that should be the antecedent.\n\nLet me just double-check. The standard form is \"If P, then Q,\" so in this case, P is \"the university does not increase financial aid,\" and Q is \"either the president fails to approve it or the board of trustees prevents it.\"\n\nSo, the antecedent is P, which is \"the university does not increase financial aid.\"\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is \"the university increases financial aid.\" That would be the negation of the antecedent, right? No, actually, it's the opposite. If the antecedent is \"does not increase,\" then \"does increase\" is the negation.\n\nBut in logic, the antecedent is directly the part after \"if\" and before the \"then,\" which in this case is \"the university does not increase financial aid.\"\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's see, maybe there's some trick here. Is \"the university does not increase financial aid\" the same as \"the university increases financial aid\"? No, obviously not. One is the negation of the other.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the structure again. The statement is a conditional, with a compound consequent: \"either the president fails to approve it or the board of trustees prevents it.\"\n\nSo, in symbolic form, it would be:\n\n\u00acIncrease \u2192 (FailApproval \u2228 PreventBoard)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u00acIncrease: the university does not increase financial aid.\n\n- FailApproval: the president fails to approve it.\n\n- PreventBoard: the board of trustees prevents it.\n\nSo, the antecedent is \u00acIncrease.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The university increases financial aid. That's Increase.\n\nB. The university does not increase financial aid. That's \u00acIncrease.\n\nC. The board of trustees prevents it. That's PreventBoard, which is part of the consequent.\n\nD. The president fails to approve it. That's FailApproval, which is also part of the consequent.\n\nSo, based on this, the antecedent is option B: the university does not increase financial aid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any possibility that \"if the university does not increase financial aid\" is not the antecedent? Well, it clearly is the part after \"if,\" so it should be the antecedent.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes statements can be rephrased or have implicit antecedents, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the logical structure. The conditional is saying that if a certain condition is met (the university does not increase financial aid), then something else follows (either the president didn't approve it or the board prevented it).\n\nSo, the antecedent is that condition, which is the university not increasing financial aid.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's consider the definition of antecedent again. In a conditional statement, the antecedent is the part that follows \"if\" and precedes \"then.\" In this case, \"if the university does not increase financial aid,\" that's the antecedent.\n\nYes, that matches option B.\n\nOption A is the contrary of the antecedent, option C and D are parts of the consequent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: the university does not increase financial aid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
