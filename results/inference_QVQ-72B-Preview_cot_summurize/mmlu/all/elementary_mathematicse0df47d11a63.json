                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this expression: \u22124 + 7 \u2022 3\u00b2. I need to simplify it, and there are options to choose from: A. 437, B. 27, C. 289, D. 59. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on order of operations, but I remember something called PEMDAS. That stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. So, I should follow that order.\n\nFirst, there are no parentheses here, so I move on to exponents. There's 3\u00b2, which is 9. So, the expression becomes \u22124 + 7 \u2022 9. Next is multiplication. I need to multiply 7 and 9, which is 63. So now I have \u22124 + 63.\n\nNow, addition and subtraction. I have to add \u22124 and 63. Negative four plus sixty-three. Let's see, negative four plus four is zero, and then plus sixty is sixty. So, that should be 59.\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. Starting from the beginning: \u22124 + 7 \u2022 3\u00b2. According to PEMDAS, exponents first: 3\u00b2 is 9. Then multiplication: 7 \u2022 9 is 63. Then addition: \u22124 + 63. Negative four plus sixty-three is indeed fifty-nine.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D is 59. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be sure, maybe I should try another approach. Maybe use a calculator to confirm.\n\nAlright, plugging it into a calculator: \u22124 + 7 \u00d7 3\u00b2. First, 3\u00b2 is 9, then 7 \u00d7 9 is 63, then \u22124 + 63 is 59. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the order differently. Sometimes people get confused with the negative sign. Maybe I should consider the negative four as subtracting four. So, it's like adding positive seven and then multiplying by three squared, and finally subtracting four.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. The multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so I should do the multiplication first, then the addition or subtraction based on the order from left to right.\n\nLet me try re-writing it: \u22124 + (7 \u2022 3\u00b2). According to PEMDAS, exponents first, so 3\u00b2 is 9, then multiplication: 7 \u2022 9 = 63, and then addition: \u22124 + 63 = 59.\n\nAnother way: maybe I can calculate 7 \u2022 3\u00b2 first, which is 63, then add \u22124, which is the same as subtracting 4 from 63, giving 59 again.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. It seems straightforward. Maybe I should consider if there are any implicit operations or if the expression could be interpreted differently. But no, it's pretty clear: exponentiation, multiplication, then addition.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any ambiguity in the expression. Is there any chance that the negative sign could be affecting the exponent? Like, is it (\u22124) + 7 \u2022 3\u00b2 or \u2212(4 + 7 \u2022 3\u00b2)? No, because the negative sign is only in front of the 4, not the entire expression.\n\nSo, no, that shouldn't affect the calculation. It's simply subtraction of 4 after performing the multiplication and exponentiation.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The correct answer should be D. 59.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 59} \\]"
