                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a firm hiring labor and selling products. They're paying $15 per worker and selling each unit for $3. The marginal product of the third worker is 10, and I need to figure out which statement is the most true based on that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what marginal product (MP) is. MP is the additional output produced by hiring one more worker. So, for the third worker, it's 10 units. Now, the firm sells each unit for $3, so the marginal revenue product (MRP) of that worker would be the MP multiplied by the price per unit, right? So, MRP = MP * price.\n\nSo, MRP = 10 * $3 = $30.\n\nNow, the firm is paying each worker $15, so for the third worker, the MRP is $30 and the cost is $15. That means, the additional revenue from hiring that worker ($30) is greater than the cost ($15), so it seems like the firm should hire more workers.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase.\n\nB. The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nC. The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will increase.\n\nD. The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nHmm, MRPL is marginal revenue product of labor, which is the same as MRP. So, MRPL = MP * price.\n\nNow, if MRP > wage, it's profitable to hire more workers because each additional worker adds more to revenue than to cost.\n\nWait, but I need to think about the marginal conditions. The firm should hire workers up to the point where MRP equals the wage.\n\nIn this case, for the third worker, MRP is $30 and wage is $15, so MRP > wage, meaning the firm should hire more workers.\n\nBut let's think about the options again.\n\nOption A says the firm should hire more labor so that MRPL will increase.\n\nWait, if MRP is already greater than the wage, hiring more workers would likely increase total profit as long as MRP > wage.\n\nBut, I need to consider the marginal productivity theory. As you hire more workers, MP may decrease due to diminishing marginal returns.\n\nSo, if the firm hires more workers, MP might decrease, but as long as MRP > wage, it's still worth it.\n\nBut in the short run, assuming diminishing marginal returns, hiring more workers would lead to decreasing MP, but if MRP is still above wage, it's still beneficial.\n\nSo, in this case, since MRP > wage, the firm should hire more workers, and MRPL would likely decrease, but the firm should still hire more because MRPL > wage.\n\nSo, option A says hire more to increase MRPL, but actually, MRPL might decrease as you hire more, but it's still beneficial to hire more as long as MRPL > wage.\n\nOption B says hire more to decrease MRPL, which might happen due to diminishing returns, but that's not the primary reason to hire more; the reason is that MRPL > wage.\n\nOption C says hire less to increase MRPL, which might be the case if MRPL is below wage, but in this case, MRPL is above wage, so hiring less would decrease MRPL.\n\nOption D says hire less to decrease MRPL, which again doesn't align with the goal of maximizing profit when MRPL > wage.\n\nSo, the most accurate statement would be that the firm should hire more labor because MRPL > wage, even if MRPL decreases.\n\nBut between options A and B, which one is more accurate?\n\nOption A suggests hiring more to increase MRPL, but in reality, MRPL might decrease as more workers are hired due to diminishing returns.\n\nOption B suggests hiring more to decrease MRPL, which is more accurate because diminishing returns would likely lead to decreasing MRPL.\n\nBut the key point is that as long as MRPL > wage, hiring more is beneficial, regardless of whether MRPL increases or decreases.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is misleading because MRPL might not necessarily increase when more workers are hired.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The goal is to maximize profit, which occurs when MRPL = wage.\n\nSince currently MRPL > wage, the firm should hire more workers until MRPL equals wage.\n\nTherefore, the firm should hire more labor so that MRPL decreases towards the wage rate.\n\nSo, option B seems to align with this reasoning.\n\nOption A says hire more to increase MRPL, which might not be the case; in fact, MRPL might decrease as more workers are hired.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is option B: the firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nWait, but in option B, it says \"so that the MRPL will decrease,\" but actually, by hiring more, MRPL might decrease due to diminishing returns, but the firm should still hire more as long as MRPL > wage.\n\nSo, perhaps the wording of option B is a bit confusing.\n\nOption A suggests hiring more to increase MRPL, which is incorrect because MRPL is likely to decrease with additional hires due to diminishing returns.\n\nOption B suggests hiring more to decrease MRPL, which is more accurate because diminishing returns would cause MRPL to decrease, but the firm should still hire more as long as MRPL > wage.\n\nSo, even though MRPL decreases, as long as it's above the wage, hiring more is beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the most true statement is option B: the firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease, with the understanding that decreasing MRPL is acceptable as long as it remains above the wage.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
