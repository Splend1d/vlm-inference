                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to understand this question about Nagel and his view on absolutism. The options are a bit confusing, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Nagel means by \"absolutism.\" From what I remember, Nagel discusses moral absolutism in his work, particularly in \"The Possibility of Altruism.\" Moral absolutism generally holds that there are absolute moral principles that must always be followed, no matter what the circumstances.\n\nSo, in this context, absolutism is likely referring to the idea that certain actions are always wrong or always required, without exception.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about murder. It says, \"Nagel clarifies that absolutism is the view that we should prevent murder at all costs\" or \"avoid murder at all costs,\" versus \"only sometimes prevent murder\" or \"only sometimes avoid murder.\"\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. prevent murder at all costs\n\nB. avoid murder at all costs\n\nC. only sometimes prevent murder\n\nD. only sometimes avoid murder\n\nI think there's an important distinction between \"prevent\" and \"avoid.\" To prevent murder means to stop someone else from committing murder, whereas to avoid murder means to refrain from committing murder oneself.\n\nGiven that, option A is about preventing murder at all costs, which would mean going to any lengths to stop someone else from killing someone. Option B is about avoiding murder at all costs, which would mean never killing anyone oneself, no matter what.\n\nOptions C and D suggest that we should only sometimes prevent or avoid murder, which seems to contradict the idea of absolutism, since absolutism is about always following certain moral rules without exception.\n\nSo, if absolutism is about always adhering to certain moral principles, then options A and B seem more in line with that, while C and D suggest variability based on circumstances, which would be more in line with moral relativism or consequentialism.\n\nBut between A and B, which one is Nagel referring to?\n\nI need to think about Nagel's position. In \"The Possibility of Altruism,\" he discusses the idea of act and rule utilitarianism, and he also touches on the importance of considering the interests of others beyond just the consequences.\n\nGiven that, I think Nagel is more focused on the idea that certain actions are intrinsically wrong, like murder, and should never be done, regardless of the consequences.\n\nSo, in that case, option B, \"avoid murder at all costs,\" seems to align better with moral absolutism, because it suggests that one should never commit murder, no matter what the circumstances.\n\nOption A, \"prevent murder at all costs,\" might imply that one should always try to stop murder, even if it means doing something morally questionable or harmful, which could be seen as a form of absolutism, but I think it's more accurate to say that absolutism is about refraining from certain actions oneself.\n\nMoreover, preventing murder might require committing other wrongful acts, which absolutism would likely prohibit.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: avoid murder at all costs.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any evidence in Nagel's work that supports this view.\n\nIn \"The Possibility of Altruism,\" Nagel discusses the idea that some actions are intrinsically right or wrong, independent of their consequences. He argues against act utilitarianism, which would allow for exceptions based on outcomes, and seems to lean towards a rule-based ethics that upholds certain moral principles categorically.\n\nGiven that, avoiding murder at all costs would fit with this view, as it upholds the principle that taking another person's life is always wrong, regardless of the potential benefits.\n\nOn the other hand, preventing murder at all costs could lead to scenarios where one might have to violate other moral principles, such as lying or harming innocent people, which absolutism would likely forbid.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option B is the most accurate representation of Nagel's clarification of absolutism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
