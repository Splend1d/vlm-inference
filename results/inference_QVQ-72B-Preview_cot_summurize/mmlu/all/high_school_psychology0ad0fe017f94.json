                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is the least likely to contribute to prejudice. The options are stereotyping, scapegoating, out-group homogeneity, and superordinate goals. Let me try to understand each one.\n\nFirst, stereotyping. I think stereotyping is when you have overly simplified or generalized beliefs about a group of people. Like thinking all teenagers are reckless or all doctors are smart. That sounds like it could lead to prejudice because it's making assumptions about people based on the group they belong to, not on their individual merits. So, that probably contributes to prejudice.\n\nNext, scapegoating. I've heard this term before, especially in history class. It's when a group blames another group for their problems. For example, during economic hardships, some groups might blame immigrants for taking jobs or something like that. That also seems like it would fuel prejudice because you're directing anger and frustration towards a particular group unfairly.\n\nOut-group homogeneity. Hmm, that sounds a bit fancy. I think it means seeing people who are not part of your group as all the same. Like, if you're part of one social group, you might think that everyone else is similar to each other, even if they're from different backgrounds. This can lead to prejudice because you're not recognizing the differences and individuality within other groups.\n\nLastly, superordinate goals. I'm not as familiar with this term. Let me think. I recall that in psychology, there's something called superordinate goals that can help reduce conflict between groups. It's about having a common goal that requires cooperation from different groups. So, if groups work together towards a shared objective, it might help them see each other as partners rather than rivals. That sounds like it could reduce prejudice, not contribute to it.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which one is least likely to contribute to prejudice. So, if superordinate goals help reduce prejudice, then it's probably the least likely to contribute to it. Whereas the other three\u2014stereotyping, scapegoating, and out-group homogeneity\u2014all seem to foster prejudice in different ways.\n\nLet me double-check. Stereotyping is about generalized beliefs, scapegoating is about blaming others, and out-group homogeneity is about seeing everyone else as the same, which can lead to prejudice. Superordinate goals, on the other hand, seem to promote cooperation and understanding between groups, which should decrease prejudice.\n\nSo, based on that, D. superordinate goals is the least likely to contribute to prejudice.\n\nIs there anything I'm missing here? Maybe I should consider if superordinate goals could somehow contribute to prejudice in certain contexts. But from what I remember, they're generally seen as a way to reduce intergroup conflict and prejudice.\n\nFor example, in the Robbers Cave experiment, researchers used superordinate goals to reduce conflict between two groups of boys. By having them work together on tasks that benefited both groups, prejudice and hostility decreased. So, that supports my initial thought that superordinate goals don't contribute to prejudice but rather help overcome it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. superordinate goals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
