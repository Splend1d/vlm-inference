The options are:\n\nA. disappointment and disproportion\n\nB. disbelief and disintegration\n\nC. disengagement and disenchantment\n\nD. distribution and distillation\n\nI need to pick the correct pair that describes secularization. I'm not entirely sure about the exact definition of secularization, but I think it has something to do with the decline of religious influence in society. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what secularization means. Secularization is a process where religious practices, beliefs, and institutions lose their significance and influence in society. This can happen at the individual level, where people become less religious, or at the societal level, where religion plays a smaller role in public life and decision-making.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. disappointment and disproportion\n\nDisappointment seems too personal an emotion to describe a process like secularization. Disproportion might refer to an imbalance, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to secularization. This option doesn't seem to fit.\n\nB. disbelief and disintegration\n\nDisbelief could relate to people no longer believing in religious doctrines, which aligns with secularization. Disintegration might suggest the breaking down of social structures, which could be a consequence of secularization if religion was a unifying force. However, disintegration seems a bit too negative and implies things falling apart, which might not fully capture the nuances of secularization.\n\nC. disengagement and disenchantment\n\nDisengagement sounds like people are stepping back from religious involvement, which fits with secularization. Disenchantment might refer to a loss of belief in mystical or supernatural elements, which also aligns with secularization. This option seems promising.\n\nD. distribution and distillation\n\nDistribution refers to spreading out or allocating something, which doesn't directly relate to secularization. Distillation is a process of purifying or concentrating a substance, which also doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nBetween options B and C, C seems to better capture the essence of secularization. Disbelief is a part of it, but disengagement covers both belief and active participation. Disenchantment also captures the idea of losing faith in the mystical or supernatural aspects of religion.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that the term \"disenchantment\" was used by sociologist Max Weber to describe the rationalization of society, which is related to secularization. So, that reinforces that this is the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. disengagement and disenchantment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
