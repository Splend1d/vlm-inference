                    "text": "So I'm reading this excerpt from Kwame Nkrumah's book \"Neo-Colonialism\" from 1965. He's talking about the struggle against neo-colonialism and explaining what non-alignment means, especially in terms of economic policies. The question is asking which ideology most inspired the national plan he mentions in the second paragraph: Fascism, Social Darwinism, Classical Liberalism, or Socialism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Nkrumah is saying in the second paragraph. He talks about non-alignment being based on cooperation with all states, regardless of their economic systems\u2014whether they're capitalist, socialist, or have a mixed economy. He also mentions that this policy involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested according to a national plan designed by the government of the non-aligned state, keeping its own interests in mind.\n\nSo, the national plan he's referring to is one that guides how foreign investment is used in the country, ensuring it aligns with the country's development goals and doesn't lead to neo-colonial control.\n\nNow, I need to see which of the given options\u2014Fascism, Social Darwinism, Classical Liberalism, or Socialism\u2014most inspired this idea of a national plan that directs economic activities, including foreign investment, in a way that serves the country's interests and prevents external control.\n\nLet's briefly define each option to see which one fits best.\n\nA. Fascism: This is a far-right ideology that is typically characterized by dictatorial power, strong nationalism, and suppression of opposition. It's not known for its emphasis on planning economic activities in a way that promotes cooperation with different types of economies or protects national sovereignty in the context of foreign investment.\n\nB. Social Darwinism: This is the application of the concept of natural selection to human societies, suggesting that stronger societies will dominate weaker ones. It's more about justifying existing inequalities and power structures rather than planning economic activities to prevent external control.\n\nC. Classical Liberalism: This ideology emphasizes individual freedoms, free markets, and limited government intervention. It would likely support free trade and minimal restrictions on foreign investment, which contradicts Nkrumah's idea of a national plan directing how foreign investment is used to serve the country's interests.\n\nD. Socialism: This ideology advocates for social and economic equality, often through government planning and regulation to distribute resources fairly. It emphasizes the importance of the collective good over individual profit and often involves state control over key industries to ensure they benefit the nation.\n\nGiven these definitions, let's see which one aligns best with Nkrumah's ideas.\n\nNkrumah's concept of non-alignment involves cooperating with all types of economies but ensuring that foreign investment is aligned with a national plan that serves the country's interests. This suggests a planned approach to economic development, where the government plays a significant role in directing investment and economic activities to prevent neo-colonialism.\n\nFascism doesn't focus on economic planning in this way; it's more about authoritarian rule and nationalism. Social Darwinism justifies the status quo based on supposed natural selection, which doesn't fit with the idea of planning to prevent external economic control. Classical Liberalism promotes free markets and minimal government intervention, which contradicts the idea of a national plan directing foreign investment.\n\nSocialism, on the other hand, emphasizes government planning and regulation to ensure economic activities benefit the nation as a whole. This seems to align closely with Nkrumah's idea of a national plan that guides foreign investment to serve the country's interests and prevent neo-colonialism.\n\nMoreover, Nkrumah mentions that non-alignment involves cooperation with capitalist, socialist, or mixed economies, and that foreign investment from capitalist countries must be invested according to a national plan. This suggests a willingness to engage with different economic systems but within a framework that ensures the country's sovereignty and development priorities are respected. This approach is consistent with socialist principles of planning and regulating the economy for the common good.\n\nTherefore, the most inspiring ideology behind Nkrumah's national plan is Socialism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D.
