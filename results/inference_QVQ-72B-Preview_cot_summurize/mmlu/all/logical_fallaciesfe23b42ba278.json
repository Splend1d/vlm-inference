But I need to make sure I understand which of these options correctly describes it.\n\nOption A says it's about summarizing an opponent's position in a way that makes it seem silly. Hmm, that sounds more like a straw man fallacy, where you misrepresent someone's argument to make it easier to attack. So, probably not _tu quoque_.\n\nOption B mentions attempting to gain agreement based only on the feelings aroused in the argument. That sounds like an appeal to emotion, maybe pathos in rhetoric. It's not directly about accusing someone else, so I think that's different from _tu quoque_.\n\nOption C says responding to charges of wrongdoing by saying the accuser does the same thing. That seems familiar. It's like when someone points out your mistake, and instead of addressing it, you say, \"Well, you do it too!\" Yeah, that sounds like _tu quoque_. It's a way of evading the issue by throwing back the accusation.\n\nOption D is about arguing against a position based only on negative personal feelings toward the position. That seems more like an ad hominem fallacy, where you attack the person rather than the argument. But it's not exactly the same as _tu quoque_.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is C: responding to charges of wrongdoing by saying the accuser does the same thing. That's the classic definition of _tu quoque_.\n\nLet me just double-check. I recall that _tu quoque_ is often used in arguments when someone is accused of hypocrisy. Instead of addressing the substance of the criticism, the person being accused says, \"But you're doing the same thing!\" which doesn't actually address the original issue. Yeah, that matches option C pretty well.\n\nSo, I'm confident that C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
