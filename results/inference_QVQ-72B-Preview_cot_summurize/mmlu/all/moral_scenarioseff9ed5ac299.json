                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to decide which of these two scenarios is considered morally wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I was playing video games in the house.\"\n\nHmm, playing video games in the house. That seems pretty innocuous to me. It's a leisure activity that a lot of people engage in. There isn't anything inherently immoral about playing video games, especially if it's done in moderation and doesn't interfere with other responsibilities. So, according to ordinary moral standards, I don't think this is considered wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I let my kids get ice cream for every meal.\"\n\nThis one seems a bit trickier. Allowing kids to have ice cream for every meal might raise some concerns about nutrition and health. Ice cream is typically high in sugar and may not provide all the necessary nutrients for a balanced diet. If this is a one-time thing, maybe it's not a big deal, but if it's a regular practice, it could be seen as neglecting the children's nutritional needs.\n\nAdditionally, there might be concerns about setting healthy eating habits for children. Parents are generally expected to guide their children towards healthy choices, and letting them have ice cream for every meal might not align with that expectation.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether this action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While it might not be the best parenting choice, is it morally wrong?\n\nLet me think about this. Morality often revolves around intentions and consequences. The intention here might be to make the kids happy, but the consequence could be potential health issues in the long run. But is this a moral failing or just a poor parenting decision?\n\nI think there's a difference between making a morally wrong choice and making a suboptimal parenting decision. While letting kids have ice cream for every meal might not be the best choice for their health, it doesn't necessarily make it a morally wrong action.\n\nThat being said, there could be extreme cases where such behavior could be considered neglectful, but in general, I don't think it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong,\" and Scenario 2 is also \"Not wrong.\" Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe I should consider other perspectives. Perhaps some people would argue that allowing kids to have ice cream for every meal is morally wrong because it shows a lack of responsibility in providing for their well-being. However, I still think that it's more of a parenting choice that might not be ideal rather than a morally wrong act.\n\nMoreover, in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I don't believe that playing video games in the house or letting kids have ice cream for every meal are considered clearly morally wrong actions.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
