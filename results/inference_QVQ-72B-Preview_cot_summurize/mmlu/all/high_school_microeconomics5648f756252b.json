                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about monopolies compared to perfectly competitive firms. I know that in perfect competition, there are lots of sellers and buyers, and no single one can influence the price. But a monopoly is different because there's only one seller, right? So, let's look at each option.\n\nOption A says that a monopoly will charge the highest price it can on the demand curve. Hmm, that seems a bit too simplistic. I think monopolies can set prices where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, not necessarily the highest possible price. Maybe this isn't accurate.\n\nOption B says that a monopoly has a horizontal marginal revenue curve. In perfect competition, the marginal revenue curve is horizontal because the firm is a price taker. But in a monopoly, since the firm can influence the price, I don't think the marginal revenue curve is horizontal. Maybe it's downward sloping?\n\nOption C mentions that a monopoly has an upward sloping total revenue curve. Wait, total revenue is price times quantity. If the demand curve is downward sloping, then as price increases, quantity decreases, so total revenue might not necessarily always increase. There's got to be a point where increasing price starts decreasing total revenue. So, it's not always upward sloping, is it?\n\nOption D states that a monopoly faces a downward sloping demand curve. That makes sense because in a monopoly, the firm is the sole seller and can set prices higher as quantity demanded decreases. In perfect competition, the demand curve is horizontal because the price is set by the market.\n\nLet me double-check. In perfect competition, there are many sellers and buyers, and the demand curve faced by an individual firm is horizontal, meaning it can sell as much as it wants at the market price. In a monopoly, since there's only one seller, the demand curve is downward sloping, meaning to sell more, the firm has to lower its price.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer. But just to be sure, let's consider if any of the other options could also be correct.\n\nOption A: Monopolies don't just charge the highest price possible. They set prices where marginal revenue equals marginal cost to maximize profits. So, it's not necessarily the highest price on the demand curve.\n\nOption B: The marginal revenue curve for a monopoly is not horizontal. It's typically downward sloping and lies below the demand curve.\n\nOption C: Total revenue for a monopoly isn't always upward sloping. It depends on the price and quantity sold. In fact, as price increases and quantity decreases, total revenue may first increase and then decrease.\n\nSo, after considering all options, option D seems to be the most accurate statement distinguishing a monopoly from a perfectly competitive firm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
