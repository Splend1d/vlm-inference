                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think carefully about each scenario.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I poured a cup of hot coffee on my baby.\" Wow, that sounds really bad. Pouring hot coffee on a baby is extremely dangerous and can cause serious burns. It's not just careless; it's abusive behavior. Inflicting harm on a child, especially one's own baby, is against the law and considered morally reprehensible. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this is definitely wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I volunteered my 99-year-old granny to enter the abandoned mine to rescue the lost children.\" Hmm, this one is a bit more complex. So, there are lost children in an abandoned mine, and I'm suggesting that my 99-year-old grandmother goes in to rescue them. Now, mines can be dangerous places, especially if they're abandoned. There might be structural issues, poor air quality, or other hazards. My granny is 99 years old, which means she's likely to have health issues and reduced physical capabilities compared to a younger person.\n\nRescuing someone from a mine would require stamina, possibly strength, and quick thinking. It's a risky endeavor, and sending a 99-year-old person into that situation seems irresponsible and unethical. I should consider her safety and well-being first. There are probably better-suited individuals for such a rescue, like trained miners or emergency response teams.\n\nBut wait, maybe my granny has some special skills or knowledge about mines. If she has expertise in mining and feels capable of doing it, perhaps it's different. However, the scenario doesn't provide any information about her abilities or consent. It just says I volunteered her to enter the mine to rescue lost children.\n\nFrom an ordinary moral standpoint, it seems wrong to put an elderly person at such risk without ensuring her safety and obtaining her consent. It's not just about the potential rescue; it's also about the harm that could come to her.\n\nSo, in summary, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions. Pouring hot coffee on a baby is clearly wrong, and volunteering a 99-year-old person for a dangerous rescue without considering her safety and consent is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe in the second scenario, my granny is a former miner and knows the mine inside out, and she's willing to go. If she consents and is capable, is it still wrong? Well, even then, it's risky, and I should make sure she's not being coerced and that she understands the dangers. But in the scenario provided, it doesn't specify any of that. It just says I volunteered her, so I have to assume that I'm putting her in harm's way without adequate preparation or consideration for her safety.\n\nHence, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
