                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"What kind of angle is formed where two perpendicular lines meet?\" And the options are A. obtuse, B. acute, C. right, D. invisible. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what perpendicular lines are. I think perpendicular lines are lines that intersect at a 90-degree angle. Right? Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, if two lines are perpendicular, they cross each other forming four angles, all of which should be equal.\n\nLet me think about the different types of angles. There's acute, which are angles less than 90 degrees; obtuse, which are more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees; right angles, which are exactly 90 degrees; and then there's straight angles, which are 180 degrees. Also, there are reflex angles, which are more than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees. But I don't think reflex angles apply here.\n\nSo, if two lines are perpendicular, they form four angles, all of which are 90 degrees. That means all four angles are right angles. So, the answer should be C. right.\n\nWait a minute, is there a trick here? The question says \"where two perpendicular lines meet,\" and maybe there's something tricky about that. Maybe it's not just two lines, but maybe more? Or maybe there's something about the angles formed that I'm missing.\n\nLet me draw this out. If I have two lines that are perpendicular, like a plus sign (+), they cross each other at one point, and they form four angles. Each of these angles should be 90 degrees. So, it's straightforward.\n\nIs there any chance that the angles could be different if the lines aren't exactly perpendicular? Well, no, by definition, perpendicular lines form right angles. So, I don't think that's the case.\n\nMaybe I should consider the properties of perpendicular lines in more detail. In geometry, if two lines are perpendicular, their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. But that's more about coordinate geometry, and the question seems to be more basic, about the nature of the angles formed.\n\nAlso, in terms of Euclidean geometry, perpendicular lines intersect at one point and form four right angles. So, that reinforces my initial thought.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of triangles or something, but that seems unnecessary here. The question is pretty straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's any confusion between perpendicular lines and other types of lines. For example, intersecting lines that are not perpendicular form angles that are not 90 degrees. So, if two lines intersect and are not perpendicular, the angles formed would either be all acute or all obtuse, depending on the angle of intersection.\n\nBut in this case, the lines are perpendicular, so the angles should be exactly 90 degrees, which are right angles.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in some contexts, people might refer to angles that are not right angles as \"oblique\" angles, which include both acute and obtuse angles. But that's not directly relevant to this question.\n\nAlso, there's the concept of perpendicular bisectors in geometry, but again, that seems unrelated to this basic question about angles formed by perpendicular lines.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is clear: two perpendicular lines meet, meaning they intersect, and we need to identify the type of angle formed. Since perpendicular lines form 90-degree angles, the correct choice is C. right.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's eliminate the other options:\n\nA. obtuse: angles greater than 90 degrees. Perpendicular lines form exactly 90-degree angles, so not obtuse.\n\nB. acute: angles less than 90 degrees. Again, perpendicular lines form exactly 90-degree angles, not acute.\n\nD. invisible: that doesn't make any sense in the context of geometry. Angles are measurable and visible if drawn, so this option is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is C. right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. right}} \\]"
