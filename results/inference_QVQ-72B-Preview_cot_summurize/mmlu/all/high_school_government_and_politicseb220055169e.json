Increasing visibility for individual candidates on TV\n\nC. Increasing concentration of ownership in the news media\n\nD. Decreasing cost of political ads on TV\n\nHmm, let's think about each one.\n\nStarting with option A: decreasing liberal bias in the news media. If there's less liberal bias, maybe the news is becoming more balanced or conservative. But would that lead to less diversity in coverage? Maybe if different networks are shifting towards a similar perspective, but I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nOption B: increasing visibility for individual candidates on TV. So, if certain candidates are getting more airtime, maybe that means less coverage for other stories or perspectives. That could lead to less diversity in news coverage because the focus is narrowing down to a few prominent figures.\n\nOption C: increasing concentration of ownership in the news media. This sounds plausible. If a fewer number of companies own more media outlets, they might impose similar editorial policies across their networks, leading to less diverse coverage. Big corporations might prioritize certain types of stories or perspectives that align with their interests, which could reduce overall diversity.\n\nOption D: decreasing cost of political ads on TV. If political ads are cheaper, maybe more political content is being aired, but how does that affect news coverage diversity? Well, perhaps networks are airing more political content because it's cheaper, which could mean less airtime for other types of news stories, thus reducing diversity.\n\nLet me consider which of these is most likely to cause a significant decrease in news coverage diversity.\n\nOption A seems more about ideological balance, which might not necessarily reduce diversity. In fact, if different biases are being reduced, it might lead to more similar coverage across networks, but that might not reduce diversity in terms of topics covered or perspectives presented.\n\nOption B, increased visibility for individual candidates, could lead to more coverage of those candidates and less of other political figures or non-political stories. So, that could reduce diversity.\n\nOption C, media consolidation, is a big factor. When one company owns multiple news outlets, they might push for uniformity in reporting to maintain a consistent brand image or to push a particular agenda. This could definitely lead to less diverse coverage across the board.\n\nOption D, cheaper political ads might encourage more political content on TV, which could mean less time for other types of news, thus reducing diversity.\n\nBetween options B, C, and D, which one is most likely to have the biggest impact on news coverage diversity?\n\nOption B affects the focus on specific individuals, which might shift coverage towards politics and away from other areas, but media companies still cover a wide range of topics beyond politics.\n\nOption C, media consolidation, seems particularly impactful because it changes the fundamental structure of how news is produced and distributed. If a single entity controls multiple news sources, they can dictate what stories get covered and how, leading to homogeneous coverage across their outlets.\n\nOption D, while influencing the amount of political advertising, doesn't directly dictate the diversity of news coverage in the same way that ownership does.\n\nTherefore, I think option C, increasing concentration of ownership in the news media, is the most significant factor contributing to less diverse network news coverage.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider some examples. In recent years, we've seen major media conglomerates like Comcast owning NBCUniversal, Disney owning ABC and ESPN, and ViacomCBS owning CBS and various cable networks. These companies have interests in multiple industries, and their news outlets might avoid covering stories that could harm their other business interests. This could lead to certain stories being underreported or ignored, reducing diversity in coverage.\n\nAlso, with fewer independent news outlets, there's less competition for diverse perspectives and more likelihood of a single narrative being promoted across multiple channels.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
