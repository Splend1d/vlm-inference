                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that five different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive, and I need to find the probability that each of these numbers has a different tens digit. The options are A. 1/4, B. 1/3, C. 1000/52969, and D. 2500/52969.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the range of numbers we're dealing with. The numbers are from 20 to 69, inclusive. That means the tens digit can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 because 20 is the smallest and 69 is the largest. So, there are five different tens digits available in this range.\n\nSince we're choosing five different integers, and we want each of them to have a different tens digit, it seems like we're choosing one number from each possible tens digit category. But wait, there are five tens digits available (2,3,4,5,6), and we're choosing five numbers. So, if we choose one number from each tens digit, that would be one number with tens digit 2, one with 3, one with 4, one with 5, and one with 6.\n\nBut, we need to consider that the numbers are chosen randomly and without replacement, since they are different integers. So, the order in which we pick these numbers matters in terms of probability.\n\nLet me think about the total number of ways to choose five different integers from 20 to 69, inclusive. The numbers range from 20 to 69, which is 50 numbers in total (since 69 - 20 + 1 = 50). So, the total number of ways to choose five different numbers from 50 is the combination of 50 choose 5, which is \\( \\binom{50}{5} \\). But since the order matters in combinations, it's actually \\( \\binom{50}{5} \\times 5! \\), but I think for this problem, it's more straightforward to use permutations directly, which is \\( p(50,5) = \\frac{50!}{(50-5)!} = 50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46 \\). So, the total number of ways to choose five different integers is \\( 50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46 \\).\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, where each of the five numbers has a different tens digit. As I mentioned earlier, there are five tens digits available: 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nLet's see how many numbers there are for each tens digit:\n\n- Tens digit 2: numbers from 20 to 29, inclusive. That's 10 numbers (20,21,...,29).\n\n- Tens digit 3: from 30 to 39, inclusive. Again, 10 numbers.\n\n- Tens digit 4: from 40 to 49, inclusive. 10 numbers.\n\n- Tens digit 5: from 50 to 59, inclusive. 10 numbers.\n\n- Tens digit 6: from 60 to 69, inclusive. 10 numbers.\n\nSo, each tens digit category has 10 numbers.\n\nNow, to have five numbers with different tens digits, we need to choose one number from each of the five tens digit categories. But since we're dealing with permutations (order matters), we need to consider the order in which we pick these numbers.\n\nWait a minute, actually, since we're choosing five numbers, each with a distinct tens digit, and the tens digits are already distinct by design if we choose one from each category, the order in which we pick them doesn't affect the distinctness of the tens digits. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of combinations here.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem specifies different integers and different tens digits, and since we're dealing with selection without replacement, perhaps combinations are more appropriate.\n\nLet me try recalibrating.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose five different integers from 50 is \\( \\binom{50}{5} \\).\n\nThe number of favorable ways is the number of ways to choose one number from each tens digit category. Since there are five tens digit categories and we need to choose one from each, and these choices are independent, the number of favorable outcomes is \\( 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10^5 = 100,000 \\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because that would make the probability \\( \\frac{100,000}{\\binom{50}{5}} \\), and \\( \\binom{50}{5} = 2,118,760 \\), so that would be approximately \\( \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} \\approx 0.0471 \\), or about 1/21, which isn't matching any of the options.\n\nI must have made a mistake here. Let's think again.\n\nActually, when choosing five numbers with different tens digits, we are selecting one number from each of the five tens digit categories. Since there are 10 choices in each category and the selections are independent, the number of favorable outcomes is indeed \\( 10^5 = 100,000 \\).\n\nBut the total number of ways to choose five different numbers from 50 is \\( \\binom{50}{5} = 2,118,760 \\), as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be \\( \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} \\).\n\nLet me simplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 10: \\( \\frac{10,000}{211,876} \\).\n\nThen, divide both by 4: \\( \\frac{2,500}{52,969} \\).\n\nThis is approximately \\( 0.0471 \\), or \\( \\frac{2,500}{52,969} \\), which matches option D.\n\nBut wait, option D is \\( \\frac{2500}{52,969} \\), which seems to match my calculation.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the order matters in the favorable outcomes.\n\nIf order matters, then the number of ways to choose one from each tens digit category is still \\( 10^5 = 100,000 \\), because for each position, there are 10 choices independently.\n\nBut in the total number of ways, if order matters, it should be \\( p(50,5) = 50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46 = 254,251,200 \\).\n\nThen, the probability would be \\( \\frac{100,000}{254,251,200} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{1,000}{2,542,512} \\), which doesn't match any option.\n\nTherefore, it's more accurate to consider combinations rather than permutations, since the problem is about selecting a set of numbers with distinct tens digits, regardless of order.\n\nSo, \\( \\binom{50}{5} = 2,118,760 \\) is the correct total number of outcomes, and \\( 10^5 = 100,000 \\) is the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nThus, the probability is \\( \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} = \\frac{2,500}{52,969} \\), which matches option D.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about selecting the tens digits first and then selecting the units digits.\n\nThere are five tens digits available: 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nThe number of ways to assign these tens digits to the five numbers is \\( 5! = 120 \\) (since each tens digit is used exactly once).\n\nFor each tens digit, there are 10 choices of units digits (0 through 9), but we need to ensure that the numbers are distinct.\n\nWait, but since we're choosing one number from each tens digit category, and each category has 10 numbers, and the numbers must be distinct, the number of ways to choose the units digits is indeed \\( 10^5 = 100,000 \\), as I previously thought.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is \\( 5! \\times 10^5 = 120 \\times 100,000 = 12,000,000 \\), but that doesn't make sense because it's larger than the total number of possible outcomes, which is \\( \\binom{50}{5} = 2,118,760 \\).\n\nI must have made a mistake here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nConsider that we need to choose five numbers, each with a different tens digit.\n\nFirst, choose the tens digits: there are \\( 5! = 120 \\) ways to assign the tens digits to the five positions (since each tens digit is used exactly once).\n\nThen, for each tens digit, choose a units digit: 10 choices for each.\n\nBut since the numbers must be distinct, we need to ensure that no two numbers are the same.\n\nWait, but if we choose one number from each tens digit category, and each category has 10 distinct numbers, and we choose one from each, then the numbers are guaranteed to be distinct.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is indeed \\( 5! \\times 10^5 = 120 \\times 100,000 = 12,000,000 \\), but that can't be right because it's larger than the total number of possible outcomes, which is \\( \\binom{50}{5} = 2,118,760 \\).\n\nI must be double-counting somewhere.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of it as selecting one number from each of the five tens digit categories.\n\nEach category has 10 numbers, and we choose one from each, so \\( 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 100,000 \\) favorable outcomes.\n\nThen, the probability is \\( \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{2,500}{52,969} \\), matching option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, choose the first number: there are 50 choices.\n\nSecond number: must have a different tens digit from the first, so 40 choices (since there are 10 numbers in the same tens digit as the first, so 50 - 10 = 40).\n\nThird number: must have a different tens digit from the first two, so 30 choices (since two tens digits are already used, so 50 - 2*10 = 30).\n\nFourth number: must have a different tens digit from the first three, so 20 choices.\n\nFifth number: must have a different tens digit from the first four, so 10 choices.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable sequences is \\( 50 \\times 40 \\times 30 \\times 20 \\times 10 = 50 \\times 40 \\times 30 \\times 20 \\times 10 = 120,000,000 \\), but again, this is larger than the total number of possible sequences, which is \\( 50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46 = 254,251,200 \\), so the probability would be \\( \\frac{120,000,000}{254,251,200} = \\frac{120,000,000}{254,251,200} = \\frac{120,000,000 \\div 100,000}{254,251,200 \\div 100,000} = \\frac{1,200}{2,542.512} \\), which is approximately 0.47, which doesn't make sense because it should be less than 1.\n\nI must have made a mistake in assuming that there are 40 choices for the second number, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the first approach, I considered choosing one number from each tens digit category, which ensures that all tens digits are different, and there are \\( 10^5 = 100,000 \\) ways to do that, as each category has 10 choices.\n\nThen, the total number of ways to choose five different numbers is \\( \\binom{50}{5} = 2,118,760 \\), and the probability is \\( \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} = \\frac{2,500}{52,969} \\), which matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using permutations.\n\nTotal number of ordered 5-tuples: \\( p(50,5) = 50 \\times 49 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46 = 254,251,200 \\).\n\nNumber of ordered 5-tuples with distinct tens digits: first choose the tens digits in order, which is \\( 5! = 120 \\) ways, and then choose the units digits, which is \\( 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 100,000 \\), so total favorable ordered 5-tuples: \\( 120 \\times 100,000 = 12,000,000 \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\( \\frac{12,000,000}{254,251,200} = \\frac{12,000,000 \\div 1,000}{254,251,200 \\div 1,000} = \\frac{12,000}{254,251.2} \\), which is approximately 0.047, which is the same as \\( \\frac{2,500}{52,969} \\), but that seems off because 12,000,000 is larger than 254,251,200, which can't be right.\n\nI must have made a mistake in assuming that the tens digits can be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways and then multiplied by \\( 10^5 \\).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as selecting one number from each tens digit category, and since the order matters in permutations, the number of favorable permutations is \\( 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 100,000 \\), because for each position, we're choosing from a different tens digit category with 10 choices each.\n\nThen, the total number of permutations is \\( p(50,5) = 254,251,200 \\), so the probability is \\( \\frac{100,000}{254,251,200} = \\frac{100,000 \\div 100}{254,251,200 \\div 100} = \\frac{1,000}{2,542,512} \\), which is approximately 0.00039, which is way smaller than the actual probability.\n\nThis can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the tens digits are being assigned to the five positions in a specific order.\n\nThere are \\( 5! = 120 \\) ways to arrange the five tens digits, and for each arrangement, there are \\( 10^5 = 100,000 \\) ways to choose the units digits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable permutations is \\( 120 \\times 100,000 = 12,000,000 \\), and the total number of permutations is \\( p(50,5) = 254,251,200 \\), so the probability is \\( \\frac{12,000,000}{254,251,200} = \\frac{12,000,000 \\div 1,000}{254,251,200 \\div 1,000} = \\frac{12,000}{254,251.2} \\), which is approximately 0.047, which is the same as \\( \\frac{2,500}{52,969} \\), but that still doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the tens digits are being assigned to the five positions in a specific order, and for each assignment, there are \\( 10^5 \\) ways to choose the units digits.\n\nBut actually, since the units digits are independent for each tens digit, the total number of favorable permutations should be \\( 5! \\times 10^5 = 120 \\times 100,000 = 12,000,000 \\), and the total number of permutations is \\( p(50,5) = 254,251,200 \\), so the probability is \\( \\frac{12,000,000"
