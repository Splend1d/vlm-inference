                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"As of 2020, about how much do you need to make annually to be among the richest one percent in the world?\" And there are four options to choose from: A. $150,000, B. $75,000, C. $35,000, D. $15,000.\n\nHmm, this is interesting. I've always heard about the top one percent being really wealthy, but I'm not sure what the exact income threshold is. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to be in the top one percent of income earners globally. That means I'm comparing my income to that of every other person in the world. With a global population of around 7.7 billion people in 2020, the top one percent would be the top 77 million people in terms of income.\n\nNow, I need to find out what income level would place me in that group. The options provided range from $15,000 to $150,000, which is a pretty wide span. I need to narrow this down.\n\nI recall that in many discussions about global income inequality, there's a lot of emphasis on the top earners making significantly more than the average person. So, option A ($150,000) seems quite high, but is it high enough to be in the top one percent?\n\nWait a minute, let's consider the purchasing power parity (PPP). Different countries have different costs of living, so simply comparing nominal incomes might not give the full picture. However, I think the question is referring to actual reported incomes, perhaps in US dollars.\n\nLet me try to recall any statistics or reports that might have this information. I think the World Inequality Database or reports from organizations like Oxfam might have data on global income distribution.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that Credit Suisse publishes an annual Global Wealth Report that often includes information on global income and wealth distribution.\n\nBut since I don't have access to those reports right now, I'll need to use my judgment and any general knowledge I have on this topic.\n\nLet me consider the distribution of global income. A large portion of the world's population lives on relatively low incomes. For example, in many developing countries, the per capita income is less than $10,000 per year.\n\nIn contrast, in developed countries like the United States, Canada, or Western European nations, average incomes are much higher, often exceeding $50,000 per year.\n\nGiven this disparity, I would imagine that to be in the top one percent globally, one would need to earn significantly more than the average income in developed countries.\n\nLet me see if I can estimate the income required based on the global income distribution.\n\nIf the bottom 50% of the global population earns around 10-15% of the total income, and the middle 40% earns perhaps 30-35%, that would leave the top 10% earning around 55-60% of the total income.\n\nWithin that top 10%, the top 1% would command a significant share, possibly around 20-30% of the total income.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit too deep into the details here. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nPerhaps I can look at the median income in the US and see how it compares to the options given.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the median household income in the US in 2020 was around $68,000. However, that's household income, not individual income. And furthermore, the question is about individual income, not household income.\n\nAssuming that the average household has about 2.5 people, that would mean the per capita income within the household is around $27,200 ($68,000 divided by 2.5).\n\nBut again, this is just the median income in the US, which is a developed country. Globally, the median income is much lower, around $10,000 to $15,000 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the global median income is around $10,000 to $15,000, then the top one percent would have to earn significantly more than that.\n\nLet me try another angle. Maybe I can look at the income required to be in the top one percent of earners in the US, and see how that compares to the global threshold.\n\nIn the US, according to some reports, the top one percent of earners make around $500,000 to $1 million per year. But again, that's for the US only, not globally.\n\nGiven that the US has one of the highest average incomes in the world, the threshold for the top one percent globally should be lower than that in the US.\n\nPerhaps it's around $100,000 to $150,000 per year globally. But that seems quite high when considering the vast majority of the world's population earns much less.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the purchasing power parity. In some countries, $35,000 might go a lot further due to lower costs of living, but in terms of actual income earned in US dollars, it might still be considered a decent income.\n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should just go with my initial gut feeling.\n\nIntuitively, I would say that earning $75,000 per year would place someone in the top one percent globally. It's a good salary in many countries and would certainly put them above the majority of the world's population in terms of income.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe $75,000 is too low. After all, in some countries, people earn much more than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps $35,000 is enough to be in the top one percent, considering that a large portion of the world's population lives on less than $10,000 per year.\n\nBut that seems too low. I think $35,000 might place someone in the top 5% or 10%, but not necessarily the top one percent.\n\nWhat about $15,000? That seems way too low. Even in the poorest countries, there are individuals who earn more than that.\n\nSo, option D ($15,000) is probably incorrect.\n\nBetween $150,000 and $75,000, $150,000 seems excessively high for the top one percent globally. I think $75,000 is a more reasonable estimate.\n\nMoreover, considering that in some European countries and in Australia, the average income is around $50,000 to $60,000, someone earning $75,000 would be above that average and certainly in the higher echelons of global income distribution.\n\nI think the answer is B. $75,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
