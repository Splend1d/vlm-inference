                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, Lind Co. pays salaries every other Friday for the 10 workdays that end on that Friday. Employees don't work on Saturdays and Sundays. The last payroll was on June 18. We need to find out how much salaries expense should be reported in the income statement for June, given that the month-end balance before accruals was $14,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the payroll schedule and how many pay periods are there in June. Since paydays are every other Friday, that means every two weeks. So, typically, there are about 26 pay periods in a year, but let's see how many paydays are in June.\n\nJune has 30 days. If paydays are every other Friday, let's list the Fridays in June: June 4, 11, 18, 25. So, four paydays in June.\n\nThe last payday was on June 18. So, the next payday would be on June 25.\n\nNow, the salaries expense is $10,000 every 10 workdays. Since employees don't work on weekends, we need to calculate the actual workdays in each pay period.\n\nWait, but it says they are paid every other Friday for the 10 workdays then ending. So, each pay period is 10 workdays, and they are paid on the last day of the pay period, which is a Friday.\n\nSo, for example, if the pay period is from Monday to Friday of one week and Monday to Friday of the next week, that's 10 workdays, and they are paid on the second Friday.\n\nBut since they don't work on weekends, we need to make sure we're only counting weekdays.\n\nLet me see: June has 30 days, and paydays are on the 4th, 11th, 18th, and 25th Fridays.\n\nWait, June 4 is a Friday, June 11 is a Friday, June 18 is a Friday, and June 25 is a Friday. So, four paydays in June.\n\nEach payday is for the previous 10 workdays. So, for example:\n\n- June 4 payday covers May 24 to June 4 (10 workdays)\n\n- June 11 payday covers June 7 to June 18 (10 workdays)\n\n- June 18 payday covers June 21 to July 1 (10 workdays)\n\n- June 25 payday covers July 5 to July 16 (10 workdays)\n\nWait, but the last payday was on June 18, and the next would be June 25.\n\nNow, the problem says that on June 30, the month-end balance before accruals was $14,000. So, what does that mean?\n\nIt means that $14,000 has already been recognized as salary expense up to June 30, but there might be some accrued salaries that haven't been paid yet.\n\nSo, I need to find out how much salary expense should be recognized for the entire month, considering the pay schedule and any accruals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total salary expense for the month based on the pay periods.\n\nEach payday is $10,000 for 10 workdays.\n\nThere are four paydays in June: June 4, 11, 18, and 25.\n\nSo, total salary expense would be 4 * $10,000 = $40,000.\n\nBut the problem says that on June 30, the balance before accruals was $14,000. So, perhaps not all paydays have been accounted for yet.\n\nWait, but June 25 is a payday, which is after June 30, since June has 30 days. Wait, June 25 is a Friday, which is before June 30.\n\nWait, June 25 is a Friday, and June 30 is a Wednesday.\n\nSo, the last payday was on June 18, and the next payday is on June 25.\n\nBut the problem says the last payroll was paid on June 18.\n\nSo, perhaps the salary for the period ending June 18 was paid on June 18, and the salary for the period ending June 25 would be paid on June 25.\n\nBut June 30 is a Wednesday, and the month-end balance before accruals is $14,000.\n\nSo, maybe $14,000 is the salary expense recognized up to June 30, but there might be some salary that has been earned by employees but not yet paid.\n\nSo, I need to accrue the salary expense for the days worked but not yet paid.\n\nLet me see: the payday on June 25 is for the period ending June 25, which would be from June 14 to June 25 (10 workdays).\n\nBut June 30 is a Wednesday, and the next payday would be on July 9 (assuming every other Friday).\n\nBut for the purpose of June, the last payday is June 25.\n\nSo, perhaps the salary expense recognized so far is $14,000, and I need to accrue the salary for the period from June 26 to June 30.\n\nWait, but the pay period is 10 workdays ending on the payday.\n\nSo, for the June 25 payday, the period would be from June 14 to June 25 (10 workdays).\n\nThen, from June 26 to June 30 is five workdays (assuming no weekends).\n\nBut, actually, weekends are Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nLet me calculate the workdays from June 26 to June 30:\n\n- June 26: Saturday (not a workday)\n\n- June 27: Sunday (not a workday)\n\n- June 28: Monday\n\n- June 29: Tuesday\n\n- June 30: Wednesday\n\nSo, three workdays from June 26 to June 30.\n\nTherefore, the salary expense for those three days needs to be accrued.\n\nGiven that each 10 workdays correspond to $10,000, then per workday, it's $1,000 per day.\n\nSo, for three workdays, the accrual would be $3,000.\n\nNow, the total salary expense for June would be the sum of the salary expenses recognized ($14,000) plus the accrual ($3,000), totaling $17,000.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that there are four paydays in June, each $10,000, totaling $40,000.\n\nBut according to this calculation, it's $14,000 + $3,000 = $17,000, which doesn't match.\n\nI must be missing something.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nFirst, understand that the salary expense is recognized based on the work performed, not necessarily when it's paid.\n\nSo, for each pay period, the expense is recognized over the workdays in that period.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the salary expense for each pay period in June.\n\nPaydays in June: June 4, 11, 18, and 25.\n\nEach payday is for 10 workdays, and each workday costs $1,000 ($10,000 / 10 days).\n\nNow, let's list the pay periods:\n\n1. June 4 payday: covers workdays from May 24 to June 4.\n\n2. June 11 payday: covers workdays from June 7 to June 18.\n\n3. June 18 payday: covers workdays from June 21 to July 1.\n\n4. June 25 payday: covers workdays from June 14 to June 25.\n\nWait, but June 18 payday covers June 21 to July 1? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nGiven that pay periods are 10 workdays ending on the payday, which is a Friday.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- June 4 payday: workdays from May 24 to June 4.\n\n- June 11 payday: workdays from June 7 to June 18.\n\n- June 18 payday: workdays from June 21 to July 1.\n\n- June 25 payday: workdays from June 14 to June 25.\n\nWait, but June 25 is a Friday, so the period should be from June 14 to June 25, which is 10 workdays.\n\nSimilarly, June 18 is a Friday, so the period should be from June 21 to July 1.\n\nBut June 30 is a Wednesday, so any workdays after June 25 up to June 30 need to be accrued.\n\nSo, from June 26 to June 30:\n\n- June 26: Saturday (not workday)\n\n- June 27: Sunday (not workday)\n\n- June 28: Monday\n\n- June 29: Tuesday\n\n- June 30: Wednesday\n\nSo, three workdays need to be accrued.\n\nGiven that each workday costs $1,000, the accrual is $3,000.\n\nNow, the total salary expense for June would be the sum of the salary expenses for the pay periods in June plus the accrual for the last three days.\n\nBut the problem says that on June 30, the month-end balance before accruals was $14,000.\n\nSo, perhaps $14,000 is the salary expense recognized for the pay periods up to June 30, and I need to add the accrual for the last three days.\n\nSo, total salary expense = $14,000 + $3,000 = $17,000.\n\nBut $17,000 is not one of the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the pay periods.\n\nLet me list the pay periods and their corresponding workdays:\n\n1. June 4 payday: covers May 24 to June 4 (10 workdays)\n\n2. June 11 payday: covers June 7 to June 18 (10 workdays)\n\n3. June 18 payday: covers June 21 to July 1 (10 workdays)\n\n4. June 25 payday: covers June 14 to June 25 (10 workdays)\n\nWait a minute, there seems to be an overlap here.\n\nJune 14 to June 25 is covered by the June 25 payday.\n\nBut June 21 to July 1 is covered by the June 18 payday.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I need a better way to align the pay periods.\n\nGiven that pay periods are 10 workdays ending on a Friday, and employees don't work on weekends.\n\nLet me try to list the workdays for each pay period:\n\n- June 4 payday: workdays from May 24 to June 4 (10 workdays)\n\n- June 11 payday: workdays from June 7 to June 18 (10 workdays)\n\n- June 18 payday: workdays from June 21 to July 1 (10 workdays)\n\n- June 25 payday: workdays from June 14 to June 25 (10 workdays)\n\nBut this seems inconsistent because June 14 to June 25 is already covered by the June 25 payday, and June 21 to July 1 is covered by the June 18 payday.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the dates wrong.\n\nLet me consider that each pay period starts 10 workdays before the payday.\n\nGiven that, and considering weekends are not workdays.\n\nFor example, June 4 is a Friday, so 10 workdays before would be May 24.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nFrom June 4 backwards:\n\n- June 4: Friday (workday)\n\n- June 3: Thursday (workday)\n\n- June 2: Wednesday (workday)\n\n- June 1: Tuesday (workday)\n\n- May 31: Monday (workday)\n\n- May 28: Friday (workday)\n\n- May 27: Thursday (workday)\n\n- May 26: Wednesday (workday)\n\n- May 25: Tuesday (workday)\n\n- May 24: Monday (workday)\n\nSo, May 24 to June 4 is 10 workdays.\n\nSimilarly, June 11 payday: June 7 to June 18 (10 workdays)\n\nJune 18 payday: June 21 to July 1 (10 workdays)\n\nJune 25 payday: June 14 to June 25 (10 workdays)\n\nBut June 14 to June 25 is already covered by the June 25 payday.\n\nWait, but June 14 to June 25 is 10 workdays:\n\n- June 14: Monday\n\n- June 15: Tuesday\n\n- June 16: Wednesday\n\n- June 17: Thursday\n\n- June 18: Friday\n\n- June 21: Monday\n\n- June 22: Tuesday\n\n- June 23: Wednesday\n\n- June 24: Thursday\n\n- June 25: Friday\n\nThat's 10 workdays.\n\nSimilarly, June 21 to July 1:\n\n- June 21: Monday\n\n- June 22: Tuesday\n\n- June 23: Wednesday\n\n- June 24: Thursday\n\n- June 25: Friday\n\n- June 28: Monday\n\n- June 29: Tuesday\n\n- June 30: Wednesday\n\n- July 1: Thursday\n\n- July 2: Friday\n\nThat's 10 workdays.\n\nSo, the pay periods are:\n\n- June 4: May 24 to June 4\n\n- June 11: June 7 to June 18\n\n- June 18: June 21 to July 1\n\n- June 25: June 14 to June 25\n\nBut there is an overlap between June 21 to June 25, which is covered by both June 18 and June 25 paydays.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that each pay period is exactly 10 workdays ending on the payday, and there is no overlap.\n\nSo, for June 18 payday, the period should be from June 21 to July 1, which is after June 30.\n\nWait, but June 30 is before July 1.\n\nSo, for the purpose of June's income statement, the salary expense for June 21 to June 30 needs to be recognized.\n\nBut according to the pay period, the June 18 payday covers June 21 to July 1, but since June 30 is before July 1, perhaps only a portion of that pay period needs to be recognized.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of workdays in June and calculate the total salary expense based on that.\n\nTotal workdays in June:\n\nJune has 30 days, minus weekends.\n\nWeekends in June:\n\n- Saturdays: June 5, 12, 19, 26\n\n- Sundays: June 6, 13, 20, 27\n\nSo, 8 non-workdays.\n\nTotal workdays: 30 - 8 = 22 days.\n\nEach workday costs $1,000 ($10,000 / 10 days per pay period).\n\nSo, total salary expense for June should be 22 days * $1,000 = $22,000.\n\nBut the problem mentions that on June 30, the month-end balance before accruals was $14,000.\n\nSo, perhaps $14,000 is the salary expense recognized for a certain number of workdays, and I need to find out how many workdays are unaccounted for and accrue the salary expense for those days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $14,000 is the salary expense recognized up to June 30, and I need to add the accrual for the days worked but not yet paid.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the total salary expense is $14,000 + accrual.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, total workdays in June are 22, at $1,000 per day, totaling $22,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be $22,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $24,000\n\nB. $22,000\n\nC. $20,000\n\nD. $18,000\n\nSo, option B. $22,000 seems correct.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the problem mentions that the last payroll was paid on June 18, and the month-end balance before accruals was $14,000.\n\nIf total salary expense should be $22,000, then perhaps $14,000 has been recognized, and $8,000 needs to be accrued.\n\nBut according to my calculation, total workdays are 22, at $1,000 per day, totaling $22,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $14,000 is the salary expense recognized for three pay periods, and the fourth pay period needs to be accrued partially.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nPaydays in June: June 4, 11, 18, 25.\n\nEach payday is $10,000.\n\nBut the problem says that the last payroll was paid on June 18, so perhaps only three paydays have been accounted for: June 4, 11, 18.\n\nSo, $10,000 * 3 = $30,000.\n\nBut the problem says that the month-end balance before accruals was $14,000, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the $14,000 is the salary expense recognized for a certain number of workdays.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $14,000 is the salary expense recognized for the pay periods ending before June 30, and I need to accrue for the pay period ending after June 30.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nEach pay period is 10 workdays, and they are paid every other Friday.\n\nSo, in June, there are four paydays: June 4, 11, 18, 25.\n\nEach payday is for 10 workdays, so total workdays"
