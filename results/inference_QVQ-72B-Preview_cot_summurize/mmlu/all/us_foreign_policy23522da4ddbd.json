It indicated the primacy of economic containment.\n\nB. It indicated a desire to engage with the Soviet Union.\n\nC. It indicated a shift towards military containment.\n\nD. It dispensed with the idea of containment.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what NSC 68 is. I think it's a national security council document from the 1950s that outlined a more aggressive approach to containing communism. But let me make sure.\n\nNSC 68, or National Security Council Paper 68, was a top-secret document presented in 1950 that argued for a significant increase in military spending and a more forceful containment of communism worldwide. It was a response to the perceived threats from the Soviet Union and communist expansion.\n\nNow, looking at option A: primacy of economic containment. I know that economic containment was a part of U.S. policy, like the Marshall Plan, which aimed to rebuild European economies and prevent them from falling to communism. But NSC 68 seems more focused on military aspects. So, maybe not primarily economic.\n\nOption B: a desire to engage with the Soviet Union. Hmm, during the Cold War, engagement with the Soviet Union was minimal, and NSC 68 was more about containing and countering their influence. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C: a shift towards military containment. This sounds plausible. NSC 68 advocated for a substantial build-up of U.S. military capabilities to deter and, if necessary, fight the Soviet Union. So, it emphasized military might as a key tool in containment.\n\nOption D: it dispensed with the idea of containment. This contradicts what I know about NSC 68. It actually reinforced the idea of containment, just with more emphasis on military strength.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the correct answer. NSC 68 marked a turning point by shifting towards a more militarily focused approach to containment.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about it again. Was there any aspect of NSC 68 that suggested a move away from containment? No, I don't think so. It was more about strengthening the means to contain communism, particularly through military means.\n\nAlso, I recall that NSC 68 led to increased defense spending and the expansion of the U.S. military's global presence, which aligns with military containment.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
