                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about the exclusionary rule. I need to figure out what it was established to do. The options are pretty different, so I have to be careful here.\n\nFirst, option A says it's about creating \"separate but equal\" facilities to facilitate racial segregation. Hmm, that sounds familiar, but I think that's related to something else. I recall that the \"separate but equal\" doctrine was from the Plessy v. Ferguson case, which was about segregation laws. But that was more about allowing separate facilities for different races as long as they were equal. And the exclusionary rule is about evidence in legal proceedings. So, I don't think that's the right answer.\n\nNext, option B mentions allowing private organizations to restrict their memberships. That seems unrelated to the exclusionary rule. Private organizations can generally restrict their memberships based on their own criteria, within certain legal bounds, like anti-discrimination laws. But again, that doesn't seem connected to the exclusionary rule, which is about evidence in court.\n\nOption C says it limits the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence. Now, that rings a bell. The exclusionary rule is indeed a legal principle that prevents evidence collected in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights from being used in court. It's meant to deter police misconduct and protect individual rights. So, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nLastly, option D talks about denying control of interstate commerce to the states. That sounds like it's related to the Commerce Clause in the U.S. Constitution, which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states. There are cases where the Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to limit state regulations that burden interstate commerce. But again, that's a different area of law from the exclusionary rule, which is about criminal procedure and evidence.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm pretty confident that option C is the correct answer. The exclusionary rule was established to limit the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence. That makes sense because it's a fundamental principle in criminal law to ensure that law enforcement agencies adhere to constitutional safeguards when investigating crimes and collecting evidence.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall some famous cases related to the exclusionary rule. One that comes to mind is Mapp v. Ohio, where the Supreme Court held that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures cannot be used in state prosecutions. That aligns perfectly with option C.\n\nAnother case is Weeks v. United States, which was an earlier instance where the exclusionary rule was applied at the federal level. So, yes, this rule is firmly rooted in constitutional law, aimed at preventing the government from profiting from its own wrongs by using illegally seized evidence to convict defendants.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the exclusionary rule was established to limit the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence. That's option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
