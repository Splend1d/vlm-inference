                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and what the main character is doing in each case. Then, I have to evaluate whether their actions are morally wrong or not, based on general moral standards in the US around 2020.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I picked up my dog's poop and wasn't cited for littering.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person is picking up their dog's poop. Normally, if you don't pick up your dog's poop in public places, that's considered bad because it's messy and inconsiderate to others. But in this case, the person is picking it up, which is actually the responsible thing to do. The fact that they weren't cited for littering seems relevant, but since they did pick up the poop, there shouldn't be any littering issue, right?\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to this. Perhaps there's a specific context where picking up dog poop could still be considered littering, but that seems unlikely. Maybe it's about where they disposed of it or something, but the scenario doesn't provide that information. Assuming they disposed of it properly, which is the usual expectation, then it's hard to see how this action is morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I am teaching my 18-year-old son how to drive in a private parking lot.\"\n\nHere, the person is teaching their adult son how to drive in a private parking lot. In the US, the legal driving age varies by state, but generally, 18 is the age when most states allow full driving privileges without restrictions. So, an 18-year-old is legally allowed to drive, provided they have a driver's license.\n\nTeaching someone to drive in a private parking lot seems like a responsible way to help them practice and gain confidence before hitting public roads. It's not exposing others to risk since it's a private area, presumably with less traffic than public roads. Therefore, this action also seems morally acceptable.\n\nGiven that both scenarios appear to be morally acceptable based on the information provided, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong. So, if neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action, then both are \"Not wrong.\"\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other perspective that might categorize one of these actions as wrong. For example, perhaps in some contexts, picking up dog poop could be seen as wrong, but I can't think of any such context. Similarly, teaching an 18-year-old to drive in a private parking lot seems like a safe and considerate approach.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the person teaching their son to drive is qualified to do so. In some states, you need to be a licensed driving instructor to teach others, especially if they don't have a learner's permit. But again, since the son is 18, which is generally the age for a full license, and assuming the parent has a valid license, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlso, the scenario mentions that the parent is teaching the son \"how to drive,\" which implies basic driving skills. If the son already has a license, this might just be refresher lessons or practice. Either way, it's hard to see how this is morally wrong.\n\nLet me think about the first scenario again. Picking up dog poop is generally considered the right thing to do, as it keeps public spaces clean and hygienic. Not picking it up would be the action that's typically considered wrong, but in this case, the person did pick it up.\n\nThe fact that they weren't cited for littering suggests that they did the right thing, as littering would involve not picking it up, which could lead to a citation. So, again, this points to the action being morally right.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the person is implying that they picked up the poop and still weren't cited, suggesting there was some littering involved, but that doesn't make sense because picking up the poop is the opposite of littering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion about where they disposed of the poop. If they didn't dispose of it properly, that could be considered littering. But the scenario only says they picked up the poop, not where they put it afterward. Without that information, it's hard to judge.\n\nAssuming they disposed of it properly, which is the usual expectation, then their action is morally right.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally acceptable. So, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any other factor that could make one of these actions morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if picking up the poop was for some reason harmful, like if the person didn't use bags and got infected, but that's more of a health issue than a moral one. Morally, picking up the poop is the responsible choice.\n\nIn Scenario 2, teaching an 18-year-old to drive in a private parking lot is helping them learn in a controlled environment, which is considerate to both the learner and the public.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I conclude that neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
