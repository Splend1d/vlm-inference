                    "text": "So I have this subtraction problem: 2,396 minus 1,709. I need to find the difference between these two numbers. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nA. 687\n\nB. 687\n\nC. 1,493\n\nD. 1,695\n\nHmm, interesting. I see that options A and B are both 687. Maybe there's a typo there, but I'll proceed anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to subtract 1,709 from 2,396. I can do this by breaking down the numbers place by place, starting from the units place.\n\nLet's write it down:\n\n2,396\n\n-1,709\n\n------\n\nLet's align the numbers by their place values.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n6 (units) minus 9 (units).\n\nBut 6 is less than 9, so I need to borrow from the tens place.\n\nThe tens place has 9, so I'll borrow 1 from there, making the units place 16 minus 9.\n\n16 - 9 = 7.\n\nNow, the tens place is 8 (since I borrowed 1 from 9, making it 8).\n\nNext, 8 minus 0 = 8.\n\nMoving on to the hundreds place: 3 minus 7.\n\nWait, but the hundreds place in the second number is 7, and in the first is 3.\n\nBut 3 is less than 7, so I need to borrow from the thousands place.\n\nThe thousands place has a 2, so I'll borrow 1 from there, making the hundreds place 13 minus 7.\n\n13 - 7 = 6.\n\nNow, the thousands place is 1 (since I borrowed 1 from the 2), so 1 minus 1 = 0.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n2,396\n\n-1,709\n\n------\n\n0 6 8 7\n\nSo, the difference is 687.\n\nLooking back at the options, both A and B show 687. It seems like there might be a mistake in the options because C and D are different numbers.\n\nBut based on my calculation, the correct answer should be 687.\n\nMaybe I should check again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLet me try another method, perhaps using addition to verify.\n\nIf I add 1,709 and 687, it should give me 2,396.\n\nLet's add 1,709 + 687.\n\n1,709\n\n+ 0,687\n\n------\n\n2,396\n\nYes, that matches the original number. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 687.\n\nEven though both A and B are 687, I think the intention was to have different options, but perhaps there was a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach the problem, but based on standard subtraction methods, 687 is indeed the correct difference.\n\nSo, I'll go with A (687) as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{687} \\]"
