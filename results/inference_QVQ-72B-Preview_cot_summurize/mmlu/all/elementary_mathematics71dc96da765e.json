                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the mean of the data set 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, 19. And there are options A. 9, B. 15, C. 30, D. 11. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand what mean is. I think mean is the average of all the numbers, right? So, to find the mean, I should add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are.\n\nAlright, first step: add up all these numbers. Let's see: 18 plus 9 is 27, plus another 9 is 36, plus 10 is 46, plus 11 is 57, plus 14 is 71, plus 30 is 101, and finally plus 19 is 120. So, the total sum is 120.\n\nNow, how many numbers are there? Let's count them: 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, 19. That's 8 numbers in total.\n\nTo find the mean, I need to divide the total sum by the number of values. So, 120 divided by 8. Let me do that division: 120 \u00f7 8 equals 15.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 15 seems to be the correct answer. But just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can check if there's any outlier or something that might affect the mean.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, 19. Thirty seems a bit higher compared to the others, but it's not extremely out of place. Still, it's affecting the mean somewhat.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can arrange the numbers in order to see if that helps. Let's arrange them from smallest to largest: 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 30. Yeah, that looks orderly.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the median as well, but no, the question specifically asks for the mean. So, I think I'm on track.\n\nSo, sum is 120, count is 8, mean is 15. That should be the answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can cross-verify this by estimating. If I take 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, and 30, most numbers are around 10 to 15, with 30 being higher. So, the mean being 15 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can group some numbers to check. For example, 9 and 9 average to 9, 10 is 10, 11 is 11, 14 is 14, 18 is 18, 19 is 19, and 30 is 30. Adding those up and dividing by 8 should still give 15.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: I can try to find the total and then divide. Let's see, 9 + 9 is 18, plus 10 is 28, plus 11 is 39, plus 14 is 53, plus 18 is 71, plus 19 is 90, plus 30 is 120. Yep, same as before.\n\nNow, dividing 120 by 8 again: 8 times 15 is 120. Yes, exactly 15.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with the answer. The mean of this data set is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
