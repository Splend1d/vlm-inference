Let me go through each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that statehood requires the entity in question to not be an aggressor and to be peaceful. Hmm, that seems a bit vague. I don't think statehood is determined by whether a country is aggressive or not. Even if a country has been aggressive in the past, it can still be considered a state. So, I'm\u6000\u7591\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u786e\u3002\n\nOption B suggests that statehood requires recognition by the majority of other nations. While recognition by other states is important, I don't think it's necessarily about a majority. For example, if a few key states recognize a new state, that might be sufficient for it to function internationally. Plus, there are cases where a state is widely recognized but not by everyone, so having a majority might not be the deciding factor. Maybe this isn't the right criterion.\n\nOption C lists several points: a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into foreign relations. This sounds familiar. I think these are known as the Montevideo Convention criteria for statehood. Let me double-check that. Yes, the Montevideo Convention outlines these four elements as the basic requirements for statehood. So, this seems like a solid choice.\n\nOption D mentions stable and indissoluble borders and recognition. While having stable borders is important for a state, I don't think \"indissoluble\" is necessarily a requirement. Borders can change over time through treaties and agreements, and that doesn't disqualify a state. Also, recognition is part of it, but again, it's not just about recognition; it's about meeting certain criteria.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe Option C is the correct answer. It directly refers to the Montevideo Convention's criteria for statehood, which are widely accepted in international law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
