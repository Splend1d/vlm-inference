                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about negative externalities in production and how to achieve the socially optimal quantity of output. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, what's a negative externality in production? It's when the production of a good imposes costs on society that aren't reflected in the market price. Like, say a factory pollutes the air while making widgets; that pollution is a negative externality because it affects people's health and the environment, but the factory doesn't have to pay for that damage directly.\n\nSo, in this situation, the free market might produce too much of the good because the producers aren't accounting for the full social costs of their production. That means the market quantity is higher than the socially optimal quantity.\n\nNow, the question is asking how to achieve the socially optimal quantity of output in this scenario. The options are:\n\nA. Free market capitalism\n\nB. Placing limits on the quantity that can be produced\n\nC. Government purchases of the good\n\nD. Setting a minimum on the quantity that can be produced\n\nLet's consider each option.\n\nA. Free market capitalism: Well, as we just discussed, in the presence of a negative externality, the free market will likely produce too much of the good because the producers aren't considering the external costs. So, relying on the free market probably won't lead to the socially optimal quantity.\n\nB. Placing limits on the quantity that can be produced: This sounds like setting a maximum amount that can be produced, maybe through quotas or production caps. If the market is producing too much, setting a limit that restricts production could help align production with the socially optimal level.\n\nC. Government purchases of the good: If the government buys the good, that might affect the market equilibrium. But in the case of a negative externality, I'm not sure how directly purchasing the good would reduce the overproduction. Maybe if the government buys up some of the supply, it could reduce the quantity available in the market, but that seems indirect and perhaps not the most efficient way to target the externality.\n\nD. Setting a minimum on the quantity that can be produced: This seems counterintuitive. If there's overproduction due to a negative externality, setting a minimum quantity would likely make the problem worse by encouraging even more production.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems like the most straightforward way to achieve the socially optimal quantity of output in the presence of a negative externality in production. By placing limits on the quantity that can be produced, the government can restrict production to a level that accounts for the external costs.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this more deeply. Are there any potential downsides to placing limits on production? For example, if the limits are too strict, it might lead to shortages or higher prices, which could harm consumers. Also, enforcing such limits might be challenging, especially if there are many producers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other policies that could achieve the same goal more efficiently. For instance, imposing taxes on producers equivalent to the external costs could internalize the externality, leading producers to voluntarily reduce their output to the socially optimal level. This approach might be more efficient because it allows the market to find its own balance while ensuring that external costs are accounted for.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about achieving the socially optimal quantity, and among the given options, placing limits on production seems like the most direct way to reduce overproduction caused by negative externalities.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose the socially optimal quantity is less than the market equilibrium quantity due to the negative externality. Then, setting a maximum quantity (a limit) would align with that goal. On the other hand, setting a minimum quantity would likely push production beyond the optimal level, which is the opposite of what we want.\n\nAdditionally, government purchases might affect the market, but they don't directly address the externality unless the government is purchasing the externality itself, which doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nFree market capitalism, as option A, is likely to result in overproduction, as we discussed earlier, because the market doesn't account for external costs.\n\nTherefore, the best answer among the options provided is B: placing limits on the quantity that can be produced. This approach can help achieve the socially optimal quantity by restricting production to a level that considers the external costs imposed by the production process.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
