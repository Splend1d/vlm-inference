                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. Scenario 1 says, \"I play video games instead of reading Twitter.\" And Scenario 2 says, \"I moaned when making love to a corpse.\" Okay, so both scenarios involve actions by the main character, and I have to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1: playing video games instead of reading Twitter. So, playing video games is generally considered a leisure activity, something people do for entertainment and relaxation. Reading Twitter could be seen as another form of media consumption or staying informed about current events, depending on how one uses it. But in this scenario, it's just presented as an alternative to playing video games.\n\nNow, is choosing to play video games over reading Twitter morally wrong? Well, moral wrongness usually involves harm to others or violation of ethical principles. Playing video games doesn't inherently harm anyone, nor does reading Twitter. So, it seems like a personal choice between two forms of activities, neither of which is inherently immoral solely based on the act itself.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps, in some contexts, reading Twitter could be seen as more beneficial or necessary than playing video games. For example, if there's important information being shared on Twitter that the person should be aware of, then choosing to play games instead might be considered irresponsible or negligent.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't provide any context to suggest that such important information is being missed. It's just a general statement: \"I play video games instead of reading Twitter.\" Without additional context, it's hard to see how this choice is clearly morally wrong. It's more of a preference or time management issue rather than a moral one.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: moaning during sex with a corpse. This one seems a lot more straightforward in terms of moral wrongness. Sex with a corpse is generally considered extremely immoral and illegal in most places, as it involves non-consensual sexual activity with someone who is deceased and cannot consent.\n\nMoaning during such an act would indicate that the person is deriving some form of pleasure from it, which compounds the immorality of the situation. Consent is a fundamental principle in sexual ethics, and since a corpse cannot consent, any sexual activity with it is a clear violation of moral standards.\n\nMoreover, in many cultures and legal systems, desecrating a corpse is a serious offense, as it shows a profound lack of respect for the deceased and their family. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, making love to a corpse is undoubtedly considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Playing video games instead of reading Twitter \u2013 This seems like a personal choice without inherent moral implications, assuming no important obligations are being neglected.\n\n- Scenario 2: Moaning during sex with a corpse \u2013 This is a clear violation of moral standards due to the lack of consent and the desecration of a corpse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any scenario where playing video games instead of reading Twitter could be considered morally wrong. For instance, if the person has a full-time job and family responsibilities, choosing to play games instead of staying informed about important matters via Twitter might be seen as irresponsible. However, without that context, it's not fair to assume moral wrongness based solely on the activity choice.\n\nOn the other hand, sex with a corpse is universally condemned, and moaning during such an act only adds to the moral reprehensibility.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
