                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Match Co. makes a product that costs $140 per unit to make, and they can sell up to 400,000 units at $200 each. There are some selling costs like $10 per unit for shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50,000 per year. Now, Reno Co. wants to buy 5,000 units on a special order, and there would be no shipping costs for this order. We need to find the lowest price per unit that Match should accept for these 5,000 units.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cost breakdown of the product. The total cost per unit is $140, which breaks down into:\n\n- Direct materials: $60\n\n- Direct labor: $10\n\n- Variable overhead: $40\n\n- Fixed overhead: $30\n\nNow, when Match sells these units in their regular market, they sell them at $200 each. Additionally, there are selling costs:\n\n- $10 per unit for shipping\n\n- A fixed licensing fee of $50,000 per year\n\nSo, the total selling cost per unit in the regular market is $10 for shipping plus their share of the fixed licensing fee.\n\nBut for the special order from Reno Co., there are no shipping costs, which is a perk. So, the only selling cost would be the portion of the fixed licensing fee.\n\nWait a minute, but the licensing fee is fixed per year, so it doesn't change with the number of units sold. But since Reno's order is in addition to the regular 400,000 units, maybe the licensing fee has already been covered by those sales.\n\nBut I need to think carefully about how the fixed costs are allocated.\n\nIn the regular operation, Match sells up to 400,000 units, and they have a fixed licensing fee of $50,000 per year. So, the fixed cost per unit in the regular sales is $50,000 / 400,000 units = $0.125 per unit.\n\nBut now, there's an additional order of 5,000 units from Reno Co. Since this is a special order, maybe the fixed licensing fee shouldn't be allocated to these additional units because it's already been covered by the regular sales.\n\nWait, but in cost accounting, fixed costs are often allocated based on the capacity or the actual production level. Here, the maximum plant capacity is 400,000 units per year, and they're selling all 400,000 units.\n\nBut the special order is for an additional 5,000 units, so they're producing beyond the regular capacity. Does that mean they need to consider additional fixed costs?\n\nHmm, maybe not necessarily. If the fixed costs are truly fixed, they don't change with the level of production within the relevant range. But producing beyond capacity might require additional fixed costs, like overtime pay, additional equipment rental, etc.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify any changes in fixed costs for producing up to 400,000 units. It says that 400,000 units is the maximum plant capacity, and they're already selling all of that. So, perhaps producing an additional 5,000 units doesn't require additional fixed costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed overhead of $30 per unit includes the allocation of fixed costs like factory rent, equipment depreciation, etc., which are spread over the 400,000 units.\n\nBut since the special order is for an additional 5,000 units, and assuming that producing these units doesn't require significant additional fixed costs (like no need for extra machinery or space), then perhaps the fixed overhead per unit for the special order is still $30.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nFirst, identify the relevant costs for the special order.\n\nRelevant costs are those that differ between alternatives or are avoided if the order isn't accepted.\n\nIn this case, the special order has no shipping costs, which is a variable selling expense, so that's a saving.\n\nThe fixed licensing fee is fixed per year, so it doesn't change whether Match accepts the special order or not. Therefore, it's not relevant to the decision.\n\nSo, for the special order, the relevant costs are:\n\n- Direct materials: $60\n\n- Direct labor: $10\n\n- Variable overhead: $40\n\n- Fixed overhead: $30\n\nTotal relevant cost per unit: $140\n\nWait, but if the fixed overhead is already covered by the regular sales, maybe it shouldn't be included in the special order's cost.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf Match is already producing and selling 400,000 units, their fixed overhead is fully allocated to those units at $30 per unit.\n\nFor the additional 5,000 units, if no additional fixed costs are incurred (i.e., they can produce these units without increasing fixed costs), then the fixed overhead shouldn't be included in the relevant cost for the special order.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, for the special order, the relevant costs would be:\n\n- Direct materials: $60\n\n- Direct labor: $10\n\n- Variable overhead: $40\n\nTotal relevant cost per unit: $110\n\nTherefore, the lowest price per unit that Match should accept is $110.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this.\n\nIf Match accepts the special order at $110 per unit, they would cover their variable costs (direct materials, direct labor, variable overhead), but not their fixed overhead.\n\nHowever, since their fixed overhead is already being covered by the regular 400,000 units, they don't need to cover it again with the special order.\n\nTherefore, as long as the special order covers the variable costs and contributes something to fixed costs and profit, it's beneficial.\n\nBut in this case, since the fixed costs are already covered, they can accept the special order as long as it covers the variable costs, which are $110 per unit.\n\nSo, the answer should be $110 per unit.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any other costs or factors that I might have missed.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions that there are no shipping costs for the special order, which is good.\n\nAlso, the fixed licensing fee is $50,000 per year, but since it's fixed and doesn't change with the special order, it shouldn't affect the per-unit cost for the special order.\n\nTherefore, the only relevant costs are the variable costs per unit, which sum up to $110.\n\nHence, the lowest price per unit that Match should accept is $110.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $110\n\nB. $140\n\nC. $190\n\nD. $200\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any opportunity costs or other considerations.\n\nSuppose that producing the additional 5,000 units for Reno Co. would require resources that could otherwise be used to produce and sell more units in the regular market.\n\nHowever, Match is already producing and selling 400,000 units, which is their maximum capacity. So, to produce the additional 5,000 units, they might have to forego some regular production, but the problem states that they have a ready market for all 400,000 units.\n\nWait, does that mean they're already selling 400,000 units, and now Reno Co. wants an additional 5,000 units?\n\nIf that's the case, and they can produce up to 400,000 units, but Reno wants an additional 5,000, does that mean they have to increase their capacity?\n\nThe problem says that the maximum plant capacity is 400,000 units per year, and they have a ready market for all 400,000 units.\n\nBut Reno wants 5,000 more units. So, perhaps they can produce up to 400,000 units, but since they're already selling 400,000 units, to accept Reno's order, they might need to produce beyond that, which could incur additional costs.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify any additional fixed costs for producing beyond 400,000 units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can produce the additional 5,000 units without increasing fixed costs, perhaps by working overtime or adjusting schedules.\n\nIn that case, the fixed overhead shouldn't be allocated to these additional units, as it's already covered by the regular 400,000 units.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cost per unit for the special order is indeed $110.\n\nHence, the lowest price they should accept is $110 per unit.\n\nAlternatively, if producing the additional 5,000 units requires incurring additional fixed costs, then those fixed costs should be allocated to the special order, increasing the relevant cost per unit.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention any additional fixed costs, I'll assume that the fixed overhead of $30 per unit is already allocated to the regular 400,000 units, and no additional fixed costs are incurred for the special order.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $110 per unit.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. $110.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 110} \\]"
