The options are product safety, consumer rights, environmental policies, and price-fixing. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is about how companies manage their business operations in a way that benefits society and the environment, not just their bottom line. So, it's about being ethical and considering the impact of their actions on people and the planet.\n\nOption A is product safety. That sounds like something that should be a part of CSR, right? Companies should make sure their products are safe for consumers to use, free from hazards, and meet certain standards. If they don't, it could harm people, which goes against the whole idea of being socially responsible. So, I think product safety is definitely a characteristic of CSR.\n\nOption B is consumer rights. This seems relevant too. CSR should encompass respecting and protecting the rights of consumers, such as their right to privacy, accurate information, and fair treatment. Companies that ignore consumer rights are probably not being very socially responsible. So, I'd say consumer rights are part of CSR.\n\nOption C is environmental policies. This one seems straightforward. CSR often includes efforts to minimize environmental impact, reduce pollution, conserve resources, and maybe even contribute positively to the environment. Having environmental policies in place would be a key aspect of CSR. So, this should be a characteristic of CSR.\n\nNow, option D is price-fixing. Hmm, I've heard of price-fixing before. It's when companies agree to set prices at a certain level, often to avoid competition and maintain higher prices than the market might otherwise allow. That sounds shady, doesn't it? It's like cheating or colluding against consumers.\n\nWait a minute, if price-fixing is about companies working together to set prices artificially high, that would be against free-market competition, and it would likely harm consumers by making products more expensive. That doesn't sound very socially responsible. In fact, it seems quite the opposite.\n\nI recall that in many countries, price-fixing is illegal because it distorts the market and violates antitrust laws. These laws are in place to promote fair competition and protect consumers from being exploited by powerful companies.\n\nSo, if CSR is about being ethical and considering the well-being of society and the environment, then price-fixing, which involves manipulating prices and potentially harming consumers, would go against those principles.\n\nTherefore, I think price-fixing is not a characteristic of corporate social responsibility.\n\nLet me just double-check. Maybe there's some context where price-fixing could be considered socially responsible? Hmm, I can't think of any. It seems pretty clear-cut that price-fixing is a practice that benefits companies at the expense of consumers, which is the opposite of what CSR aims to achieve.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer should be D. Price-fixing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
