                    "text": "So I've got this real estate contract dispute between Beeson and Sloan. Beeson agreed to buy a property from Sloan for $250,000, with a deposit of $12,500 and the rest due at closing on December 1. The property was zoned for commercial use, specifically for building a shopping mall. But then, on November 24, the city council rezoned the property for single-family residential use only. Because of this, Beeson refused to go through with the purchase. Now, Sloan is suing for specific performance, meaning Sloan wants the court to force Beeson to complete the purchase as per the contract.\n\nSloan is arguing that under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of any changes in the property's value or status should fall on the buyer once the contract is signed. So, since Beeson signed the contract, any zoning changes that happen before closing should be Beeson's problem, not Sloan's.\n\nOn the other hand, Beeson is saying that enforcing the contract would be unfair and oppressive to him because the property can no longer be used for its intended purpose\u2014a shopping mall\u2014which was likely the basis for the purchase price and his investment plans.\n\nNow, the question is asking what would most likely be the reason for a judgment in favor of Beeson, meaning the court decides not to enforce the contract and allows him to walk away without buying the property.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Sloan assumed the risk.\n\nB. Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\n\nC. Legal title remained in Sloan.\n\nD. Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nOption A: Sloan assumed the risk.\n\nWell, in real estate contracts, generally, there's this concept called \"equitable conversion,\" which means that once a contract to buy real estate is signed, the buyer becomes equitably entitled to the property, and the seller holds the property in trust for the buyer. As a result, any risks associated with the property, like damage or changes in zoning, typically pass to the buyer.\n\nSo, if the court applies the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of the zoning change would fall on Beeson, and Sloan wouldn't be responsible for it. But that seems to favor Sloan, not Beeson.\n\nWait, but the question is about a judgment in favor of Beeson, meaning against enforcement of the contract. So, if the court decides that Sloan assumed the risk, that would likely lead to enforcing the contract, not relieving Beeson from it. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B: Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\n\nUnjust enrichment occurs when one party benefits at the expense of another without a legal basis for doing so. In this case, if the court were to enforce the contract and make Beeson buy the property, knowing that its value has significantly decreased because it can't be used for commercial purposes, Sloan might be seen as being unjustly enriched by receiving the full purchase price for a property that is now less valuable due to the zoning change.\n\nBut, typically, in contract law, the principle is \"pacta sunt servanda,\" meaning agreements must be kept. So, unless there's a good reason not to enforce the contract, the court would likely enforce it.\n\nHowever, equity considers fairness, and if enforcing the contract would cause significant unfairness or hardship to Beeson, the court might refuse to enforce it to prevent unjust enrichment to Sloan.\n\nSo, this could be a possible reason for the court to rule in favor of Beeson.\n\nOption C: Legal title remained in Sloan.\n\nYes, legally, until the closing date, title to the property is still in Sloan. But does that matter here?\n\nWell, under the doctrine of equitable conversion, even though legal title is still with Sloan, equitable title has passed to Beeson once the contract was signed. So, any benefits and burdens of ownership, like zoning changes, typically pass to the buyer.\n\nTherefore, the fact that legal title is still in Sloan doesn't necessarily mean that Beeson shouldn't bear the risk of the zoning change.\n\nSo, this option doesn't seem to strongly support a judgment in favor of Beeson.\n\nOption D: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n\nThis seems related to the idea that enforcing the contract would be unfair or oppressive to Beeson because the fundamental basis of the deal has changed\u2014the property can no longer be used for commercial development.\n\nCourts sometimes refuse to enforce contracts when doing so would cause extreme hardship or when the circumstances have changed in a way that makes the contract significantly different from what was originally agreed upon.\n\nIn this case, the zoning change significantly affects the value and use of the property, which might be a sufficient reason for the court to refuse to enforce the contract.\n\nSo, this also seems like a plausible reason for the court to rule in favor of Beeson.\n\nNow, between options B and D, which one is most likely?\n\nOption B focuses on unjust enrichment to Sloan, meaning that enforcing the contract would allow Sloan to keep the full purchase price for a property that is now less valuable due to the zoning change.\n\nOption D focuses on the hardship or unfairness to Beeson, who agreed to buy the property for a specific use that is now prohibited.\n\nBoth are relevant, but perhaps option D captures the essence better because it's about relieving Beeson from the contract due to changed circumstances that make the contract unfair to him.\n\nMoreover, in contract law, when there's a fundamental change in circumstances that was unforeseen and beyond the control of the parties, the contract may be discharged on the grounds of frustration of purpose or impracticability.\n\nIn this scenario, the zoning change was beyond the control of both parties and significantly altered the property's value and usability, which could be grounds for relieving Beeson from the contract.\n\nTherefore, option D seems the most appropriate reason for a judgment in favor of Beeson.\n\nLet me check again: \"If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because...\"\n\nA. Sloan assumed the risk.\n\nNo, that would favor Sloan.\n\nB. Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\n\nThis is a possible reason, but it's more about Sloan benefiting unfairly from the situation.\n\nC. Legal title remained in Sloan.\n\nNot likely, since equitable conversion suggests that Beeson bears the risk.\n\nD. Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n\nThis seems to capture the essence of the court's potential decision, considering the fairness and the significant change in circumstances.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
