                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the opening theme song of TV's \"All in the Family.\" It's asking which U.S. president is mentioned by name in that song. The options are Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman, Herbert Hoover, and Richard Nixon. Hmm, I need to recall the lyrics of the theme song to figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I remember that \"All in the Family\" was a popular television show in the 1970s, and the theme song was sung by Carroll O'Connor, who played Archie Bunker. The song is kind of nostalgic and reflective about the past. Let me try to recall the lyrics.\n\nI think the song starts with something like, \"There's a man lives in the city, he's a simple kind of guy. But he's got his head up in the clouds, and he won't come down.\" Wait, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I'm confusing it with another show.\n\nLet me think again. Oh, wait, I think the actual first line is, \"There's a man lives in the city, he's a simple kind of guy. But he's got his head up in the clouds, and he won't come down.\" Hmm, that still seems familiar, but I might be mixing it up.\n\nLet me try to recall the chorus. I think it goes, \"And now those days are all gone, and we wonder what went wrong. Everything was simpler then, oh, wouldn't you like to go back again, to when you were young?\" Wait, that doesn't seem exactly right either.\n\nMaybe I should think about the part where the president's name is mentioned. I recall that there's a line about \"those were the days when the grass was green, and the president was Harry S. Truman.\" Oh, yes! That rings a bell. So, according to this, the president mentioned in the theme song is Harry Truman.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check. I know that Harry Truman was the U.S. president from 1945 to 1953. \"All in the Family\" aired from 1971 to 1979, so referencing Truman would make sense as a nostalgic element, looking back to a earlier time.\n\nLet me consider if any of the other presidents listed could possibly be mentioned in the song. Calvin Coolidge was president from 1923 to 1929, Herbert Hoover from 1929 to 1933, and Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1974. Given the time period of the show and the nostalgic tone of the song, mentioning Nixon seems unlikely because he was president during part of the time the show was on air. It wouldn't make much sense to look back nostalgically to a time when Nixon was president while the show was being aired during his presidency.\n\nMoreover, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover were presidents in the early 20th century, which might be too far back for the theme song's intended nostalgia. Truman, on the other hand, was president in the 1940s and early 1950s, which was a bit more recent and likely within the lifetime of the character Archie Bunker, who was born in the early 1900s.\n\nJust to confirm, I can think about the lyrics again. I recall the line, \"Those were the days when the grass was green, and the president was Harry S. Truman.\" That seems pretty straightforward. So, based on that, the correct answer should be Harry Truman.\n\nI don't remember any mention of Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, or Richard Nixon in the theme song. The reference is clearly to Truman, so I'm confident that B. Harry Truman is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Harry Truman}} \\]"
