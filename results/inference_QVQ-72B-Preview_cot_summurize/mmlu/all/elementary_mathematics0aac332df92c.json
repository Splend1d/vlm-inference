                    "text": "Let's see. Kim rode her bicycle 135 miles in 9 weeks, and she rode the same distance each week. So, to find out how many miles she rode each week, I need to divide the total miles by the number of weeks, right? So, 135 miles divided by 9 weeks should be 15 miles per week.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 9 times 15 is 135. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, Eric rode 102 miles in 6 weeks, also riding the same distance each week. So, for Eric, I need to divide 102 miles by 6 weeks to find out how many miles he rode per week. That should be 17 miles per week.\n\nLet me confirm that: 6 times 17 is 102. Yes, that's right.\n\nNow, I need to compare the number of miles per week they rode. The question is asking which statement correctly compares the number of miles per week they rode.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim rode.\n\nB. Kim rode 3 more miles per week than Eric rode.\n\nC. Kim rode 11 more miles per week than Eric rode.\n\nD. Eric rode 17 more miles per week than Kim rode.\n\nOkay, so I have Kim riding 15 miles per week and Eric riding 17 miles per week.\n\nSo, Eric rode more miles per week than Kim. So, option B and C suggest that Kim rode more than Eric, which isn't the case here. So, those can be eliminated.\n\nNow, between options A and D:\n\nA says Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim rode.\n\nD says Eric rode 17 more miles per week than Kim rode.\n\nSo, let's see the difference between Eric's and Kim's weekly miles.\n\nEric rode 17 miles per week, and Kim rode 15 miles per week. So, 17 minus 15 is 2. So, Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct.\n\nWait a minute, option D says Eric rode 17 more miles per week than Kim rode. But that would mean Eric rode 15 + 17 = 32 miles per week, which is not the case. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option A.\n\nJust to make sure, let's recheck the calculations.\n\nKim's weekly miles: 135 miles / 9 weeks = 15 miles per week.\n\nEric's weekly miles: 102 miles / 6 weeks = 17 miles per week.\n\nDifference: 17 - 15 = 2 miles per week.\n\nYes, Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim.\n\nSo, the correct statement is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
