                    "text": "So I have this question about cystic fibrosis, and it's asking about the most common mutation that causes it. The options are a deletion, a duplication, a substitution, or an insertion. I need to pick which one is the most common in cystic fibrosis.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what cystic fibrosis is. It's a genetic disorder that affects the production of mucus, sweat, and digestive enzymes. It's caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which codes for a protein that regulates the movement of salt and water in cells.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis. I remember that mutations can be of different types: deletions, where part of the DNA is missing; duplications, where a part is repeated; substitutions, where one nucleotide is replaced by another; and insertions, where extra DNA is added.\n\nI think the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis is a deletion. Specifically, it's the deletion of a single phenylalanine residue in the CFTR protein, which is known as the \u0394F508 mutation. This mutation leads to a defective CFTR protein that doesn't function properly, causing the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\nTo make sure I'm correct, let me think about it again. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and the most prevalent mutation is indeed a deletion of three nucleotides, which results in the loss of phenylalanine at position 508 in the protein. This is the \u0394F508 mutation, and it's the most common cause of cystic fibrosis, especially in people of Northern European descent.\n\nSo, in terms of the options given:\n\nA. a deletion.\n\nB. a duplication.\n\nC. a substitution.\n\nD. an insertion.\n\nThe correct answer should be A. a deletion, because the \u0394F508 mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides causing the loss of one amino acid in the protein sequence.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are other mutations that might be more common. However, I believe that the \u0394F508 mutation accounts for about 70% of cystic fibrosis cases in some populations, making it the most common mutation overall.\n\nI don't think it's B. a duplication, because duplications are less common in cystic fibrosis. Similarly, while substitutions and insertions can cause cystic fibrosis, they aren't as prevalent as the deletion mutation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. a deletion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
