                    "text": "Let's see here. So, a high school surveyed 75 people from last year's graduating class, but only 27 of them didn't return the survey. That means 75 minus 27 is 48 did return it. Now, they need to decide what to do next, and there are four options.\n\nOption A says to use the surveys that were returned and change the sample size to 48 for the analysis. So, basically, just use the 48 responses and forget about the other 27 who didn't respond.\n\nOption B says to use the surveys that were returned but leave the sample size at 75 for the analysis. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. So, they're including only 48 responses but considering it as a sample of 75. Not sure how that works.\n\nOption C suggests randomly selecting 27 more class members and sending the survey to them. So, basically, replacing the non-respondents with new people.\n\nOption D says to follow up with those who didn't return the survey to encourage them to respond. So, trying to get responses from the same group of 27 people.\n\nI need to think about which option is the best plan of action. First, I should consider the concept of response bias. If the people who didn't respond are different in some way from those who did respond, then using only the respondents might give a skewed view of the whole population.\n\nFor example, maybe people who are more interested in the school are more likely to respond, or maybe those who are busier didn't have time to fill it out. So, there could be systematic differences between respondents and non-respondents.\n\nOption A suggests using only the 48 responses and adjusting the sample size to 48. This might be acceptable if the non-respondents are similar to the respondents in the aspects being studied. But if there's a difference, this could introduce bias.\n\nOption B suggests using the 48 responses but keeping the sample size as 75. This seems like it's trying to account for the non-response in some way, but I'm not sure how that would work in practice. It might be some kind of weighting, but that's usually more complex than just changing the sample size in analysis.\n\nOption C proposes selecting 27 new people and sending them the survey. This is like doing a second sampling. It could help increase the response rate, but it might also introduce new variability because these new people weren't part of the original sample.\n\nOption D suggests following up with the non-respondents to encourage them to respond. This could potentially increase the response rate and make the sample more representative, provided that the follow-up is effective and doesn't introduce new biases.\n\nI think option D is the best plan of action. By following up with the non-respondents, the school is giving those individuals another chance to participate, which could lead to a higher response rate and potentially more representative data. This approach addresses the issue of non-response bias directly by trying to maximize the number of responses from the original sample.\n\nOption C, while it might seem like a solution, could actually complicate things because the new people selected might not be representative of the original sample. It's generally better to work with the original sample as much as possible.\n\nOption A is a common approach in many analyses, where you just use the respondents, but it assumes that the respondents are representative of the entire sample, which might not be the case if there's significant non-response bias.\n\nOption B seems a bit unclear. Keeping the sample size at 75 but only using 48 responses might imply some kind of imputation or weighting, but without more detail, it's hard to evaluate.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: follow up with those who did not return the survey to encourage them to respond.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
