                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"According to the Constitution, who determines voter eligibility requirements?\" And the options are A. The president, B. Congress, C. State legislatures, D. Federal administrative agencies. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and it outlines the framework for our government and the rights of citizens. Voting is a fundamental right in our democracy, so it's important to understand how the Constitution addresses who can vote.\n\nLet me recall some basic principles. The Constitution originally left the determination of voter qualifications largely up to the individual states. For example, in Article I, Section 2, it says that the House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states, and that the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature. So, that suggests that each state decides who can vote in federal elections based on their own state laws.\n\nBut I also remember that there have been several amendments to the Constitution that have modified these original provisions. For instance, the 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870, prohibits denying the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. The 19th Amendment, ratified in 1920, prohibits denying the right to vote based on sex. The 24th Amendment, ratified in 1964, prohibits poll taxes in federal elections. And the 26th Amendment, ratified in 1971, sets the minimum voting age at 18 years old for federal and state elections.\n\nThese amendments show that while states have significant latitude in setting voter eligibility requirements, there are federal limits on what those requirements can be. For example, states cannot deny someone the right to vote based on race, sex, or age if they are over 18.\n\nGiven all that, it seems that the primary responsibility for determining voter eligibility requirements lies with the state legislatures. But, of course, they must do so within the constraints imposed by the Constitution and federal law.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A: The president. No, the president doesn't determine voter eligibility requirements. The president's role is more about executive actions and signing bills into law, but not directly setting voting rules.\n\nOption B: Congress. Congress does have the power to pass laws that can affect voting rights, like the Voting Rights Act, which oversees changes to voting laws in certain jurisdictions with a history of discrimination. However, in general, Congress doesn't directly set voter eligibility requirements for state elections. For federal elections, while Congress can set some rules, it still defers to state laws for many aspects of voter eligibility.\n\nOption C: State legislatures. This seems the most accurate based on my understanding. States have the primary authority to set voter eligibility requirements, subject to the constraints of the Constitution and federal law.\n\nOption D: Federal administrative agencies. These are organizations like the Election Assistance Commission, which provides guidance and assistance to states in running elections, but they don't directly set voter eligibility requirements. That's generally not their role; they more so provide support and resources to the states.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I believe the correct answer is C. State legislatures. They are the ones primarily responsible for determining voter eligibility requirements, within the bounds set by the Constitution and federal law.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll think about a specific example. Let's say a state wants to require a certain level of education to vote. Would that be constitutional? No, because it would be a poll tax or a literacy test, which have been deemed unconstitutional under various amendments and Supreme Court decisions. So, even though states have leeway, there are limits.\n\nAnother example: some states have different residency requirements for voting. For instance, you might need to have lived in the state for a certain amount of time before being eligible to vote there. That's a state-imposed eligibility requirement.\n\nAlso, felons' voting rights vary by state. Some states restore voting rights after completion of sentence, while others permanently disenfranchise felons. This variation suggests that states have the power to set these rules, again within certain federal constraints.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the bases here. The key takeaway is that according to the Constitution, state legislatures determine voter eligibility requirements, though they must comply with federal laws and constitutional amendments that prohibit discrimination based on certain factors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
