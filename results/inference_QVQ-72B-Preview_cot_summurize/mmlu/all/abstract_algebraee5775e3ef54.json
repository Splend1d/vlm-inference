                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these statements about permutations and functions. I'm not super confident with these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, Statement 1 says that every permutation is a one-to-one function. Okay, let's break this down. A permutation, as I understand it, is a rearrangement of elements in a set. So, for a set like {1, 2, 3}, there are 6 permutations: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1).\n\nNow, a function is a rule that assigns to each element of a set (the domain) exactly one element of another set (the codomain). A one-to-one function, specifically, is a function where each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain, and no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain.\n\nSo, if I think of a permutation as a function, it's mapping each element to another element in the set. Since each element is being mapped to exactly one other element, and no two elements map to the same element (because it's a rearrangement), then yes, every permutation should be a one-to-one function.\n\nWait, but is that always true? Let's consider a set with four elements, say {a, b, c, d}. A permutation like (a,b,c,d) is just the identity, which maps each element to itself. Is that a one-to-one function? Well, yes, because each element is mapped to a distinct element.\n\nAnother permutation like (a,c,b,d) would map a to c, b to b, c to b, and d to d. Wait, that can't be right because in a permutation, each element should map to exactly one other element without repetition. Actually, in permutations, each element is mapped to a unique element, so my earlier example might be wrong.\n\nLet me correct that. In a permutation of a set, each element is mapped to exactly one other element, and no two elements map to the same element. So, in the set {a, b, c, d}, a permutation like (a\u2192b, b\u2192c, c\u2192d, d\u2192a) is valid, and it's clearly one-to-one.\n\nOn the other hand, a function like (a\u2192c, b\u2192c, c\u2192d, d\u2192a) is not a permutation because both b and a map to c, which would violate the one-to-one property. So, permutations inherently have the one-to-one property because each element is uniquely mapped without any collisions.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 seems to be true: every permutation is a one-to-one function.\n\nNow, Statement 2 says that every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. First, not every function is a permutation. Permutations are specifically bijections (one-to-one and onto functions) from a set to itself. So, for a function to be a permutation, it needs to be both one-to-one and onto (meaning every element in the codomain is mapped to by some element in the domain).\n\nA one-to-one function ensures that each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain, but it doesn't guarantee that every element in the codomain is mapped to. For example, consider the function f: {1,2,3} \u2192 {a,b,c,d} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c. This function is one-to-one, but it's not onto because d is not mapped to by any element in the domain. Therefore, this function is not a permutation.\n\nPermutations require that the function is both one-to-one and onto, meaning the domain and codomain are the same set, and every element in the set is mapped to exactly once.\n\nSo, for a function to be a permutation, it must be one-to-one and onto (which together make it a bijection). Therefore, saying that every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one is incorrect because it also needs to be onto.\n\nTo put it differently, a function being one-to-one is necessary but not sufficient for it to be a permutation. It must also be onto.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be C. True, False.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor Statement 1: Every permutation is a one-to-one function.\n\nYes, because permutations are bijections, which are one-to-one and onto functions. So, they are indeed one-to-one.\n\nFor Statement 2: Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\n\nThis is incorrect because a function needs to be both one-to-one and onto to be a permutation. Being one-to-one is not enough.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
