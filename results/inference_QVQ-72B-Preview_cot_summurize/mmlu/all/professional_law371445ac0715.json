                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a police search without a warrant, and now the defendants are trying to suppress the evidence found in their car. I need to figure out whether their motion should be granted or denied based on the options given. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: There's a report of a robbery by women dressed as superheroes on an island. The only way on or off the island is via a ferry, and the last ferry of the night is about to leave when the police get the report. So, the police decide to stop all the cars waiting for the ferry to check for suspects.\n\nIn one of these cars, there are three women who seem nervous and fidgety. The police search their car and find stolen property from the victim hidden under the front seat. The defendants are arrested and now they're trying to suppress this evidence, saying it was illegally obtained.\n\nSo, the question is whether the police had the right to search their car without a warrant, and if the evidence found can be used in court.\n\nOption A says the motion should be granted because the police didn't have a warrant to search their car.\n\nOption B says it should be granted because the police didn't have probable cause to suspect that the car contained evidence of the crime.\n\nOption C says it should be denied because the police had probable cause to search the car and, under the circumstances, no warrant was required.\n\nOption D says it should be denied because even though the detention was unlawful, the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that the car contained evidence of the crime since the women were fidgeting nervously.\n\nOkay, so I need to recall some Fourth Amendment law here about searches and seizures. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and generally, a warrant is required to search someone's property or belongings.\n\nBut there are exceptions to the warrant requirement, especially in cases where there's probable cause and certain exigent circumstances exist, like the possibility of evidence being destroyed or the suspect fleeing.\n\nIn this case, the police stopped all the cars waiting for the ferry without a warrant. Was this stop lawful?\n\nWell, the police had a report of a robbery, and the only way off the island was via the ferry. So, they probably set up a checkpoint to look for suspects trying to leave.\n\nCheckpoints can be lawful under certain circumstances, especially if there's a reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that checking vehicles is necessary to prevent the escape of suspects or recovery of stolen property.\n\nHere, the police had a report of a robbery, and knowing that the suspects might be trying to leave the island on the last ferry, they stopped all cars. That seems like a reasonable action to prevent the escape of suspects.\n\nNow, when they stopped the cars, they noticed these three women who appeared nervous and fidgety. Nervousness alone isn't usually enough to establish probable cause for a search, but combined with other factors, it could be considered.\n\nThey found stolen property under the front seat, which directly links them to the crime.\n\nSo, the question is whether the police had probable cause to search the car based on the totality of the circumstances.\n\nLet me think about probable cause. Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge are sufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the suspect has committed or is committing an offense.\n\nHere, the police had a report of a robbery, and they were checking vehicles leaving the island. When they saw three women in a car, and these women appeared nervous and fidgety, that might raise suspicions, especially given the context of the robbery report.\n\nBut is that enough for probable cause to search the car?\n\nMaybe not on its own, but combined with the robbery report and the fact that the women were trying to leave the island on the last ferry, it starts to build a case for probable cause.\n\nHowever, nervousness can be a subjective observation and isn't always reliable.\n\nMaybe the women were just anxious about being late for the ferry or something unrelated to the crime.\n\nSo, perhaps the police should have had more concrete evidence before searching the car.\n\nBut, considering the time pressure (the last ferry was about to leave), they might not have had time to get a warrant or to gather more evidence.\n\nIn such cases, courts often allow warrantless searches if there's probable cause and exigent circumstances, like the imminent departure of suspects.\n\nSo, perhaps under these circumstances, the search was reasonable, and the evidence should not be suppressed.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Granted, no warrant.\n\nBut maybe the search was justified without a warrant due to exigent circumstances.\n\nB. Granted, no probable cause.\n\nBut perhaps there was probable cause considering the context and the women's behavior.\n\nC. Denied, probable cause and no warrant required under the circumstances.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nD. Denied, even if the detention was unlawful, there was reasonable suspicion.\n\nBut reasonable suspicion is different from probable cause. Reasonable suspicion allows for brief detentions and investigations, but probable cause is required for searches.\n\nSo, if the police had reasonable suspicion based on the women's nervousness and the robbery report, they might have had probable cause to search the car, especially given the urgency of the situation.\n\nWait, but reasonable suspicion is different from probable cause. Reasonable suspicion is a lower standard than probable cause.\n\nIn Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court allowed police to conduct a brief investigative stop and frisk based on reasonable suspicion.\n\nBut for a full search of a vehicle, generally, probable cause is required.\n\nSo, if the police only had reasonable suspicion, that might not be enough to justify the search.\n\nBut in this case, considering the nervous behavior, the robbery report, and the fact that they were trying to leave the island on the last ferry, maybe it rises to probable cause.\n\nAdditionally, there's the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, which allows police to search a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that it contains evidence of a crime.\n\nThis is based on the idea that vehicles can be quickly moved out of the jurisdiction or the evidence can be destroyed.\n\nSo, combining that with the exigent circumstances of the last ferry leaving, it seems like the police had sufficient grounds to search the car without a warrant.\n\nTherefore, the motion to suppress should be denied because the police had probable cause to search the car under the circumstances, and no warrant was required.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the police had probable cause to believe that the car contained stolen property, and due to the urgency of the situation (the last ferry leaving), they couldn't get a warrant, then the search is permissible under the automobile exception and the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the women were nervous and fidgeting could be seen as indicative of guilt, especially in the context of the robbery report and their attempt to leave the island.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the search was constitutional, and the evidence should not be suppressed.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Denied, because the police had probable cause to search their car and, under the circumstances, no warrant was required.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
