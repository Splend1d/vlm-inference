                    "text": "So I need to find the least common multiple of 4 and 10. I remember that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them. There are a few ways to find the LCM, and I think I'll try the one where I list the multiples of each number and then find the smallest one they have in common.\n\nFirst, let's list the multiples of 4:\n\n4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, ...\n\nNow, let's list the multiples of 10:\n\n10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, ...\n\nLooking at both lists, I can see that 20 appears in both lists. Is there a smaller number that appears in both? Let's see:\n\n- 4, 8, 12, 16, 20...\n\n- 10, 20, 30, 40, 50...\n\nSo, 20 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 4 and 10. But wait, let's check if there's a smaller number that could also be a multiple of both. For example, 20 is divisible by 4 and by 10, but is there a smaller number that also fits this criterion?\n\nLet me think about another method. Maybe I can use the prime factorization approach. I know that finding the LCM of two numbers involves taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of either number.\n\nSo, let's factorize 4 and 10 into their prime factors:\n\n- 4 = 2^2\n\n- 10 = 2 \u00d7 5\n\nNow, the LCM should have the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations. So, for 2, the highest power is 2^2, and for 5, it's 5^1.\n\nTherefore, LCM = 2^2 \u00d7 5^1 = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20.\n\nThis matches what I found earlier by listing the multiples. So, it seems that the LCM of 4 and 10 is 20.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider another perspective. Maybe I can think about the relationship between 4 and 10. I know that 4 goes into 10 two times with a remainder of 2 (since 4\u00d72=8 and 10-8=2), but that doesn't seem particularly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula that relates LCM and GCD (Greatest Common Divisor). I recall that for any two numbers, LCM(a, b) \u00d7 GCD(a, b) = a \u00d7 b.\n\nSo, if I can find the GCD of 4 and 10, I can use that to find the LCM.\n\nFirst, find GCD(4, 10):\n\n- The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\n- The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\n- The common divisors are 1 and 2, and the greatest one is 2.\n\nSo, GCD(4, 10) = 2.\n\nNow, using the formula:\n\nLCM(4, 10) \u00d7 2 = 4 \u00d7 10\n\nLCM(4, 10) = (4 \u00d7 10) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the LCM is 20.\n\nJust to make sure there aren't any smaller numbers that could be considered, I'll think about whether 20 is indeed the smallest multiple that both 4 and 10 divide into without remainder.\n\n- 4 divides into 20: 20 \u00f7 4 = 5, which is an integer.\n\n- 10 divides into 20: 20 \u00f7 10 = 2, which is also an integer.\n\nSo, 20 is divisible by both 4 and 10. Is there a smaller number that both 4 and 10 can divide into without remainder?\n\nLet's check 20 divided by 4 and 10: it works. If I check 16: 16 \u00f7 4 = 4, but 16 \u00f7 10 = 1.6, which is not an integer. So, 16 is not a multiple of 10. Similarly, 12: 12 \u00f7 4 = 3, but 12 \u00f7 10 = 1.2, not an integer. And 8: 8 \u00f7 4 = 2, but 8 \u00f7 10 = 0.8, not an integer. So, indeed, 20 is the smallest number that both 4 and 10 can divide into without remainder.\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 4 and 10 is 20.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 14\n\nB. 20\n\nC. 40\n\nD. 60\n\nThe correct answer is B. 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
