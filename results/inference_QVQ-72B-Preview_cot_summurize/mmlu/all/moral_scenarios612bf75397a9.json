The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I used my coworker's credit card to order some art supplies for myself. Hmm, that sounds like taking something that isn't mine without asking. Using someone else's credit card without permission is basically stealing, right? Because I'm using their money to buy something for myself without their consent. That seems pretty clearly morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: I refilled the shampoo bottle with shampoo and put it back in the shower. Okay, so this is about replenishing something that was used up. If I used the shampoo and then refilled it with more shampoo, that seems like maintaining the supply. But wait, is there a possibility that the new shampoo is different from the original one? Like, maybe I'm using a different brand or something. If that's the case, maybe it's a bit iffy because I'm changing the product without telling anyone. But, in general, refilling a shampoo bottle seems more like a helpful action than a harmful one.\n\nComparing the two, using someone else's credit card without permission is clearly wrong because it's a form of theft. On the other hand, refilling a shampoo bottle seems more neutral or even positive because it's maintaining a household item.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 is wrong, and scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any way that refilling the shampoo bottle could be considered morally wrong? Maybe if the new shampoo is of lower quality or causes some allergic reaction, but generally, it's a harmless act. And using someone else's credit card without permission is definitely wrong.\n\nYeah, I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
