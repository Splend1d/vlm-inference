The options are A. Franks, B. Visigoths, C. Russians, D. Anglo-Saxons.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to find out which of these groups converted to Christianity in the tenth century, and specifically, this conversion was carried out by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic timelines for each of these groups.\n\nStarting with the Franks: They were a Germanic tribe that lived in present-day France and Germany. I think some Frankish tribes converted to Christianity earlier, like in the 5th or 6th century, but I need to confirm if there was a significant conversion in the tenth century specifically by Byzantine missionaries.\n\nNext, the Visigoths: They were another Germanic people who settled in Spain and southern France. I remember that the Visigoths initially practiced Arian Christianity, which was considered heretical by the Roman Church. They later converted to Roman Christianity, but again, I'm not sure about the exact timing.\n\nThe Russians: This refers to the Eastern Slavic peoples, primarily centered around what is now Ukraine and Russia. I have a vague recollection that the Kievan Rus' converted to Christianity in the late tenth century, and I think it was through the influence of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nLastly, the Anglo-Saxons: They were the Germanic tribes that settled in England and converted to Christianity in the seventh century, primarily through the efforts of missionaries from Rome, not the Byzantine Empire.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the Russians converted to Christianity in the tenth century under the influence of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Franks: While the Franks did convert to Christianity, it was earlier, in the Merovingian dynasty, around the 5th century, not the tenth century. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nB. Visigoths: They converted to Arian Christianity in the 4th century and then to Roman Christianity in the 7th century, again, not in the tenth century. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nC. Russians: As I thought earlier, the Kievan Rus' under Prince Vladimir I accepted Christianity in 988 CE, which is indeed the tenth century. This conversion was heavily influenced by the Byzantine Empire, as Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) had close ties with the Kievan Rus' through trade and diplomacy.\n\nD. Anglo-Saxons: They converted to Christianity in the seventh century, primarily through the efforts of Augustine of Canterbury, who was sent by Pope Gregory I. This was definitely not in the tenth century, and the influence was from Rome, not the Byzantine Empire.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Russians.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll see if there's any other group among the options that might have converted in the tenth century through Byzantine missionaries.\n\nLooking back, the Franks, Visigoths, and Anglo-Saxons all converted earlier, and their conversions were influenced by different entities\u2014primarily the Roman Church for the Anglo-Saxons and possibly the Merovingian Frankish kingdom for the Visigoths through their connections in Gaul.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the Russians were the group that converted to Christianity in the tenth century C.E. by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Russians}} \\]"
