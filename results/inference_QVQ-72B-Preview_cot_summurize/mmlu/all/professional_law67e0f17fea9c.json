                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the motion to suppress the cocaine evidence should be denied or granted. Let me try to understand all the details first.\n\nSo, there's a mother who's legally separated from her husband and has filed for divorce. They own their home in joint tenancy, which means both of them have equal ownership rights over the property. One night, the mother goes out to dinner and leaves her 11-year-old daughter at home alone. Before leaving, she locks her bedroom door. While she's gone, the daughter finds a spare key and unlocks the bedroom door. In the dresser, she finds a bag of white powder and suspects it might be drugs. She's concerned and decides to call her father for advice. Her father tells her to call the police. So, the daughter calls the police station and reports what she found. The police come over, and the daughter lets them in. She takes them to her mother's bedroom and hands over the bag of powder, which later tests positive for cocaine. The mother is arrested and charged with illegal possession.\n\nNow, the mother's attorney is trying to prevent the cocaine from being admitted as evidence in court. I need to decide whether this motion should be denied or granted based on the options provided.\n\nOption A says the motion should be denied because the daughter and the husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.\n\nOption B says it should be denied because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.\n\nOption C says it should be granted because the daughter, as a minor, did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter the home.\n\nOption D says it should be granted because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about the concept of consent to search in this situation. Generally, consent to search can be given by someone who has authority over the premises or the items in question. But there are nuances here because the daughter is a minor and the mother and father are both owners of the house.\n\nFirst, let's consider the daughter's authority to consent to the search. She's 11 years old, which is generally considered a minor and not someone who can give legal consent. However, in some cases, minors can consent to searches, especially if they have some degree of control or authority over the area being searched.\n\nIn this case, the daughter lives in the house and likely has some degree of control over common areas, but her mother's bedroom is a private space. Even though the daughter found a spare key and entered the bedroom, that doesn't necessarily mean she had the authority to consent to the search of that specific area.\n\nMoreover, the mother locked her bedroom before leaving, which suggests that she expected privacy in that space and didn't intend for others to have access to it.\n\nNow, considering that, it seems that the daughter didn't have the authority to consent to the search of her mother's locked bedroom. But what about the father's involvement? He advised the daughter to call the police, but he wasn't present at the time of the search.\n\nThe father is a co-owner of the house, so he might have some authority over the premises. However, he wasn't there when the police arrived, and it was the daughter who let them in and showed them to the bedroom.\n\nSo, does the father's ownership interest give him the authority to consent to the search indirectly through his daughter? I'm not sure about that.\n\nMaybe I should look into the concept of apparent authority. Apparent authority refers to situations where a third party reasonably believes that someone has the authority to consent to a search, even if they actually don't.\n\nIn this case, did the police reasonably believe that the daughter had the authority to consent to the search of her mother's locked bedroom? Given that she's an 11-year-old child, it might not be reasonable to assume that she has that kind of authority over her mother's private space.\n\nSimilarly, did they reasonably believe that the daughter had the authority to consent to the search of the entire house? Again, given her age and status as a minor, it's questionable.\n\nBut perhaps the police relied on the fact that the daughter was living in the house and had access to the bedroom, assuming she had some level of authority.\n\nHowever, the bedroom was locked, indicating that it was a private space, and the daughter shouldn't have had access to it without permission.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should consider the idea that the daughter's actions in finding the spare key and entering the bedroom were unauthorized, and therefore, any evidence obtained from that shouldn't be admissible.\n\nBut then again, once the police were called, and the daughter consented to their entry and showed them the bag, it becomes a question of whether her consent was valid.\n\nI recall that in some cases, minors can consent to searches of their own belongings or areas within the home that they control, but not necessarily to areas that are clearly the private spaces of adults.\n\nIn this scenario, the mother's bedroom is clearly her private space, and the daughter doesn't have authority over it.\n\nTherefore, the daughter likely didn't have the apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.\n\nSo, based on that, option D seems plausible: the motion should be granted because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.\n\nBut let's consider option C: the motion should be granted because the daughter, as a minor, did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter the home.\n\nThis is similar, but it refers to entering the home in general, not specifically the bedroom.\n\nGiven that the daughter lives in the home and likely has some authority over common areas, it might be that she could consent to the police entering the home, but not to entering her mother's locked bedroom.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is more accurate because it specifies the bedroom.\n\nOption A suggests that the motion should be denied because the daughter and the husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.\n\nBut the husband wasn't present; it was the daughter who let the police in. So, even if the husband had authority, the daughter doesn't necessarily share that authority, especially since she's a minor.\n\nMoreover, the husband wasn't the one who gave consent; it was the daughter.\n\nOption B says the motion should be denied because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.\n\nBut did she really have equal control? The mother locked her bedroom, indicating that it was her private space and not subject to the daughter's control.\n\nSo, I don't think that's accurate.\n\nTherefore, based on my reasoning, I think the motion should be granted because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
