                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that \\( f(x) = 3x^{2} - 2 \\) and \\( g(f(x)) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\), and I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( g(25) \\). The options are 13, 25, 9, or 20.\n\nAlright, first thing I notice is that \\( g \\) is defined in terms of \\( f(x) \\), not directly in terms of \\( x \\). So, to find \\( g(25) \\), I need to find an \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 25 \\), because \\( g(f(x)) \\) is given, and I want to evaluate \\( g(25) \\).\n\nSo, set \\( f(x) = 25 \\):\n\n\\( 3x^{2} - 2 = 25 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 3x^{2} = 27 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x^{2} = 9 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( x = 3 \\) or \\( x = -3 \\)\n\nNow, since \\( g(f(x)) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\), and for \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\), \\( f(x) = 25 \\), then \\( g(25) = 3^{2} + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 \\), and similarly, \\( g(25) = (-3)^{2} + (-3) + 1 = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\nWait a minute, but both correspond to \\( f(x) = 25 \\), so \\( g(25) \\) should be the same regardless of which \\( x \\) I use, right? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me see. Since \\( g(f(x)) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\), and I want \\( g(25) \\), I need to find an \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 25 \\), and then plug that \\( x \\) into the expression for \\( g(f(x)) \\).\n\nSo, as I found earlier, \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\) both satisfy \\( f(x) = 25 \\). For both of these, \\( g(25) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\), which gives 13 and 7, respectively. But the problem asks for the sum of all possible values of \\( g(25) \\), so I should add 13 and 7, which gives 20.\n\nWait, but that's one way to look at it. However, I'm a bit unsure because \\( g(f(x)) \\) is defined as \\( x^{2} + x + 1 \\), and for each \\( x \\) that satisfies \\( f(x) = 25 \\), I get a value of \\( g(25) \\). So, there are two such \\( x \\)'s, leading to two values of \\( g(25) \\), and their sum is 20.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find an expression for \\( g(x) \\) directly. Since \\( g(f(x)) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\), if I can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( f(x) \\), maybe I can find \\( g(x) \\).\n\nLet \\( y = f(x) = 3x^{2} - 2 \\). Then, \\( g(y) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\).\n\nBut I need to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\). From \\( y = 3x^{2} - 2 \\), solving for \\( x^{2} \\):\n\n\\( 3x^{2} = y + 2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x^{2} = \\frac{y + 2}{3} \\)\n\nSimilarly, solving for \\( x \\), \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{y + 2}{3}} \\)\n\nNow, plugging this back into \\( g(y) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\), but it seems messy because of the square root. Maybe this isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\( g(f(x)) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\), and I want to find \\( g(25) \\), which corresponds to \\( f(x) = 25 \\).\n\nAs I did earlier, finding \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 25 \\), which gives \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\), and then \\( g(25) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\) for those \\( x \\)'s.\n\nSo, for \\( x = 3 \\), \\( g(25) = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 \\)\n\nFor \\( x = -3 \\), \\( g(25) = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7 \\)\n\nTherefore, the possible values of \\( g(25) \\) are 13 and 7, and their sum is 20.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider only one value. Let me see the problem again: \"Find the sum of all possible values of \\( g(25) \\).\"\n\nSo, it's asking for the sum of all distinct possible values that \\( g(25) \\) can take. In this case, there are two possible values, 13 and 7, so their sum is 20.\n\nBut let me check if this is the correct interpretation. Maybe there's only one value for \\( g(25) \\), and I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that \\( g \\) is a function, and \\( g(f(x)) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\), so \\( g(25) \\) is determined by the \\( x \\) that satisfies \\( f(x) = 25 \\), which are \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\), leading to two different values for \\( g(25) \\), and their sum is 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider that \\( g \\) is defined only through \\( g(f(x)) \\), and I need to find \\( g(25) \\), which is \\( g(f(x)) \\) when \\( f(x) = 25 \\).\n\nSo, \\( g(25) = x^{2} + x + 1 \\) when \\( f(x) = 25 \\), and as before, for \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\), \\( g(25) = 13 \\) and \\( g(25) = 7 \\), respectively.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of \\( g(25) \\) is \\( 13 + 7 = 20 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, 20 is one of them, so I think this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
