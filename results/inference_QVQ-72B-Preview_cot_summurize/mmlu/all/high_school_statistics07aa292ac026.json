                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about probabilities in an automobile service station. It says that 60% of customers request an oil change, 30% request tire replacements, and 10% request both. And I need to find the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not request tire replacements. The options are 0.42, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.833.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have customers who get their oil changed, tires replaced, or both. And I need to find the probability that, given a customer gets an oil change, they don't get their tires replaced.\n\nSo, this sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is when we have some information already, and we need to adjust our calculations based on that information.\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B), where A and B are events. In this case, event B is that the customer requests an oil change, and event A is that the customer does not request tire replacements.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The event we're given is that the customer requests an oil change, which is event B. And we want to find the probability that the customer does not request tire replacements, which is like event A', but I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Event O: oil change\n\n- Event T: tire replacement\n\nGiven:\n\n- P(O) = 0.60\n\n- P(T) = 0.30\n\n- P(O \u2229 T) = 0.10\n\nAnd I need to find P(T' | O), where T' is the event that tire replacement is not requested, given that O is requested.\n\nSo, using the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(T' | O) = P(T' \u2229 O) / P(O)\n\nI know P(O) = 0.60, so I need to find P(T' \u2229 O), which is the probability that a customer requests an oil change but not tire replacements.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that P(T' | O) = 1 - P(T | O), because the customer either requests tire replacements or doesn't, given that they request an oil change.\n\nBut let's try both ways to confirm.\n\nFirst method:\n\nP(T' | O) = P(O \u2229 T') / P(O)\n\nI know P(O) = 0.60, and P(O \u2229 T') is the probability that a customer requests an oil change but not tire replacements.\n\nI can find P(O \u2229 T') by using the principle that P(O) = P(O \u2229 T) + P(O \u2229 T')\n\nSo, P(O \u2229 T') = P(O) - P(O \u2229 T) = 0.60 - 0.10 = 0.50\n\nTherefore, P(T' | O) = 0.50 / 0.60 = 5/6 \u2248 0.833\n\nSecond method:\n\nP(T' | O) = 1 - P(T | O)\n\nFirst, find P(T | O), which is the probability that a customer requests tire replacements given that they request an oil change.\n\nP(T | O) = P(T \u2229 O) / P(O) = 0.10 / 0.60 = 1/6 \u2248 0.1667\n\nTherefore, P(T' | O) = 1 - 0.1667 = 0.8333\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLooking back at the options, 0.833 is one of them.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other way to interpret the question or if I've made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the probabilities as frequencies. Suppose there are 100 customers.\n\nThen:\n\n- 60 request oil change (O)\n\n- 30 request tire replacement (T)\n\n- 10 request both O and T\n\nSo, the number of customers who request O only is 60 - 10 = 50\n\nAnd the number of customers who request T only is 30 - 10 = 20\n\nThen, the total customers who request O is 60, and among them, 10 also request T, so 50 request only O.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a customer requests O and not T is 50 / 60 = 5/6 \u2248 0.833\n\nAgain, this confirms the previous result.\n\nI don't see any flaw in this reasoning, so I'm confident that the correct answer is 0.833.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.833} \\]"
