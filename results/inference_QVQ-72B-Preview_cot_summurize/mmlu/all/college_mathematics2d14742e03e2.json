                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a ring \\( R \\) with a multiplicative identity, and it has exactly two right ideals. We need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic definitions:\n\n1. **Ring \\( R \\):** A set equipped with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying certain properties. It has an additive identity (0) and a multiplicative identity (1).\n\n2. **Additive subgroup \\( U \\):** A subset of \\( R \\) that is closed under addition and contains additive inverses.\n\n3. **Right ideal \\( U \\):** An additive subgroup of \\( R \\) such that for every \\( u \\in U \\) and every \\( r \\in R \\), the product \\( ur \\) is also in \\( U \\).\n\nGiven that \\( R \\) has exactly two right ideals, these must be \\( R \\) itself and the zero ideal \\( \\{0\\} \\). If there were any other right ideals, that would contradict the assumption.\n\nNow, let's consider each statement:\n\n**I. \\( R \\) is commutative.**\n\nThis means that multiplication in \\( R \\) is commutative, i.e., for all \\( a, b \\in R \\), \\( ab = ba \\).\n\nHaving exactly two right ideals doesn't necessarily imply that \\( R \\) is commutative. For example, consider the ring of integers \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is commutative, or the ring of integers modulo a prime \\( p \\), which is also commutative. But there are non-commutative rings with exactly two right ideals as well. So, this might not be necessarily true.\n\n**II. \\( R \\) is a division ring.**\n\nA division ring is a ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Essentially, it's a skew field.\n\nIf \\( R \\) is a division ring, then every right ideal is principal and generated by an idempotent element. But in a division ring, the only idempotents are 0 and 1, so the only right ideals are \\( \\{0\\} \\) and \\( R \\) itself. Therefore, if \\( R \\) is a division ring, it has exactly two right ideals.\n\nBut does having exactly two right ideals imply that \\( R \\) is a division ring? Let's think about this.\n\nSuppose \\( R \\) has exactly two right ideals: \\( \\{0\\} \\) and \\( R \\). We need to show that every non-zero element of \\( R \\) has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nLet \\( a \\) be a non-zero element of \\( R \\). Consider the set \\( Ra = \\{ ra \\mid r \\in R \\} \\). This is a right ideal of \\( R \\) because:\n\n- It's an additive subgroup: \\( (ra) + (r'a) = (r + r')a \\in Ra \\), and the additive inverse of \\( ra \\) is \\( (-r)a \\in Ra \\).\n\n- For any \\( u = ra \\in Ra \\) and any \\( r' \\in R \\), \\( ur' = (ra)r' = r(ar') \\in Ra \\) since \\( ar' \\in R \\).\n\nBut \\( Ra \\) is a right ideal, and by our assumption, the only right ideals are \\( \\{0\\} \\) and \\( R \\).\n\n- If \\( Ra = \\{0\\} \\), then \\( a = 0 \\), which contradicts our choice of \\( a \\) being non-zero.\n\n- Therefore, \\( Ra = R \\).\n\nSo, \\( Ra = R \\), which means there exists an element \\( r \\in R \\) such that \\( ra = 1 \\). Thus, \\( a \\) has a right inverse.\n\nSimilarly, consider the set \\( aR = \\{ ar \\mid r \\in R \\} \\). This is a left ideal of \\( R \\).\n\nSince \\( R \\) has exactly two right ideals, and \\( aR \\) is a left ideal, we need to relate this to right ideals somehow.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps using the fact that in a ring with identity, if every right ideal is principal, it has certain properties, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose \\( a \\) has a right inverse, say \\( a r = 1 \\). Then, \\( a \\) is invertible from the right. But I need to show that it has a two-sided inverse.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the set \\( \\{ x \\in R \\mid xa = a \\} \\). This is the centralizer of \\( a \\) in \\( R \\).\n\nIf \\( a \\) has a left inverse, say \\( s a = 1 \\), then combining with the right inverse, \\( s a = 1 \\), and \\( a r = 1 \\), so \\( s = s (a r) = (s a) r = 1 \\cdot r = r \\), meaning the left and right inverses are the same.\n\nTherefore, in this case, every non-zero element has a two-sided inverse.\n\nWait, is that always true? Let me see.\n\nSuppose \\( a \\) has a left inverse \\( s \\) and a right inverse \\( r \\), such that \\( s a = 1 \\) and \\( a r = 1 \\).\n\nThen, \\( s = s \\cdot 1 = s (a r) = (s a) r = 1 \\cdot r = r \\), so \\( s = r \\), meaning the left and right inverses coincide.\n\nTherefore, in this ring, every element that has a left inverse also has a right inverse, and they are the same.\n\nThus, \\( R \\) is a division ring.\n\nTherefore, statement II must be true.\n\n**III. \\( R \\) is infinite.**\n\nThis statement claims that \\( R \\) must be infinite. But is this necessarily the case?\n\nConsider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is a field, hence a division ring, and it has exactly two right ideals: \\( \\{0\\} \\) and the entire ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\). But this ring is finite, with \\( p \\) elements.\n\nTherefore, \\( R \\) can be finite, so statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n- Statement I: Not necessarily true, as there are non-commutative rings with exactly two right ideals.\n\n- Statement II: True, as shown above.\n\n- Statement III: Not necessarily true, as demonstrated by the finite field \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
