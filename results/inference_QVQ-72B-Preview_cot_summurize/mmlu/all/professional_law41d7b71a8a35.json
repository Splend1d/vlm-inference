In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 \u0080\u009421, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this scenario about a golf course owner and a gardener who made an oral agreement for the gardener to replace all the sprinkler heads on the golf course. The owner agreed to pay $2,400 upon completion, and the job was supposed to be done by April 19 because of a golf tournament. The gardener started working and had replaced 80 sprinkler heads by April 14, which is like a third of the total 240 heads. Then, the owner found out that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so the owner told the gardener to stop working and hired a landscaper to finish the job at $8 per head, completing it on April 19.\n\nNow, the question is asking which statement, if true, would give the owner legally justifiable grounds to discharge the gardener. The options are:\n\nA. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12.\n\nB. The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\n\nC. The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\n\nD. Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\n\nI need to think about which of these could be a valid reason for the owner to terminate the gardener's contract.\n\nFirst, option A: the gardener was adjudicated bankrupt on April 12. I'm not sure if bankruptcy alone is a sufficient legal ground to discharge someone from a contract. Bankruptcy might affect the gardener's ability to perform the contract or their credibility, but is it enough to terminate the contract? Maybe in some jurisdictions, but I'm not certain.\n\nOption B: the gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when discharged. So, the gardener had done a third of the job when the owner told them to stop. Is incomplete work a valid reason to discharge? Well, the contract was to complete the entire job, so if the gardener wasn't going to finish, maybe the owner has a reason to terminate. But the gardener was still working towards completion, and time was a factor because of the tournament deadline.\n\nOption C: the contract was not in writing. Does that matter? Well, the contract was oral, and generally, oral contracts are still contracts, though they can be harder to enforce. The lack of a written contract might make it harder to prove the terms, but it shouldn't be a direct ground for discharge unless there's a statute of frauds issue, which typically applies to contracts that can't be performed within a year. Here, the job was supposed to be done by April 19, which is within a year, so probably not an issue.\n\nOption D: half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were defective, and the gardener refused to replace them. This seems like a pretty significant issue. If the work performed is defective and the gardener refuses to correct it, that could be a breach of the contract, giving the owner grounds to terminate the contract.\n\nBut let's think more carefully. In contract law, there are several grounds for terminating a contract, such as breach, failure to perform, or if certain conditions are not met. Here, the contract was oral, and it was for a specific job to be completed by a certain date.\n\nFirst, regarding bankruptcy (option A), in some contracts, especially those involving significant financial risks or where the contractor's solvency is crucial, bankruptcy might be a ground for termination. However, generally, bankruptcy alone doesn't automatically terminate a contract. The owner would likely need to show that the gardener's bankruptcy affects their ability to perform the contract.\n\nOption B, incomplete work: the gardener had done a third of the job when discharged. But they were still working towards completion, and time was of the essence because of the tournament. If the gardener was behind schedule and couldn't finish on time, that could be a reason to terminate. But from the information given, it seems like the gardener was on track or perhaps a bit behind, but not necessarily unable to meet the deadline.\n\nOption C, no written contract: as I thought, oral contracts are generally enforceable, though proving them can be tricky. The lack of a written contract might make it harder for the owner to enforce the terms, but it doesn't provide a legal ground to discharge the gardener.\n\nOption D, defective work: this seems the most straightforward reason for termination. If the gardener installed defective sprinkler heads and refused to replace them, that's a clear breach of the contract terms, as the contract presumably required the installation of new, working sprinkler heads.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the scenario: \"Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\"\n\nThis seems like a material breach of the contract. The gardener was supposed to install new sprinkler heads, but half of them were defective. That's not what the owner paid for. Moreover, the gardener refused to replace them, which compounds the issue.\n\nIn contract law, if one party breaches the contract by failing to perform as agreed, the other party may have the right to terminate the contract. Here, installing defective sprinkler heads and refusing to replace them is a failure to perform as agreed.\n\nAdditionally, since time was of the essence due to the tournament, any delay or defect in the work could be particularly problematic.\n\nSo, if option D is true, that would provide a legally justifiable ground for the owner to discharge the gardener.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options again to make sure.\n\nOption A, bankruptcy: while it might be a concern, it's not necessarily a legal ground to terminate the contract unless the contract itself specifies that as a condition.\n\nOption B, incomplete work: the gardener was still working and hadn't completed the job when discharged. But was that because the owner told them to stop? If the gardener was willing and able to continue but was prevented from doing so by the owner, it's not clear that incomplete work alone is sufficient grounds for discharge.\n\nOption C, no written contract: again, not a ground for discharge.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer, as defective work and refusal to correct it constitute a breach of contract, giving the owner legal grounds to discharge the gardener.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other possible grounds that might not be listed here.\n\nFor example, if the gardener was not performing the work in a workmanlike manner, or if they were causing damage to the property, that could be grounds for termination. But none of that is mentioned in the scenario.\n\nSimilarly, if the gardener was not going to meet the deadline, that could be a issue, but again, the scenario doesn't specify that.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the options given, option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
