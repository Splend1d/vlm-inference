                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about why the majority of part-time work is done by women, according to Hakim (1995, 1996). There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through each one.\n\nOption A says that part-time jobs pay relatively high wages and are financially beneficial. But I thought that generally, part-time jobs might pay less per hour compared to full-time jobs, and they might not come with benefits like health insurance or pension plans. So, I'm not sure if this is accurate.\n\nOption B says that women make a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives. This sounds like women choose part-time work because it fits better with their responsibilities at home, maybe like taking care of children or other family members. It's a choice they make based on their lifestyle preferences.\n\nOption C mentions that their choices are constrained by structural factors, such as being unable to afford childcare. This seems different from option B because it's not just a choice; there are barriers that make it difficult for women to work full-time if they have young children or other dependents.\n\nOption D says that full-time work is not available in the kinds of occupations that they want to enter. This suggests that women might want to work full-time in certain fields, but those jobs aren't offered on a full-time basis, or perhaps there's a lack of opportunities.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Hakim argued in 1995 and 1996. I remember that Hakim is known for her work on women's employment preferences and how they relate to their family roles. She proposed a concept called \"preference theory,\" which suggests that women have different preferences when it comes to balancing work and family life.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to align with Hakim's ideas. She would argue that women rationally choose to work part-time because it allows them to fulfill their roles at home while still being employed. It's a preference based on their values and circumstances.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, suggests that women's choices are constrained by external factors like the cost of childcare. While this is certainly an important issue, Hakim's theory emphasizes individual preferences rather than structural constraints.\n\nOption D seems to be more about the availability of full-time jobs in certain sectors, which might not directly relate to Hakim's focus on individual preferences.\n\nOption A doesn't seem to make much sense because part-time jobs are generally not known for paying higher wages; in fact, they often pay less and offer fewer benefits.\n\nSo, based on my understanding of Hakim's work, I think the correct answer is B: they make a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if Hakim also discussed structural factors or constraints. If I recall correctly, Hakim does acknowledge that some women may face constraints, but her main emphasis is on the preferences women have for different types of work arrangements.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
