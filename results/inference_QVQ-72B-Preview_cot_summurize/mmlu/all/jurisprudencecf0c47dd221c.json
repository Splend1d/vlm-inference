Defined law in accordance with morality and purity\n\nC. Separated law from religion, ethics, sociology, and history\n\nD. Discussed law purely in terms of justice\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Kelsen's pure theory of law is all about. I remember that Kelsen was a legal positivist, which means he believed that law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions. His theory is often associated with the idea of the \"Grundnorm\" or basic norm, which is an assumed higher norm that validates all other norms in a legal system.\n\nNow, looking at option A: \"Purely discussed jurisprudence only.\" While it's true that Kelsen focused on jurisprudence, I think his theory goes beyond just discussing jurisprudence in isolation. He was interested in the structure and function of legal systems, so this option seems a bit too narrow.\n\nOption B: \"Defined law in accordance with morality and purity.\" This doesn't sound right because legal positivism, which Kelsen advocated, typically separates law from morality. Positivists believe that the validity of a law isn't dependent on its moral content but rather on its sources and the way it's created.\n\nOption C: \"Separated law from religion, ethics, sociology, and history.\" This seems more in line with Kelsen's approach. He was known for his emphasis on the autonomy of law, meaning that law should be studied as a self-contained system, independent from other social sciences and moral considerations. This aligns with his positivist stance.\n\nOption D: \"Discussed law purely in terms of justice.\" Again, this contradicts the positivist perspective. Positivists like Kelsen believe that law and justice are separate domains. They argue that law can exist without being just, and justice can be pursued outside of the law. Therefore, discussing law purely in terms of justice would go against Kelsen's views.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to be the most accurate explanation for why Kelsen's theory is called the pure theory of law. He emphasized the separation of law from other disciplines and moral considerations, focusing instead on the internal logic and structure of legal systems.\n\nTo double-check, I'll recall Kelsen's famous work, \"The Pure Theory of Law.\" In this work, he indeed argues for a science of law that is autonomous and free from metaphysical, ethical, or other non-legal concerns. He saw law as a hierarchical system of norms, with each norm deriving its validity from a higher norm, culminating in the Grundnorm.\n\nSo, in summary, Kelsen's theory is called \"pure\" because it separates law from religion, ethics, sociology, and history, focusing solely on the logical structure of the legal system. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
