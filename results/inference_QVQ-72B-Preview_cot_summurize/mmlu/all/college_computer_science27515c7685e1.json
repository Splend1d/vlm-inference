                    "text": "So here's this probability problem. Let me read it carefully.\n\nCompany X shipped 5 computer chips, and out of these, 1 is defective. Company Y shipped 4 computer chips, and out of those, 2 are defective. So in total, there are 5 + 4 = 9 chips, and among them, there are 1 + 2 = 3 defective chips.\n\nNow, one chip is chosen at random from these 9 chips, and it turns out to be defective. The question is, what's the probability that this defective chip came from Company Y?\n\nHmm, okay. So, this seems like a conditional probability problem. I think I should use Bayes' theorem here, but let me make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nWe know that the chip is defective, and we want to find the probability that it came from Company Y. So, it's given that the chip is defective, and we need to find the probability that it's from Y.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- D: the event that the chip is defective.\n\n- Y: the event that the chip is from Company Y.\n\nThen, the probability we're looking for is P(Y|D), which is the probability that the chip is from Company Y given that it's defective.\n\nBayes' theorem states that:\n\nP(Y|D) = [P(D|Y) * P(Y)] / P(D)\n\nOkay, so I need to find P(D|Y), P(Y), and P(D).\n\nFirst, P(Y) is the probability that a randomly chosen chip is from Company Y, regardless of whether it's defective or not.\n\nThere are 9 chips in total (5 from X and 4 from Y), so P(Y) is 4/9.\n\nNext, P(D|Y) is the probability that a chip is defective given that it's from Company Y.\n\nFrom the problem, Company Y shipped 4 chips, and 2 of them are defective. So, P(D|Y) is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, P(D) is the overall probability that a randomly chosen chip is defective, without any condition.\n\nThere are 3 defective chips out of 9, so P(D) is 3/9, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nPlugging these into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(Y|D) = (1/2 * 4/9) / (1/3)\n\nFirst, multiply 1/2 and 4/9:\n\n(1/2) * (4/9) = 4/18 = 2/9\n\nThen, divide by 1/3:\n\n(2/9) / (1/3) = (2/9) * (3/1) = 6/9 = 2/3\n\nSo, according to this, the probability is 2/3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in another way to confirm.\n\nTotal defective chips: 3.\n\nOut of these 3 defective chips, how many are from Company Y?\n\nCompany Y has 2 defective chips.\n\nSo, out of the 3 defective chips, 2 are from Y.\n\nTherefore, the probability should be 2/3.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nLet me consider another approach, maybe using the formula for conditional probability directly.\n\nP(Y|D) = P(Y and D) / P(D)\n\nWe already have P(D) = 1/3.\n\nNow, P(Y and D) is the probability that the chip is both from Company Y and defective.\n\nFrom Company Y, out of 4 chips, 2 are defective.\n\nSo, the probability that a chip is both from Y and defective is 2 out of 9, which is 2/9.\n\nThen, P(Y|D) = (2/9) / (1/3) = 2/3.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any dependency or something I'm missing?\n\nWell, the chips are being chosen uniformly at random from all 9 chips, and it's given that the chosen chip is defective.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there's any dependency beyond what's stated.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the defective chip came from Company Y is 2/3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 2 / 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
