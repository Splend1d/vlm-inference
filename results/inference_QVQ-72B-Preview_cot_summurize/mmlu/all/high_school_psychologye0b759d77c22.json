Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to figure out which field of study is all about mental processes and behavior. Mental processes sound like thoughts, emotions, perceptions\u2014that kind of stuff. And behavior is how we act based on those mental processes, right?\n\nOption A is biology. I know biology is about living organisms\u2014their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution. So, while it does study living things, it seems pretty broad. Also, biology covers plants and animals, not specifically human minds or behaviors. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nOption B is psychology. I think psychology is about the study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists try to understand why people think, feel, and act the way they do. They look at things like perception, cognition, personality, and social interactions. This seems pretty close to what the question is asking.\n\nOption C is cognition. Cognition refers to mental processes involved in acquiring knowledge and understanding, such as thinking, learning, remembering, and reasoning. So, it's a part of the broader field that studies mental processes, but it's not the entire field. It's more specific than what the question is asking for.\n\nOption D is the scientific method. The scientific method is a process for experimentation and research that is used in many scientific disciplines, including psychology. It's a way of asking questions and testing hypotheses systematically. But it's not a field of study in itself; it's a method used within those fields.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best answer is B. psychology. Psychology is the field that specifically focuses on the scientific investigation of mental processes and behavior.\n\nJust to double-check, let me think about it again. Biology is more about the physical aspects of living things, not specifically mental processes. Cognition is a part of psychology, focusing on mental processes related to knowledge and understanding. The scientific method is a way of conducting research, not a field of study about mental processes and behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. psychology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. psychology}} \\]"
