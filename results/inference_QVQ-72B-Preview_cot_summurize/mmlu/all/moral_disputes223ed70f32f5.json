                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this statement by Carruthers about how we should act towards animals for their sake. The question is asking what explains the fact that we're required to act in a certain way towards an animal for its own benefit. The options are:\n\nA. The animal itself.\n\nB. The wider effects on human beings.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n\nFirst, I need to grasp what Carruthers is saying here. He's suggesting that when we have a moral obligation to treat an animal in a certain way for its own sake, there's an explanation behind that obligation. The question is asking for what provides that explanation: is it something about the animal, something about how it affects humans, or both, or neither.\n\nLet me think about moral obligations towards animals. Generally, when we say we should treat animals well for their own sake, we're acknowledging that they have intrinsic value or interests that we should respect. So, it seems like the explanation for why we should act in a certain way is because of something about the animal itself\u2014perhaps its ability to feel pain or experience well-being.\n\nBut then there's also the consideration of how our treatment of animals affects humans. For example, treating animals humanely might lead to better mental health in people, or it might foster a society that is more compassionate overall. So, in this case, the explanation for why we should act kindly towards animals isn't just about the animals' welfare, but also about the benefits to humans.\n\nNow, Carruthers might be arguing that the primary explanation is one or the other. If he's a consequentialist, he might say that the wider effects on humans explain why we should care about animals, because ultimately, human well-being is what matters. On the other hand, if he's an ethical pluralist or a deontologist, he might argue that the intrinsic properties of the animal itself require certain treatments.\n\nBut I need to recall specifically what Carruthers believes. From what I remember, Carruthers is known for his views on animal cognition and ethics. He has argued that animals have mental states and can experience pain and suffering, which gives them moral standing. So, according to him, animals have interests that we should consider.\n\nGiven that, it seems like he would say that the facts about the animal itself explain why we have moral obligations towards them. That is, because animals can suffer and have interests, we are required to act in ways that respect those interests for the animal's sake.\n\nHowever, he might also consider the effects on humans. For instance, treating animals well might have positive impacts on human morality or society. But I think his primary focus is on the intrinsic value of the animals.\n\nLet me consider this more carefully. If the explanation is about the animal itself, then option A seems correct. If it's about the wider effects on humans, then option B is correct. If both are necessary to explain the moral requirement, then option C is correct. And if neither explains it, then option D is correct.\n\nGiven Carruthers' emphasis on animals' mental capacities and their ability to experience pain and pleasure, it seems that he would prioritize the animal's own well-being as the explanation for why we should act in certain ways towards them. Therefore, option A seems the most fitting answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any indication that he thinks the effects on humans are also part of the explanation. While it's possible that he acknowledges benefits to humans from treating animals well, his main argument for moral consideration of animals is based on their own ability to experience certain mental states.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe the correct answer is A. The animal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
