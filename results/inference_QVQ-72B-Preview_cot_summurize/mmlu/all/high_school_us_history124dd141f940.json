During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nWhich of the following in later years would be most likely to see themselves in Logan's position?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Logan, an Indian leader from 1774, and his address expressing his feelings towards the white settlers. The question is asking which group from a later era would most likely see themselves in Logan's position. The options are:\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s\n\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s\n\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s\n\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s\n\nFirst, I need to understand Logan's position based on the text provided. He talks about how he was peaceful and helpful to the white settlers, providing them with food and shelter. He was known as a friend to the white man, but his perspective changed after a tragic event: the murder of his relatives by Colonel Cresap. This event pushed him towards revenge and violence, even though he now sees the value in peace.\n\nSo, Logan initially tried to coexist peacefully but was driven to extreme measures due to the actions of others. He feels betrayed and justifies his retaliatory actions as a means to seek vengeance for the harm done to his family.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these groups from the given options might resonate with Logan's experience.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: An opponent of big government in the 1930s**\n\nIn the 1930s, during the Great Depression, there was a significant expansion of government roles in the economy through President Roosevelt's New Deal. Opponents of big government during this time were likely advocating for less government intervention and more individual freedom and responsibility.\n\nWhile Logan's situation involved conflicts between different groups, the opposition to big government is more about the size and scope of government power rather than inter-group conflicts or feelings of betrayal. So, it doesn't seem to align closely with Logan's experience of feeling betrayed and seeking revenge.\n\n**Option B: An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s**\n\nThe 1950s were characterized by a boom in consumer culture, with advertising and mass marketing playing significant roles in society. Opponents of consumerism might have been critical of the materialistic focus and the potential negative impacts on society and individuals.\n\nLogan's situation involves direct personal and communal trauma leading to a shift in his actions and beliefs, whereas opposition to consumerism is more about ideological differences regarding materialism and lifestyle choices. While both may involve feelings of disillusionment, the contexts are quite different.\n\n**Option C: A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s**\n\nIn the 1960s, liberalism often encompassed social and political movements advocating for civil rights, equality, and social justice. Supporters of liberalism during this period were pushing for changes in areas like racial equality, women's rights, and anti-war sentiments.\n\nLogan's position involves a personal and communal response to specific acts of violence and betrayal. While supporters of liberalism in the 1960s might have sympathized with Logan's plight, their broader goals were more about systemic change and equality rather than personal revenge or direct retaliation.\n\n**Option D: A supporter of feminism in the 1970s**\n\nFeminism in the 1970s was part of the second wave of the feminist movement, focusing on a wide range of issues such as equal pay, reproductive rights, and challenging gender stereotypes. Supporters of feminism were advocating for women's liberation and equality with men.\n\nAgain, while Logan's situation involved feelings of injustice and the need for redress, the feminist movement was about structural inequalities and social justice on a larger scale, not primarily about personal revenge or direct retaliation against individuals.\n\nAfter considering each option, none of them seem to perfectly mirror Logan's position of feeling betrayed and seeking personal vengeance due to specific harmful actions against his family and community. However, among the given choices, option C, a supporter of liberalism in the 1960s, might be the closest in terms of advocating for the interests of a marginalized group facing injustice.\n\nBut even then, liberalism in the 1960s was more about advocating for equal rights and social justice through peaceful means, rather than seeking revenge or engaging in violent retaliation, as Logan did.\n\nGiven this, perhaps none of the options perfectly align with Logan's experience, but if I had to choose one, I would select option C, a supporter of liberalism in the 1960s, because it involves advocating for the interests of a group that feels oppressed or mistreated by the dominant society.\n\nHowever, I have doubts about this choice because the methods and motivations differ significantly. Logan was driven by a desire for revenge after a specific traumatic event, whereas supporters of liberalism in the 1960s were driven by a desire for equality and social justice, often through non-violent means.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing the understanding of Logan's position beyond just his actions, but also his feelings of betrayal and the need to stand up against perceived injustices.\n\nIn conclusion, while none of the options perfectly match Logan's unique historical context and personal experiences, option C, a supporter of liberalism in the 1960s, might be the most likely to see themselves in a position of advocating for a group that feels marginalized or betrayed by the dominant society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
