                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a regression analysis. There's a regression equation: yt = \u03b21 + \u03b22 x2t + \u03b23 x3t + ut, and it's estimated using 27 quarterly observations. The question is asking for the appropriate critical value for a two-sided 5% size test of the null hypothesis that \u03b23 equals 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a critical value is in this context. A critical value is a point on the distribution that helps determine whether to reject the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. For a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, I would look for the values that cut off the upper and lower 2.5% of the distribution.\n\nSince this is a regression analysis, the test statistic for \u03b23 would likely be a t-statistic. The t-statistic for testing \u03b23 is calculated as (b3 - \u03b20)/(SE(b3)), where b3 is the estimated coefficient, \u03b20 is the hypothesized value (which is 1 in this case), and SE(b3) is the standard error of the estimate of \u03b23.\n\nBut here, I don't have the estimated value of \u03b23 or its standard error, so I probably don't need to calculate the actual t-statistic. Instead, I think the question is asking for the critical value from the t-distribution that would be used to compare against the t-statistic.\n\nSo, for a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, I need to find the t-values that correspond to the upper and lower 2.5% points of the t-distribution.\n\nNext, I need to determine the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution. In regression analysis, the degrees of freedom are n - k, where n is the number of observations and k is the number of regressors (including the constant term).\n\nFrom the problem, there are 27 quarterly observations. The regression equation has three coefficients: \u03b21 (constant), \u03b22, and \u03b23. So, k = 3.\n\nTherefore, degrees of freedom df = 27 - 3 = 24.\n\nNow, I need to find the critical t-values for 24 degrees of freedom at the 2.5% level on each tail.\n\nLooking at a t-distribution table, I need to find the t-value such that P(t > t_critical) = 0.025 for df = 24.\n\nSimilarly, P(t < -t_critical) = 0.025.\n\nSo, the critical value is the t-value that leaves 2.5% in the upper tail and 2.5% in the lower tail.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a two-sided test at 5%, I can look for the t-value corresponding to a 95% confidence level with df = 24.\n\nWait, but the options provided are:\n\nA. 1.64\n\nB. 1.71\n\nC. 2.06\n\nD. 1.96\n\nI need to see which of these corresponds to the critical t-value for df = 24 at the 2.5% level.\n\nLet me recall or look up the t-distribution table to find the critical value for df = 24 and \u03b1 = 0.025.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula or a standard t-table.\n\nFrom my memory, for df = 24, the t-value for a two-tailed test at 5% significance level is approximately 2.064.\n\nLet me confirm that.\n\nYes, checking a t-table, for df = 24, the t-value that corresponds to a two-tailed test at 5% is indeed approximately 2.064.\n\nSo, the critical value would be approximately 2.06.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 2.06.\n\nBut let's make sure.\n\nOption A is 1.64, which sounds familiar for a z-distribution at 5% one-tailed test, but that's not applicable here.\n\nOption B is 1.71, which might be for a different degrees of freedom or significance level.\n\nOption D is 1.96, which is the critical z-value for a two-tailed test at 5% in a standard normal distribution, but since we're dealing with a small sample size (n=27, df=24), we should use the t-distribution, not the z-distribution.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. 2.06.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
