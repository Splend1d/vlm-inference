                    "text": "So Tara can develop 2 rolls of film in about 18 minutes. I need to find out how long it will take her to develop 8 rolls of film at this same rate. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how long it takes her to develop one roll. If 2 rolls take 18 minutes, then one roll would take half of that, right? So, 18 minutes divided by 2 is 9 minutes per roll.\n\nNow, if one roll takes 9 minutes, then 8 rolls should take 8 times that, which is 8 times 9 minutes. Let's calculate that: 8 multiplied by 9 is 72 minutes.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, there's 42 minutes, 1 hour 12 minutes, 1 hour 20 minutes, and 1 hour 44 minutes. 72 minutes is the same as 1 hour 12 minutes, I think. Let's confirm that.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n72 minutes minus 60 minutes is 12 minutes, so that's 1 hour and 12 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 1 hour 12 minutes.\n\nBut let me double-check another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother approach: Since Tara develops 2 rolls in 18 minutes, maybe I can find out how many sets of 2 rolls are in 8 rolls.\n\n8 divided by 2 is 4, so it's 4 sets of 18 minutes.\n\n4 times 18 is 72 minutes again.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the rate at which she develops the film.\n\nIf she develops 2 rolls in 18 minutes, her rate is 2 rolls per 18 minutes.\n\nTo find out the time for 8 rolls, I can set up a proportion: 2 rolls / 18 minutes = 8 rolls / t minutes.\n\nCross-multiplying: 2 times t = 8 times 18.\n\nSo, 2t = 144.\n\nThen, t = 144 / 2 = 72 minutes.\n\nAgain, that's 72 minutes, which is 1 hour 12 minutes.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if the development process is sequential or parallel.\n\nLike, if she has to develop each roll one after the other, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nThe problem says she can develop 2 rolls in 18 minutes, so probably she can handle multiple rolls at once, but the time adds up linearly based on the number of rolls.\n\nBut based on the information given, I think the straightforward interpretation is correct.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. 1 hour 12 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 1\\ \\text{hour}\\ 12\\ \\text{minutes}} \\]"
