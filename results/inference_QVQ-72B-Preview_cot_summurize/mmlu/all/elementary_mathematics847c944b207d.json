Let me see, I can add these numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll add 145 and 281. 145 plus 281... let's break it down. 145 plus 200 is 345, and then adding the remaining 81 would bring it to 426. So, 145 + 281 = 426.\n\nNow, I need to add 62 to that. 426 plus 62... well, 426 plus 60 is 486, and then adding the extra 2 makes it 488. So, 426 + 62 = 488.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 426\n\nB. 488\n\nC. 946\n\nD. 1,046\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 488.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I'll try adding them in a different order. Starting with 281 + 145: 281 plus 100 is 381, plus 45 is 426. Then, 426 plus 62: 426 plus 60 is 486, plus 2 is 488. Yeah, that matches my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, I could add 145 + 62 first. 145 plus 60 is 205, plus 2 is 207. Then, 207 plus 281: 200 plus 280 is 480, plus 7 plus 1 is 488. Again, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this. But just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way these numbers could be interpreted. Is there any possibility of misreading the symbols or the numbers themselves? No, the problem seems straightforward: just adding three numbers together.\n\nAlso, considering the options, 946 and 1,046 seem too large, as I already have a sum of 488, which is less than half of those. 426 is the intermediate step, but that's not the final sum.\n\nSo, the exact answer is 488, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 488} \\]"
