                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about David covering cubes with paint, and it's talking about how the amount of paint he needs is directly proportional to the surface area of the cube. That makes sense because paint covers surfaces, right? So, if the surface area increases, he'd need more paint, and if it decreases, he'd need less.\n\nFirst, they say that David can cover a cube with side length 2 feet using exactly 16 quarts of paint. So, I need to find out how big a cube he can cover with 169 quarts of paint. The options are given in fractions and whole numbers, so I need to be careful with units and proportions here.\n\nOkay, let's start by recalling that the surface area of a cube is calculated by 6 times the side length squared. So, for a cube with side length s, the surface area A is:\n\n\\[ A = 6s^2 \\]\n\nGiven that, and since paint usage is directly proportional to surface area, I can set up a proportion between the paint used and the surface area.\n\nSo, for the first cube:\n\nSide length \\( s_1 = 2 \\) feet\n\nPaint used \\( p_1 = 16 \\) quarts\n\nFor the second cube:\n\nSide length \\( s_2 \\) (what we need to find)\n\nPaint used \\( p_2 = 169 \\) quarts\n\nSince paint is directly proportional to surface area, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p_1}{A_1} = \\frac{p_2}{A_2}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( A_1 = 6{s_1}^2 \\) and \\( A_2 = 6{s_2}^2 \\).\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{6(2)^2} = \\frac{169}{6(s_2)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\n2^2 = 4, \\text{ so } 6 \\times 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{24} = \\frac{169}{6(s_2)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify 16/24:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 \\div 8}{24 \\div 8} = \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{169}{6(s_2)^2}\n\\]\n\nNow, cross-multiply to solve for \\( (s_2)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 6(s_2)^2 = 3 \\times 169\n\\]\n\n\\[\n12(s_2)^2 = 507\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 12:\n\n\\[\n(s_2)^2 = \\frac{507}{12} = 42.25\n\\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides to find \\( s_2 \\):\n\n\\[\ns_2 = \\sqrt{42.25} = 6.5 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, none of them are 6.5 feet. The options are in fractions like 13/4, 13/2, and whole numbers like 8 and 13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the proportion.\n\nLet me double-check the initial setup. It says that the amount of paint is directly proportional to the surface area. So, if surface area increases, paint usage increases proportionally. Maybe I should set it up as paint proportional to surface area.\n\nGiven that, we can write:\n\n\\[\np = k \\times A\n\\]\n\nWhere k is the constant of proportionality, and A is the surface area.\n\nFrom the first cube:\n\n\\[\n16 = k \\times 6 \\times (2)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n16 = k \\times 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{16}{24} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, for the second cube:\n\n\\[\n169 = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 \\times (s_2)^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n169 = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 \\times s_2^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n169 = \\frac{12}{3} s_2^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n169 = 4 s_2^2\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{169}{4} = s_2^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{169}{4}} = \\frac{13}{2} \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nAh, so the edge length is 13/2 feet, which is 6.5 feet. That matches one of the options: C. 13/2.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{13}{4}\\)\n\nB. 8\n\nC. \\(\\frac{13}{2}\\)\n\nD. 13\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be C. \\(\\frac{13}{2}\\).\n\nBut let me check again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting over:\n\nGiven that paint is directly proportional to surface area.\n\nSurface area \\( A = 6s^2 \\)\n\nFor the first cube:\n\n\\( s = 2 \\) feet, \\( p = 16 \\) quarts\n\nFor the second cube:\n\n\\( s = ? \\), \\( p = 169 \\) quarts\n\nSince \\( p \\propto A \\), we have \\( p = k A \\), where \\( k \\) is the constant.\n\nFrom the first cube:\n\n\\( 16 = k \\times 6 \\times 4 \\)\n\n\\( 16 = k \\times 24 \\)\n\n\\( k = \\frac{16}{24} = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n\nNow, for the second cube:\n\n\\( 169 = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 \\times s^2 \\)\n\n\\( 169 = 4 s^2 \\)\n\n\\( s^2 = \\frac{169}{4} \\)\n\n\\( s = \\frac{13}{2} \\) feet\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the correct answer should be C. \\(\\frac{13}{2}\\).\n\nI think that's it. No further confusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{2}} \\]"
