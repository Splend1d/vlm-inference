                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. So, first up is Statement 1: \"Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.\" Hmm, I need to recall what a quotient ring is and how it relates to commutative rings.\n\nI remember that a quotient ring is formed by taking a ring and an ideal, and then defining equivalence classes based on that ideal. So, if we have a ring R and an ideal I, the quotient ring is R/I, where two elements a and b in R are equivalent if a - b is in I.\n\nNow, if R is commutative, that means for any two elements a and b in R, a*b = b*a. I need to check if this property carries over to R/I.\n\nLet's consider two cosets in R/I, say a + I and b + I. The product in R/I is defined as (a + I)*(b + I) = a*b + I. Since R is commutative, a*b = b*a, so a*b + I = b*a + I. Therefore, (a + I)*(b + I) = (b + I)*(a + I). This shows that multiplication in R/I is commutative whenever R is commutative.\n\nWait, but is there any chance that R/I could fail to be commutative even if R is commutative? I don't think so, because the commutativity is preserved in the quotient structure. So, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider an example. Take the ring of integers Z, which is commutative. An ideal in Z is, say, 2Z, the even integers. The quotient ring is Z/2Z, which is the ring of integers modulo 2, consisting of {0, 1}. Clearly, this is a commutative ring. Another example could be polynomial rings, like R[x], which are commutative if R is commutative, and their quotient rings would also be commutative.\n\nAlright, moving on to Statement 2: \"An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 is in N.\"\n\nFirst, recall that an ideal N in a ring R is a subset that is closed under addition and has the property that for any n in N and any r in R, both r*n and n*r are in N.\n\nNow, the statement says that N is all of R if and only if 1 is in N. Let's see why this is true.\n\nSuppose that 1 is in N. Then, for any r in R, r*1 = r and 1*r = r are both in N, since N is an ideal. Therefore, every element of R is in N, which means N = R.\n\nConversely, if N = R, then 1 is in R, so it must be in N as well.\n\nWait, but is there any catch here? Let's think about it again.\n\nIf N = R, and R contains 1, then certainly 1 is in N.\n\nOn the other hand, if 1 is in N, then N contains every element of R, as explained earlier, so N = R.\n\nThis seems straightforward, so Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider a specific example.\n\nTake R = Z, the ring of integers, which has unity 1.\n\nLet N = 2Z, the even integers, which is an ideal.\n\nN \u2260 Z, because it doesn't contain odd integers like 1.\n\nAnd 1 is not in N.\n\nNow, take N = Z itself, which is an ideal.\n\nThen N = Z, and indeed, 1 is in N.\n\nAnother example: take R = Z[x], polynomials with integer coefficients, with unity 1.\n\nLet N = (x), the ideal generated by x.\n\nN \u2260 Z[x], because it doesn't contain constants like 1.\n\nAnd 1 is not in N.\n\nIf we take N = Z[x], which is R itself, then N = R, and 1 is in N.\n\nSo, these examples support the statement that N = R if and only if 1 is in N.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ True, True}} \\]"
