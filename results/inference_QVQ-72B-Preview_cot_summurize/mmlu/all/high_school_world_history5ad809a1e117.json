But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about British motivations for trying to end the sati ritual in India. Sati, as I recall, is a practice where a widow immolates herself on her husband's funeral pyre. Pretty grim stuff, and it's been widely criticized as inhumane. The passage is from William Bentinck, who was the Governor-General of India in 1829, and he's discussing whether to continue or discontinue the practice.\n\nThe question is asking about the tone of the first passage and which supposition it best supports regarding British motivations. There are four options:\n\nA. The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.\n\nB. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\n\nC. They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.\n\nD. They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the tone of Bentinck's passage. He seems to be grappling with a moral dilemma. On one hand, he recognizes that sati is a cruel and untimely end for innocent victims, and as someone in a position of power, he feels a responsibility to prevent it. On the other hand, he's concerned that taking action against sati might put the British Empire's safety in India at risk.\n\nHe mentions that consenting to the practice continues to happen year after year, and if he has the power to prevent it, not doing so would be horrifying. But he also considers the alternative\u2014prohibiting it\u2014could jeopardize British authority in India. He notes that when the British had powerful neighbors and their own security was in doubt, perhaps a more cautious approach was warranted. However, now that the British are supreme in India, he favors an open and general prohibition.\n\nSo, his tone is one of moral urgency tempered by practical concerns for maintaining British rule. He wants to do the right thing by ending a cruel practice but doesn't want to risk the stability of British control in the process.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Christianization: While the British did have Christianization efforts in India, the passage doesn't mention religion or converting Hindus to Christianity. It's focused on ending sati as an inhumane practice, not on promoting Christianity.\n\nB. Ending inhumane practice without endangering authority: This seems to align closely with Bentinck's concerns. He explicitly mentions the cruelty of sati and his desire to prevent it, but also worries about the impact on British authority. He concludes that now is the time to prohibit it because British supremacy is secure.\n\nC. Progressive concern for women's equality: While ending sati would certainly benefit women, the passage doesn't specifically mention women's equality or rights. It focuses more on the cruelty of the practice and the moral responsibility to prevent it, balanced against maintaining British authority.\n\nD. Racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs: This doesn't seem to fit the tone of the passage. Bentinck is not expressing disdain for all Indian customs; he's specifically addressing one practice that he finds cruel. He's trying to find a balance between ending a harmful practice and maintaining British rule, not showing racial prejudice against all Indian customs.\n\nSo, based on the tone of the passage, option B seems to be the most accurate reflection of Bentinck's motivations. He wants to end what he considers an inhumane practice but is cautious not to undermine British authority in the process.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look at the second passage briefly. It's from George Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826. He talks about ruling the Indians with a rod of iron and making them feel dependent on the goods the company sells them. This suggests a colonial mentality focused on control and economic dominance, but it doesn't directly relate to the issue of sati or the motivations for ending it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
