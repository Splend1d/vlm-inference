                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Anscombe thought about moral psychology. The question is asking what an adequate moral psychology would include according to her. The options are:\n\nA. an answer to the mind-body problem.\n\nB. analyses of concepts such as \u201caction\u201d and \u201cintention.\u201d\n\nC. an explanation of how free will is possible.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nI need to recall what Anscombe wrote about moral psychology. I remember that she was a philosopher who contributed to ethics and the philosophy of action. She wrote a paper called \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" where she criticized the dominant moral philosophy of her time and proposed some changes.\n\nIn that paper, she discusses the importance of understanding human actions and intentions. She argues that moral philosophy should be grounded in a proper understanding of human agency. So, analyzing concepts like \"action\" and \"intention\" seems relevant to her thought, which would be option B.\n\nBut let's think about the other options. Option A is about the mind-body problem. Anscombe did write about philosophy of mind, and she was influenced by Aristotle and Aquinas, who both dealt with the relationship between mind and body. However, I'm not entirely sure if she saw solving the mind-body problem as essential to moral psychology.\n\nOption C is about explaining how free will is possible. Anscombe did discuss free will in some of her works. In \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" she talks about responsibility and blame, which are connected to free will. So, it seems like free will is also part of her moral psychology.\n\nOption D suggests that all of the above are included in an adequate moral psychology according to Anscombe.\n\nNow, I need to decide which one is correct. Since Anscombe emphasized the importance of understanding human actions and intentions in her moral philosophy, option B seems particularly relevant. But she also touched upon free will and responsibility, which align with option C.\n\nHowever, I'm not as sure about the mind-body problem being central to her moral psychology. While it's related to philosophy of mind, which she was interested in, her moral philosophy seems more focused on the concepts of action and intention, and the conditions under which people are morally responsible for their actions.\n\nMaybe the mind-body problem isn't directly addressed in her moral psychology, whereas analyzing actions and intentions, and explaining free will are more central.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider if there's a connection between the mind-body problem and moral psychology in Anscombe's view.\n\nIf I recall correctly, Anscombe was interested in the idea that human beings are embodied rational agents. Her work on the philosophy of mind suggests that she thought about the nature of the soul and its relationship to the body, which is related to the mind-body problem.\n\nIn \"The Intention,\" she discusses the nature of intentional actions, which involves both the mind (intentions) and the body (actions). So, perhaps there is a connection there.\n\nBut still, when I think about her main points in \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" it's more about the concepts of action and intention, and the rejection of a purely consequentialist approach to ethics.\n\nMaybe option D is the correct answer because all three aspects are important in her moral psychology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option B is the most accurate because it's directly related to her analysis in \"The Intention\" and \"Modern Moral Philosophy.\"\n\nI need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me look back at some key points in \"Modern Moral Philosophy.\"\n\nIn that paper, Anscombe criticizes the prevailing moral philosophy of her time, which she sees as overly focused on duty and obligation without a proper foundation in understanding what actions are.\n\nShe emphasizes the importance of understanding human actions in terms of intentions and purposes. She also discusses the role of law and the importance of distinguishing between different kinds of actions based on their intentions.\n\nFurthermore, she touches upon the concept of free will when discussing responsibility and blame. She argues that people are only morally responsible for actions that are within their control, which implies a belief in some form of free will.\n\nSo, options B and C seem to be central to her moral psychology.\n\nWhat about option A, the mind-body problem?\n\nWhile Anscombe did write about philosophy of mind and the nature of the soul, I'm not sure if resolving the mind-body problem is a prerequisite for an adequate moral psychology in her view.\n\nPerhaps understanding the nature of the mind and body is important for a full account of human agency, but it might not be a direct component of moral psychology as she conceived it.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards option D being incorrect, and either option B or C being correct.\n\nBut since both B and C are important in her moral psychology, maybe she would say that all three are necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mind-body problem is too broad or not directly relevant to moral psychology in her framework.\n\nI need to make a decision based on what I know.\n\nConsidering that Anscombe's main contributions to moral psychology are in the areas of action theory and intention, and to some extent free will and responsibility, I think option B is the most accurate answer.\n\nOption C is also relevant, but perhaps not as central as option B.\n\nOption A, the mind-body problem, while interesting and related to philosophy of mind, doesn't seem to be a direct component of her moral psychology.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option B: analyses of concepts such as \u201caction\u201d and \u201cintention.\u201d\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
