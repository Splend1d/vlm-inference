Aquinas was a prominent scholastic philosopher and theologian, and his thoughts are deeply rooted in Aristotelian philosophy. In Aristotle's ethics, particularly in the Nicomachean Ethics, the concept of telos is central. Telos can be translated as 'end' or 'purpose,' and it refers to the ultimate goal or purpose of an action.\n\nAquinas builds upon this idea in his own work, integrating it with Christian doctrine. So, when we talk about the end of every action, we're discussing what ultimately motivates or aims our actions.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: some desire.\n\nDesire is a strong feeling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen. In many philosophical traditions, desires are seen as motivators of action. However, in Aquinas's view, desires might be a part of what moves us to act, but they aren't the ultimate end. Desires can be directed towards various ends, some of which may be good and others not so much. Aquinas would likely see desire as a means to an end rather than the end itself.\n\nOption B: some pleasure.\n\nPleasure is a feeling of happiness or satisfaction derived from something enjoyable. Again, in Aquinas's moral framework, pleasure can be a byproduct of good actions, but it isn't the ultimate end of every action. He would argue that pursuing pleasure for its own sake can lead to immoral behavior if it's not aligned with the higher good.\n\nOption C: some good.\n\nThis seems promising. Aquinas believed that all human actions are directed towards some perceived good. In his work, the Summa Theologica, he writes that \"every voluntary action has for its object some good under some aspect.\" This means that when we act, we do so because we see some good in what we're doing, even if that good is mistakenly perceived.\n\nMoreover, Aquinas distinguishes between different kinds of goods: there are material goods like health and wealth, and there are spiritual or moral goods like virtue and knowledge. Ultimately, he argues that the highest good is God, who is the perfection towards which all human actions are directed.\n\nOption D: some emotional state.\n\nEmotions are complex psychological states that involve feelings, thoughts, and physical sensations. While emotions can influence our actions significantly, Aquinas wouldn't view them as the ultimate end of our actions. Instead, he would likely see them as part of the human experience that can either lead us towards or away from the true good.\n\nGiven this background, it seems that option C, \"some good,\" is the most accurate answer. Aquinas believed that every action is directed towards some good, even if the person's judgment about what constitutes a good is flawed.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider a specific quote from Aquinas. In the Summa Theologica, he says, \"Good is that to which every action tends.\" This reinforces the idea that the end of every action is some good.\n\nAdditionally, in his discussion of human actions, Aquinas often refers to the concept of intentionality, meaning that our actions are purposeful and directed towards ends that we perceive as good. This further supports the idea that the end of every action is some good.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Aquinas argues that the end of every action is some good.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
