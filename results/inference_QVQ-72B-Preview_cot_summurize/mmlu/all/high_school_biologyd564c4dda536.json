                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options isn't a characteristic of asexual reproduction in animals. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. That sounds right because in asexual reproduction, you're basically making copies of yourself without combining genes from two parents. So, the chromosome number should stay the same.\n\nOption B says that daughter cells are identical to the parent cell. Yeah, that makes sense too. Since it's asexual, there's no mixing of genetic material from two different parents, so the offspring should be very similar, if not identical, to the parent.\n\nOption C says that the parent cell produces diploid cells. Hmm, in biology, diploid refers to cells that have two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. But in asexual reproduction, there's only one parent, so I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, in asexual reproduction, the parent cell is already diploid, and it produces daughter cells that are also diploid and identical to it. So, maybe this is correct.\n\nOption D says that the daughter cells fuse to form a zygote. Now, in sexual reproduction, we know that gametes (like sperm and egg) fuse to form a zygote. But in asexual reproduction, there's no fusion of gametes; it's just the parent cell dividing directly into daughter cells without any mating or combination of genetic material from two sources.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems like it doesn't belong because fusing daughter cells to form a zygote is more characteristic of sexual reproduction, not asexual reproduction.\n\nLet me double-check. Asexual reproduction is a process where an organism produces offspring from a single parent without any involvement of gametes or fusion of cells. So, no, there isn't any fusion of daughter cells to form a zygote in asexual reproduction.\n\nTherefore, option D is NOT a characteristic of asexual reproduction in animals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
