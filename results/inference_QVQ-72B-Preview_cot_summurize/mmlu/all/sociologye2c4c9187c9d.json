Both boys and girls being closely attached to their mothers, but then boys breaking away\n\nB. Girls being attached to their mothers but then breaking away\n\nC. Boys being attached to their fathers and girls to their mothers\n\nD. Both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers, but girls breaking away\n\nI need to recall what Chodorow argued about how gender socialization happens through these attachments.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chodorow was a feminist psychoanalytic theorist who wrote about the development of gender identity and the ways in which society shapes gender roles. Her work in 1978, I think it was \"The Reproduction of Mothering,\" where she discussed these ideas.\n\nLet me think about the attachments she believed were key in gender socialization.\n\nOption A says both boys and girls are closely attached to their mothers, but then boys break away. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I recall that Chodorow emphasized the mother's role in nurturing both sons and daughters, but that boys might distance themselves from their mothers as they develop a masculine identity.\n\nOption B says only girls are attached to their mothers but then break away. That doesn't seem right. I think Chodorow believed that both boys and girls have close attachments to their mothers initially.\n\nOption C suggests that boys are attached to their fathers and girls to their mothers. While this might be a common cultural expectation, I don't think it's what Chodorow argued. She seemed to focus more on the mother's role in nurturing both genders.\n\nOption D proposes that both boys and girls are closely attached to their fathers, but girls break away. That contradicts what I recall about Chodorow's views. I think she emphasized the mother's role in early attachment for both genders.\n\nSo, between options A and C, option A seems more accurate based on what I remember. Let me double-check.\n\nChodorow argued that since mothers are typically the primary caregivers, both boys and girls develop a close attachment to their mothers. However, as boys grow older, they are socialized to adopt masculine traits, which often involve distancing themselves from emotions and nurturing, which are associated with femininity and the mother. Therefore, boys break away from their close attachment to their mothers to conform to societal expectations of masculinity.\n\nGirls, on the other hand, are encouraged to maintain their emotional connections and nurturing abilities, which are seen as feminine traits. So, they don't break away from their attachment to their mothers in the same way.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Both boys and girls being closely attached to their mothers, but then boys breaking away.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other perspective that Chodorow might have had. For example, did she discuss attachments to fathers at all? While she recognized the father's role in the family, her main focus was on the mother's influence in shaping gender identity through nurturing.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
