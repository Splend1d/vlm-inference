                    "text": "So last year, Chesa made 32 one-cup servings of soup for a school party. This year, she's planning to make two times the amount she made last year. I need to figure out how many gallons that will be.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many cups are in a gallon. I think there are 16 cups in one gallon. Is that right? Let me double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure there are 16 cups in a gallon.\n\nLast year, Chesa made 32 cups of soup. This year, she's making two times that amount. So, 32 multiplied by 2 should give me the total number of cups she's making this year.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 32 times 2 is 64 cups.\n\nNow, I need to convert that into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, I need to divide the total number of cups by 16 to get the number of gallons.\n\nSo, 64 divided by 16 equals... let's see. 16 times 4 is 64. So, that should be 4 gallons.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can use fractions or something. Like, if 1 gallon is 16 cups, then 64 cups would be 64 over 16, which simplifies to 4. Yeah, that matches what I got before.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider the units. If I have 64 cups and I want gallons, and I know that 1 gallon equals 16 cups, then the conversion factor is 1 gallon per 16 cups. So, 64 cups times (1 gallon / 16 cups) would give me 4 gallons. That seems consistent.\n\nI should also consider if there's a way to visualize this. Like, if I imagine having 16 cups making one gallon, then two more sets of 16 cups would make two more gallons, but wait, 32 cups would make two gallons. But Chesa is making 64 cups, which is four times 16 cups, so four gallons.\n\nHmm, another way to look at it is to see if there's a formula or something, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. It's a straightforward division problem: total cups divided by cups per gallon equals total gallons.\n\nSo, 64 divided by 16 is definitely 4. Therefore, Chesa will make 4 gallons of soup this year.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 64\n\nB. 16\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 2\n\nThe correct answer is C. 4.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in my reasoning here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
