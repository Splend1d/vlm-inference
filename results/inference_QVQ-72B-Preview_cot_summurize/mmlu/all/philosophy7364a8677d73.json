                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Singer's theory, and I need to figure out which objection he considers. The options are:\n\nA. It doesn't do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\n\nB. It inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\n\nC. It doesn't account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\n\nD. It requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Singer's theory is about. I know that Peter Singer is a philosopher who is famous for his work on ethics, particularly on issues like animal rights and global poverty. One of his famous arguments is about our moral obligations to help others, especially those in poverty.\n\nI think the theory being referred to here is likely his argument that we have a moral obligation to aid those in need, and that this obligation isn't limited by geographical boundaries or relationships. He argues that if we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it.\n\nGiven that, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\n\nWell, Singer is known for emphasizing that we have moral obligations to people suffering in other countries, not just in our own. In fact, he challenges the idea that geographical proximity should affect our moral obligations. So, if anything, his theory might be seen as giving too much weight to suffering in other countries, not too little. Maybe this isn't the right objection.\n\nB. Inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\n\nSinger actually argues against the idea that proximity should determine our moral obligations. He suggests that distance shouldn't matter; what matters is the severity of the need and our ability to help without sacrificing something of similar moral importance. So, this option seems to suggest that his theory incorrectly emphasizes proximity, but I think his theory does the opposite. He tries to minimize the relevance of proximity.\n\nC. Does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\n\nThis is interesting. Singer does recognize that we have special obligations to our family and friends. He doesn't think that all moral obligations are equal regardless of relationship. He acknowledges that we have closer duties to those nearest and dearest to us. So, perhaps this is a objection that he does consider and responds to in his work.\n\nD. Requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.\n\nSinger's views do challenge traditional moral intuitions. He suggests that we should be doing much more to help others, especially the global poor, and that our current practices are morally inadequate. Some might object that adopting his view would require too significant a change in how we live our lives and make moral decisions. This could be seen as a practical objection, questioning whether his theory is too demanding.\n\nNow, considering these options, I need to figure out which one Singer specifically considers in his theory.\n\nOption A seems off because his theory actually extends our moral obligations beyond our own country, so it's not that it doesn't do enough; it's that it does too much in that direction.\n\nOption B is also unlikely because his theory downplays the moral significance of proximity.\n\nOption C is interesting because Singer does discuss the idea of special obligations to loved ones. He might consider this as an objection to his view that we should help strangers in need just as much as we help our loved ones.\n\nOption D is also plausible because his theory does require significant changes in how we think about our moral obligations.\n\nBut between C and D, which one does he specifically consider?\n\nI think option C is more directly related to the content of his theory. He does address the idea that we have stronger obligations to our family and friends than to strangers, and he tries to balance that with the idea that we still have significant obligations to strangers in need.\n\nOption D is more about the practical implications and whether his theory is too demanding, which might not be as central to the theory itself.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the correct answer is C: it does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure. Let me think again.\n\nSinger does recognize that we have special obligations to our loved ones. In fact, he might argue that these special obligations are permissible or even required, but that doesn't\u514d\u9664 our obligations to others.\n\nSo, perhaps he does consider this objection and responds to it by allowing for special obligations to loved ones while still maintaining that we have significant duties to strangers.\n\nOn the other hand, option D suggests that his theory is too demanding, requiring significant changes in our moral schemes.\n\nThis is also a possible objection, as his theory does imply that we should be doing much more to help others, possibly to the point where our current lifestyles would need to change.\n\nHowever, I think option C is more directly related to the content of his theory, as it touches on the balance between obligations to loved ones and obligations to strangers, which is a central theme in his discussions on moral obligations.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is C. It does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
