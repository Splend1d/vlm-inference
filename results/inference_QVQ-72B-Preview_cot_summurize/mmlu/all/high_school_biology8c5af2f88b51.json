                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what happens to preRNA during RNA processing. I have this question here with four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what preRNA is. I think it's the initial transcript made by RNA polymerase II from a gene. It's like a rough draft that needs editing before it can be used as mRNA. So, during RNA processing, certain things happen to make it into mature mRNA.\n\nOne of the things I remember is that introns are removed and exons are spliced together. Introns are the non-coding parts, and exons are the coding parts. So, option C says exons are removed, but that doesn't sound right. Shouldn't exons be kept and introns removed? Yeah, I think there's a mistake there.\n\nOption A says introns are removed in the nucleus, and then a 5\u2032 cap and the poly-A tail are added after the preRNA leaves the nucleus. Hmm, I thought both capping and polyadenylation happen in the nucleus before the mRNA exits to the cytoplasm. So, maybe option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. This seems plausible. I recall that capping happens right after transcription starts, and polyadenylation happens towards the end of transcription. Splicing to remove introns also occurs in the nucleus. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D mentions point mutations are repaired, exons are removed, and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus. Wait, point mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. I don't think RNA processing involves repairing point mutations; that sounds more like DNA repair mechanisms. Also, again, it says exons are removed, which I think is incorrect because exons are supposed to be kept.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems the most accurate. Introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. In RNA processing, capping occurs at the 5\u2032 end soon after transcription starts. Then, splicing removes introns and splices exons together. Finally, polyadenylation adds a poly-A tail at the 3\u2032 end. All of these processes happen in the nucleus before the mature mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm for translation.\n\nSo, option B correctly describes this sequence: introns are removed and both a 5\u2032 cap and a poly-A tail are added before the preRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that capping and polyadenylation occur after the RNA leaves the nucleus, which is not the case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it says exons are removed, which is the opposite of what should happen.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it includes point mutation repair, which isn't part of RNA processing, and again, it incorrectly states that exons are removed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
