                    "text": "So I have this problem: (1 + i)^10. I need to find the value of this expression. The options are 1, i, 32, and 32i. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1. So, 1 + i is a complex number. To raise it to the 10th power, I could try to expand it using the binomial theorem, but that seems messy for such a high power. There must be a smarter way to do this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can express 1 + i in polar form and then apply De Moivre's theorem. That could simplify things a lot.\n\nLet me recall how to convert a complex number into polar form. A complex number a + bi can be written as r(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8), where r is the modulus and \u03b8 is the argument.\n\nSo, for 1 + i, the modulus r is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument \u03b8 is \u03c0/4, since the real and imaginary parts are both positive and equal.\n\nTherefore, 1 + i = sqrt(2)(cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nNow, according to De Moivre's theorem, (cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)^n = cos(n\u03b8) + i sin(n\u03b8).\n\nSo, (1 + i)^10 = [sqrt(2)(cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4))]^10 = sqrt(2)^10 * [cos(10*(\u03c0/4)) + i sin(10*(\u03c0/4))].\n\nSimplify sqrt(2)^10: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^10 = 2^(10/2) = 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, calculate the angle: 10*(\u03c0/4) = (10\u03c0)/4 = (5\u03c0)/2.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^10 = 32 * [cos((5\u03c0)/2) + i sin((5\u03c0)/2)].\n\nNow, what is cos((5\u03c0)/2) and sin((5\u03c0)/2)? Let's see.\n\n(5\u03c0)/2 is the same as \u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0, since 2\u03c0 is a full rotation.\n\ncos(\u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0) = cos(\u03c0/2) = 0\n\nsin(\u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0) = sin(\u03c0/2) = 1\n\nSo, cos((5\u03c0)/2) = 0 and sin((5\u03c0)/2) = 1.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^10 = 32*(0 + i*1) = 32i.\n\nWait, but 32i is one of the options. Is that the correct answer?\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, I converted 1 + i to polar form: sqrt(2)(cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)). That seems right.\n\nThen, applying De Moivre's theorem: (sqrt(2)(cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)))^10 = sqrt(2)^10 * [cos(10*(\u03c0/4)) + i sin(10*(\u03c0/4))].\n\nsqrt(2)^10 is indeed 2^5 = 32.\n\n10*(\u03c0/4) = 5\u03c0/2, which is equivalent to \u03c0/2 modulo 2\u03c0.\n\ncos(\u03c0/2) = 0 and sin(\u03c0/2) = 1, so the result is 32i.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, just to verify.\n\nLet's try to compute (1 + i)^2 first and see if there's a pattern.\n\n(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i.\n\nSo, (1 + i)^2 = 2i.\n\nNow, (1 + i)^4 = ((1 + i)^2)^2 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\nThen, (1 + i)^8 = ((1 + i)^4)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\nFinally, (1 + i)^10 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^2 = 16 * 2i = 32i.\n\nOkay, this matches what I got earlier using De Moivre's theorem.\n\nSo, the answer should be 32i.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. i\n\nC. 32\n\nD. 32i\n\nSo, D. 32i is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32i} \\]"
