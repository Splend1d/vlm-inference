It wants to know what percentage of Americans thought that sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. The options are 25%, 45%, 65%, or 85%. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Vietnam War was a pretty divisive issue in American history. It started in the 1950s and escalated in the 1960s, especially under President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1965, there was a significant increase in U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, with the deployment of combat troops.\n\nI remember learning that initially, there was some support for the war, especially with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, which gave the president authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by communist aggression. But as the war progressed, opposition grew.\n\nBut in 1965, was opposition already at a high level? I think that major protests started a bit later, like in the late 1960s, after the Tet Offensive in 1968. So maybe in 1965, opposition wasn't as widespread yet.\n\nLet me think about this. If I recall correctly, polls from that time showed that support for the war was higher in the early years. For example, after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, many Americans rallied behind the president. So, perhaps in 1965, fewer people thought it was a mistake to send troops.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- 25% seems pretty low. That would mean only one in four Americans thought it was a mistake. Maybe early on, but I'm not sure about 1965.\n\n- 45% seems more plausible. It's almost half, suggesting that there was significant but not majority opposition.\n\n- 65% would indicate a clear majority thought it was a mistake, which I think might be too high for 1965.\n\n- 85% is very high and seems unlikely for that early in the war.\n\nI think 45% is the most reasonable choice here. It suggests that there was a substantial minority who were against the war, but it wasn't yet the majority view. Opposition grew over time, especially as the war dragged on and casualties increased.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that by the late 1960s, after the Tet Offensive, opposition to the war had indeed grown significantly. So, in 1965, it makes sense that opposition wouldn't be as high as in later years.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to go with B. 45%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 45\\%} \\]"
