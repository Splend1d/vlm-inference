                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a builder, an alarm company, and a supplier. Let me try to wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst, the builder wants to have security systems installed in his homes and asks companies to bid on the job. The alarm company decides to bid and needs to get bids from wholesalers for the burglar alarms they plan to use. So, the alarm company gets a bid from a supplier, which they use to calculate their own bid to the builder.\n\nOn September 1, the alarm company sends their bid to the builder, proposing to install the security systems for $100,000. Then, on September 9, the supplier tells the alarm company that they can't supply any burglar alarms. That's a problem because now the alarm company needs to find another supplier.\n\nOn September 11, the builder sends a fax to the alarm company accepting their offer to install the security systems for $100,000. But by this time, the alarm company already knows that their original supplier can't provide the alarms. So, they have to find another wholesaler, and this new supplier charges them $10,000 more than what was originally quoted by the first supplier.\n\nBecause of this, the alarm company tells the builder that the total price for the job needs to be increased to $110,000. But the builder insists on paying only the initially agreed price of $100,000. Despite this, the alarm company goes ahead and installs the security systems, but the builder hasn't paid them yet.\n\nNow, in an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the question is, how much will the alarm company likely recover?\n\nOption A says $100,000, which was the contract price.\n\nOption B says $110,000 because of an unanticipated change in circumstances after the parties entered into the contract.\n\nOption C says only in quantum meruit because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.\n\nOption D says only in quantum meruit because by demanding $110,000, the alarm company repudiated their contract with the builder.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between the builder and the alarm company for $100,000 to install security systems. The alarm company based their bid on the supplier's quote, but after they submitted their bid, the supplier backed out.\n\nSo, the alarm company had to find another supplier who charged them $10,000 more. Then, when the builder accepted their offer, the alarm company tried to renegotiate the price to $110,000, but the builder refused and insisted on the original $100,000.\n\nNow, the alarm company has done the work, and they're suing the builder for the amount they\u8ba4\u4e3a they're owed.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nOption A: $100,000, the contract price.\n\nThis seems straightforward. The builder accepted the alarm company's offer at $100,000, and that's the price they agreed upon. In general, contracts are binding, and unless there's a clause allowing for price adjustments, the builder is obligated to pay the agreed-upon price.\n\nHowever, the alarm company incurred additional costs because their original supplier couldn't deliver, and they had to get a more expensive supplier. But that seems like a risk that the alarm company should have accounted for in their bid.\n\nOption B: $110,000 due to unanticipated changes after the contract was formed.\n\nThis suggests that there was some event that changed the circumstances beyond the control of the alarm company, making the original price unfair.\n\nIn contract law, there's a doctrine called \"impossibility of performance,\" where if an unforeseen event makes performance impossible, the contract may be discharged. However, in this case, it's not that performance is impossible; it's just more expensive.\n\nThere's also the doctrine of \"commercial impracticability,\" which is similar but refers to situations where performance is possible but unreasonably difficult or expensive due to an unforeseen event.\n\nBut generally, courts are reluctant to adjust contract prices based on increased costs unless there's a specific clause in the contract that allows for such adjustments.\n\nIn this scenario, there's no mention of such a clause, so it's unlikely that the alarm company can successfully argue for $110,000 based on changed circumstances.\n\nOption C: Only in quantum meruit due to commercial frustration.\n\nQuantum meruit is a principle where a party can recover the reasonable value of the services provided when there's no enforceable contract, or when the contract has been frustrated.\n\nCommercial frustration refers to a situation where an unforeseen event makes the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was anticipated.\n\nIn this case, the alarm company did perform the contract by installing the security systems, so it's not a case of impossibility.\n\nMoreover, while the supplier backing out was unexpected, it's not necessarily a case of commercial frustration that would allow the alarm company to recover based on quantum meruit.\n\nOption D: Only in quantum meruit because demanding $110,000 repudiated the original contract.\n\nRepudiation occurs when one party indicates they will not perform their contractual obligations.\n\nHere, the alarm company demanded $110,000 instead of the agreed $100,000, which could be seen as repudiating the contract.\n\nHowever, the alarm company still went ahead and performed the contract by installing the security systems.\n\nSo, if the alarm company repudiated the contract by demanding more money, but then performed the work anyway, it's unclear how that affects their right to payment.\n\nBut generally, if a party performs the contract despite demanding more money, they're still entitled to the contract price.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the most likely answer is Option A: $100,000, because that was the contract price.\n\nThe alarm company took the risk when they based their bid on the supplier's quote, and when that supplier backed out, it's their problem to find another supplier at a potentially higher price.\n\nUnless there's a clause in the contract that allows for price adjustments due to increased costs, the builder is only obligated to pay the agreed-upon price of $100,000.\n\nTherefore, in an action against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover $100,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
