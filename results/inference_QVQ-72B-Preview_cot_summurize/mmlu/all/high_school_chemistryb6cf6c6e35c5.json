                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's an unknown substance with a high melting point, it's a poor conductor of electricity, and it doesn't dissolve in water. I need to figure out what kind of bonding it most likely has from these options: ionic bonding, nonpolar covalent bonding, covalent network bonding, or metallic bonding.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling what each type of bonding is and what properties they typically give to substances.\n\nFirst up, ionic bonding. That's when positive and negative ions attract each other, like in table salt, sodium chloride. Ionic bonds are usually strong, which gives these substances high melting and boiling points. But they're also good conductors of electricity when melted or dissolved in water because the ions can move around and carry charge. However, in their solid state, they don't conduct electricity because the ions are fixed in place. Also, they tend to be soluble in water because water is polar and can break up the ionic bonds.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says this substance is a poor conductor of electricity and doesn't dissolve in water. That seems to contradict what I know about ionic bonds. So maybe ionic bonding isn't the best fit here. Maybe it's not A.\n\nOkay, option B: nonpolar covalent bonding. This is when atoms share electrons equally, like in oxygen gas (O\u2082). Nonpolar covalent bonds generally result in molecules that have low melting and boiling points because the intermolecular forces are weak. They're also poor conductors of electricity because there are no free-moving charges. And they usually don't dissolve in water because water is polar and nonpolar substances don't mix well with polar solvents.\n\nBut the substance in question has a high melting point, which doesn't align with nonpolar covalent bonding. So maybe B isn't the right choice either.\n\nNext, C: covalent network bonding. This is like in diamonds or silicon dioxide (quartz). In these substances, atoms are connected by covalent bonds that extend throughout the entire crystal. These networks are extremely strong, which leads to very high melting points. They're also poor conductors of electricity because the electrons are tightly bound in the bonds and can't move freely. Additionally, they're typically insoluble in water because the strong bonds within the network aren't easily broken by water molecules.\n\nHmm, this seems to match the description of the unknown substance pretty well. High melting point, poor conductor, and doesn't dissolve in water.\n\nLastly, D: metallic bonding. This is when metal atoms are held together by a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons. Metallic bonds give metals their characteristic properties: high melting points, good conductivity of electricity and heat, and malleability. They're also usually ductile and have a shiny appearance. But when it comes to solubility, metals generally don't dissolve in water unless they react chemically with it, which some do, but generally, metals aren't water-soluble.\n\nWait, but in terms of conductivity, metals are excellent conductors of electricity, both in their solid state and when melted. That contradicts the problem's statement that the substance is a poor conductor of electricity. So, metallic bonding probably isn't the answer.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Ionic bonding: high melting point, good conductor when melted or dissolved, soluble in water.\n\n- Nonpolar covalent bonding: low melting point, poor conductor, insoluble in water.\n\n- Covalent network bonding: very high melting point, poor conductor, insoluble in water.\n\n- Metallic bonding: high melting point, excellent conductor, generally insoluble in water.\n\nGiven that the substance has a high melting point, is a poor conductor of electricity, and doesn't dissolve in water, the most fitting type of bonding is covalent network bonding.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider some examples.\n\n- Ionic bonding: NaCl - melts at about 801\u00b0C, conducts electricity when dissolved, soluble in water.\n\n- Nonpolar covalent bonding: O\u2082 - melts at -218.4\u00b0C, poor conductor, doesn't dissolve in water.\n\n- Covalent network bonding: diamond - melts at about 3550\u00b0C, poor conductor (unless doped), insoluble in water.\n\n- Metallic bonding: copper - melts at 1084\u00b0C, excellent conductor, doesn't dissolve in water (unless exposed to strong acids).\n\nYes, the diamond example fits perfectly with the properties described in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the substance most likely contains covalent network bonding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
