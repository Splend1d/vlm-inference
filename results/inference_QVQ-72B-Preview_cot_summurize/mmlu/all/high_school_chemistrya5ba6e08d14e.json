                    "text": "So I have this question about reduction half-reactions, and I need to pick which of the given options are correct. Let's start by understanding what a reduction half-reaction is. Reduction is when an atom gains electrons, which leads to a decrease in its oxidation state. So, in a reduction half-reaction, we should see an ion or atom becoming more negative in charge because it's gaining electrons.\n\nLooking at the first reaction: Cu\u00b2\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Cu\u207a. Here, copper(II) ion (Cu\u00b2\u207a) is gaining one electron to become copper(I) ion (Cu\u207a). The oxidation state of copper decreases from +2 to +1, which indicates reduction. So, this is a reduction half-reaction.\n\nThe second reaction is Cu\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Cu\u2070. Copper(I) ion (Cu\u207a) is gaining another electron to become metallic copper (Cu\u2070). Again, the oxidation state decreases from +1 to 0, which is also a reduction process.\n\nNow, the third reaction is Fe\u00b2\u207a \u2192 Fe\u00b3\u207a + e\u207b. Here, iron(II) ion (Fe\u00b2\u207a) is losing one electron to become iron(III) ion (Fe\u00b3\u207a). The oxidation state increases from +2 to +3, which is oxidation, not reduction.\n\nSo, based on this, options A, B, and D seem to have some misconceptions.\n\nOption A says that only 1 is correct because copper(II) ions are reduced. But actually, both 1 and 2 are reduction half-reactions involving copper.\n\nOption B says that 3 is correct because iron is reduced, but actually, 3 is an oxidation reaction.\n\nOption D mentions something about insoluble ions, which isn't relevant here since we're dealing with redox reactions, not solubility.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C: 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. In reaction 1, Cu\u00b2\u207a is reduced to Cu\u207a, and in reaction 2, Cu\u207a is further reduced to Cu\u2070. So, both are reduction half-reactions. Reaction 3 is indeed oxidation, as Fe\u00b2\u207a is oxidized to Fe\u00b3\u207a.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions.\n\nBut the question says \"because they both reduce copper ions.\" Is that entirely accurate? Well, yes, both involve the reduction of copper ions, but more precisely, they involve the reduction of copper ions to lower oxidation states.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only mentions 1, but 2 is also a reduction reaction.\n\nOption B is incorrect because 3 is an oxidation reaction, not a reduction reaction.\n\nOption D brings in irrelevant information about insoluble ions, which isn't applicable here.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation.\n\nIn reaction 1, Cu\u00b2\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Cu\u207a, this is clearly reduction.\n\nReaction 2, Cu\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Cu\u2070, also reduction.\n\nReaction 3, Fe\u00b2\u207a \u2192 Fe\u00b3\u207a + e\u207b, oxidation.\n\nHence, only reactions 1 and 2 are reduction half-reactions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
