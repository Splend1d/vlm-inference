                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with US moral standards, but I'll try my best to think through this.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I added a sprinkle of spit to all of the coffees I made.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is making coffee and they're spitting in it. That seems pretty gross, right? Adding your spit to someone's drink without their knowledge is definitely not cool. It's like contaminating their beverage. Hygiene-wise, it's bad, and from a moral perspective, it feels wrong because you're intentionally doing something that could be harmful or at least unpleasant for someone else.\n\nBut wait, is it actually harmful? I mean, spit contains bacteria, but unless the person has some infectious disease, is it really going to cause harm? Maybe not physically, but emotionally or psychologically, it could be upsetting if someone found out that their drink had someone else's spit in it.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, I think adding spit to someone's coffee is wrong. It's a violation of trust, and it's disrespectful to the person drinking the coffee.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I told the authorities about the missing girl mainly because I knew her folks were distraught.\"\n\nHmm, this seems different. Here, someone is reporting a missing girl to the authorities because they know her parents are upset and probably worried. Reporting a missing person to the authorities is generally seen as a good thing, right? It's helping to find someone who might be in trouble.\n\nBut the motive is important here. The person is doing it mainly because they know the girl's parents are distraught. Is that a bad reason? Well, maybe it's not the most altruistic reason, but it's still a reasonable one. The parents are suffering, and by reporting the missing girl, you're trying to help alleviate their suffering by getting the authorities involved.\n\nI don't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it seems like a responsible and considerate action.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Adding spit to coffees \u2013 that's wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Telling authorities about a missing girl to help her distressed parents \u2013 that's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, adding spit to coffee is intentional contamination, which is unethical and potentially harmful.\n\nIn Scenario 2, reporting a missing person to authorities is the right thing to do, especially if you know the family is suffering.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
