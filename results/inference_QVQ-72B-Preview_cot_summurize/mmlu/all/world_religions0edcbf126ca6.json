It's asking when it began, and there are four options: A. 515 BCE, B. 535 BCE, C. 586 BCE, or D. 70 CE. Hmm, I need to recall the details of this historical event.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Babylonian captivity refers to the period when many Jews from the Kingdom of Judah were taken into exile in Babylon. This happened after the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the First Temple. But let me make sure I have the timeline straight.\n\nI think the Babylonians first invaded Judah in the early 6th century BCE. There might have been multiple deportations of Jews to Babylon. The first one might have been in 597 BCE, when King Jehoiachin was taken captive along with thousands of others after Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem.\n\nThen, there was another major event in 586 BCE, when the Babylonians finally destroyed Jerusalem and the First Temple. This is when the exile really took hold, as large numbers of Jews were taken to Babylon as captives.\n\nLooking back at the options, 586 BCE seems to be one of them. But I should double-check if that's the exact year the exile began.\n\nOption A is 515 BCE, which I believe is when the Second Temple was rebuilt in Jerusalem after the Persians allowed the Jews to return. So that's after the exile, not when it began.\n\nOption B is 535 BCE. I think that's around the time when Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylon and issued the decree allowing exiled Jews to return to Judah and rebuild the Temple. So again, that's after the exile had already started.\n\nOption D is 70 CE, which is much later. That's when the Roman Empire destroyed the Second Temple and dispersed the Jewish people during the Jewish-Roman wars. That's a different event altogether.\n\nSo, based on this, the Babylonian captivity began before 535 BCE and 515 BCE, and definitely not in 70 CE. Between the options given, 586 BCE seems the most plausible date for the beginning of the exile.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there was any earlier exile. I recall that there was a deportation in 597 BCE under King Jehoiachin, but that was more of the beginning of the conflicts leading up to the exile. The massive destruction and exile happened in 586 BCE.\n\nLet me also consider the context of the First Temple. It was built by King Solomon and stood for about 400 years before being destroyed by the Babylonians. So, if it was built around 950 BCE and destroyed in 586 BCE, that fits the timeline.\n\nAdditionally, the Babylonian Empire was at its height around the 6th century BCE, which aligns with the time of the exile.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the Babylonian captivity or Exile began in 586 BCE when the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the First Temple and took many Jews into exile in Babylon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
