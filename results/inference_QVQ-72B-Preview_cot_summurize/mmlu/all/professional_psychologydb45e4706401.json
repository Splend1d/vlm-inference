Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nI remember from parenting classes and reading books about child development that babies typically start saying their first words around a certain age. Let me think back... I think it's somewhere between 10 to 18 months, but I might be a bit off.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. 7 months: That seems a bit young. At 7 months, babies are usually babbling and making cooing sounds, but not forming actual words. I don't think they say their first words that early.\n\nB. 9 months: This might be possible. By 9 months, babies are more aware of their surroundings and are starting to understand simple commands. Some might be saying their first words around this time, but I think it's a bit early for most babies.\n\nC. 12 months: This rings a bell. I think around 12 months, many babies start saying their first words. \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" are common first words that babies say at this age. Yeah, this seems plausible.\n\nD. 15 months: This is a bit older, but still within the range. Some babies might start talking a bit later, so this could also be possible for some.\n\nBut if I had to choose the most common age for babies to say their first words, I would go with 12 months. I recall that around this time, babies typically start using single words to communicate their needs and desires.\n\nLet me double-check this information. I think in many developmental milestones, the average age for saying the first word is around 12 to 14 months. So, option C. 12 months, seems to be the most accurate choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that babies can vary a lot in when they start talking. Some might say their first word as early as 7 months, while others might not start until 18 months or even later. But the question is asking for the age when most babies say their first words, so I should consider the majority.\n\nIn that case, I still think 12 months is the best answer. It's the age when the majority of babies begin to use their first words.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any specific reason why another age might be more accurate. For example, maybe in some cultures or with certain stimulations, babies might start talking earlier. However, the question is general and doesn't specify any particular context, so I should stick with general developmental norms.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. Most babies say their first words at about 12 months of age. So, the correct answer should be C. 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
