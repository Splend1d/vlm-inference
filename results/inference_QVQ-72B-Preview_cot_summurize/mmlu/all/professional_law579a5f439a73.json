                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about exceptions to the general rule that all contractual rights may be assigned. The question is asking which of the options isn't an exception to this rule. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, I know that in contract law, assignment is when one party transfers their rights under a contract to another party. Generally, you can assign your rights, but there are some situations where you can't. So, the question is essentially asking which of these options doesn't represent a situation where assignment is restricted or not allowed.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk.\" Hmm, I need to understand what this means. The obligor is the party who has the duty to perform under the contract. So, if an assignment continues the obligor's duty or risk, that probably means that the assignment doesn't change the obligor's responsibilities or the risks they face under the contract.\n\nWait a minute, is this a good thing or a bad thing? If the assignment doesn't change the obligor's duty or risk, that might actually be a situation where assignment is allowed because it doesn't affect the obligor adversely. But the question is asking for exceptions where assignment is not allowed. So, maybe this isn't an exception; maybe it's a situation where assignment is permitted.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the wording is a bit tricky. Perhaps \"continues\" means that the obligor's duty or risk remains the same, which would make assignment acceptable. Alternatively, maybe it means that the assignment itself continues the obligor's duty or risk in some way that's problematic.\n\nI need to be careful here. Maybe I should consider the general principles. Generally, assignments are allowed unless they change the obligor's duty or risk in a substantial way. So, if an assignment doesn't change the obligor's duty or risk, it should be allowed. Therefore, option A might not be an exception because it's describing a situation where the obligor's position isn't altered by the assignment.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"An assignment not allowed by law.\" This seems straightforward. If the law prohibits the assignment of certain rights, then that's clearly an exception where assignment isn't allowed. For example, some statutes might restrict the assignment of certain types of contracts, like those involving personal services or those related to public policy.\n\nSo, in this case, if the assignment is not allowed by law, it's definitely an exception where assignment is restricted. Therefore, option B is likely one of the exceptions.\n\nOption C: \"An assignment of future rights from future contracts.\" This is interesting. I recall that generally, you can't assign rights from contracts that haven't been formed yet. Future rights that are purely speculative or haven't yet come into existence might not be assignable.\n\nFor instance, if someone has a contract to perform in the future that might generate certain rights, assigning those rights before the contract is even in place could be problematic. So, assignments of future rights from future contracts are probably not allowed, making this an exception.\n\nLastly, option D: \"An assignment that substantially changes obligor's duty or risk.\" This seems directly related to the general rule. I think I remember that assignments that materially increase the risk or alter the duties of the obligor are not allowed without the obligor's consent.\n\nSo, if an assignment changes the obligor's duty or risk in a significant way, it's an exception where assignment is restricted unless the obligor agrees to it.\n\nGiven all that, it seems like option A is describing a situation where the assignment doesn't change the obligor's duty or risk, which would mean that it's not an exception; rather, it's a situation where assignment is generally allowed.\n\nTo confirm, let me rephrase option A: \"An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk.\" If the assignment continues, or maintains, the obligor's duty or risk without changing them substantially, then it should be permissible under the general rule of assignability.\n\nTherefore, option A is not an exception to the general rule that all contractual rights may be assigned. Instead, it's a scenario where assignment is allowed because it doesn't impose any additional burden or change the obligor's position in a significant way.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
