                    "text": "So I have this question here about which ethical theory would approach the morality of abortion by considering how much overall intrinsic value is likely to be brought about by abortion. The options are virtue ethics, consequentialist theory, Kantian ethics, and natural law theory. I need to figure out which one of these would focus on the overall intrinsic value that abortion might bring about.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"intrinsic value\" means in this context. Intrinsic value is something that's valuable in itself, not just because it leads to something else that's valuable. So, if abortion brings about certain outcomes that are valuable on their own, without considering any further consequences, that's what we're looking at here.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A: virtue ethics. Virtue ethics is all about character and virtues. It focuses on the moral character of the person performing the action rather than the consequences of the action itself. So, it would look at whether having an abortion aligns with certain virtues or character traits that are considered good. For example, is it compassionate or selfish? But it doesn't directly consider the overall intrinsic value brought about by the abortion. It's more about the moral agent's character development. So, maybe not the best fit for this description.\n\nOption B: consequentialist theory. This one sounds promising. Consequentialism is an ethical theory that judges the morality of an action based on its consequences. The most common form is utilitarianism, which aims for the greatest good for the greatest number. So, in this case, considering how much overall intrinsic value is brought about by abortion fits nicely with consequentialism. It would look at the total happiness, well-being, or whatever intrinsic goods result from the abortion, balancing them against any negative consequences.\n\nWait, but the question specifies \"intrinsic value.\" In philosophy, intrinsic value is often associated with things that are good in themselves, not just because they lead to something else. So, consequentialism, especially utilitarianism, does focus on maximizing intrinsic goods like happiness or pleasure.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's a difference between \"overall intrinsic value\" and what consequentialists consider. Is there any chance that consequentialists might look at extrinsic values as well? Well, consequentialists do consider the intrinsic value of outcomes, so I think this aligns well with the description.\n\nMoving on to C: Kantian ethics. Kantian ethics is deontological, meaning it focuses on duties and rules rather than consequences. Kant believed in the categorical imperative, which essentially says that one should act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. In other words, it's about following moral laws that apply to everyone, regardless of the outcomes. So, when it comes to abortion, Kantian ethics would likely focus on whether abortion aligns with moral duties and universal laws, not on the overall intrinsic value it might bring about. Therefore, this doesn't seem to fit the description.\n\nOption D: natural law theory. Natural law theory is another deontological approach that bases moral principles on human nature and reason. It holds that there are certain actions that are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. Abortion, according to natural law theory, would likely be considered inherently wrong because it goes against the natural purpose of human life and reproduction. So, again, this approach is more concerned with the inherent morality of the act itself rather than the overall intrinsic value it might bring about.\n\nAfter considering all these options, it seems that consequentialist theory, particularly utilitarianism, is the one that would approach the morality of abortion by considering how much overall intrinsic value is likely to be brought about by it. It focuses on the consequences and the total amount of good or bad that results from the action, which aligns perfectly with the idea of overall intrinsic value.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Virtue ethics focuses on character, Kantian ethics on duties and rules, and natural law theory on inherent rightness or wrongness based on human nature. None of these primarily consider the overall intrinsic value of the consequences of an action. Consequentialism, on the other hand, is specifically about evaluating actions based on their consequences, aiming to maximize good outcomes.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is B: consequentialist theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
