                    "text": "Alright, so I have this question here: \"What are the names of the two primary M&M's spokes-candies?\" And the options are A. Peanut and Plain, B. Red and Yellow, C. Mort and Marty, D. They don't have names. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm pretty sure M&M's are those little chocolate candies with the colorful coatings, right? I think they're really popular, especially around Halloween.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall if M&M's have specific spokes-candies with names. I remember seeing M&M's commercials where the candies themselves are anthropomorphized and have personalities. But what are their names?\n\nLet me think about this. In the commercials, the different colors seem to have distinct personalities. For instance, the red one is often portrayed as confident or maybe a bit arrogant, and the yellow one seems laid-back or casual. Could their names just be Red and Yellow? That seems too straightforward, but maybe that's it.\n\nWait a minute, option B is Red and Yellow. That seems plausible. But let's consider the other options. Option A is Peanut and Plain. I know that M&M's come in different flavors and varieties, like peanut M&M's and plain M&M's. Maybe the spokes-candies represent these different types? But that doesn't seem to align with what I recall from the commercials.\n\nOption C is Mort and Marty. Hmm, that sounds like it might be a reference to something else, maybe from a different context or perhaps a parody. I don't think that's correct for M&M's.\n\nOption D is They don't have names. Well, that could be possible, but I feel like in the commercials, they do refer to each other by color at least. So maybe they don't have official names beyond their color designations.\n\nLet me think about this some more. I recall that M&M's has been around for a long time; they were first introduced in the 1940s, I think. And they've had various marketing campaigns over the years. The idea behind M&M's is that they melt in your mouth, not in your hand, which is a famous slogan.\n\nIn terms of the spokes-candies, I think the red and yellow ones are the most commonly featured in advertisements. They often appear together, bantering or getting into amusing situations. Sometimes other colors join in, like blue or green, but red and yellow seem to be the main characters.\n\nWait, what about the green M&M? She's been in commercials too, and I think she has a bit of a sassy personality. But the question specifies the two primary spokes-candies, so maybe red and yellow are the originals or the most prominent ones.\n\nI should also consider if M&M's has ever given their spokes-candies official names beyond their colors. A quick search might help, but since I'm relying on my memory, I'll have to recall if I've ever heard them referred to by names other than their colors.\n\nHmm, I don't think they have specific names like Mort and Marty. That seems unlikely. So option C is probably incorrect.\n\nBetween options B and D, I'm leaning towards B. Red and Yellow. Even if their names are just their colors, that seems to be how they're referred to in the commercials and marketing materials.\n\nLet me try to think of an example. If I were to say, \"I saw the red M&M in a commercial,\" everyone would know who I'm talking about. Similarly, the yellow M&M has a distinct personality.\n\nI don't think the answer is D, They don't have names, because they do have names based on their colors. So, in that case, Red and Yellow would be their names.\n\nMaybe I should consider if these spokes-candies have ever been given more formal names, like first names or something. But I don't recall that being the case. They seem to be primarily referred to by their colors.\n\nAdditionally, I think the peanut M&M's have their own commercials sometimes, but I don't think they're considered the primary spokes-candies. The original plain M&M's seem to be represented by the red and yellow characters.\n\nWait, perhaps the peanut M&M's have their own spokesperson or something, but I don't think they're part of the main group.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I believe the two primary M&M's spokes-candies are Red and Yellow. Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check my thoughts. If I'm wrong, it might be because the spokes-candies have different names that I'm not recalling, but I don't think that's the case. Option C, Mort and Marty, doesn't ring a bell, and option D seems incorrect because they do have names based on their colors.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with my choice. The answer is B. Red and Yellow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
