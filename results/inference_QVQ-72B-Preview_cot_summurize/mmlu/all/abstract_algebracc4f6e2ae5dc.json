And cycles are a specific type of permutation where you arrange elements in a circular way, like a loop.\n\nStatement 1 says, \"Every permutation is a cycle.\" Hmm, that seems a bit strong. I think not every permutation is a cycle. For example, if I have a set with three elements, say {1, 2, 3}, there are six permutations: (1,2,3), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), and (3,1,2). But only some of these are cycles. Like (1,2,3) is a cycle, but (1,2,3) is the identity permutation, which is also a cycle of length 1, I think. Wait, actually, the identity permutation is sometimes considered a cycle of length 1, but in general, not all permutations are cycles. There are permutations that are products of disjoint cycles, but not single cycles. So, probably, statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2 says, \"Every cycle is a permutation.\" Well, cycles are a type of permutation, so yes, every cycle is a permutation. But to be precise, cycles are permutations where the elements are arranged in a single loop, without breaking into smaller loops. So, in that sense, every cycle is indeed a permutation, but not every permutation is a cycle because some permutations are products of more than one cycle.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about the definitions more carefully. In group theory, a cycle is a permutation where a set of elements is cyclically permuted, and all other elements are fixed. So, for a set with n elements, a k-cycle is a permutation that moves k elements in a cycle and fixes the remaining n-k elements. So, every cycle is a permutation of the set, yes. But permutations can be more general, consisting of one or more disjoint cycles.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Not every permutation is a cycle because some permutations are products of multiple cycles.\n\n- Every cycle is a permutation, as it rearranges the elements of the set in a specific cyclic manner.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false, and statement 2 is true.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct one: false for statement 1 and true for statement 2.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
