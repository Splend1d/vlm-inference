                    "text": "So I've got this question about corporate law, specifically about the removal of directors before their term expires. The question is: in the absence of any special provisions in the articles of incorporation, how can directors of a corporation, who are elected for a specified term, be removed from office?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. They can be removed at a shareholders' meeting, but only for cause and after giving the directors a chance to be heard.\n\nB. They can be removed at a shareholders' meeting, with or without cause.\n\nC. They can be removed at a shareholders' meeting, but only for cause.\n\nD. They can only be removed by a court decree in an action brought by the shareholders.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to recall some basic principles of corporate governance.\n\nFirst off, directors are elected by shareholders to manage the corporation. Their terms can be for a set period, like one, two, or three years, depending on the company's bylaws. But can shareholders remove them before their term ends?\n\nI remember that in many jurisdictions, including the United States, directors elected for a specified term can generally be removed by the shareholders before the end of their term, but usually only for cause. \"For cause\" typically means there has to be a good reason, like misconduct or breach of duty.\n\nBut option A says they can be removed for cause after giving the directors a chance to be heard. That sounds fair, because the directors should have an opportunity to defend themselves if there are allegations against them.\n\nOption B says they can be removed with or without cause. That seems more permissive. In some states, like Delaware, I think directors can be removed without cause, but I'm not sure if that's the general rule.\n\nOption C is similar to A but without mentioning the opportunity to be heard. So, it says they can only be removed for cause, but doesn't specify if the directors get a chance to respond to the allegations.\n\nOption D is quite different. It says directors can only be removed by a court decree in a lawsuit brought by the shareholders. That seems pretty stringent and not the typical approach. Usually, shareholders can remove directors directly through a vote, not necessarily through the courts.\n\nWait a minute, maybe in some cases, like if there's a dispute over the removal, it could go to court, but I don't think that's the standard procedure.\n\nLet me think about this again. In most corporations, unless the articles of incorporation say otherwise, directors elected for a specified term can be removed by the shareholders before the end of their term, but only for cause.\n\nSo, that would point towards option C: they can be removed from office at a meeting of the shareholders, but only for cause.\n\nBut option A adds that they must be given an opportunity to be heard, which seems important from a due process perspective. Maybe in some jurisdictions, that's required.\n\nOption B allows removal with or without cause, which seems too broad. I don't think that's the general rule.\n\nOption D seems out of place because it involves the court, which isn't the primary mechanism for removing directors.\n\nSo, between options A and C, which one is more accurate?\n\nI think option A is more comprehensive because it includes the due process element of giving directors a chance to be heard before being removed for cause. That seems like a important protection.\n\nWait, but is that universally required? Maybe not. Perhaps some jurisdictions don't explicitly require a hearing before removal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opportunity to be heard is implied in the process of removing a director for cause.\n\nLet me consider this differently. If a director is being removed for cause, it's only fair that they have a chance to defend themselves against the allegations. So, even if it's not explicitly required by law, it's a good practice.\n\nBut the question is about what's permitted in the absence of contrary provisions in the articles of incorporation.\n\nI think the key point is that directors can be removed for cause by the shareholders, and generally, they should have an opportunity to be heard as part of that process.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nBut to be sure, let me check a quick reference. Oh, wait, I don't have any references right now. I have to rely on my memory.\n\nBased on what I recall, in most corporate laws, directors elected for a specified term can be removed before the end of their term by the shareholders, but only for cause, and they should be given a chance to be heard.\n\nSo, I'll go with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
