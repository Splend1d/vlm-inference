                    "text": "So I have this question about circuits. It says that as more lamps are connected in parallel in a circuit, the current in the power source... and then there are options: increases, decreases, remains the same, or not enough information to say.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's going on here. I need to think about how adding more lamps in parallel affects the total current drawn from the power source.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic circuit principles. In a parallel circuit, multiple components are connected in such a way that the voltage across each component is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component.\n\nSo, if I have a power source with a certain voltage, and I connect one lamp, the current through that lamp is given by Ohm's law: I = V/R, where V is the voltage and R is the resistance of the lamp.\n\nNow, if I add another lamp in parallel, there are two paths for the current to flow through. Each lamp has its own resistance, and since they're in parallel, the voltage across each is the same as the power source.\n\nThe total current from the power source would be the sum of the currents through each lamp. So, if I have two lamps, each with resistance R, the total current would be I_total = I1 + I2 = (V/R) + (V/R) = 2V/R.\n\nSimilarly, if I add a third lamp, it would be I_total = 3V/R, and so on.\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, lamps have their own resistance, and assuming they're identical, it's easier to calculate.\n\nBut in general, for multiple lamps in parallel, each drawing current based on its own resistance, the total current is the sum of all individual currents.\n\nSo, if I have n lamps, each with resistance R, the total current is n*(V/R).\n\nTherefore, as more lamps are added in parallel, the total current increases.\n\nBut let me think about if there are any factors that could change this scenario.\n\nFor example, if the power source has internal resistance, does that affect the total current?\n\nWell, yes, if the power source has internal resistance, it would affect the terminal voltage when drawing more current, but assuming it's an ideal power source, the voltage remains constant regardless of the load.\n\nIn that case, with an ideal power source, the current would indeed increase linearly with the number of lamps.\n\nBut in reality, power sources do have internal resistance, which might cause the voltage to drop as more current is drawn.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this question, I think we're assuming an ideal power source with constant voltage.\n\nTherefore, as more lamps are added in parallel, the total current increases.\n\nWait, but one of the options is \"not enough information to say.\" Maybe there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the type of lamps. If they're incandescent lamps, their resistance can change with temperature, as they get hotter, their resistance increases.\n\nBut even then, in a parallel circuit, each lamp draws its own current based on its resistance, and the total current is the sum of all these.\n\nSo, unless there's some interaction between the lamps that affects their resistance, which I don't think is the case here, the total current should still increase.\n\nAnother thought: if the lamps are not identical, meaning they have different resistances, then the total current would still be the sum of the individual currents through each lamp.\n\nSo, even with varying resistances, the total current would still increase as more lamps are added.\n\nTherefore, in all these scenarios, the total current from the power source increases as more lamps are connected in parallel.\n\nI don't think the answer is \"decreases\" or \"remains the same,\" unless there's some negative feedback mechanism that reduces the current, which isn't typical in such circuits.\n\nAlso, \"not enough information to say\" seems unlikely, as the question provides the necessary information about the configuration being parallel.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the answer should be \"increases.\"\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the formula for equivalent resistance in parallel.\n\nThe equivalent resistance of multiple resistors in parallel is given by 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn.\n\nSo, as more resistors (lamps) are added in parallel, the equivalent resistance decreases.\n\nSince the voltage is constant, and I = V/R, a decrease in R_total would lead to an increase in total current.\n\nThis reinforces the earlier conclusion that the current increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ increases}} \\]"
