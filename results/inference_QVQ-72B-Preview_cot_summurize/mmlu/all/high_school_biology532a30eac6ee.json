                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species are known as...\" and the options are A. auxins, B. hormones, C. pheromones, D. enzymes. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these fits the description.\n\nFirst off, the question is about chemical substances released by organisms that affect others of the same species. So, it's about communication or interaction within the same species through chemicals.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A is auxins. I remember that auxins are plant hormones. They regulate growth in plants, like promoting cell elongation and root development. But the question is about substances released by organisms in general, not specifically plants. Maybe auxins are more specific to plants, so maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption B is hormones. Hormones are indeed chemical messengers released by glands in the body and travel through the bloodstream to target cells where they elicit responses. But, hormones are typically involved in regulating physiological processes within an individual organism, not necessarily affecting other members of the same species directly through external release. So, maybe not the right answer.\n\nOption C is pheromones. Now, pheromones are interesting. They are chemicals released by one organism that can influence the behavior or physiology of another organism of the same species. For example, many insects release pheromones to attract mates, warn of predators, or mark trails. Animals, including humans, also produce pheromones that can influence social behaviors. This seems to fit the description in the question pretty well.\n\nOption D is enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are crucial for metabolic processes but aren't typically released externally to affect other individuals of the same species. So, this doesn't seem to fit the bill.\n\nLet me double-check. The question says \"chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species.\" Pheromones seem to be the most appropriate choice here because they are specifically involved in communication between individuals of the same species through chemical signals.\n\nHormones, while important, are more about internal regulation within an individual, not external communication with others of the same species. Auxins are similar, focusing on plant growth regulation. Enzymes are involved in metabolic processes and not generally released to affect other individuals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. pheromones.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that pheromones are indeed released externally and affect others of the same species across different individuals. Yes, that's correct. For example, in many species, pheromones are used for sexual attraction, alarm signals, or marking territories. So, they perfectly fit the description provided in the question.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that another option could also fit. Could hormones ever be released externally and affect other individuals?\n\nWell, sometimes, hormones can be excreted in waste products, but their primary function is internal regulation, not external communication. So, even if they are released externally, it's not their intended purpose, and they wouldn't reliably elicit a physiological or behavioral response in others in the same way pheromones do.\n\nAuxins in plants are involved in growth and development, and while plants can release certain substances that affect other plants, auxins themselves are not generally released externally to communicate with other plants.\n\nEnzymes are clearly involved in metabolic processes within the organism and aren't used for communication between individuals.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. pheromones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. pheromones}} \\]"
