                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which number is a multiple of 7?\" And the options are A. 27, B. 48, C. 56, D. 74. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these numbers can be divided by 7 without any remainder. That means, which one is in the times table of 7, right?\n\nFirst, I should recall what multiples of 7 are. Starting from 7 times 1, which is 7, then 7 times 2 is 14, 21, 28, and so on. But I don't remember up to where I should go for this question. Maybe I should check each option one by one.\n\nOption A is 27. Let me see, 7 times 3 is 21, and 7 times 4 is 28. So, 27 is between 21 and 28, but it's not exactly a multiple of 7. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B is 48. Hmm, 7 times 6 is 42, and 7 times 7 is 49. So, 48 is between 42 and 49, but it's not exactly a multiple. So, probably not B.\n\nOption C is 56. Wait, 7 times 7 is 49, and 7 times 8 is 56. Oh, so 56 is exactly 7 times 8. That seems like a match. So, 56 is a multiple of 7.\n\nOption D is 74. Let me check, 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 11 is 77. So, 74 is between 70 and 77, but it's not exactly a multiple. So, probably not D.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like C. 56 is the correct answer because it's exactly 7 times 8, which is 56.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check to be sure. Let me see, 7 times 8 is indeed 56. And none of the other options seem to be exact multiples of 7. So, I think C is the right answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe there's another way to check if a number is a multiple of 7. I've heard of a rule where you take the last digit, double it, and subtract it from the rest of the number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is too.\n\nLet's try that with 56. Take 6, double it to 12, and subtract from 5, which is negative 7. Negative 7 is divisible by 7, so 56 is indeed a multiple of 7.\n\nLet's try with 27. Double 7 is 14, subtract from 2, which is negative 12. Is negative 12 divisible by 7? Well, 7 times negative 2 is negative 14, which is more than negative 12, so no, it's not divisible by 7. So, confirms that 27 is not a multiple of 7.\n\nSimilarly, 48: double 8 is 16, subtract from 4, which is negative 12 again. Not divisible by 7, so not a multiple of 7.\n\nAnd 74: double 4 is 8, subtract from 7, which is negative 1. Not divisible by 7, so not a multiple of 7.\n\nAgain, this confirms that only 56 is a multiple of 7 among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, I could use long division to divide each number by 7 and see if there's a remainder. For example, 27 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 6, so not a multiple. 48 divided by 7 is 6 with a remainder of 6. 56 divided by 7 is 8 with no remainder. 74 divided by 7 is 10 with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, again, this method shows that 56 is the only number among the options that is a multiple of 7.\n\nI think I've used three different ways to confirm that 56 is the correct answer. First, by recalling the multiples of 7 and matching it to 7 times 8. Second, by using the divisibility rule for 7. And third, by performing actual division. All these methods point to 56 being the multiple of 7.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C. 56.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
