                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about partnerships and who can bind the partnership in contracts. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nKendall and Thornton agree to form a partnership, but they have an internal agreement that only Kendall will manage the business, make all business decisions, and execute all contracts with third parties. So, according to their partnership agreement, Thornton doesn't have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the partnership.\n\nBut then, Thornton goes ahead and enters into a long-term service contract with Clark. Importantly, Clark doesn't know about this internal agreement between Kendall and Thornton. So, Clark is unaware that Thornton isn't supposed to be making contracts for the partnership.\n\nNow, the question is whether this contract between Thornton and Clark is enforceable against the partnership.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Enforceable, as the partners' agreement cannot withhold statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\n\nB. Enforceable, as Clark has no knowledge of Thornton's lack of authority.\n\nC. Unenforceable, as Thornton is unauthorized to execute the contract by the partner agreement.\n\nD. Unenforceable, as Clark had an obligation to confirm Thornton's authority prior to entering into a service contract with the partnership.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall some partnership law here. In general partnerships, each partner has the authority to bind the partnership in contracts, unless there's a specific agreement stating otherwise.\n\nBut in this case, there is an internal agreement that limits Thornton's authority. However, this agreement is internal, meaning it's between Kendall and Thornton. External parties, like Clark, might not know about this internal limitation.\n\nSo, the key here is whether Clark knew about this limitation or not. If Clark didn't know about the internal agreement restricting Thornton's authority, then Thornton's actions might still bind the partnership.\n\nOption B seems to suggest that since Clark has no knowledge of Thornton's lack of authority, the contract is enforceable. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption A says that the partners' agreement cannot withhold statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership. Hmm, I need to check if that's accurate. Generally, internal partnership agreements can limit the authority of partners, but only if third parties are aware of those limitations. If third parties aren't aware, then the partners' actions can still bind the partnership.\n\nOption C says the contract is unenforceable because Thornton is unauthorized by the partner agreement. But if Clark didn't know about this unauthorized status, then maybe the partnership is still bound.\n\nOption D says the contract is unenforceable because Clark had an obligation to confirm Thornton's authority. But is that the case? Generally, third parties don't have to know the internal workings of a partnership unless there's something publicly recorded or they have actual knowledge.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up some partnership law here. Let's see.\n\nIn partnership law, each partner has the authority to bind the partnership in the ordinary course of business unless there's a specific limitation that's communicated to the third party.\n\nSo, if there's an internal agreement that limits a partner's authority, but that limitation isn't known to the third party, then the partner can still bind the partnership.\n\nIn such a case, the partnership would be bound by the contract, but the partner who exceeded their authority might be liable to the other partners for any resulting losses.\n\nSo, applying this to the scenario, Thornton enters into a contract with Clark, and Clark doesn't know about the internal agreement limiting Thornton's authority. Therefore, the partnership should be bound by the contract.\n\nSo, options A and B suggest that the contract is enforceable, while C and D say it's unenforceable.\n\nBetween A and B, I need to decide which one is more accurate.\n\nOption A mentions \"statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\" That sounds like a reference to the general rule that partners can bind the partnership unless there's a specific limitation that's known to third parties.\n\nOption B simply states that it's enforceable because Clark has no knowledge of Thornton's lack of authority, which is also in line with the general principle.\n\nBut perhaps option A is more comprehensive, as it refers to statutory authority, which suggests that there's a law backing this up.\n\nWait, but in some jurisdictions, there might be specific statutes that govern this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) have provisions regarding this.\n\nLet me try to recall.\n\nUnder the UPA, each partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business, and the act of any partner, including the execution of contracts, binding upon the partnership unless the partner had no authority to act in that particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing had knowledge of the limitation.\n\nSo, in this case, since Clark had no knowledge of the limitation on Thornton's authority, Thornton's act in entering into the contract would bind the partnership.\n\nTherefore, the contract is enforceable against the partnership.\n\nSo, options A and B are both saying that it's enforceable, but for slightly different reasons.\n\nOption A refers to statutory authority, which is correct, as the UPA or RUPA would likely have provisions similar to what I just recalled.\n\nOption B focuses on Clark's lack of knowledge, which is also a key point.\n\nHowever, option A seems more comprehensive as it refers to the statutory framework.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, as per the UPA, the internal agreement doesn't protect the partnership from contracts entered into by partners acting beyond their authority if the third party was unaware of the limitation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because generally, third parties don't have an obligation to confirm a partner's authority unless there's something to indicate that there might be a limitation.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be A: enforceable, as the partners' agreement cannot withhold statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\n\nBut I should double-check this.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose that the partnership agreement was recorded publicly, and Clark could have known about the limitation. Would that change things?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if the partnership agreement is recorded in a public registry, third parties are presumed to know its contents, and thus, partners cannot bind the partnership beyond their authorized scope.\n\nBut in this problem, it doesn't mention any public recording of the partnership agreement. It only says that Kendall and Thornton agreed internally that only Kendall would manage the business and make contracts.\n\nSince Clark doesn't know about this internal agreement, and there's no indication that this agreement was publicly recorded, then Thornton's actions should bind the partnership.\n\nTherefore, the contract is enforceable.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
