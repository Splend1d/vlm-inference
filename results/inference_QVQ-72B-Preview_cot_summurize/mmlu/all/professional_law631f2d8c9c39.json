                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this property law scenario. It's about a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship between a woman and her cohabiting partner. The partner has some debts and secretly gets a mortgage on his interest in the property. Then he dies, and the bank wants to execute on that mortgage. The question is whether the bank can do that, and I need to apply the majority view on this issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship means. I know that in a joint tenancy, each owner has an undivided interest in the property, and when one owner dies, their interest passes automatically to the surviving owner(s), bypassing the probate process. The right of survivorship is a key feature here.\n\nNow, the partner secretly obtains a mortgage on his interest in the property. In a joint tenancy, each tenant can encumber their interest, but it's important to note that this only affects their share. So, if the property is owned 50/50, he can mortgage his 50% interest.\n\nWhen he dies, the bank tries to execute on the mortgage. In a lien theory state, a mortgage creates a lien on the property, which secures the debt. Typically, upon default, the lender can foreclose on the property to satisfy the debt.\n\nBut here, the property is jointly owned, and there's a right of survivorship. When the partner dies, his interest passes to the surviving joint tenant. So, does that mean the bank's lien is wiped out because the property automatically goes to the surviving owner?\n\nI think the key here is understanding whether the mortgage lien affects the entire property or just the mortgagor's interest. In a joint tenancy, each tenant's interest can be subject to liens based on their individual debts.\n\nThe majority view in property law seems to be that a mortgage on one tenant's interest in a joint tenancy does not destroy the joint tenancy as a whole. Instead, it affects only that tenant's interest. So, upon the mortgagor's death, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant, and the mortgage lien attaches to the proceeds that the estate would have received if there had been no joint tenancy.\n\nWait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase it. If the partner mortgaged his interest, and then died, his interest passes to the surviving joint tenant, and the bank's lien would attach to whatever interest the partner had, which has now passed to the surviving tenant. But does the bank get to collect anything in this scenario?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, when a joint tenant dies, and their interest passes to the surviving tenant, any liens against that deceased tenant's interest generally do not attach to the surviving tenant's interest. So, the surviving tenant gets the property free of those liens.\n\nHowever, the bank might still have a claim against the deceased tenant's estate for the debt, but since the property passed by operation of law to the surviving tenant, the bank might be out of luck unless there are other assets in the estate.\n\nBut maybe it's not that straightforward. Perhaps the bank has some rights to proceed against the property despite the joint tenancy.\n\nLet me consider the options provided:\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nThis seems to align with what I was thinking. The joint tenancy isn't destroyed by the mortgage on one tenant's interest, and the right of survivorship ensures that the property passes to the surviving tenant upon the other's death.\n\nB. No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.\n\nThis suggests that the mortgage did sever the joint tenancy, but the bank needs a deed of trust to execute. However, I'm not sure if that's accurate. In many places, a mortgage is sufficient to secure the debt against the mortgagor's interest.\n\nC. Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\n\nThis implies that the mortgage severed the joint tenancy and gave the bank rights to the property. But I think that's an overstatement. The bank has a lien against the mortgagor's interest, not the entire property.\n\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n\nSimilar to option C, this suggests that the mortgage effectively transferred significant rights to the bank, allowing it to execute on the mortgage without restrictions.\n\nGiven what I know about joint tenancies and mortgages, I think option A is the correct answer. The majority view holds that the mortgage on one tenant's interest does not destroy the joint tenancy, and upon the mortgagor's death, the property passes to the surviving tenant free of the mortgage lien.\n\nTo double-check, I'll look up some case law or statutory provisions regarding joint tenancies and mortgages in lien theory states.\n\nI found that in many jurisdictions, including lien theory states, a mortgage on one joint tenant's interest does not sever the joint tenancy. Upon the mortgagor's death, the property passes to the surviving tenant, and the mortgage lien is generally extinguished unless there are specific provisions to the contrary.\n\nThere might be exceptions or variations based on state law, but generally, the right of survivorship prevails over individual liens on a joint tenant's interest.\n\nTherefore, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage after the partner's death because the property has already passed to the surviving joint tenant, and the mortgage lien does not attach to the surviving tenant's interest.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
