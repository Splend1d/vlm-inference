                    "text": "So I'm looking at these two statements about finite groups, and I need to determine whether they're true or false. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll try to recall the relevant theorems.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"If a finite group has order n, then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n.\"\n\nHmm, this sounds familiar. I think there's a theorem related to this. Oh, right! It's Sylow's Theorems. Sylow's First Theorem says that if you have a finite group G of order n, and if p is a prime that divides n, then G has a subgroup of order p^k, where p^k is the highest power of p dividing n. But wait, that's not exactly what this statement is saying.\n\nThis statement is saying that for every positive divisor d of n, there exists a subgroup of order d. So, not just the prime powers, but any divisor. Is that always true?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose G is a group of order 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Does G necessarily have subgroups of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6?\n\nWell, yes, every group has a trivial subgroup of order 1 and the group itself, so those are straightforward. For order 2, in a group of order 6, there should be an element of order 2, and thus a subgroup of order 2. Similarly, for order 3, since 3 is prime, by Cauchy's theorem, there's a subgroup of order 3.\n\nBut is this always the case for any finite group? What if the group isn't abelian or simple?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's consider the alternating group A4, which has order 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Does A4 have subgroups of each of these orders?\n\nIt has subgroups of orders 1, 2, 3, and 12, that's clear. What about order 4 and 6?\n\nFor order 4, yes, A4 has subgroups of order 4, like the Klein four-group V4.\n\nBut for order 6, does A4 have a subgroup of order 6? Hmm, I think not. Because A4 has 12 elements, and a subgroup of order 6 would have index 2, which would be normal. But A4 is simple, right? Wait, no, A4 is not simple because it has normal subgroups, like the Klein four-group.\n\nWait, actually, A4 is not simple; it has normal subgroups. But does it have a subgroup of order 6?\n\nLet me think. The order of a subgroup divides the order of the group, by Lagrange's theorem, but that doesn't guarantee that for every divisor, there's a subgroup of that order.\n\nSo, in the case of A4, does it have a subgroup of order 6? I think not, because A4 is the group of even permutations of 4 elements, and it doesn't have a subgroup of order 6.\n\nWait, let me check: the subgroups of A4 include the Klein four-group V4, which has order 4, and the cyclic subgroups of order 3 generated by 3-cycles. But no subgroup of order 6.\n\nSo, in this case, even though 6 divides 12, A4 doesn't have a subgroup of order 6. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"If a belongs to a finite group, then |a| divides |G|.\"\n\nThis seems familiar. I think this is a consequence of Lagrange's theorem. Lagrange's theorem states that in a finite group G, the order of any subgroup H divides the order of G.\n\nNow, the order of an element a in G is defined as the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by a, which is <a>. So, |a| = |<a>|.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, since <a> is a subgroup of G, |<a>| divides |G|. Therefore, |a| divides |G|.\n\nThis seems to hold true in all finite groups. For example, in Z_6, the integers modulo 6 under addition, the element 2 has order 3, which divides 6. Similarly, in any group, the order of an element always divides the order of the group.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. True, False, but since Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, that would be D. False, True.\n\nWait, no, the options are:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nGiven that, D. False, True would be the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier thought process, I concluded that Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, so D is the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should double-check my understanding to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me verify Statement 1 again. Is it true that every finite group has a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n?\n\nAs I thought earlier, no, because of the example of A4 not having a subgroup of order 6, even though 6 divides 12.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nFor Statement 2, it's a standard result in group theory that the order of an element divides the order of the group, which is Lagrange's theorem applied to the cyclic subgroup generated by that element.\n\nSo, yes, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
