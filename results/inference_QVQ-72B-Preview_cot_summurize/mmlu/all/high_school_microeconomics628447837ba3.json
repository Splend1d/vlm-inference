                    "text": "Let's see here. Mr. Hamm puts $0.45 worth of sauce on each pizza he makes. The question is asking which cost categories this sauce falls into among total fixed costs, total variable costs, marginal cost, and total costs. And the options are combinations of these categories.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these cost categories represents.\n\nTotal Fixed Costs (TFC) are costs that do not change with the level of production. For example, rent or salaries that stay the same regardless of how many pizzas are made.\n\nTotal Variable Costs (TVC) are costs that change directly with the level of production. So, the more pizzas Mr. Hamm makes, the more sauce he uses, which means variable costs increase with production.\n\nMarginal Cost (MC) is the cost of producing one additional unit. So, for each extra pizza, what's the extra cost incurred?\n\nTotal Costs (TC) are the sum of total fixed costs and total variable costs.\n\nGiven that, the cost of sauce seems to be a variable cost because it's directly related to the number of pizzas produced. Each pizza gets $0.45 of sauce, so if he makes more pizzas, he uses more sauce, which increases the total variable costs.\n\nAlso, since marginal cost is the cost of making one more pizza, the cost of sauce would be part of that because each additional pizza requires an extra $0.45 of sauce.\n\nTotal costs are the sum of fixed and variable costs, so the sauce cost would be included in total costs as well.\n\nBut what about total fixed costs? Does the cost of sauce change with the level of production? No, because it's a per-pizza cost. So, it's not a fixed cost.\n\nWait, but the question is saying \"for Mr. Hamm, the cost of pizza sauce is a component of which of the following?\" And the options are combinations of I, II, III, and IV.\n\nOption A is I and IV only, meaning total fixed costs and total costs.\n\nOption B is II and III only, meaning total variable costs and marginal cost.\n\nOption C is II and IV only, meaning total variable costs and total costs.\n\nOption D is II, III, and IV only, meaning total variable costs, marginal cost, and total costs.\n\nGiven that sauce is a variable cost, it should be included in total variable costs, marginal cost, and total costs.\n\nIt's not a fixed cost, so it shouldn't be included in total fixed costs.\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct: II and IV only.\n\nBut wait, marginal cost is also part of it, so maybe option D is correct.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nTotal Variable Costs: yes, because sauce cost varies with production.\n\nMarginal Cost: yes, because each additional pizza requires $0.45 more for sauce.\n\nTotal Costs: yes, because total costs include both fixed and variable costs, and sauce is part of variable costs.\n\nTotal Fixed Costs: no, because fixed costs are constant and don't change with production.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct: II, III, and IV only.\n\nI think I was mistaken initially. Sauce is indeed a variable cost, so it's included in total variable costs, marginal cost, and total costs.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. II, III, and IV only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
