                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two people on ice, one heavier than the other, and they push off each other with a force F. I need to figure out what happens next in terms of the forces and accelerations they experience. Let's see...\n\nFirst off, I know that when two objects interact, the forces they exert on each other are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That's Newton's third law, right? So, if the heavier person pushes on the lighter one with force F, the lighter one pushes back on the heavier person with the same force F, but in the opposite direction. So, the force felt by the heavier person should be -F, not (-1/2)F or -2F. So, options A and B seem off based on that.\n\nNow, about the accelerations. I remember that force equals mass times acceleration, or F = ma. So, if I have two different masses experiencing the same magnitude of force but in opposite directions, their accelerations should be inversely proportional to their masses.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- m1 = 100 kg (heavier person)\n\n- m2 = 50 kg (lighter person)\n\n- F1 = F (force exerted by heavier on lighter)\n\n- F2 = -F (force exerted by lighter on heavier)\n\nThen, for the heavier person:\n\nF2 = m1 * a1\n\n-F = 100 * a1\n\na1 = -F / 100\n\nFor the lighter person:\n\nF1 = m2 * a2\n\nF = 50 * a2\n\na2 = F / 50\n\nNow, I need to compare the magnitudes of a1 and a2.\n\nMagnitude of a1 is |a1| = F / 100\n\nMagnitude of a2 is |a2| = F / 50\n\nSo, |a2| / |a1| = (F/50) / (F/100) = (F/50)*(100/F) = 100/50 = 2\n\nSo, the magnitude of the lighter person's acceleration is twice that of the heavier person's acceleration.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of Newton's laws again. Since the force pair is equal and opposite, and mass affects acceleration inversely, then yes, the lighter person should accelerate more than the heavier one for the same force.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the ratio of their accelerations.\n\n|a2| / |a1| = (F / 50) / (F / 100) = (1/50)/(1/100) = 2\n\nSo, again, it's a factor of 2.\n\nBut wait, does that mean the lighter person's acceleration is twice the heavier person's, or is it the other way around?\n\nLet me see: since a2 = (F / 50) and a1 = (-F / 100), then |a2| = (F / 50) and |a1| = (F / 100). So, |a2| / |a1| = 2, meaning |a2| = 2 * |a1|.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the lighter person's acceleration is twice that of the heavier person's.\n\nTherefore, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't something else going on here.\n\nIs there any other force acting on them? Well, gravity is acting downwards, but since they're on ice, the normal force balances that, so no horizontal forces besides the push between them.\n\nAlso, since it's frictionless ice, there's no friction to worry about.\n\nSo, my conclusion stands.\n\nI think the answer is D: the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
