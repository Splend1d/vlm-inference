Contains the full range of phonemes that comprise all languages\n\nB. Is different for each language community from the onset of babbling\n\nC. Is the same for each language community until the first words are spoken\n\nD. Depends upon the phonetic structure of the language\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what early babbling in infants is like. From what I remember, babbling is the early production of sounds by infants before they start using meaningful words. It's like practice for speech.\n\nNow, the question is about infants from different language communities. That probably means infants who are exposed to different languages from birth, like English, Mandarin, Spanish, etc.\n\nOption A says that early babbling contains the full range of phonemes that comprise all languages. Phonemes are the smallest units of sound that can distinguish meaning in a language. So, is it true that all babies, regardless of the language they're exposed to, produce all possible phonemes found in all languages?\n\nI think I've read that babies are born with the ability to produce and hear a wide range of phonemes, but this ability narrows down as they grow older and are exposed to the specific sounds of their native language. So, in early babbling, babies might produce a broad range of sounds, but not necessarily the full range of all possible phonemes in all languages. Maybe some phonemes are missing even in early babbling, depending on the language environment.\n\nOption B says that babbling is different for each language community from the onset of babbling. So, does this mean that from the very beginning, babies babble in ways that are specific to the language they're hearing?\n\nI recall that initially, babies' babbling is quite universal, meaning it's similar across different language backgrounds. They produce a wide variety of sounds, including those that might not even be present in their native language. It's only later that their babbling starts to reflect the sounds and rhythms of the language they're exposed to. So, I think this option might not be accurate because babbling isn't different from the very onset based on language community.\n\nOption C states that babbling is the same for each language community until the first words are spoken. This seems plausible because research suggests that until around 6 to 8 months of age, babies produce similar sounds regardless of their language background. It's after that age that their babbling starts to converge towards the phonetic features of their native language.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, before they start producing their first words, babies' babbling is quite similar, regardless of the language they're learning. After that, it starts to become more specific to the language they're exposed to.\n\nOption D says that babbling depends upon the phonetic structure of the language. The phonetic structure of a language refers to its sound system, including the sounds used and how they are combined.\n\nGiven what I know, initially, babbling is not dependent on the phonetic structure of the language being learned. Babies produce a wide range of sounds, many of which are common across languages. However, as they get older, their babbling does start to reflect the phonetic structure of their native language.\n\nSo, perhaps this option is partially true, but it might not capture the entire picture because in the early stages, babbling isn't strictly dependent on the specific phonetic structure of the language being learned.\n\nLet me summarize what I think:\n\n- Early babbling is similar across different language communities and includes a broad range of phonemes.\n\n- As infants get older, their babbling becomes more specific to the sounds and rhythms of their native language.\n\n- So, until a certain age (maybe around 6 to 8 months), babbling is universal, and after that, it starts to reflect the language being learned.\n\nGiven this, option C seems the most accurate because it states that babbling is the same for each language community until the first words are spoken. After that, it likely starts to differ based on the specific language being learned.\n\nBut let me double-check. I remember that the critical period for phonological development is around 6 to 8 months, when babies start to fine-tune their perception and production of language sounds to match those of their native language.\n\nBefore that age, their babbling is quite similar across different language backgrounds. After that age, their babbling becomes more aligned with the phonetic features of their native language.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to align with this understanding.\n\nOption A might be tempting because babies can produce a wide range of sounds initially, but it's not necessarily the full range of all possible phonemes in all languages. Some phonemes might not be produced in early babbling.\n\nOption B is incorrect because babbling isn't different from the onset based on language community; it becomes different as the child gets older.\n\nOption D is somewhat true in the later stages, but not from the very beginning.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is C. Babbling is the same for each language community until the first words are spoken.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
