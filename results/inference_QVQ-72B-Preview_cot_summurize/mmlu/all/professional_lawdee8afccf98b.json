Call us to reserve your table. \"The response to the promotion was more than the restaurant expected, and the restaurant was soon overbooked for the Mother's Day brunch. On the day before Mother's Day, the restaurant owner decided to double-check inventory to make sure the restaurant had enough food and supplies to handle the large Mother's Day crowd. To her horror, she discovered that the restaurant was almost out of eggs. Knowing that a large supply of eggs would be needed for the omelet station, the owner immediately sent the following e-mail to her egg supplier:\"Desperately need 20 flats of Grade AA eggs for tomorrow's brunch. Money is no object. The eggs must be delivered today. \"The supplier e-mailed back:\"No problem! I'll load them on the truck and deliver them within the hour. \"With respect to the agreement between the owner and the supplier, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the omittance of a fixed contract price?\n\nA. The contract is unenforceable as violative of the statute of frauds.\nB. The contract is unenforceable, because of indefiniteness.\nC.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a restaurant that's overbooked for Mother's Day brunch and realizes they're almost out of eggs. The owner emails the egg supplier urgently requesting 20 flats of Grade AA eggs for the next day's brunch, saying that money is no object and that the eggs must be delivered today. The supplier responds saying there's no problem and will deliver the eggs within the hour.\n\nNow, the question is about the agreement between the owner and the supplier, specifically regarding the omission of a fixed contract price. The options are:\n\nA. The contract is unenforceable as violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nB. The contract is unenforceable because of indefiniteness.\n\nC. The contract may be enforceable if it is later modified to include the price term.\n\nD. The contract is enforceable with a reasonable price being fixed at the time of delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The owner needs eggs urgently and is willing to pay whatever it takes to get them delivered quickly. The supplier agrees to deliver them within the hour. But there's no specific price mentioned in the agreement.\n\nOption A mentions the statute of frauds. I remember that the statute of frauds generally requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, like contracts for the sale of goods over a certain amount, I think it's $500 or more. But in this case, since it's an email exchange, which is in writing, and they've agreed on the quantity and quality of the eggs, maybe it's covered. But I'm not sure if the absence of a price makes it violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nOption B says the contract is unenforceable due to indefiniteness. That makes sense because without a price, it might be unclear how much the restaurant has to pay. But I think in contract law, if terms are missing, courts can sometimes imply terms or determine a reasonable price based on market rates or other factors.\n\nOption C says the contract may be enforceable if it's later modified to include the price term. That seems possible. If after the agreement, they agree on a price, then the contract becomes enforceable with that price. But the question is about the current agreement, not any potential modifications.\n\nOption D states that the contract is enforceable with a reasonable price being fixed at the time of delivery. This seems plausible. If the parties didn't specify a price, perhaps the court can determine a fair price based on the current market price of eggs or the usual price the supplier charges.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully. In contract law, for a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be an agreement on essential terms. Price is generally considered an essential term in a sales contract. So, if there's no agreed price, does that make the contract unenforceable?\n\nI recall that under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs the sale of goods, a contract for the sale of goods may be enforceable even if the price is not fixed, provided that:\n\n- The price is otherwise properly agreed upon, or\n\n- It is otherwise made evident by the course of dealing or usage of trade, or\n\n- If it's impossible to determine a price, the contract may fail for indefiniteness.\n\nIn this scenario, the owner said \"money is no object,\" which might imply that they are willing to pay whatever the supplier asks, but it's not clear what the actual price is.\n\nPerhaps the supplier, knowing the market price of eggs, could infer a price based on that. Or maybe the court would set a price that is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nOption A mentions the statute of frauds. I don't think that's the issue here, because the agreement is in writing (via email), and even if it weren't, the UCC allows for enforceability under certain circumstances.\n\nOption B suggests the contract is unenforceable due to indefiniteness. While lacking a price term could make a contract indefinite, the UCC allows for the determination of a reasonable price if the parties did not specify one.\n\nOption C mentions that the contract may be enforceable if modified to include the price term. That's possible, but the question is about the current agreement, not any future modifications.\n\nOption D says the contract is enforceable with a reasonable price fixed at the time of delivery. This seems the most accurate based on UCC principles.\n\nTherefore, I believe the most accurate statement is D: the contract is enforceable with a reasonable price being fixed at the time of delivery.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\nUnder UCC Section 2-305, if the parties make a contract for the sale of goods but omit the price term, the price is determined as follows:\n\n- At a reasonable price at the time of delivery if:\n\n- The price is to be fixed at market price on delivery, or\n\n- If it is otherwise to be fixed at market price and no market price is available.\n\n- Otherwise, at a reasonable price.\n\nSo, in this case, since the parties didn't specify a price, and the owner said \"money is no object,\" it seems that the price would be determined at a reasonable price at the time of delivery.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be correct.\n\nI don't think it's A, because the statute of frauds isn't being violated here, especially since there's a written agreement.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, under the UCC, the contract can still be enforceable even if the price isn't specified, as long as it can be determined reasonably.\n\nOption C is possible, but it's speculative because it refers to a future modification, whereas the question is about the current state of the agreement.\n\nThus, the best answer is D: the contract is enforceable with a reasonable price being fixed at the time of delivery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
