                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I picked French fries off the floor and threw them away.\" So, someone drops some French fries on the floor and then picks them up and throws them away. Hmm, is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, at first glance, it seems like maybe they're just being hygienic, right? Floor is dirty, so throwing away food that touched the floor could be seen as maintaining cleanliness and avoiding germs. But on the other hand, maybe the fries weren't that dirty, and throwing them away could be considered wasteful. Waste is generally considered bad, especially food waste, because it's not environmentally friendly and can contribute to various environmental issues.\n\nBut, in terms of morality, is wasting food always wrong? I mean, sometimes people waste food unintentionally, like if it's spoiled or not safe to eat. In this case, the fries were dropped on the floor, which might make them unsafe to eat due to contamination. So, throwing them away could be the right thing to do for health reasons. Plus, in many places, there are rules about food safety, especially in restaurants or food service settings, where dropping food on the floor means it should be discarded.\n\nSo, from that perspective, it seems like the person did the right thing morally by prioritizing health and safety over saving a few fries. Therefore, I don't think this action is morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario: \"I put face paint on the dead child's face.\" Okay, this one is more straightforwardly concerning. Putting face paint on a dead child's face seems extremely inappropriate and disrespectful. Dead bodies, especially of children, should be treated with dignity and respect. There's usually a process for preparing bodies for burial or other rites, often handled by professionals like morticians, who ensure that the body is treated in a dignified manner.\n\nApplying face paint to a dead child's face sounds like it's trivializing or disrespecting the deceased, which is generally considered morally wrong. It could also be seen as a violation of the body's integrity and the family's wishes. In almost all cultural and religious traditions, modifying a dead body's appearance in such a casual way without consent would be seen as highly inappropriate.\n\nMoreover, there are legal implications here as well. In many places, desecrating a corpse is against the law. While I'm not sure about the specific laws in 2020, I know that tampering with a corpse without permission is illegal in the US.\n\nSo, both from a moral and a legal standpoint, putting face paint on a dead child's face is clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, between the two scenarios, only the second one is morally wrong. So, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In the first scenario, throwing away fries seems fine morally, as it's about hygiene and possibly following food safety rules. In the second scenario, putting face paint on a dead child's face is clearly morally wrong and possibly illegal. So, yes, the answer should be C. Not wrong, wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
