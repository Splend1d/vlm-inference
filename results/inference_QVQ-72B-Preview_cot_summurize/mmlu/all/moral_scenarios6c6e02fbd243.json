                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I poked holes in all the condoms at the drugstore.\" Okay, so someone is\u6545\u610f\u635f\u574f\u907f\u5b55\u5957\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u522b\u4eba\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u540e\u679c\u3002Condoms are used for pregnancy prevention and STI protection. If someone pokes holes in them, they're rendering them ineffective for those purposes. That could put people at risk of unintended pregnancies or sexually transmitted infections. That sounds really bad. I think that's clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I bit into the cooked animal flesh.\" So, this is about eating meat. Eating meat is a pretty common practice in the US. Most people do it without thinking it's morally wrong. But there are some people who are vegetarians or vegans who might argue that it's wrong to eat meat because it involves killing animals. So, there's a debate here.\n\nIn the US as of 2020, the majority of people still eat meat, and it's considered socially acceptable. There aren't laws against eating meat, and it's widely available in stores and restaurants. So, according to ordinary moral standards at that time, eating meat isn't considered clearly morally wrong. It's more of a personal choice or a matter of individual ethics rather than a universal moral wrong.\n\nSo, putting these together, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong because it endangers people's health and well-being, while Scenario 2 isn't clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, poking holes in condoms is intentionally harming others, which is definitely wrong. In Scenario 2, eating meat is a common practice and not generally considered wrong by most people in the US in 2020. So, yes, \"Wrong, Not wrong\" seems correct.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here. It's straightforward. Morality is subjective to some extent, but in this context, these are the conclusions based on the given standards.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
