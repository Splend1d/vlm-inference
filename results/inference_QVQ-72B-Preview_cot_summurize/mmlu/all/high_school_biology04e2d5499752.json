                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is about transpiration and the special properties of water. It says that transpiration is a result of special properties of water, and it lists cohesion, adhesion, capillary action, and hydrophobicity. I need to pick which one of these is NOT a special property of water in the context of transpiration.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what transpiration is. Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water vapor through their leaves, stems, and flowers, mostly through stomata. It's kind of like evaporation from the plant's surface, and it's crucial for the uptake of water from the roots and the transport of minerals.\n\nNow, the special properties of water that are mentioned are:\n\nA. cohesion\n\nB. adhesion\n\nC. capillary action\n\nD. hydrophobicity\n\nI need to figure out which one of these isn't involved in transpiration.\n\nLet's recall what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Cohesion**: This is the property of water molecules to stick together due to hydrogen bonding. This is important in maintaining the integrity of water columns in plants.\n\n2. **Adhesion**: This is the property of water molecules to stick to other surfaces, like the walls of xylem vessels in plants. This helps in pulling water up from the roots.\n\n3. **Capillary action**: This is the ability of water to flow in narrow spaces without the help of gravity, due to the combined effects of adhesion and surface tension. It's important in the movement of water in soils and in small pores of plants.\n\n4. **Hydrophobicity**: This refers to the property of certain substances to repel water. This is more about materials not interacting with water rather than a property of water itself.\n\nWait a minute, hydrophobicity isn't a property of water; it's a property of certain materials that do not interact well with water. So, maybe that's the one that's exceptions.\n\nBut let's think deeper. In transpiration, water is being moved up from the roots to the leaves, where it's evaporated through stomata. This movement is driven by the cohesion of water molecules, the adhesion of water to the xylem walls, and capillary action helps in getting water through small spaces.\n\nHydrophobicity, on the other hand, is about materials not liking water. In plants, some parts like the cuticle on leaves are hydrophobic to prevent excessive water loss, but in terms of water transport via xylem, the xylem itself is made of cellulose, which is hydrophilic, meaning it attracts water.\n\nSo, cohesion, adhesion, and capillary action are all directly involved in the transpiration process, whereas hydrophobicity is more about resistance to water, which isn't directly involved in facilitating transpiration.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. hydrophobicity.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any way hydrophobicity could be considered a part of transpiration. Maybe in the sense that some plant waxes are hydrophobic and help regulate water loss, but again, that's more about preventing transpiration rather than facilitating it.\n\nYeah, I think it's safe to say that hydrophobicity is the exception here, and not a special property of water involved in transpiration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
