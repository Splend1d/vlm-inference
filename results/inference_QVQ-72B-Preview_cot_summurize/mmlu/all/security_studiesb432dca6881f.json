                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here: \"When did the cyber-security discourse emerge? In other words, when did politicians, academics, and other agents begin to talk seriously about cyber-security?\" And the options are A. 1970s, B. 1990s, C. 1960s, and D. 1980s.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this. Cybersecurity is such a big deal now, but when did people start really discussing it?\n\nFirst off, I know that computers have been around since the mid-20th century. The 1960s saw the rise of mainframe computers and the beginning of the internet as we know it, with ARPANET being developed in the late 1960s.\n\nBut was there any significant discussion about cybersecurity back then? I don't think so. Computing was mostly confined to government and large organizations, and security was probably more about physical security than digital.\n\nMoving on to the 1970s. This was when the internet started to take shape, and computer networking became more common. The first computer worm, the Creeper, was created in the early 1970s, which shows that people were starting to think about security issues.\n\nAlso, in 1975, the first edition of \"Computer Security\" by Dorothy Denning and Peter Denning was published, which is often considered a foundational text in the field. So, maybe there was some discourse happening in the 1970s.\n\nBut I think the real surge in cybersecurity discourse came in the 1990s. That's when the internet really took off, with the advent of the World Wide Web in 1991. As more people and businesses started using the internet, concerns about security increased.\n\nIn the 1990s, we saw the rise of antivirus software, firewalls, and other cybersecurity tools. There were also several high-profile hacking incidents, like the Morris Worm in 1988, which might have been just at the end of the 1980s, but its impact was felt in the 1990s.\n\nAdditionally, in the 1990s, governments started to pass laws related to cybersecurity, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the United States, which was originally passed in 1986 but was amended several times in the 1990s to address new threats.\n\nAcademically, cybersecurity became a more established field in the 1990s, with more research being conducted and conferences being held on the topic.\n\nSo, between the 1970s and the 1990s, I think the 1990s saw a significant increase in the cybersecurity discourse.\n\nBut let me consider the 1980s as well. The 1980s were a time when personal computers became more widespread, with the rise of companies like IBM and Apple. This increased accessibility likely led to more discussions about security.\n\nAlso, in the 1980s, there were notable cybersecurity events, such as the first computer virus, Elk Cloner, which was created in 1982 for the Apple II.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in 1988 in response to the Morris Worm.\n\nSo, the 1980s definitely saw some development in cybersecurity discussions, but I still think the 1990s saw a more substantial increase due to the rapid growth of the internet and the World Wide Web.\n\nAs for the 1960s, while they were important for the development of computing and the early internet, I don't think cybersecurity was a major discourse at that time. It was probably more about building the technology than securing it.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the cybersecurity discourse emerged in the 1990s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
