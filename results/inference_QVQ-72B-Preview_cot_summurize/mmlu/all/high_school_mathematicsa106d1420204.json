                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got this situation where a retailer bought 20,000 pounds of soybeans in both 2014 and 2015, but the prices were different in those years. In 2014, the average wholesale price was $0.24 per pound, and in 2015, it dropped to $0.16 per pound. We need to find out the percent change in the retailer's expenses from 2014 to 2015.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much the retailer spent in each year. That seems straightforward since I know the price per pound and the quantity purchased.\n\nIn 2014:\n\nPrice per pound = $0.24\n\nQuantity = 20,000 pounds\n\nTotal expense in 2014 = price per pound \u00d7 quantity = $0.24 \u00d7 20,000\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$0.24 \u00d7 20,000 = $4,800\n\nOkay, so the retailer spent $4,800 in 2014.\n\nNow, in 2015:\n\nPrice per pound = $0.16\n\nQuantity = 20,000 pounds\n\nTotal expense in 2015 = price per pound \u00d7 quantity = $0.16 \u00d7 20,000\n\nCalculating that:\n\n$0.16 \u00d7 20,000 = $3,200\n\nSo, the retailer spent $3,200 in 2015.\n\nNow, to find the percent change in expenses from 2014 to 2015, I need to see how much the expenses decreased and then find out what percentage that decrease is relative to the original amount in 2014.\n\nFirst, calculate the decrease in expenses:\n\nDecrease = expense in 2014 - expense in 2015 = $4,800 - $3,200 = $1,600\n\nNow, to find out what percentage $1,600 is of $4,800, I use the formula:\n\nPercent change = (decrease / original amount) \u00d7 100%\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercent change = ($1,600 / $4,800) \u00d7 100%\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$1,600 \u00f7 $4,800 = 0.3333...\n\nThen, 0.3333... \u00d7 100% = 33.33...\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't match any of the options directly. The options are \u20138%, \u201333%, \u201350%, and 8%. I got 33.33%, which is close to 33%, but there's a negative sign there. Since the expenses decreased, it should be negative, right?\n\nLet me check the formula again. Percent change is usually calculated as:\n\nPercent change = [(new amount - original amount) / original amount] \u00d7 100%\n\nIn this case, new amount is $3,200 and original amount is $4,800.\n\nSo, percent change = [($3,200 - $4,800) / $4,800] \u00d7 100% = [(-$1,600) / $4,800] \u00d7 100% = -0.3333... \u00d7 100% = -33.33...\n\nSo, it's a 33.33% decrease. Looking at the options, -33% is option B.\n\nBut wait, there's also option A, -8%, which seems lower. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nTotal expense in 2014: $0.24 \u00d7 20,000 = $4,800\n\nTotal expense in 2015: $0.16 \u00d7 20,000 = $3,200\n\nDecrease: $4,800 - $3,200 = $1,600\n\nPercent change: ($1,600 / $4,800) \u00d7 100% = (1/3) \u00d7 100% \u2248 33.33%\n\nSo, -33% seems correct, which is option B.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it to confirm.\n\nMaybe using the percentage decrease formula:\n\nPercentage decrease = (decrease \u00f7 original amount) \u00d7 100%\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps calculating the percentage difference based on the price per pound.\n\nPrice in 2014: $0.24\n\nPrice in 2015: $0.16\n\nDecrease in price: $0.24 - $0.16 = $0.08\n\nPercent decrease: ($0.08 / $0.24) \u00d7 100% = (8/24) \u00d7 100% = (1/3) \u00d7 100% \u2248 33.33%\n\nAgain, -33%, which matches option B.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the percentage change, like changes in quantity, but the problem states that the retailer purchased 20,000 pounds in both years, so quantity remained constant.\n\nTherefore, the percent change in expenses is solely due to the change in price per pound.\n\nSo, the percent change is -33%, meaning a 33% decrease from 2014 to 2015.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-33\\%} \\]"
