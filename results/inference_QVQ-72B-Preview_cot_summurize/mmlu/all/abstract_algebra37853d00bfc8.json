                    "text": "So I have this problem here: Let p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) in S_5. Find the index of <p> in S_5. The options are A. 8, B. 2, C. 24, D. 120.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what p is. It's a permutation in S_5, which is the symmetric group on 5 elements. The permutation p is given as a product of cycles: (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3).\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. The cycle (1, 2, 5, 4) moves 1 to 2, 2 to 5, 5 to 4, and 4 back to 1. Then there's another cycle (2, 3), which moves 2 to 3 and 3 to 2. But notice that both cycles involve the element 2, so I need to be careful here.\n\nActually, when you write a permutation as a product of cycles, you have to consider the order of application. Typically, you apply them from right to left if you're using the standard composition convention.\n\nSo, first apply (2,3), then apply (1,2,5,4).\n\nLet me try to compute where each element goes.\n\nStart with 1:\n\n- Apply (2,3): 1 stays 1.\n\n- Then apply (1,2,5,4): 1 goes to 2.\n\nSo overall, 1 goes to 2.\n\nNow, 2:\n\n- Apply (2,3): 2 goes to 3.\n\n- Apply (1,2,5,4): 3 stays 3.\n\nSo 2 goes to 3.\n\nNext, 3:\n\n- Apply (2,3): 3 goes to 2.\n\n- Apply (1,2,5,4): 2 goes to 5.\n\nSo 3 goes to 5.\n\nThen, 4:\n\n- Apply (2,3): 4 stays 4.\n\n- Apply (1,2,5,4): 4 goes to 1.\n\nSo 4 goes to 1.\n\nFinally, 5:\n\n- Apply (2,3): 5 stays 5.\n\n- Apply (1,2,5,4): 5 goes to 4.\n\nSo 5 goes to 4.\n\nPutting it all together, p = (1,2,3,5,4) in cycle notation.\n\nWait, but that seems different from what was originally written. Maybe I made a mistake in the composition.\n\nLet me try again, being careful with the order.\n\nGiven p = (1,2,5,4)(2,3), and assuming we compose from right to left.\n\nSo, first apply (2,3), then apply (1,2,5,4).\n\nLet's track each element:\n\n- 1: (2,3) keeps 1 as 1; then (1,2,5,4) sends 1 to 2. So 1 \u2192 2.\n\n- 2: (2,3) sends 2 to 3; then (1,2,5,4) keeps 3 as 3. So 2 \u2192 3.\n\n- 3: (2,3) sends 3 to 2; then (1,2,5,4) sends 2 to 5. So 3 \u2192 5.\n\n- 4: (2,3) keeps 4 as 4; then (1,2,5,4) sends 4 to 1. So 4 \u2192 1.\n\n- 5: (2,3) keeps 5 as 5; then (1,2,5,4) sends 5 to 4. So 5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo indeed, p = (1,2,3,5,4), which is a single 5-cycle.\n\nNow, I need to find the index of <p> in S_5. The index is [S_5 : <p>] = |S_5| / |<p>|.\n\nWe know that |S_5| = 5! = 120.\n\nAnd |<p>| is the order of p.\n\np is a 5-cycle, and the order of a k-cycle in S_n is k, provided k \u2264 n.\n\nSo |p| = 5.\n\nTherefore, [S_5 : <p>] = 120 / 5 = 24.\n\nSo the answer should be 24.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 24 is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, confirming the permutation p:\n\n- (1,2,5,4)(2,3) composed from right to left is indeed (1,2,3,5,4), as I calculated.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, the order of a 5-cycle in S_5 is 5, and |S_5| is 120.\n\nSo, index [S_5 : <p>] = 120 / 5 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]"
