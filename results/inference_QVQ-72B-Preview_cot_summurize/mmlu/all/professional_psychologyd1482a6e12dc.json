                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Schachter's study on affiliation and anxiety. It says that Schachter investigated how affiliation and anxiety are related, and he concluded that high-anxiety participants preferred to wait with other high-anxiety participants. The question is asking which of the following options best accounts for this preference: demand characteristics, evaluation apprehension, relief from discomfort, or social comparison.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Schachter found in his study. I think Schachter did an experiment where he induced anxiety in participants and then looked at who they chose to affiliate with while waiting for the main part of the experiment. The key point is that high-anxiety participants preferred to wait with other high-anxiety individuals.\n\nNow, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: demand characteristics. I remember that demand characteristics refer to cues in the experimental setting that tell participants how they are supposed to behave. So, if participants are picking who to wait with based on what they think the experimenter wants them to do, that would be demand characteristics. But I don't think that's the main reason here. Schachter's study was designed to look at genuine preferences based on anxiety levels, not on what participants thought the experimenter wanted.\n\nOption B: evaluation apprehension. This term refers to the concern about being evaluated or judged by others. If high-anxiety participants are avoiding others because they're worried about being judged, that might make them prefer to wait with similar high-anxiety people, assuming those people might understand them better and not judge them. That could be a possible explanation, but I think there's a more direct reason based on Schachter's theory.\n\nOption C: relief from discomfort. This sounds like a possible benefit of affiliating with others who are also anxious. Maybe being with others who are in the same boat makes you feel less alone in your anxiety, which could provide some comfort. However, Schachter's theory of affiliation and anxiety is more specifically about seeking information during times of uncertainty or stress.\n\nOption D: social comparison. This seems the most relevant. Social comparison theory, proposed by Festinger, suggests that people compare themselves to others to evaluate their own opinions, abilities, and situations. In times of anxiety or uncertainty, comparing oneself to others who are in a similar state might help clarify one's own situation and reduce uncertainty.\n\nPutting it all together, Schachter's conclusion was that high-anxiety participants preferred to affiliate with other high-anxiety individuals because it allowed them to compare information and reduce their uncertainty about the situation. This aligns closely with social comparison theory.\n\nSo, among the given options, D. social comparison seems to be the best account for why high-anxiety participants preferred to wait with other high-anxiety participants.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Demand characteristics are about participants responding to perceived expectations of the experimenter, which isn't the primary driver here. Evaluation apprehension would suggest avoiding others to prevent judgment, but in this case, participants are seeking out others, so that doesn't fit well. Relief from discomfort might be a byproduct, but it's not the main reason according to Schachter's theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. social comparison.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
