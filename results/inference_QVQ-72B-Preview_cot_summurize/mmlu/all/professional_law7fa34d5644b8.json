                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out how much the furniture store can recover from its employee after being sued by a car driver who was injured in an accident caused by the employee's negligence. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the furniture store has a truck that their employee uses to deliver furniture to customers. One afternoon, while delivering a chair, the employee ran through a stop sign and hit a car, injuring the driver. The car driver sued the furniture store and recovered $25,000. Now, the furniture store wants to sue its own employee to recover some or all of that amount.\n\nI need to consider the principles of contribution and indemnity here. Contribution allows one who has paid more than their share of a common obligation to seek recovery from others who share that obligation. Indemnity, on the other hand, involves one party being responsible for the losses of another due to some agreement or legal principle.\n\nIn this case, the furniture store was sued and had to pay $25,000 because their employee was negligent. So, the question is, can the furniture store turn around and recover that money from the employee?\n\nLet me think about the relationship between the employer and the employee. Generally, employers are liable for the actions of their employees when those actions are performed within the course and scope of employment. This is called vicarious liability. So, the furniture store was held liable for the employee's negligence because the employee was acting in the course of employment when the accident occurred.\n\nNow, after paying the damages, the furniture store might want to seek reimbursement from the employee. This is where the concept of indemnity could come into play. If there's an indemnity agreement between the employer and the employee, or if there's a statutory right to indemnity, the employer might be able to recover the damages paid from the employee.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether such an indemnity agreement exists or if the jurisdiction allows for employers to seek indemnity from employees in such cases. The problem mentions that the jurisdiction has statutes permitting defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity, but it doesn't specify the exact nature of these statutes.\n\nOption A says the furniture store recovers nothing because it was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages. But I'm not sure about that. Just because the employer was primarily liable doesn't necessarily mean they can't seek recovery from the employee who caused the negligence.\n\nOption B suggests recovering $12,500 because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility. Hmm, but there's no information provided about how responsibility is allocated between the employer and the employee. It might not necessarily be equal.\n\nOption C says the furniture store can recover $25,000 because the employee was at fault. That seems plausible if the employee was entirely at fault and there's a right to indemnity.\n\nOption D adds a condition about insurance, saying the furniture store can recover $25,000 unless it was fully insured against such losses. But the problem states to assume all events occur in a jurisdiction that allows for contribution and indemnity claims, but it doesn't mention anything about insurance status affecting recovery rights.\n\nI think the key here is to understand the relationship between the employer and the employee and whether the employer has a right to indemnity from the employee for losses arising from the employee's negligence.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, employers have the right to indemnity from employees for damages paid due to the employees' negligence, especially if the negligence occurred during the course of employment.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the furniture store could potentially recover the full $25,000 from the employee, assuming there's no contractual or statutory provision preventing such recovery.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some limitations. For example, if the employee was acting within the scope of their employment, perhaps the employer cannot seek indemnity because the risk of employee negligence is inherent in doing business.\n\nHowever, in practice, many employers require employees to sign indemnity agreements holding the employer harmless for damages resulting from the employee's negligence.\n\nAlternatively, the employer might have insurance that covers such liabilities, in which case the employer might not seek indemnity from the employee.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide information about any such agreements or insurance policies, so I have to assume, based on the information given, that the furniture store can seek recovery from the employee.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer seems to be Option C: $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident.\n\nI don't think it's Option D because the problem doesn't mention anything about the furniture store being insured against such losses, so I can't assume that insurance status affects the recovery.\n\nOption B seems arbitrary because there's no basis to assume that responsibility is split equally between the employer and the employee.\n\nAnd Option A doesn't make sense because even if the employer was primarily liable, that doesn't preclude them from seeking recovery from the party whose actions caused the liability, which is the employee in this case.\n\nSo, I'll go with Option C: $25,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
