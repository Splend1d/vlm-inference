                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Tyler and his wife putting up a sign for Stan Johnson, who's running for mayor. They've been won over by the advertising campaign, and now they're putting a sign in their front yard. The question is asking what step of the advertising campaign this represents, and the options are identification, legitimacy, penetration, or participation.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of an advertising campaign. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nStarting with \"identification\": I think this has to do with recognizing or associating something with a particular brand or person. So, if the campaign helps people identify Stan Johnson as a candidate, that would be identification.\n\n\"Legitimacy\" probably refers to establishing that Stan Johnson is a credible and valid choice for mayor. Maybe highlighting his qualifications or track record.\n\n\"Penetration\" might refer to how deeply the campaign has reached into the community or how many people are aware of it.\n\n\"Participation\" seems straightforward\u2014it's about actively getting involved or taking part in the campaign, like volunteering or, in this case, putting up a sign.\n\nNow, looking back at the scenario, Tyler and his wife have been won over by the advertising campaign. That suggests that the campaign has successfully convinced them to support Stan Johnson. By putting up a sign in their front yard, they're not just identifying him as a candidate; they're actively showing their support.\n\nSo, they're participating in the campaign by displaying the sign. That sounds a lot like participation.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I were to map these terms to the steps of an advertising campaign, what order would they typically follow?\n\nProbably, first, people need to identify the candidate\u2014know who Stan Johnson is. Then, the campaign would work to establish his legitimacy\u2014why he's a good choice. Next, penetration would involve spreading that message widely, so more people know and accept it. Finally, participation would be getting people to actively support the campaign, whether by voting, donating, volunteering, or in this case, putting up a sign.\n\nSo, in that sequence, participation seems like the latter stage, after people have been convinced of the identification, legitimacy, and penetration.\n\nGiven that, it seems that participation is the most fitting answer here, because Tyler and his wife are actively engaging with the campaign by putting up a sign.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options could also apply.\n\nIdentification: While the sign does identify Stan Johnson as a candidate, that's more about recognizing him, not about Tyler and his wife's active support.\n\nLegitimacy: The campaign might be establishing his legitimacy, but putting up a sign is an act of support, not necessarily about validating his credentials.\n\nPenetration: This seems more about the reach of the campaign, how many people are aware of it, not specifically about individual actions like putting up a sign.\n\nTherefore, participation seems to be the best fit.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up the definition of each term in the context of advertising campaigns to be absolutely sure.\n\nStarting with identification: in marketing and advertising, identification often refers to brand recognition or the ability of consumers to recognize and recall the brand. In this political context, it would be similar\u2014recognizing Stan Johnson as a candidate.\n\nLegitimacy: This would involve establishing the candidate's credibility, trustworthiness, and suitability for the position. It's about building trust and confidence in the candidate's ability to lead.\n\nPenetration: Market penetration refers to how widely a product or message is adopted within a market. In advertising terms, it's about reaching as many people as possible and having a significant impact on their awareness and perceptions.\n\nParticipation: This is about active engagement from the audience. It involves taking actions that support the campaign, such as signing petitions, attending events, donating money, volunteering, or in this case, displaying a sign in one's front yard.\n\nGiven these definitions, Tyler and his wife putting up a sign is clearly an act of participation in the campaign.\n\nTo further solidify this, let's consider the progression of involvement:\n\n1. Awareness: Hearing about Stan Johnson for the first time.\n\n2. Interest: Learning more about his platform and policies.\n\n3. Evaluation: Considering whether he is a good choice.\n\n4. Decision: Deciding to support him.\n\n5. Action: Taking steps to show that support, such as putting up a sign.\n\nSo, putting up the sign is the action stage, which aligns with participation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. participation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if there's any possibility that another option could also be correct.\n\nFor example, could putting up a sign be considered a form of identification? Well, yes, the sign identifies the house as supporting Stan Johnson, but that's more of an outcome of their participation. It's not the primary act itself.\n\nSimilarly, legitimacy might be established through the campaign, but putting up a sign is not directly about establishing his legitimacy; it's about showing personal support.\n\nPenetration is about the campaign's reach and impact on the broader audience, not about individual actions.\n\nHence, participation remains the most appropriate choice.\n\nIn conclusion, Tyler and his wife are engaging in participation, which is the third step of the advertising campaign.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
