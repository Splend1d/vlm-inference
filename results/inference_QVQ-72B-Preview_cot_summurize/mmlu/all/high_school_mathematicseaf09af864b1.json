Find the sum of the digits of \\( n \\).\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. I know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nLet me list out the 3-digit numbers and find the primes starting from the smallest.\n\nStarting from 100:\n\n100 is not prime because it's divisible by 2, 4, 5, etc.\n\n101: Let's check if it's prime. The square root of 101 is approximately 10.049, so I need to check divisibility by primes less than or equal to 10, which are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n- 101 \u00f7 2 = 50.5, not an integer.\n\n- 101 \u00f7 3 \u2248 33.666, not an integer.\n\n- 101 \u00f7 5 = 20.2, not an integer.\n\n- 101 \u00f7 7 \u2248 14.428, not an integer.\n\nSo, 101 is prime.\n\nNext is 102: Divisible by 2.\n\n103: Check for primality.\n\n- 103 \u00f7 2 = 51.5, not an integer.\n\n- 103 \u00f7 3 \u2248 34.333, not an integer.\n\n- 103 \u00f7 5 = 20.6, not an integer.\n\n- 103 \u00f7 7 \u2248 14.714, not an integer.\n\nSo, 103 is prime.\n\nTherefore, the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers are 101 and 103.\n\nNow, I need to find the product \\( n = 101 \\times 103 \\).\n\nTo calculate this, I can use the distributive property:\n\n\\( n = 101 \\times 103 = 101 \\times (100 + 3) = 101 \\times 100 + 101 \\times 3 \\).\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n- 101 \u00d7 100 = 10,100\n\n- 101 \u00d7 3 = 303\n\nNow, add them together: 10,100 + 303 = 10,403.\n\nSo, \\( n = 10,403 \\).\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the digits of 10,403.\n\nThe number is 10,403, which has digits 1, 0, 4, 0, and 3.\n\nSum of these digits: 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) is 8.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 6\n\nD. 9\n\nSo, the correct answer is Option A. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
