                    "text": "So I have this question about the calcium atom, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that a calcium atom contains 20 protons and neutrons. Hmm, I remember that in atoms, the number of protons determines the element. Calcium has an atomic number of 20, which means it has 20 protons. But what about the neutrons? The number of neutrons can vary because atoms can have different isotopes, which are versions of the element with different numbers of neutrons. So, not all calcium atoms will have exactly 20 neutrons. Maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption B states that a calcium atom contains 20 protons and 20 electrons. I know that in neutral atoms, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons because the atom has no overall charge. Since calcium has 20 protons, it should have 20 electrons to balance out the charge. This seems right, but let's check the other options.\n\nOption C claims that a calcium atom contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons. From what I recall, the number of protons and electrons in a neutral atom is equal, which is 20 for calcium. But the number of neutrons can vary depending on the isotope. So, saying it has exactly 20 neutrons might not be accurate because there could be different isotopes with different neutron counts.\n\nOption D says that all atoms of calcium have a mass of 40.078 u. The atomic mass of calcium is indeed approximately 40.078 atomic mass units (u), but this is an average mass taken over all the isotopes of calcium found in nature. Individual isotopes can have different masses because they have different numbers of neutrons. So, not all calcium atoms have exactly the same mass.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems to be the most accurate statement about a calcium atom: it contains 20 protons and 20 electrons. The number of neutrons can vary, so options A and C are too specific about the number of neutrons. Option D is incorrect because atomic mass is an average, not a fixed value for every atom.\n\nI think the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
