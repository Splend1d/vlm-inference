                    "text": "So I have this question about what happens when the corpus callosum is cut in a right-handed patient. The options are:\n\nA. cannot carry out well-learned motor tasks with the left hand\n\nB. cannot name objects placed in the right hand if the patient can see them\n\nC. cannot name objects placed in the left hand if the patient cannot see them\n\nD. shows a decline in verbal intelligence\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what the corpus callosum does. The corpus callosum is a bundle of neural fibers that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain, allowing them to communicate and share information.\n\nNow, if it's cut, that communication is severed, which can lead to some interesting and sometimes problematic effects, especially in how the two hemispheres process information independently.\n\nI should also remember that in right-handed people, the left hemisphere is typically dominant for language and motor functions.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: cannot carry out well-learned motor tasks with the left hand.\n\nHmm, the left hand is controlled by the right hemisphere. Since the corpus callosum is cut, the left hemisphere might have trouble communicating with the right hemisphere to perform complex tasks that usually require coordination between both hemispheres. But for well-learned motor tasks, I think the right hemisphere can still handle those on its own, at least to some extent. Maybe not as efficiently, but completely losing the ability seems extreme. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption B: cannot name objects placed in the right hand if the patient can see them.\n\nThe right hand is controlled by the left hemisphere, which is dominant for language in right-handed people. So, if the patient can see the object, the visual information goes to both hemispheres, but since the corpus callosum is cut, the right hemisphere can't send that information to the left hemisphere for naming. Wait, but if the patient can see it, why can't the left hemisphere name it directly? Maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps because the object is in the right hand, and the left hemisphere is processing the visual information, but I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption C: cannot name objects placed in the left hand if the patient cannot see them.\n\nThe left hand is controlled by the right hemisphere, which is not typically dominant for language in right-handed people. So, if the patient cannot see the object, the information has to be processed by the right hemisphere and then communicated to the left hemisphere for naming. But since the corpus callosum is cut, that communication is blocked. This seems plausible. The patient might be able to feel the object but not be able to name it because the language centers in the left hemisphere aren't getting the information.\n\nOption D: shows a decline in verbal intelligence.\n\nThis seems a bit too broad. Cutting the corpus callosum might affect certain cognitive functions, but a general decline in verbal intelligence seems unlikely. Verbal intelligence is largely handled by the left hemisphere, and unless that hemisphere is directly damaged, I don't think there would be a significant decline in verbal intelligence just from severing the corpus callosum.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, option C seems the most straightforward. If the patient can't see the object and it's placed in their left hand, which is controlled by the right hemisphere, and the corpus callosum is cut, the information can't be sent to the left hemisphere for naming. So, they might not be able to name it.\n\nLet me double-check this. In split-brain patients, where the corpus callosum is severed, one of the classic findings is that when an object is placed in the left hand (right hemisphere), and the patient can't see it, they often can't name it because the right hemisphere doesn't have language capabilities, and the left hemisphere isn't getting the information due to the severed connection.\n\nIn contrast, if the object is in the right hand and the patient can see it, the visual information goes to both hemispheres, but since the left hemisphere is dominant for language, it should be able to name it, even if the right hand is involved.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the most accurate based on this reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. cannot name objects placed in the left hand if the patient cannot see them.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
