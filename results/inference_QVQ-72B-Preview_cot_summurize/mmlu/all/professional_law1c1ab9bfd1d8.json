So, the situation is about a police search and the subsequent seizure of heroin, leading to an arrest and a motion to suppress the evidence. The question is whether the motion should be granted or denied based on the circumstances of the search.\n\nFirst, let's understand the sequence of events:\n\n1. Police are conducting a house-to-house search for an escaped convict.\n\n2. An officer rings the doorbell of a house and a teenage male opens the door.\n\n3. The officer informs the teenager about the escaped convict and asks if he has seen anyone suspicious.\n\n4. The teenager says no but invites the officer inside to ensure the house is safe.\n\n5. The officer enters the home and looks around.\n\n6. In the kitchen, the officer notices a bag containing white powder, suspected to be narcotics.\n\n7. The officer questions the teenager about the contents, and the teenager claims he doesn't live there and has never seen the bag before.\n\n8. The officer confiscates the bag and takes the teenager to the station.\n\n9. It's discovered that the teenager escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the house earlier that day.\n\n10. A lab test confirms the bag contains heroin.\n\n11. An arrest warrant is issued for the homeowner, who is charged with possession of heroin.\n\n12. The homeowner's attorney files a motion to suppress the heroin as unlawfully obtained.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA. Granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.\n\nB. Granted, because the teenager did not have an ownership or shared occupancy interest in the premises.\n\nC. Denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling.\n\nD. Denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling and reasonably believed that the teenager was competent to give consent.\n\nThe central issue here is the legality of the search that led to the discovery of the heroin. The homeowner's attorney is arguing that the heroin was unlawfully obtained, implying that the search violated the homeowner's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nLet's consider the consent to search aspect. Generally, police can conduct a search without a warrant if they have consent from someone who has the authority to consent to the search of the premises. This is known as the \"consent exception\" to the warrant requirement.\n\nIn this case, the teenager invited the officer inside, which could be considered consent to enter the house. However, the question is whether the teenager had the authority to consent to the search.\n\nOption A suggests that the motion should be granted because the teenager didn't have the authority to consent to the search of the house. Option B similarly argues that the teenager didn't have an ownership or shared occupancy interest in the premises.\n\nOn the other hand, options C and D suggest that the motion should be denied because the officer reasonably believed he had permission to enter the dwelling, with option D adding that the officer reasonably believed the teenager was competent to give consent.\n\nHere, it's crucial to determine the teenager's authority to consent to the search. The teenager was not the homeowner and had broken into the house earlier that day. Therefore, he lacked actual authority to consent to the search since he wasn't the owner or someone with a legitimate interest in the premises.\n\nHowever, there's a doctrine called \"apparent authority\" that allows police to rely on a person's representation of authority to consent to a search, provided that the police officer's reliance on that representation is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nIn this scenario, the officer arrived at the house and a teenager opened the door. The teenager appeared to be occupying the house at that moment, as he was inside and answered the door. He then invited the officer inside, which could be seen as consenting to the search.\n\nThe officer had no reason to suspect that the teenager didn't have the authority to consent to the search. The teenager's behavior seemed normal and cooperative. The officer didn't know that the teenager had broken into the house.\n\nTherefore, the officer's belief that he had permission to enter the dwelling was reasonable, and he could have reasonably believed that the teenager had the authority to consent to the search based on the teenager's actions and representations.\n\nGiven this, options C and D seem relevant. However, option D adds that the officer reasonably believed the teenager was competent to give consent. Considering that the teenager was a minor, his competence to consent might be in question.\n\nIn general, minors can consent to searches, but there might be age limits or specific circumstances that affect their ability to consent. However, without specific information about the teenager's age or mental capacity, it's challenging to assess competence fully.\n\nGiven that the teenager was described as a \"teenage male,\" and assuming he was old enough to be living independently or at least capable of consenting, the officer might have reasonably believed he was competent.\n\nMoreover, the teenager's invitation to enter the house to ensure safety suggests a level of maturity and understanding of the situation.\n\nBut considering that the teenager had broken into the house and was likely not of lawful age to consent to a search of someone else's property, his consent might be invalid.\n\nHowever, if the officer had no knowledge of the teenager's lack of authority or competence and reasonably believed otherwise, the consent might still be valid under the apparent authority doctrine.\n\nIn United States v. Matlock (1974), the Supreme Court held that third parties can consent to searches if they possess common authority over the premises or effects to be searched. Common authority can be actual or apparent.\n\nIn Illinois v. Rodriguez (1990), the Court further clarified that apparent authority exists when the circumstances would lead a reasonable police officer to believe that the consenting individual has the authority to consent.\n\nIn this case, the officer arrived at the house, and a person who appeared to be a resident opened the door and invited him in. The officer had no reason to suspect that the teenager lacked authority to consent to the search.\n\nTherefore, the officer's belief that he had permission to enter the dwelling was reasonable, and the search might be considered lawful under the consent exception.\n\nHowever, there's another layer to consider. Even if the search was lawful up to that point, the discovery of the heroin in the kitchen might still be challenged.\n\nBut since the search itself was consented to, and the heroin was found during that lawful search, the evidence should be admissible.\n\nTherefore, the motion to suppress should be denied.\n\nOption D seems the most comprehensive, as it covers both the officer's reasonable belief in having permission to enter and the reasonable belief in the teenager's competence to give consent.\n\nOption C only mentions the officer's belief in having permission to enter but doesn't explicitly address the teenager's competence.\n\nGiven that, option D is the best choice.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other potential issues.\n\nFor example, was the search scope limited to ensuring safety, as the teenager invited the officer in for that purpose? If the officer exceeded the scope of the consent by searching areas not related to ensuring safety, that could be a problem.\n\nHowever, the officer went into the kitchen and found the bag there. If the kitchen is a common area of the house, it might be within the scope of the consent to search.\n\nAlternatively, if the officer had probable cause to believe that the house was unsafe or that evidence of a crime was present, he might have had justification to search further.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to assess the scope of the search.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the officer had probable cause to arrest the teenager or seize the bag.\n\nGiven that the teenager claimed he didn't live there and had never seen the bag before, and considering that he had broken into the house, the officer had probable cause to believe that the teenager was involved in criminal activity.\n\nAs for the bag, if the officer reasonably suspected it contained narcotics based on his training and experience, he had probable cause to seize it.\n\nSubsequently, the lab test confirmed it was heroin, leading to the arrest warrant for the homeowner.\n\nBut again, the central issue is the initial search and the consent provided by the teenager.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that the motion to suppress should be denied because the officer reasonably believed he had permission to enter the dwelling and reasonably believed that the teenager was competent to give consent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
