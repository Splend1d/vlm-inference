                    "text": "So I have this subtraction problem: 800 minus 301. I need to find the exact answer, and there are multiple choices given. Let me see, option A is 599, B is 500, C is 499, and D is 401. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is correct.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. It's straightforward: subtract 301 from 800. But let me think about how subtraction works. Subtraction is like taking away one number from another. So, starting with 800 and taking away 301 should give me the difference between these two numbers.\n\nLet me consider the numbers in terms of place value. 800 is 8 hundreds, and 301 is 3 hundreds and 1 one. So, when I subtract 301 from 800, I can think of it as subtracting 3 hundreds from 8 hundreds and 1 one from 0 ones. But wait, I can't subtract 1 from 0 in the ones place directly.\n\nMaybe I should borrow from the hundreds place. Let me visualize this. In 800, the hundreds digit is 8, the tens digit is 0, and the ones digit is 0. In 301, the hundreds digit is 3, the tens digit is 0, and the ones digit is 1.\n\nSo, writing it vertically:\n\n```\n\n  8 0 0\n\n- 3 0 1\n\n```\n\nNow, in the ones place: 0 - 1. I can't do that without borrowing. So, I'll borrow 1 from the tens place, which becomes 9 (since the tens place is 0, I need to borrow from the hundreds place instead.\n\nWait, maybe I need to borrow from the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 8, so if I borrow 1 from there, it becomes 7, and the tens place becomes 10. Now, in the tens place: 10 - 0 = 10, and in the ones place: 0 - 1. Still can't do that.\n\nMaybe I need to borrow again. Let's try borrowing from the tens place again. The tens place is now 10, so if I borrow 1 from there, it becomes 9, and the ones place becomes 10. Now, in the ones place: 10 - 1 = 9.\n\nMoving to the tens place: 9 - 0 = 9.\n\nWait, but the hundreds place was 7, and the tens place is now 9, and the ones place is 9. So, the result would be 799. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I messed up the borrowing.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can think of it as adding up to 800 from 301 and see what the difference is.\n\nSo, 301 to 400 is 99 (because 301 + 99 = 400). Then from 400 to 800 is another 400. So, total difference is 99 + 400 = 499. Oh, that's one of the options: C. 499.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 800 minus 300 is 500, and then subtract the extra 1, which would be 500 - 1 = 499.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, both methods give me 499 as the answer.\n\nBut let me check the other options to make sure. Option A is 599, which is 800 - 201, but that's not the case here. Option B is 500, which would be 800 - 300, but that doesn't account for the extra 1. Option D is 401, which might be a mistake, as 800 - 400 = 400, and adding 1 would be 401, but that doesn't align with the subtraction problem.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 499.\n\nJust to double-check, I can add 301 to 499 to see if I get 800. 300 + 500 = 800, but since it's 301 and 499, let's verify: 300 + 500 = 800, and 1 less in 301 means 1 more in 499, so yes, 301 + 499 = 800. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the exact answer is 499.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
