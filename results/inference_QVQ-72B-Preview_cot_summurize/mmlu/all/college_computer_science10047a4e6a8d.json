                    "text": "So I have this question here about sorting algorithms and their running times. It asks which of the following sorting algorithms has average-case and worst-case running times of O(n log n): Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, or Quicksort.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what each of these algorithms does and what their time complexities are, especially in the average and worst-case scenarios.\n\nLet's start with Bubble sort. I remember that Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It's pretty straightforward, but I think it's not very efficient for large datasets. I believe its worst-case and average time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. So, if that's the case, Bubble sort wouldn't be the answer here.\n\nNext is Insertion sort. This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It's similar to how you might sort playing cards in your hands. It's also efficient for small data sets, but for larger ones, it's not the best. I think its average and worst-case time complexity is also O(n^2). So, similar to Bubble sort, it doesn't meet the criteria of O(n log n) for average and worst-case.\n\nNow, Merge sort. I recall that Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This algorithm is more efficient than the previous two, and I think its worst-case and average time complexity is O(n log n). That seems to match what the question is asking.\n\nLastly, Quicksort. Quicksort is another divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. Quicksort is known for its average-case time complexity of O(n log n), but I think its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), especially if the pivot is poorly chosen, like always picking the smallest or largest element.\n\nWait a minute, the question specifies that both the average-case and worst-case running times should be O(n log n). So, for Quicksort, while the average-case is O(n log n), the worst-case is O(n^2). Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria of having both average and worst-case as O(n log n).\n\nHmm, but I've heard of randomized Quicksort, which can have an expected O(n log n) time complexity, but even then, the worst-case can still be O(n^2), just that it's less likely to occur.\n\nSo, based on this, Merge sort seems to be the only option among the given algorithms that has both average-case and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. For Bubble sort and Insertion sort, their time complexities are O(n^2) in both average and worst-case scenarios. Quicksort has an average-case of O(n log n) but a worst-case of O(n^2). Merge sort, on the other hand, consistently performs at O(n log n) in both average and worst-case scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Merge sort.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any variations or optimizations of these algorithms that might change their time complexities. For example, I've heard that in some optimized versions of Quicksort, measures are taken to ensure better pivot selection, like using the median of three elements, which can improve the average performance, but the theoretical worst-case remains O(n^2).\n\nSimilarly, for Merge sort, there aren't many variations in time complexity because its divide-and-conquer approach is quite consistent.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that Merge sort is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Merge sort}} \\]"
