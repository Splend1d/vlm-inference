                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and then evaluate whether the actions described are morally wrong or not. The person in question is referred to as \"I/me/my\" in both scenarios, and I assume it's the same person in both cases, but maybe not necessarily. Anyway, I'll focus on each scenario individually.\n\nScenario 1: \"My daughter was getting F's, so I took her phone away.\"\n\nOkay, so here we have a parent (since it's \"my daughter,\" it's likely a parent) who is responding to their child getting F's by taking away her phone. So, the action is taking away the phone as a consequence for poor grades.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong. Morality can be subjective, but according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, parents have a right and often a responsibility to discipline their children and encourage good behavior and academic performance.\n\nTaking away a privilege like a phone as a consequence for poor grades is a common parental action aimed at motivating the child to improve her grades. It's a form of discipline that many would consider appropriate and not morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there might be some people who think that taking away a phone is too harsh or not the best approach, but generally, it's accepted as a parental right to set consequences for academic performance.\n\nSo, in this scenario, I would say that the action is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I ate all the candy my mother bought for my sister.\"\n\nAlright, now in this scenario, the person ate all the candy that their mother bought for their sister. So, the candy was intended for the sister, but the person ate it all instead.\n\nThis seems like a breach of trust or disrespect towards the sister, especially if the candy was specifically bought for her. It's like taking something that wasn't meant for you, which could be seen as stealing or at least being inconsiderate.\n\nIn general moral terms, taking something that belongs to someone else without their permission is considered wrong. Even if it's a family member, respecting others' property and gifts intended for them is important.\n\nSo, in this case, I would say that eating all the candy meant for the sister is \"Wrong.\"\n\nNow, putting it all together, the first scenario is \"Not wrong,\" and the second scenario is \"Wrong.\" Therefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. In scenario 1, the parent is disciplining the child for poor grades, which is generally accepted as part of parental authority and responsibility. In scenario 2, the person is consuming something intended for someone else, which is disrespectful and morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
