                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: If \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are odd integers, how many terms in the expansion of \\( (m+n)^6 \\) are odd? The options are 4, 2, 1, or 9.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall how to expand something like \\( (m+n)^6 \\). Oh right, it's a binomial expansion, and the general term is given by \\( \\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k \\), where \\( k \\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, the expansion should look like this:\n\n\\[\n(m+n)^6 = \\binom{6}{0} m^6 + \\binom{6}{1} m^5 n + \\binom{6}{2} m^4 n^2 + \\binom{6}{3} m^3 n^3 + \\binom{6}{4} m^2 n^4 + \\binom{6}{5} m n^5 + \\binom{6}{6} n^6\n\\]\n\nNow, the question is asking how many of these terms are odd. Since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are both odd integers, I need to figure out when each of these terms \\( \\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k \\) is odd.\n\nI know that a product of numbers is odd if and only if all the numbers in the product are odd. So, for each term, \\( \\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k \\) to be odd, both \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\) and \\( m^{6-k} n^k \\) need to be odd.\n\nWait, actually, since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are odd, \\( m^{6-k} \\) and \\( n^k \\) are also odd because any power of an odd number is still odd. So, the only thing that can make the term even is if \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, the number of odd terms in the expansion depends on whether \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\) is odd or even for each \\( k \\) from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, I need to determine for which values of \\( k \\), \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\) is odd.\n\nI remember that \\( \\binom{6}{k} \\) represents the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) items from 6, and in the binomial expansion, these are the coefficients.\n\nLet me list out the binomial coefficients for \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{0} = 1, \\quad \\binom{6}{1} = 6, \\quad \\binom{6}{2} = 15, \\quad \\binom{6}{3} = 20, \\quad \\binom{6}{4} = 15, \\quad \\binom{6}{5} = 6, \\quad \\binom{6}{6} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, let's check which of these are odd:\n\n\\[\n1 \\quad (odd), \\quad 6 \\quad (even), \\quad 15 \\quad (odd), \\quad 20 \\quad (even), \\quad 15 \\quad (odd), \\quad 6 \\quad (even), \\quad 1 \\quad (odd)\n\\]\n\nSo, the odd coefficients are for \\( k = 0, 2, 4, 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 4 terms in the expansion that are odd.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. 4 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, I confirmed that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) being odd means that any power of them remains odd. So, yes, the parity (odd/even) of each term depends solely on the binomial coefficient.\n\nThen, I listed out the binomial coefficients for \\( n = 6 \\) and checked their parity, counting the number of odd ones, which came out to be 4.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using properties of binomial coefficients or something related to Pascal's triangle.\n\nI recall that Pascal's triangle has some properties regarding odd and even coefficients. For example, in Pascal's triangle, the pattern of odd and even coefficients follows a fractal known as the Sierpinski triangle.\n\nBut for \\( n = 6 \\), which is relatively small, it's straightforward to just list out the coefficients and check their parity.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the binary representation or use Lucas' theorem to determine the parity of binomial coefficients, but that might be overkill for this problem since \\( n = 6 \\) is small.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct, and the answer should be 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
