                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a police car moving towards a wall, and the driver hears an echo of the siren. I need to find out the frequency that the driver hears from the echo, and it's supposed to be one of these options: 600 Hz, 606 Hz, 612 Hz, or 618 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on. There's a police car moving towards a wall at 3.5 m/s, and it's emitting a siren with a frequency of 600 Hz. The speed of sound is 350 m/s. The driver hears the original siren and also an echo from the wall. I need to find the frequency of that echo as heard by the driver.\n\nI remember that when a source of sound moves relative to a reflector like a wall, and then the echo is heard by someone moving relative to the wall, there are Doppler effect considerations for both the outgoing and incoming sounds.\n\nLet me recall the Doppler effect formula for sound. The formula for the frequency heard by a observer when the source is moving towards the observer is:\n\nf' = (v / (v - u)) * f\n\nWhere:\n\n- f' is the observed frequency\n\n- v is the speed of sound\n\n- u is the speed of the source (the police car)\n\n- f is the emitted frequency\n\nBut in this case, the wall is stationary, and the car is moving towards it. So, when the sound waves hit the wall, they reflect back with the same frequency they arrived with, but since the car is moving towards the wall, the frequency the wall receives is Doppler-shifted, and then the echo is Doppler-shifted again as it goes back to the car.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it in two steps:\n\n1. The frequency of the siren as heard by the wall.\n\n2. Then, the echo (which is the reflected sound) is heard by the driver, who is moving towards the wall.\n\nSo, first, find the frequency that the wall \"hears\" (receives), and then find the frequency that the driver hears from that reflected sound.\n\nLet's tackle the first part: the frequency heard by the wall.\n\nThe police car is moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s, and emitting a siren at 600 Hz. The wall is stationary, so it will hear a Doppler-shifted frequency.\n\nUsing the formula for when the source is moving towards the observer:\n\nf_wall = (v / (v - u)) * f\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf_wall = (350 / (350 - 3.5)) * 600\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nDenominator: 350 - 3.5 = 346.5 m/s\n\nSo, f_wall = (350 / 346.5) * 600\n\nFirst, 350 divided by 346.5.\n\nWell, 350 / 350 = 1, and 3.5 is half of 7, so 350 - 3.5 is like subtracting 1% (since 3.5 is approximately 1% of 350). So, 350 / 346.5 is roughly 1.000 / (1 - 0.01) = approximately 1.0101...\n\nSo, 1.0101 * 600 = 606 Hz\n\nSo, the wall receives a frequency of approximately 606 Hz.\n\nNow, the echo is the reflection of this sound from the wall. Since the wall is stationary, it should reflect the sound at the same frequency it received, which is 606 Hz.\n\nNow, this 606 Hz sound is moving back towards the police car, which is still moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s.\n\nSo, the driver is now hearing this 606 Hz sound coming from the wall, while moving towards it at 3.5 m/s.\n\nAgain, using the Doppler effect formula, but this time, the observer is moving towards the source.\n\nThe formula for when the observer is moving towards the source is:\n\nf' = [ (v + v_o) / v ] * f\n\nWhere:\n\n- f' is the observed frequency\n\n- v is the speed of sound\n\n- v_o is the speed of the observer (the police car)\n\n- f is the frequency of the source (the wall reflecting at 606 Hz)\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to be careful here. The wall is stationary, reflecting the sound, so the source (the wall) is stationary, and the observer (the police car) is moving towards it.\n\nSo, the general Doppler formula for source stationary and observer moving is:\n\nf' = f * (v + v_o) / v\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf' = 606 Hz * (350 + 3.5) / 350\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator: 350 + 3.5 = 353.5 m/s\n\nThen, 606 * 353.5 / 350\n\nFirst, 606 * 353.5:\n\n606 * 350 = 606 * 35 * 10 = 212100\n\n606 * 3.5 = 2121\n\nSo, total is 212100 + 2121 = 214221\n\nNow, divide by 350: 214221 / 350\n\nLet's see, 350 * 612 = 350 * 600 = 210000, plus 350 * 12 = 4200, total 214200.\n\nSo, 214221 - 214200 = 21, which is a small difference, so roughly 612 Hz.\n\nBut let's calculate it more precisely.\n\n214221 / 350 = 612.06 Hz\n\nSo, approximately 612 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to 612 Hz.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 612 Hz.\n\nWait, but let's double-check if there's any other effect I might have missed.\n\nIs there any other Doppler effect consideration here? For example, does the fact that the car is moving affect the frequency it emits? No, the problem states that the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, presumably in the car's frame, and we're dealing with the echo heard by the driver.\n\nAlso, is the wall moving? No, it's stationary.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the Doppler effect for both the outgoing and incoming paths.\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nFirst, the siren is emitted at 600 Hz from the car, moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s.\n\nThe wall is stationary, so the frequency it receives is:\n\nf_wall = f * (v / (v - u)) = 600 * (350 / (350 - 3.5)) = 600 * (350 / 346.5) \u2248 606 Hz, as I calculated before.\n\nNow, the wall reflects this at 606 Hz, being stationary.\n\nThe driver is moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s, so the frequency he hears from the reflection is:\n\nf_driver = f_reflection * (v + u) / v = 606 * (350 + 3.5) / 350 = 606 * 353.5 / 350 \u2248 612.06 Hz\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, it confirms that the answer is C. 612 Hz.\n\nAlright, I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 612\\ \\text{Hz}} \\]"
