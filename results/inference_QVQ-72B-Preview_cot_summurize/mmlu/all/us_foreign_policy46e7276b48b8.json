Let's see...\n\nFirst, I know that the UN Security Council is one of the main organs of the United Nations, and it's responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It's composed of member states that have seats on the council.\n\nOption A says there are 5 permanent members with veto power and 10 rotating members without veto power. That sounds familiar. I think the permanent members are the big five: the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France. They each have the right to veto any substantive resolution, which means they can block a decision even if the majority agrees.\n\nThen, there are rotating members. I believe there are 10 of them, and they are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. These members don't have veto power. So, they can propose and vote on resolutions, but they can't veto them like the permanent members can.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check that. Is it exactly 10 rotating members? I think it might be 10, but let me recall. The total membership of the Security Council is 15, consisting of 5 permanent members and 10 non-permanent members. Yeah, that adds up to 15.\n\nOption B says there are 5 permanent members and 10 rotating members, all with veto power. That can't be right because if everyone has veto power, then it would be very difficult to pass any resolutions. The whole point of having permanent members with veto power is to give those five countries a special status, likely due to their historical roles and current influence.\n\nOption C suggests there are 10 permanent members with veto power and 5 rotating members without veto power. That seems opposite to what I know. I think it's 5 permanent members and 10 rotating members, not the other way around.\n\nOption D says there are 15 permanent members, all with veto power. That doesn't sound right either because again, only the five big countries have veto power.\n\nSo, based on what I know, option A seems correct: 5 permanent members with veto power and 10 rotating members without veto power. Let me just confirm this.\n\nI remember that the Security Council has 15 members in total: 5 permanent and 10 non-permanent. The permanent members are the United States, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), China, the United Kingdom, and France. These five have the veto power, which allows them to block any substantive resolution.\n\nThe 10 non-permanent members are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms, and they represent different regions of the world to ensure geographical diversity. These members don't have veto power.\n\nSo, yeah, option A seems to be the accurate description of the UN Security Council's structure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
