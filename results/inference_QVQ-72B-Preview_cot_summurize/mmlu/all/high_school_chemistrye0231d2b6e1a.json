                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to prepare a solution by dissolving 30.0 grams of Ni(NO3)2 in enough water to make 250 mL of solution, and I need to find out what the molarity of this solution is. The options are A. 0.496 molar, B. 0.656 mol/L, C. 3.3 molar, and D. 6.3 \u00d7 10^-3 molar.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what molarity means. Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. So, M = moles of solute / liters of solution.\n\nI have 30.0 grams of Ni(NO3)2, and I need to find out how many moles that is. To do that, I need to know the molar mass of Ni(NO3)2. I remember that nickel (Ni) has an atomic mass of approximately 58.7 grams per mole, nitrogen (N) is about 14 grams per mole, and oxygen (O) is about 16 grams per mole.\n\nNi(NO3)2 consists of one nickel ion and two nitrate ions. So, its molar mass would be:\n\nMolar mass of Ni(NO3)2 = atomic mass of Ni + 2 \u00d7 (atomic mass of N + 3 \u00d7 atomic mass of O)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n= 58.7 g/mol + 2 \u00d7 (14 g/mol + 3 \u00d7 16 g/mol)\n\n= 58.7 g/mol + 2 \u00d7 (14 + 48) g/mol\n\n= 58.7 g/mol + 2 \u00d7 62 g/mol\n\n= 58.7 g/mol + 124 g/mol\n\n= 182.7 g/mol\n\nSo, Ni(NO3)2 has a molar mass of approximately 182.7 grams per mole.\n\nNow, I have 30.0 grams of Ni(NO3)2. To find the number of moles, I divide the mass by the molar mass:\n\nMoles of Ni(NO3)2 = mass / molar mass = 30.0 g / 182.7 g/mol\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n= 30.0 \u00f7 182.7 \u2248 0.164 mol\n\nSo, there are approximately 0.164 moles of Ni(NO3)2 in 30.0 grams.\n\nNext, the solution volume is 250 mL. But molarity is expressed in moles per liter, so I need to convert 250 mL to liters.\n\n250 mL = 250 \u00d7 10^-3 L = 0.250 L\n\nNow, molarity M = moles of solute / liters of solution = 0.164 mol / 0.250 L\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n= 0.164 \u00f7 0.250 \u2248 0.656 M\n\nSo, the molarity of the solution is approximately 0.656 mol/L.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.496 molar\n\nB. 0.656 mol/L\n\nC. 3.3 molar\n\nD. 6.3 \u00d7 10^-3 molar\n\nMy calculation gives me approximately 0.656 M, which matches option B.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, molar mass of Ni(NO3)2:\n\nNi: 58.7 g/mol\n\nN: 14 g/mol\n\nO: 16 g/mol\n\nSo, Ni(NO3)2 = 58.7 + 2*(14 + 3*16) = 58.7 + 2*62 = 58.7 + 124 = 182.7 g/mol. That seems correct.\n\nThen, moles = 30.0 g / 182.7 g/mol \u2248 0.164 mol. That looks right.\n\nVolume = 250 mL = 0.250 L. Correct.\n\nMolarity = 0.164 mol / 0.250 L = 0.656 M. Matches option B.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the molarity could be different if the compound dissociates in solution? Ni(NO3)2 is an ionic compound and will dissociate into Ni\u00b2\u207a and 2 NO3\u207b ions in solution. However, molarity is defined based on the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, not the number of moles of ions. So, even though it dissociates into ions, the molarity is still based on the number of moles of the compound dissolved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 0.656 mol/L.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the molar mass more precisely. Let's use more decimal places for the atomic masses.\n\nNickel: 58.69 g/mol\n\nNitrogen: 14.01 g/mol\n\nOxygen: 16.00 g/mol\n\nMolar mass of Ni(NO3)2:\n\n= 58.69 + 2*(14.01 + 3*16.00)\n\n= 58.69 + 2*(14.01 + 48.00)\n\n= 58.69 + 2*62.01\n\n= 58.69 + 124.02\n\n= 182.71 g/mol\n\nNow, moles = 30.0 g / 182.71 g/mol \u2248 0.164 mol\n\nMolarity = 0.164 mol / 0.250 L = 0.656 M\n\nStill getting 0.656 M, which reinforces that option B is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to consider anything else.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 0.656\\ \\text{mol/L}} \\]"
