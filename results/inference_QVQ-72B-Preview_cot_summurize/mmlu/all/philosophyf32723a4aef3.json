                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Hare's views on escaping moral arguments. The options are:\n\nA. none of them are successful.\n\nB. some, but not all of them are successful.\n\nC. all are entirely successful.\n\nD. all might be successful, but at a price.\n\nI need to figure out which one correctly represents Hare's position on the ways of escaping moral arguments that he discusses.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what Hare is talking about when he mentions \"escaping moral arguments.\" I think he's referring to different strategies or approaches that people might use to avoid engaging in moral debates or to sidestep moral issues. Maybe these are ways to avoid taking a stance on a moral question or to find loopholes in moral reasoning.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Hare says about these strategies. Is he evaluating them? Does he think any of them are effective or successful in escaping moral arguments?\n\nOption A says none of them are successful. That would mean that according to Hare, all attempts to escape moral arguments fail. But I'm not sure if that's his view. Maybe some strategies are more successful than others.\n\nOption B suggests that some strategies are successful, but not all. This seems plausible. Perhaps there are some ways to legitimately avoid moral arguments in certain situations, but not in others.\n\nOption C says that all the discussed ways are entirely successful. That seems too strong. It's hard to imagine that every possible way of escaping moral arguments would work perfectly every time.\n\nOption D proposes that all might be successful, but at a price. This implies that while these strategies can work, there are costs or drawbacks associated with them. Maybe they involve sacrificing some other values or principles.\n\nI need to think about which of these options aligns with Hare's discussion. If I recall correctly, Hare was a proponent of moral universalism, meaning that he believed in objective moral truths that apply to all people. Given that, he might be critical of strategies that try to escape moral arguments because they might undermine the idea of universal moral principles.\n\nHowever, I also remember that Hare was involved in the development of prescriptive moral theories, particularly in the context of moral language and the imperative theory of ethics. He might have discussed various ways of handling moral disagreements, including escaping them, but I'm not entirely sure about his stance on the success of these strategies.\n\nLet me consider an example to see which option makes the most sense. Suppose someone uses a strategy like relativism to escape a moral argument. Relativism holds that moral truths are relative to cultural or individual perspectives. So, if someone says, \"Stealing is wrong,\" and another person responds, \"Well, in my culture, it's acceptable,\" they might be trying to escape the moral argument by appealing to relativism.\n\nAccording to Hare, who believed in universal moral principles, this strategy might not be successful because it contradicts the idea of objective moral truths. So, in this case, Hare would probably not consider relativism a successful way to escape a moral argument.\n\nAnother strategy might be to claim that moral statements are purely subjective and express personal preferences rather than objective facts. This is similar to emotivism, which Hare critiqued. If someone says, \"Killing is wrong,\" and another person responds, \"I don't feel that way,\" they might be trying to escape the moral argument by reducing it to a difference in feelings.\n\nAgain, Hare would likely view this as an unsuccessful escape because he believed that moral statements can be true or false and are not just expressions of emotion or preference.\n\nPerhaps there are strategies that Hare might consider somewhat successful, but not entirely. For instance, acknowledging the complexity of moral issues and the need for careful consideration before making a judgment. This could be seen as a way to pause or redirect a moral argument rather than escape it entirely.\n\nHowever, I'm still not sure if Hare would consider this a successful escape or just a recognition of the difficulty in resolving moral disputes.\n\nOption D suggests that all strategies might be successful but at a price. Maybe the price is compromising one's integrity, consistency, or respect for others. This could be a possibility, but I need to think more about whether Hare discusses such trade-offs.\n\nI should also consider whether Hare discusses specific ways of escaping moral arguments and evaluates their success. If he does, I need to recall his conclusions about them.\n\nLet me try to think of another angle. Maybe Hare discusses different types of moral arguments and different ways to escape them, and provides assessments of each strategy's effectiveness.\n\nFor example, he might discuss:\n\n1. Denying the relevance of moral considerations.\n\n2. Claiming that the issue is not a moral one.\n\n3. Arguing that moral statements are meaningless.\n\n4. Appealing to moral uncertainty or doubt.\n\nIf Hare evaluates each of these and finds none of them to be successful, then option A would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if he thinks that some strategies can be effective in certain contexts but not others, then option B would be more accurate.\n\nIf he believes that all strategies are effective without any caveats, option C would be the right choice, but that seems unlikely.\n\nOption D suggests that all strategies might work, but with some costs or trade-offs. This could be a possibility if Hare thinks that escaping moral arguments always involves sacrificing something else, like intellectual honesty or moral consistency.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider whether Hare is likely to hold such a view.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider that Hare, being a moral universalist, would be skeptical of any strategy that tries to escape moral arguments entirely. He might see such attempts as evasions or ways to avoid facing difficult moral questions.\n\nOn the other hand, he might acknowledge that in some cases, it's reasonable to set aside moral arguments temporarily for practical purposes, but not as a way to permanently avoid them.\n\nGiven this, I'm leaning towards option A: none of them are successful. This seems consistent with Hare's commitment to universal moral principles and his emphasis on the importance of engaging in moral reasoning and argumentation.\n\nHowever, I should make sure that I'm not oversimplifying his position. Maybe he does see some value in certain strategies under specific circumstances.\n\nBut without more specific information about Hare's discussions on escaping moral arguments, it's challenging to be certain.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my understanding of Hare's moral philosophy, I would choose option A: none of them are successful.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
