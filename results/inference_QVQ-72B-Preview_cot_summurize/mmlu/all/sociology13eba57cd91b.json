                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which term best describes the practice of placing the blame for the problems of a society on one particular group. The options are ethnocentrism, stereotyping, scapegoating, and institutionalization. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, ethnocentrism. I remember that ethnocentrism is when someone thinks their own culture is superior to others and uses their own cultural norms as a standard to judge other cultures. So, it's more about judging other groups based on your own group's values and beliefs. I don't think it directly involves blaming a specific group for societal problems. Maybe it's not the best fit here.\n\nNext, stereotyping. Stereotyping is when people have fixed or oversimplified beliefs about a particular group, often applied regardless of individual characteristics. It's like putting everyone in a group into a box based on limited information. While stereotyping can lead to blaming a group for problems, it's more about the generalized beliefs about the group rather than specifically blaming them for societal issues. Maybe it's not the exact match for what's being described.\n\nThen there's scapegoating. Scapegoating is when a group blames another group for their problems, often unfairly, and directs their frustrations and negative emotions towards that group. It's like finding a convenient target to project blame onto instead of addressing the real causes of the problems. This seems pretty close to what the question is describing\u2014placing blame on one particular group for the issues in society.\n\nLastly, institutionalization. This term can refer to several things, but in a social context, it often relates to the embedding of certain practices or inequalities within social institutions, like the legal system or education. It's about how discrimination or unfair practices can become normalized within institutions. While it's related to how groups can be disadvantaged in society, it's not directly about blaming a group for societal problems.\n\nComparing all these options, scapegoating seems to be the most fitting term for placing the blame for societal problems on one particular group. It captures the act of directing blame towards a specific group, often unfairly, for the broader issues in society.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Ethnocentrism is more about viewing one's own culture as superior and judging others by that standard. Stereotyping is about holding generalized beliefs about groups. Institutionalization is about the embedding of practices in social institutions. None of these directly involve the act of blaming a specific group for societal problems in the way that scapegoating does.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Scapegoating.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
