                    "text": "So I have this question about the contiguous zone. It's asking what the function of the contiguous zone is, and there are four options. I need to pick the correct one. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the contiguous zone is. I think it's an area adjacent to a country's territorial sea, where the country can exercise certain controls. But what exactly are those controls?\n\nOption A says it's a security zone of the coastal state. Hmm, that sounds possible, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption B says it's a zone where the coastal state can explore and exploit mineral resources. Wait, I thought that was more related to the exclusive economic zone, not the contiguous zone. Maybe I'm confusing the two.\n\nOption C says it's a zone where the coastal state can prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws. That sounds familiar. I think that's related to the concept of the contiguous zone.\n\nOption D says it's a zone where the coastal state safeguards its archaeological and historical objects. That seems specific, and I don't recall that being the primary function of the contiguous zone.\n\nLet me think again. I remember that the contiguous zone is a band of water adjacent to a state's territorial sea, where the state can extend certain aspects of its sovereignty to prevent or punish certain offenses. So, option C seems to align with that.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider option A again. Is the contiguous zone a security zone? Well, in a way, it does provide additional security by allowing a state to enforce certain laws, but I don't think it's primarily a security zone in the military sense.\n\nOption B is probably incorrect because that's more the function of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), where a state has the right to explore and exploit natural resources.\n\nOption D seems unrelated to what I recall about the contiguous zone. Safeguarding archaeological and historical objects might be part of a state's cultural heritage policies, but not specifically the function of the contiguous zone.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think the correct answer is option C: the contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal state is permitted to prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll recall the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which defines the contiguous zone. According to UNCLOS, the contiguous zone is a zone adjacent to the territorial sea in which a coastal state may exercise certain prescribed controls. Specifically, it allows the coastal state to prevent and punish infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea.\n\nYes, that matches option C perfectly. So, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
