                    "text": "So I have this problem here about finding the rest mass of a particle given its total energy and momentum. The values are 5.0 GeV for the energy and 4.9 GeV/c for the momentum. I need to find the rest mass, and there are four options to choose from. I should probably use some relativity equations here since we're dealing with energy and momentum in particle physics.\n\nFirst, I recall that in special relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[E = \\gamma m c^2\\]\n\nwhere \\(E\\) is the total energy, \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, \\(m\\) is the rest mass, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is:\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\]\n\nand it relates to the particle's velocity \\(v\\).\n\nBut I also remember another equation that relates energy, momentum, and rest mass:\n\n\\[E^2 = (m c^2)^2 + (p c)^2\\]\n\nThis seems more directly useful because I know both \\(E\\) and \\(p\\), and I need to find \\(m\\).\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\n\\[(5.0 \\, \\text{GeV})^2 = (m c^2)^2 + (4.9 \\, \\text{GeV}/c)^2\\]\n\nLet me compute the squares:\n\n\\[25.00 \\, \\text{GeV}^2 = (m c^2)^2 + 24.01 \\, \\text{GeV}^2\\]\n\nNow, subtract \\(24.01 \\, \\text{GeV}^2\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[(m c^2)^2 = 25.00 - 24.01 = 0.99 \\, \\text{GeV}^2\\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[m c^2 = \\sqrt{0.99} \\, \\text{GeV}\\]\n\n\\[\\sqrt{0.99} \\approx 0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}\\]\n\nSo, \\(m c^2 \\approx 0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}\\).\n\nBut I need to find \\(m\\), and I know that \\(c^2\\) is approximately \\(9.0 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2\\), but in particle physics, we often use natural units where \\(c = 1\\), meaning that energy and mass are in the same units, GeV.\n\nSo, in these units, \\(m \\approx 0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}\\).\n\nBut looking back at the options, they are in units of \\(\\text{GeV}/c^2\\), which is the standard unit for mass in particle physics. So, I should probably convert my answer to \\(\\text{GeV}/c^2\\).\n\nWait a minute, in natural units where \\(c = 1\\), \\(m\\) is indeed in GeV, but sometimes mass is quoted in \\(\\text{GeV}/c^2\\) to emphasize the rest mass. In reality, since \\(c = 1\\), it's just GeV.\n\nBut to be precise, I should remember that \\(E = m c^2\\), and if I want to express \\(m\\) in terms of \\(\\text{GeV}/c^2\\), then \\(m = E / c^2\\).\n\nBut in my calculation, I used \\(E^2 = (m c^2)^2 + (p c)^2\\), and solved for \\(m c^2\\), which gives me energy equivalent of mass, but to get mass in \\(\\text{GeV}/c^2\\), I need to divide by \\(c^2\\).\n\nWait, no. Let's think carefully.\n\nActually, in the equation \\(E^2 = (m c^2)^2 + (p c)^2\\), when you solve for \\(m c^2\\), you get the energy equivalent of the rest mass, which is \\(m c^2\\). To find the rest mass \\(m\\), you need to divide by \\(c^2\\).\n\nSo, \\(m = \\frac{m c^2}{c^2}\\), which means \\(m = \\frac{0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}}{c^2}\\), giving units of \\(\\text{GeV}/c^2\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(m \\approx 0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.1 GeV/c^2\n\nB. 0.2 GeV/c^2\n\nC. 0.5 GeV/c^2\n\nD. 1.0 GeV/c^2\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 0.995 GeV/c^2, which is closest to option D. 1.0 GeV/c^2.\n\nBut wait, 0.995 is closer to 1.0 than to 0.5, so it should be option D.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any possibility of a miscalculation.\n\nLet me verify the steps again.\n\nStarting with \\(E^2 = (m c^2)^2 + (p c)^2\\), plugging in \\(E = 5.0 \\, \\text{GeV}\\) and \\(p = 4.9 \\, \\text{GeV}/c\\):\n\n\\[(5.0)^2 = (m c^2)^2 + (4.9)^2\\]\n\n\\[25.00 = (m c^2)^2 + 24.01\\]\n\nSubtracting 24.01:\n\n\\[(m c^2)^2 = 25.00 - 24.01 = 0.99\\]\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\\[m c^2 = \\sqrt{0.99} \\approx 0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}\\]\n\nThen, \\(m = \\frac{0.995}{c^2}\\), which in units of \\(\\text{GeV}/c^2\\), is \\(0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\\).\n\nSo, the closest option is D. 1.0 GeV/c^2.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the calculation gives 0.995, which is closer to 1.0 than to 0.5, but not exactly 1.0. Maybe there's a rounding error or something.\n\nLet me try recalculating \\(\\sqrt{0.99}\\).\n\n\\[\\sqrt{0.99} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.01}\\]\n\nI know that \\(\\sqrt{1 - x} \\approx 1 - \\frac{x}{2}\\) for small \\(x\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\sqrt{0.99} \\approx 1 - \\frac{0.01}{2} = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995\\), which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, \\(m c^2 \\approx 0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}\\), and \\(m \\approx 0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\\).\n\nSince the options are approximate, and 0.995 is effectively 1.0 when considering significant figures, the answer should be D. 1.0 GeV/c^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to confirm this.\n\nLet me consider the relativistic relation for energy and momentum:\n\n\\[E = \\sqrt{(m c^2)^2 + (p c)^2}\\]\n\nGiven \\(E = 5.0 \\, \\text{GeV}\\) and \\(p = 4.9 \\, \\text{GeV}/c\\), plugging into the equation:\n\n\\[5.0 = \\sqrt{(m c^2)^2 + (4.9 c)^2}\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[25.00 = (m c^2)^2 + 24.01 c^2\\]\n\nWait, this seems similar to what I did before, but perhaps I need to adjust the units.\n\nActually, in natural units where \\(c = 1\\), \\(E\\) is in GeV, \\(p\\) is in GeV/c, and \\(m\\) is in GeV/c^2.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[E = \\sqrt{(m c^2)^2 + (p c)^2}\\]\n\nBut with \\(c = 1\\), \\(m c^2 = m\\), since \\(c^2 = 1\\).\n\nThus:\n\n\\[5.0 = \\sqrt{m^2 + (4.9)^2}\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[25.00 = m^2 + 24.01\\]\n\nSubtracting 24.01:\n\n\\[m^2 = 0.99\\]\n\n\\[m = \\sqrt{0.99} \\approx 0.995 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\\]\n\nAgain, this confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the rest mass is approximately 0.995 GeV/c^2, which is closest to option D. 1.0 GeV/c^2.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. 1.0 GeV/c^2"
