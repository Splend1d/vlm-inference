                    "text": "Let's see which of these molecules can form hydrogen bonds. I know that hydrogen bonding occurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, like nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, and is then attracted to another highly electronegative atom in a nearby molecule. So, I need to look for molecules that have N-H, O-H, or F-H bonds.\n\nFirst, let's look at option A: CH3OCH2CH3. This is ethyl methyl ether. I can see that it has oxygen atoms, but the hydrogens are not directly bonded to oxygen. The structure is:\n\nCH3 - O - CH2 - CH3\n\nSo, the oxygen is bonded to carbon and hydrogen, but not directly to hydrogen in a way that could form a hydrogen bond. Maybe it could form weak interactions, but not proper hydrogen bonds. So, probably not.\n\nNext, option B: HCN. This is hydrogen cyanide. The structure is H - C \u2261 N. Here, the hydrogen is bonded to carbon, which isn't highly electronegative enough to form hydrogen bonds. Wait, but carbon is less electronegative than nitrogen, so the bond between carbon and nitrogen might have some polarity, but it's not as strong as N-H or O-H bonds. Moreover, hydrogen is not bonded to nitrogen directly. So, I don't think HCN can form hydrogen bonds.\n\nOption C: CH3OCH2Br. This seems like bromoethoxy methane or something similar. Let's break it down. CH3O- is methoxy group, and then CH2Br is bromomethyl. So, the structure is:\n\nCH3 - O - CH2 - Br\n\nAgain, oxygen is bonded to carbon and hydrogen, but no direct O-H bond is present. So, similar to option A, I don't think this can form hydrogen bonds.\n\nOption D: CH3NH2. This is methylamine, which is a derivative of ammonia (NH3). The structure is:\n\nH3C - NH2\n\nHere, the nitrogen is bonded to hydrogen atoms. So, we have N-H bonds. Nitrogen is highly electronegative and can form hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen attached to another nitrogen or oxygen. So, this seems like a good candidate for hydrogen bonding.\n\nLet me double-check. In methylamine, the N-H bonds can interact with the lone pairs on another nitrogen atom from a different methylamine molecule, forming hydrogen bonds. So, yes, this should be able to form hydrogen bonds.\n\nJust to make sure, let's recall the general criteria for hydrogen bonding:\n\n1. There must be a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (N, O, or F).\n\n2. This hydrogen must be able to interact with another highly electronegative atom in a nearby molecule.\n\nIn CH3NH2, the N-H bonds can interact with the lone pairs on the nitrogen of another CH3NH2 molecule, satisfying these criteria.\n\nSo, among the given options, D. CH3NH2 is the one that can form hydrogen bonds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
