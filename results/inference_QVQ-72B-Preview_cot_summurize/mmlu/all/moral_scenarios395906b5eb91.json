                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs, and it's asking which of two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\n1. One day I just left work and picked my kid up from school myself.\n\n2. At the dinner party, I served perfectly cooked chicken.\n\nAnd the question is, for which of these two scenarios does the main character do something clearly morally wrong?\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and determine if there's a moral wrong committed in either.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Leaving work and picking up the kid from school.\n\nWell, generally, picking up your own kid from school doesn't seem like a morally wrong action. It's a parental responsibility, and assuming the child expects to be picked up by the parent, it's fulfilling that responsibility. There doesn't seem to be anything inherently immoral about it.\n\nBut maybe there's some context missing. Maybe the parent usually relies on someone else to pick up the kid, and suddenly deciding to do it themselves could cause inconvenience to others who were planning to do it. But without that context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards in the US, picking up your own child from school is not considered wrong. Unless there's some specific reason why it would be wrong, like the child didn't want to be picked up or something, but again, without context, it's hard to judge.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Serving perfectly cooked chicken at a dinner party.\n\nAgain, serving food at a dinner party is a hospitable act. Cooking chicken perfectly suggests that effort was put into preparing the meal, and it was done well. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with that.\n\nPerhaps there's an implication that someone else was supposed to bring chicken, and the host served their own instead, causing some issue. But again, without context, it's speculative.\n\nIn general, serving food at a dinner party is not a morally wrong action. It's part of being a host and providing for your guests.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, neither scenario seems to involve a clearly morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, picking up one's own child from school is a parental duty and not generally considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, serving perfectly cooked chicken at a dinner party is a hospitable act and not generally considered wrong.\n\nUnless there's some specific context that makes these actions wrong, which isn't provided in the question, it seems that both actions are morally acceptable.\n\nSo, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
