                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about two mercury barometers, one with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm\u00b2 and the other with 2 cm\u00b2. I need to figure out what the height of mercury is in the narrower tube compared to the wider one. The options are half, twice, the same, or none of these.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how barometers work. A mercury barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure. It consists of a long glass tube filled with mercury, sealed at one end, and inverted into a mercury-filled container called a reservoir. The difference in height between the mercury in the tube and the mercury in the reservoir indicates the atmospheric pressure.\n\nNow, the question is about two such barometers, one with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm\u00b2 and the other with 2 cm\u00b2. I need to find out how the heights of mercury compare in these two tubes.\n\nI think I should start by considering the principle behind barometers. The height of the mercury column in a barometer is determined by the atmospheric pressure and the density of mercury. The formula that relates atmospheric pressure (P) to the height (h) of the mercury column is:\n\n\\[ P = \\rho \\times g \\times h \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of mercury,\n\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n\n- \\(h\\) is the height of the mercury column.\n\nFrom this formula, it seems that the height \\(h\\) is independent of the cross-sectional area of the tube. As long as the atmospheric pressure is the same, and the density of mercury and gravity are constants, the height should be the same regardless of the tube's width.\n\nBut let's think about this more carefully. If I have two tubes of different cross-sectional areas, but both are open to the atmosphere in the same way, and assuming that the reservoirs are large enough so that the mercury level in the reservoir doesn't change significantly, then the height of the mercury column in the tubes should be the same.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any effect due to the different areas. Maybe there's something about the pressure exerted by the mercury column that depends on the area?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should think in terms of pressure and how it relates to the area. The pressure exerted by the mercury column is the same for both tubes because it's determined by the atmospheric pressure. So, if the pressure is the same, and the density of mercury is constant, then the height should be the same in both cases.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Imagine I have two tubes, one with 1 cm\u00b2 area and the other with 2 cm\u00b2 area. When I invert them into the mercury reservoir, the mercury inside the tubes will rise to a certain height where the weight of the mercury column balances the atmospheric pressure.\n\nGiven that, if the tube is wider, does that mean the mercury has to rise higher to balance the same pressure? Actually, no. Because the pressure is determined by the height of the column, not by its width. So, regardless of the width, the height should adjust to balance the atmospheric pressure.\n\nTo put it another way, the atmospheric pressure pushes down on the mercury in the reservoir, and the height of the mercury column in the tube rises until the weight of the mercury column equals the atmospheric pressure.\n\nTherefore, in both tubes, the height should be the same, assuming that they are both measuring the same atmospheric pressure.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be any practical differences. For example, in a wider tube, there might be more friction or other effects that could slightly affect the height. However, in ideal conditions, these effects are negligible, and the height should be the same.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the formula again: \\( P = \\rho \\times g \\times h \\). Since \\( P \\), \\(\\rho \\), and \\( g \\) are constants, \\( h \\) must be constant as well.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the height of mercury in the narrower tube should be the same as in the wider tube.\n\nWait, but one of the options is \"half.\" Is there any scenario where the height in the narrower tube would be half of that in the wider tube? It doesn't seem likely from the formula, as height doesn't depend on the area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding of the problem. Perhaps the question is trying to suggest that if the area is different, the height must adjust to compensate for the different area. But that doesn't make sense because in a barometer, it's the height that determines the pressure, not the area.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose the atmospheric pressure is such that it supports a mercury column of 760 mm height. If I have two tubes, one with 1 cm\u00b2 area and another with 2 cm\u00b2 area, both inverted into a reservoir, the mercury should rise to approximately 760 mm in both tubes, regardless of their area.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"the same.\"\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the volume of mercury in each tube. The volume in the narrower tube would be \\( V_1 = A_1 \\times h \\), and in the wider tube, \\( V_2 = A_2 \\times h \\). Since \\( A_2 = 2 \\times A_1 \\), then \\( V_2 = 2 \\times V_1 \\). However, this doesn't affect the height, which remains \\( h \\) in both tubes.\n\nSo, the height is the same in both tubes.\n\nWait, but what if the reservoir isn't large enough, or if the tubes are connected in some way? But the problem doesn't specify any such conditions, so I think it's safe to assume standard barometer setup.\n\nTherefore, the height of mercury in the narrower tube is the same as in the wider tube.\n\nSo, the answer is C. the same.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
