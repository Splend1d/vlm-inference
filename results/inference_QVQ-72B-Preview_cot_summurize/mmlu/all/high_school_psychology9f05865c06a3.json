                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a clerk who's been dealing with rude customers and then is impatient with the next customer. And the question is asking what psychological concept this exemplifies from the given options: stereotyping, the fundamental attribution error, the mere exposure effect, or the reciprocity norm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening in the scenario. The clerk has been patient with several rude customers but then loses patience with the next customer. The customer in question thinks that the clerk is generally an impatient person rather than just having a bad day. So, the customer is making an attribution about the clerk's personality based on this one interaction.\n\nNow, let's recall what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Stereotyping: This is when someone assigns characteristics to a group of people based on preconceived notions or beliefs. It's a type of shortcut in thinking where individuals are categorized based on their membership in a particular group, rather than being seen as unique individuals.\n\nB. The fundamental attribution error: This is the tendency to overattribute people's behavior to their\u5185\u5728 traits or dispositions and underattribute them to situational factors. It's especially common when we observe others' behavior but less so when reflecting on our own.\n\nC. The mere exposure effect: This is the phenomenon where people tend to develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar with them. The more we are exposed to something, the more we like it, up to a point.\n\nD. The reciprocity norm: This is a social norm that suggests we should repay in kind what we receive from others. It's about giving back what we've been given, whether it's help, gifts, or kindness.\n\nGiven this background, let's see which one fits the scenario.\n\nThe customer is attributing the clerk's impatience to her personality rather than considering that she might be having a bad day due to previous rude customers. This sounds a lot like the fundamental attribution error, where the customer is focusing on the clerk's disposition (she's an impatient person) rather than the situation (she's been dealing with rude customers all day).\n\nStereotyping would involve the customer making assumptions about the clerk based on some group she belongs to, like her job title, age, or other characteristics, but the scenario doesn't specify any group-based assumptions.\n\nThe mere exposure effect would be relevant if the customer liked the clerk more because they had seen her before or had prior positive interactions, but that's not indicated here.\n\nThe reciprocity norm would apply if the customer felt obliged to treat the clerk a certain way based on how the clerk treated them, but again, that's not directly addressed in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer seems to be B. the fundamental attribution error.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any possibility of another answer making sense. For example, could this be seen as stereotyping if the customer is making a broad assumption about the clerk's personality based on one interaction?\n\nWell, stereotyping typically involves applying group-based assumptions to an individual, whereas here, it's more about attributing the clerk's behavior to her personal disposition rather than her group membership. So, while there might be some overlap, the fundamental attribution error seems more directly applicable.\n\nAlso, the mere exposure effect doesn't fit because there's no indication that the customer has been repeatedly exposed to the clerk or is developing a preference based on familiarity.\n\nSimilarly, the reciprocity norm isn't relevant here since it pertains to reciprocal actions or favors, which aren't mentioned in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. the fundamental attribution error.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
