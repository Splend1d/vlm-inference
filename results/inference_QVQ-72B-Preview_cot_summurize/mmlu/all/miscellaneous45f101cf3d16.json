                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about displaying fragile sculptures securely. The options are:\n\nA. in glass-paneled cases\n\nB. on a series of pedestals\n\nC. on wall-mounted shelves with sturdier works around them\n\nD. in shadow boxes with signs that read \"Do Not Touch\"\n\nHmm, I need to think about which of these would provide the most security for these fragile works.\n\nFirst, option A: in glass-paneled cases. I can imagine these are like display cases where the sculpture is enclosed in glass on all sides. That might protect it from being touched directly by visitors, but what if the glass breaks? Could that cause damage to the sculpture? Maybe it's not the best option if the glass isn't bulletproof or something.\n\nOption B: on a series of pedestals. Pedestals are like individual stands for each sculpture. This might make them easy to view from all angles, but it also means they're more exposed. People might accidentally bump into them or try to touch them. That doesn't sound very secure for fragile works.\n\nOption C: on wall-mounted shelves with sturdier works around them. So, they're mounted on walls, which might provide some protection from bumps, but having sturdier works around them\u2014does that mean they're surrounded by tougher sculptures that could protect them somehow? I'm not sure how effective that would be in preventing direct touches or accidental knocks.\n\nOption D: in shadow boxes with signs that read \"Do Not Touch.\" Shadow boxes are like deep frames that can hold three-dimensional objects. They usually have a glass front, so people can see in but can't touch the contents directly. The sign reinforces that it's not to be touched. This seems like a pretty secure option, as long as the glass is sturdy and the box is well-mounted.\n\nLet me compare A and D, since both involve glass enclosures. In option A, it's a fully glass-paneled case, which might be more protective because it's enclosed on all sides, but if the glass breaks, the sculpture is exposed. In option D, it's a shadow box, which is likely only glass on the front, but perhaps the sides are covered or protected in some way.\n\nBut wait, if the shadow box is mounted on a wall, it's less likely to be bumped into from the sides, and the front glass can be protected with a frame that's strong enough to prevent breakage from normal impacts.\n\nOption C seems less secure because relying on sturdier works around the fragile ones might not offer enough protection. People might still try to touch or get too close to the fragile pieces.\n\nOption B, with pedestals, is probably the least secure because the sculptures are completely exposed and vulnerable to accidental bumps or touches.\n\nSo, between A and D, I'm leaning towards D, the shadow boxes with \"Do Not Touch\" signs. The signs serve as a clear warning to visitors to keep their hands off, and the glass front should prevent direct contact.\n\nBut I should consider if there are any downsides to shadow boxes. Maybe they can trap moisture or cause temperature fluctuations that could damage the sculpture over time. But I think that's more about the specific design of the shadow box and the materials used, not about the concept itself.\n\nAlso, shadow boxes can be designed with UV-resistant glass to protect the sculptures from light damage, and they can be sealed to maintain a stable environment.\n\nGlass-paneled cases (option A) can offer similar protections, but again, if the glass is only on one side in a shadow box, it might be easier to maintain and less likely to be damaged from the sides.\n\nWait, but if the shadow box is mounted on a wall, the sides are probably covered or recessed, making them less susceptible to accidental bumps.\n\nAnother thing to consider is accessibility. Shadow boxes mounted on walls might make it easier to secure the area around them, preventing people from getting too close.\n\nIn contrast, glass-paneled cases might be free-standing, which could be more secure in some ways, but also more prone to being bumped into from multiple sides.\n\nI think the key here is minimizing the risk of physical contact and damage, and a well-designed shadow box with clear signage should achieve that.\n\nSo, my answer would be D: in shadow boxes with signs that read \"Do Not Touch.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
