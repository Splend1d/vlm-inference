                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about sampling methods, and I need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the description. So, the researcher is planning to survey school principals in a particular state. There are 125 school districts, and instead of mixing all the principals into one big list and sampling from that, they're going to sample from each district separately.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what kind of sampling method this is. The options are simple random sample, cluster sample, systematic sample, and stratified sample. Let's recall what each of these is.\n\nA simple random sample is where every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. It's like putting everyone's name in a hat and drawing out the names you need. But in this case, they're not doing that. They're sampling from each district separately, which sounds different from just mixing everyone together and picking at random.\n\nNext, cluster sampling. I think cluster sampling involves dividing the population into groups, or clusters, and then randomly selecting some of those clusters. Once you've selected the clusters, you either survey all the individuals in those clusters or randomly sample from them. In this scenario, the districts could be considered clusters, but it says they're sampling from each district, not just some of them. So, it's not typical cluster sampling where you select a subset of clusters and survey them. Here, they're sampling from all 125 districts.\n\nSystematic sampling is another option. That's where you take a list of the population and select every k-th person, where k is some interval based on the desired sample size. For example, if you have a list of 1000 people and you want a sample of 100, you'd select every 10th person. But in this case, it's not about selecting every k-th principal; it's about sampling from each district separately. So, I don't think this fits the description of systematic sampling.\n\nNow, stratified sampling. This is where the population is divided into strata, or layers, based on some characteristic, and then samples are taken from each stratum. The idea is that each stratum is internally homogeneous but different from other strata. This can be useful if you want to ensure representation from all groups. In this scenario, the districts could be considered strata, and sampling from each district would be a form of stratified sampling.\n\nWait a minute, the option B says it's a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters. Heterogeneous means having mixed characteristics. In cluster sampling, clusters are typically heterogeneous because they're meant to represent the whole population. But in stratified sampling, strata are homogeneous within themselves but different from each other.\n\nSo, if districts are being treated as strata, they should be similar within themselves and different from other districts. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe in some contexts, districts are similar in certain ways, like size or location, but I don't know for sure.\n\nLet me think again. The question says: \"The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group.\"\n\nSo, instead of taking all principals in the state and doing a simple random sample, they're going into each district and sampling from there.\n\nOption A says it's a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner. But it's not a simple random sample if they're sampling from each district separately. So, I think this is incorrect.\n\nOption B says it's a cluster sample where the population was divided into heterogeneous groups. As I thought earlier, clusters in cluster sampling are supposed to be heterogeneous because they're mini-representations of the whole population. But in this case, if districts are being sampled separately, it might be more like stratified sampling where each district is a stratum.\n\nOption C mentions systematic sampling, which, as I thought earlier, doesn't seem to fit because that involves selecting every k-th element from a list, not sampling from each district separately.\n\nOption D says it's a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give. Stratified sampling is indeed designed to ensure that specific subgroups (strata) are represented in the sample, which can provide more precise estimates and allow for comparisons between strata.\n\nGiven that, it seems like option D is the correct conclusion. But let me double-check.\n\nIn stratified sampling, you divide the population into strata based on some characteristic, and then draw a sample from each stratum. This can be proportionate or disproportionate based on the size of the stratum. In this case, the districts could be considered strata, and sampling from each district would be a stratified sampling approach.\n\nOn the other hand, cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters, usually based on geographical locations or other grouping variables, and then randomly selecting some of these clusters. In cluster sampling, the clusters are intended to be representative of the whole population, and ideally, each cluster is a miniature version of the population.\n\nIn the scenario described, all 125 districts are being sampled, not just a subset, which differs from typical cluster sampling where only some clusters are selected for sampling.\n\nTherefore, it's more accurate to consider this as stratified sampling, where each district is a stratum, and a sample is drawn from each stratum.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct conclusion: this is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n\nWait, but the question says: \"Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\" and option D says, \"This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\"\n\nWell, stratified sampling can provide more precise estimates and allow for comparisons between strata, which a simple random sample might not offer, especially if there's significant variation between strata.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option D is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that another option could be correct.\n\nOption A claims it's a simple random sample obtained more easily and less costly. But it's not a simple random sample; it's a stratified sample. So, that's incorrect.\n\nOption B says it's a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters. While districts could be considered clusters, the way they're being sampled\u2014sampling from each district rather than selecting a subset of districts\u2014doesn't align perfectly with standard cluster sampling procedures. So, I don't think this is the best description.\n\nOption C mentions systematic sampling, which, as I thought earlier, involves selecting every k-th element from an ordered list. That doesn't seem to fit the description of sampling from each district separately.\n\nTherefore, option D is indeed the correct conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
