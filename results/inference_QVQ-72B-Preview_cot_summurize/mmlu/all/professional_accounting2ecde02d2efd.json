                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out within how many years someone can file a claim for a refund of federal income taxes if they paid taxes but didn't file a return for that year. The options are one, two, three, or four years.\n\nFirst, I should recall the general rules about filing a claim for a refund with the IRS. I think there's a statute of limitations on these things. Normally, if you file a tax return, you have up to three years from the filing date or two years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later, to file for a refund.\n\nBut in this case, the person didn't file a return in that year. They just paid taxes 27 months ago and now want to file a claim for a refund. So, since no return was filed, does that change things?\n\nLet me think about this. If no return was filed, maybe the time period is different. I seem to remember that if you haven't filed a return, the statute of limitations might be longer or perhaps doesn't start until you file the return.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to find some information on this.\n\nI found that generally, for refunds, you have to file a claim within three years from the due date of the return or two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later.\n\nBut in this scenario, no return was filed. So, perhaps the three-year period applies from the due date of the return.\n\nLet me check when the due date for the tax year in question was. Assuming it's a typical tax year ending on December 31, the due date is April 15 of the following year. So, if they paid taxes 27 months ago, let's calculate when that was.\n\nIf it's 27 months ago, that's about 2 years and 3 months. So, if today is, say, June 2023, then 27 months back would be March 2021. So, the tax year would have ended on December 31, 2020, and the due date for filing would have been April 15, 2021.\n\nNow, since no return was filed, does the three-year period start from the due date? That would mean April 15, 2021, plus three years, which is April 15, 2024. So, they could file a claim for refund until April 15, 2024.\n\nBut wait, they paid taxes 27 months ago, which is March 2021. So, the payment date is March 2021, and the due date was April 15, 2021.\n\nAccording to the general rule, the claim should be filed within three years from the due date or two years from the payment date, whichever is later.\n\nSo, three years from April 15, 2021, is April 15, 2024, and two years from March 2021 is March 2023.\n\nBetween these two, the later date is April 15, 2024.\n\nBut the question says they paid taxes 27 months ago, which is March 2021, and now is June 2023. So, from March 2021 to June 2023 is about 2 years and 3 months.\n\nSo, according to the two-year rule from the payment date, they have until March 2023 to file the claim. But according to the three-year rule from the due date, they have until April 2024.\n\nSo, the later of the two is April 2024, which is three years from the due date.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be three years.\n\nBut wait, the options are in whole years, not months. The question is phrased as \"within which of the following time periods after those taxes were paid?\"\n\nGiven that 27 months is more than two years but less than three years, and they have until three years from the due date, which is April 2024, that would mean they have just over three years from March 2021 to file the claim.\n\nBut since the options are A. One year, B. Two years, C. Three years, D. Four years, the closest answer is C. Three years.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because 27 months is 2 years and 3 months, and three years from the payment date would be March 2024, which is 3 years exactly. But according to the IRS rules, it's the later of three years from the due date or two years from the payment date.\n\nGiven that, three years from the due date is April 2024, and two years from the payment date is March 2023. So, the later date is April 2024, which is within three years from the payment date.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Three years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
