                    "text": "So I've got this trivia question here: \"Which movie popularized the phrase 'You talkin' to me?'\" And the options are Ghostbusters, Taxi Driver, Joker, and Groundhog Day. Hmm, I need to think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"You talkin' to me?\" is a pretty famous line. I think it's from a movie where someone says it in a tough, confrontational way. Let me see if I can recall which movie that is.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Ghostbusters. I remember Ghostbusters is about a group of parapsychologists who start a business to capture ghosts. I don't recall any specific scene where someone says, \"You talkin' to me?\" in that movie. It seems more focused on ghost-catching and comedy rather than tough guy dialogues. So, maybe not there.\n\nNext is Taxi Driver. Now, Taxi Driver is a different story. That's a drama film directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Robert De Niro. De Niro plays a taxi driver who's struggling with insomnia and feels disconnected from society. I think it's famous for some intense scenes and memorable lines. Let me try to recall if \"You talkin' to me?\" is from there.\n\nWait a minute, I think there's a scene in Taxi Driver where Robert De Niro's character is in a mirror, practicing what to say if someone confronts him. I think he repeats, \"You talkin' to me?\" in a menacing way. Yeah, that sounds familiar. This could be the movie where the phrase became popular.\n\nMoving on to Joker. Joker is a relatively recent movie, a psychological thriller about the origins of the Joker character from Batman comics. Joaquin Phoenix played the lead role. I don't remember any specific line like \"You talkin' to me?\" in that movie. It had its own unique dialogue, so probably not there.\n\nLastly, Groundhog Day. This is a comedy film starring Bill Murray, where he plays a weatherman who gets stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. I can't recall any tough guy dialogue in that movie; it's more about comedy and self-realization. So, again, unlikely to be the source of \"You talkin' to me?\"\n\nAfter considering all these movies, it seems like Taxi Driver is the most plausible option for popularizing the phrase \"You talkin' to me?\" I remember that scene where Robert De Niro practices saying it in the mirror, which has become quite iconic. So, I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my memory. In Taxi Driver, Robert De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, is known for his intense demeanor and confrontational attitude. The phrase \"You talkin' to me?\" fits perfectly with his character's personality and the movie's theme of isolation and violence.\n\nI don't think Ghostbusters, Joker, or Groundhog Day have this specific phrase. They each have their own famous lines, but \"You talkin' to me?\" isn't one of them.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is B. Taxi Driver.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Taxi Driver}} \\]"
