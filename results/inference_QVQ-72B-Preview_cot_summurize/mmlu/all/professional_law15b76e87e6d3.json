                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a car accident where the plaintiff was injured and is now suing the defendant for personal injuries. The accident happened when the defendant's cousin, who was driving the defendant's car negligently, hit a telephone booth where the plaintiff was resting. There's a statute that says the owner of a car is liable if someone driving with their consent causes an accident negligently.\n\nNow, in the trial, the plaintiff wants to introduce the testimony of his doctor. The doctor will say that the plaintiff told him, when seeking treatment, that he felt pain in his back immediately after the accident and that this pain has persisted. The question is, how should the trial court rule on this testimony?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Admissible as a spontaneous declaration.\n\nB. Admissible under the hearsay exception of declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nC. Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nD. Inadmissible as conclusions.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being offered here. The doctor is testifying about what the plaintiff told him regarding his back pain after the accident. So, this is the plaintiff's statement to the doctor, which is being offered through the doctor's testimony.\n\nNow, generally, hearsay is not admissible in court. Hearsay is a statement made outside of the courtroom that is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the plaintiff's statement to the doctor about feeling back pain after the accident is being offered to prove that he actually had back pain after the accident.\n\nSo, this seems like hearsay. But there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, and the question is whether this statement falls under any of those exceptions.\n\nOption A suggests it's admissible as a spontaneous declaration. A spontaneous declaration, or excited utterance, is a statement made in reaction to a startling event or condition, without time for reflection or fabrication. It's based on the idea that in the heat of the moment, people are less likely to lie.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff's statement about feeling back pain immediately after the accident might qualify as a spontaneous declaration if it was made soon after the accident, while the plaintiff was still under the stress of the event.\n\nHowever, the statement about the pain persisting over time might not fit as well under this exception because it's a recollection of past pain and a statement about its continuation, which might not be as immediate or spontaneous.\n\nOption B proposes it's admissible under the hearsay exception for declaration of present bodily condition. This exception allows statements about the declarant's current physical condition, sensations, or emotions to be admitted.\n\nIn this scenario, the plaintiff's statement to the doctor that he felt back pain immediately after the accident is about his current sensation at the time he made the statement. So, this could fit under the present bodily condition exception.\n\nHowever, the part about the pain persisting over time is a bit trickier. Is this still considered a statement about his present bodily condition if he's referring to a ongoing issue that started in the past?\n\nI think the key here is that the statement is about his current condition, which includes the persistence of the pain. So, even if it references the past, it's in the context of describing his current state.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. But based on the above, it seems like it might fall under one of the exceptions, so this is probably not the right answer.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible as conclusions. I'm not sure about this. The statement is about feeling pain, which is a factual assertion about his sensation, not really a conclusion. Conclusions are more about opinions or interpretations of facts, which isn't directly applicable here.\n\nSo, between options A and B, I need to decide which one is more appropriate.\n\nThe spontaneous declaration exception requires that the statement be made under the stress of excitement caused by the event, without time for reflection. In this case, if the statement about immediate back pain was made shortly after the accident, it might qualify.\n\nHowever, the declaration of present bodily condition exception is specifically designed for statements about one's current physical sensations, which seems directly applicable here.\n\nMoreover, the persistence of pain over time might not qualify as a spontaneous declaration if it's being related at a later date, but it could still be considered a statement about his current bodily condition.\n\nGiven that, I think option B is the most appropriate choice. The statement is about the plaintiff's current bodily condition, including the sensation of pain, and thus falls under the declaration of present bodily condition exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nSo, the trial court should rule this testimony admissible under the hearsay exception of declaration of present bodily condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
