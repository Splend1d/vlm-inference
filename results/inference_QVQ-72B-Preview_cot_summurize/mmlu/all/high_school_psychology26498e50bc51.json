                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question about Lynda, who is described as a confident, capable woman who takes responsibility for her own actions. The question is asking which of the following options best describes her based on this description: manic coping strategy, discriminative expectancy, internal locus of control, or external locus of control.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these terms means and then see which one fits Lynda's characteristics.\n\nStarting with \"manic coping strategy,\" I'm not entirely sure what that refers to. I know that manic relates to mania, which is a state of elevated mood, energy, and activity levels, often associated with bipolar disorder. But I'm not sure how it fits into coping strategies. Maybe it's not the right choice here.\n\nNext is \"discriminative expectancy.\" I'm not familiar with this term off the top of my head. It sounds like it might have to do with expectations based on discrimination, but that doesn't seem relevant to the description of Lynda. Perhaps it's a distractor or something related to a different context.\n\nThen there's \"internal locus of control\" and \"external locus of control.\" These are concepts I've heard of before. Locus of control refers to where a person believes the control over their life and events lies. If it's internal, they believe they have control over their own destiny and are responsible for their actions. If it's external, they believe that external factors, like luck or other people, control their life.\n\nGiven that Lynda is described as confident, capable, and takes responsibility for her own actions, it seems like she has an internal locus of control. She believes in her own abilities and is willing to accept that her actions have consequences, which aligns with an internal locus of control.\n\nAn external locus of control would suggest that she blames outside factors for outcomes, which doesn't fit with her taking responsibility for her actions.\n\nSo, between the options given, C. internal locus of control seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about whether any of the other options could possibly fit.\n\nManic coping strategy: Doesn't seem relevant to the description provided.\n\nDiscriminative expectancy: I still don't see how this relates to Lynda's characteristics.\n\nExternal locus of control: This would contradict the idea that she takes responsibility for her own actions, since external locus of control implies relying on external factors rather than personal responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. internal locus of control.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that individuals with an internal locus of control are more likely to be confident and take initiative, as they believe their actions can make a difference. They are also more likely to take responsibility for their failures because they attribute them to their own actions or lack of effort, rather than external factors.\n\nThis matches perfectly with Lynda's description as confident, capable, and taking responsibility for her actions.\n\nSo, I'm confident that C. internal locus of control is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
