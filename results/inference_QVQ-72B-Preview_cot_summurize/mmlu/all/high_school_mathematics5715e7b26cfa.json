                    "text": "So I have this function: y = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 \u2013 x), and I need to find its range. The options are A. \u20133 \u2264 y \u2264 3, B. \u20132 \u2264 y \u2264 8, C. 0 \u2264 y \u2264 6, D. 2 \u2264 y \u2264 8.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this function is doing. I know that the sine function has a range from -1 to 1, so sin(\u03b8) is between -1 and 1 for any angle \u03b8.\n\nBut here, the angle is \u03c0 \u2013 x. I remember that sine is an odd function, but wait, sin(\u03c0 \u2013 x) actually has a property because of the angle inside.\n\nLet me recall the identity for sin(\u03c0 \u2013 x). I think it's sin(\u03c0 \u2013 x) = sin x. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, sin(\u03c0 \u2013 x) is equal to sin x. That simplifies the function to:\n\ny = 5 + 3 * sin x\n\nOkay, so now I have y equals 5 plus 3 times the sine of x.\n\nI know that sin x ranges from -1 to 1. So, the minimum value of sin x is -1, and the maximum is 1.\n\nLet's plug these values into the function to see what y can be.\n\nFirst, when sin x is at its maximum, which is 1:\n\ny = 5 + 3 * 1 = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nAnd when sin x is at its minimum, which is -1:\n\ny = 5 + 3 * (-1) = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nSo, y ranges from 2 to 8.\n\nLooking back at the options, that would be D. 2 \u2264 y \u2264 8.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any way that y could be outside this range? Well, sin x only takes values between -1 and 1, and multiplying by 3 makes it range from -3 to 3, and then adding 5 shifts it up to 2 to 8.\n\nI don't think there are any other values y can take beyond that.\n\nLet me consider if there are any restrictions or special cases.\n\nFor example, at x = \u03c0/2, sin x = 1, so y = 5 + 3*1 = 8\n\nAt x = 3\u03c0/2, sin x = -1, y = 5 + 3*(-1) = 2\n\nAt x = 0, sin x = 0, y = 5 + 3*0 = 5\n\nAt x = \u03c0, sin x = 0, y = 5 + 3*0 = 5\n\nSo, y seems to stay within 2 and 8.\n\nWait, but option C is 0 \u2264 y \u2264 6. That can't be right because we already have y going up to 8.\n\nOption B is \u20132 \u2264 y \u2264 8, which includes negative values, but that doesn't make sense because y never goes below 2.\n\nOption A is \u20133 \u2264 y \u2264 3, which is way off because y is shifted up by 5.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 2 \u2264 y \u2264 8.\n\nJust to double-check, the range of sin x is [-1, 1].\n\nMultiply by 3: [-3, 3]\n\nAdd 5: [2, 8]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've covered all possible scenarios here. The answer is D. 2 \u2264 y \u2264 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 2 \\leq y \\leq 8} \\]"
