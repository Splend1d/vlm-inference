                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a legal case involving the Secretary of Commerce trying to stop a man from mailing advertising brochures that the Secretary thinks are obscene. The case went all the way up to the state's highest court, which said that the law the Secretary was using is unconstitutional because it violates the commerce clause and the supremacy clause. Now, the question is about how this case could be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The options are:\n\nA. by appeal.\n\nB. by certiorari.\n\nC. if five justices vote to review it.\n\nD. despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the process for getting a case to the U.S. Supreme Court from a state's highest court.\n\nI know that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of federal law and the U.S. Constitution. So, if a state court rules on something involving federal law or the Constitution, the Supreme Court might review it.\n\nIn this case, the state's highest court held that the state statute is unconstitutional because it violates the commerce clause and the supremacy clause. Both of these are part of the U.S. Constitution. The commerce clause is in Article I, Section 8, which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, and the supremacy clause is in Article VI, which says that the Constitution and federal laws made pursuant to it are the supreme law of the land.\n\nSo, since the state court's decision is based on federal constitutional grounds, it's possible for the Supreme Court to review it.\n\nNow, the options:\n\nA. by appeal.\n\nB. by certiorari.\n\nC. if five justices vote to review it.\n\nD. despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\nOption A: by appeal.\n\nI know that in some cases, parties can directly appeal to the Supreme Court from a state's highest court if the decision involves a federal question. But I think there are specific rules about when that's allowed.\n\nOption B: by certiorari.\n\nThis is probably the most common way cases reach the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court can grant a writ of certiorari to review a lower court's decision. This usually happens if there's an important federal question at stake, or if there's a conflict between different lower courts' decisions.\n\nOption C: if five justices vote to review it.\n\nI know that in the Supreme Court, it generally takes four justices to grant certiorari, which is often referred to as the \"rule of four.\" So, if five justices agree to review a case, that would certainly be enough, but the threshold is actually lower.\n\nOption D: despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\n\nThis one seems a bit tricky. The doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds refers to situations where a state court bases its decision on an independent and adequate state law ground, and as a result, the Supreme Court cannot review the decision because there's no federal question left to review.\n\nBut in this case, the state court held that the statute is unconstitutional under the commerce clause and the supremacy clause, which are both federal constitutional provisions. So, the decision is based on federal law, not on an independent state law ground.\n\nTherefore, the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds shouldn't apply here, because the state court's decision rests on federal constitutional grounds, not on state law.\n\nSo, given that, it seems like the case could be reviewed by the Supreme Court, either by appeal or by certiorari, since it involves federal constitutional questions.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nI recall that in some cases, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, meaning that appeals from certain types of cases go directly to the Supreme Court without going through the lower federal courts first. For example, cases between two or more states, or cases involving ambassadors, are within the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction.\n\nHowever, in this case, it's a dispute arising from a state statute being challenged on federal constitutional grounds, so it's likely that the Supreme Court would review it on appeal from the state's highest court.\n\nAlternatively, if the party affected by the state court's decision wants the Supreme Court to review it, they could file a petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\nGiven that, options A and B seem plausible.\n\nOption C seems a bit off because, as I mentioned earlier, it generally takes four justices to grant certiorari, not five. So, while five justices agreeing to review a case would certainly lead to review, the threshold is lower.\n\nOption D suggests that the case could be reviewed despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds, but in this scenario, since the state court's decision is based on federal constitutional grounds, that doctrine shouldn't apply anyway.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is probably A. by appeal.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any reason why it wouldn't be by appeal.\n\nIf the state's highest court's decision is final and involves a federal question, then an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the case involves a federal statute or treaty, or if there's a conflict with federal precedent, certiorari might be another path.\n\nHowever, in practice, I think appeals from state supreme courts to the U.S. Supreme Court are relatively rare, and certiorari is a more common route.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, since the state's highest court has declared a state statute unconstitutional on federal grounds, it's likely that the case could be reviewed by the Supreme Court on appeal.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option A. by appeal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
