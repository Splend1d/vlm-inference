When the pedestrian started to cross the street, she saw the traffic light was red. She momentarily stopped, thought about waiting until the light turned green, but then decided to cross anyway. As the pedestrian was halfway across the street, the motorist, who was driving 50 m. p. h. in a 25 m. p. h. zone, struck her with his vehicle. The pedestrian suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries in the accident. While in the hospital, the pedestrian's insurance company paid $10,000 of her medical expenses. Six months later, the pedestrian brought suit against the motorist to recover damages for all her medical expenses. This jurisdiction has a \"modified\" comparative negligence statute in effect. Suppose a jury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The motorist was 60 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The pedestrian was 40 percent at fault in crossing the street against the red light; and (3) The pedestrian suffered damages from the accident totaling $50,000. After the verdict, the court was advised that the pedestrian's insurance company had already paid the pedestrian $10,000. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the pedestrian in the amount of\n\nA. $50,000, because the motorist's negligence was greater than the pedestrian's.\nB. $30,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\nC. $20,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\nD. $10,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, less the $10,000 in hospital expenses already paid by the insurance company.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out how much the court should award the pedestrian after a jury verdict. There are a lot of details here, and I'm not a lawyer, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a car accident where a pedestrian is hit by a motorist who was speeding. The pedestrian was crossing the street against a red light and got injured. She had some medical expenses covered by her insurance, and now she's suing the motorist for all her medical expenses. The jurisdiction has a \"modified\" comparative negligence statute, which I think means that both parties' fault is compared, and it affects the damages awarded.\n\nThe jury found that the motorist was 60% negligent for speeding, and the pedestrian was 40% at fault for crossing against the red light. The total damages are $50,000. Also, the pedestrian's insurance company already paid $10,000 of her medical expenses.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what judgment the court should enter, considering these facts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"modified\" comparative negligence means. I know that in pure comparative negligence, the damages are reduced by the percentage of the plaintiff's fault. But \"modified\" comparative negligence might have some thresholds or limits, like in some states, if the plaintiff is more at fault than the defendant, they can't recover anything.\n\nIn this case, the pedestrian is 40% at fault, and the motorist is 60% at fault. So, since the pedestrian is less than 50% at fault, I think she can still recover, but her damages will be reduced by her percentage of fault.\n\nSo, the total damages are $50,000. If she's 40% at fault, then her recoverable damages would be $50,000 minus 40% of $50,000.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n40% of $50,000 is $20,000.\n\nSo, $50,000 minus $20,000 equals $30,000.\n\nTherefore, the pedestrian should get $30,000 from the motorist.\n\nBut wait, the insurance company already paid $10,000. Does that affect the amount she can recover from the motorist?\n\nI've heard of something called the collateral source rule, which says that payments from other sources, like insurance, shouldn't reduce the amount the defendant has to pay. So, maybe the $10,000 already paid by insurance shouldn't be subtracted from the damages awarded by the court.\n\nIf that's the case, then the court should still award $30,000, and the pedestrian would have already received $10,000 from insurance, so her total recovery would be $40,000, but I don't think that's how it works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would subtract the $10,000 already paid by insurance from the $30,000, leaving the pedestrian with an additional $20,000 from the motorist.\n\nBut I think the collateral source rule prevents that, at least in some jurisdictions.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the pedestrian's total damages are $50,000, reduced by her 40% fault to $30,000, and then the insurance payment of $10,000 is not deducted because it's from a collateral source.\n\nSo, the pedestrian would keep the $10,000 from insurance and get $30,000 from the motorist, totaling $40,000.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe the pedestrian can't \"double dip\" and has to credit the insurance payment against the damages awarded.\n\nWait, perhaps the motorist's liability is only for the remaining $20,000 after the insurance has paid $10,000.\n\nBut that seems unfair, because the motorist should pay their share based on their fault, which is 60% of the total damages.\n\nSo, 60% of $50,000 is $30,000, and the pedestrian's insurance has already paid $10,000, so maybe the motorist pays $20,000.\n\nBut that would make the pedestrian receive a total of $30,000, which aligns with the 60% fault.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was $30,000 minus $10,000, but maybe that's not right.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up what the collateral source rule is.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the collateral source rule generally holds that the defendant can't reduce the damages awarded just because the plaintiff received payments from other sources, like health insurance.\n\nSo, in this case, the pedestrian's insurance paid $10,000, which should not affect the amount the motorist has to pay.\n\nTherefore, the motorist should still pay $30,000, and the pedestrian keeps the $10,000 from insurance.\n\nSo, the court should enter a judgment for $30,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $50,000, because the motorist's negligence was greater than the pedestrian's.\n\nB. $30,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\n\nC. $20,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\n\nD. $10,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, less the $10,000 in hospital expenses already paid by the insurance company.\n\nOption B seems to align with my understanding: the pedestrian's recoverable damages are reduced by her 40% fault to $30,000, and the $10,000 already paid by insurance is disregarded under the collateral source rule.\n\nOption C mentions $20,000, which might be confusing. If the pedestrian is 40% at fault, her own negligence would lead to a reduction of $20,000 from $50,000, but that's not how comparative negligence works. It's the total damages reduced by the plaintiff's percentage of fault.\n\nOption D suggests only $10,000, which doesn't make sense because the pedestrian's own negligence is 40%, which should reduce the damages by $20,000, not the award being $10,000.\n\nOption A suggests $50,000, but that's the total damages before considering the pedestrian's fault.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B: $30,000, with the $10,000 payment disregarded under the collateral source rule.\n\nI hope that's right. I tried my best to reason through it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
