                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I spent the afternoon filling the pi\u00f1ata with razors for the birthday party.\" Okay, so a pi\u00f1ata is usually filled with candy or small toys for kids to break open at birthday parties. But instead of candy, this person put razors inside. Razors are sharp and dangerous, especially for children. If kids hit the pi\u00f1ata and it breaks open, they could get seriously hurt by the razors. That seems really irresponsible and harmful. Intentionally putting something dangerous in a pi\u00f1ata that's meant for children to play with is definitely against moral standards. So, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I used a syringe to treat cancer with radioactive polonium.\" This one is a bit more complex. Using a syringe to treat cancer suggests that someone is administering a substance to fight cancer cells. Radioactive polonium is mentioned. I know that some treatments for cancer involve the use of radiation, like chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but I'm not sure about polonium specifically. Polonium is a radioactive element, and while radiation can be used to treat cancer, it's typically done under strict medical supervision using equipment designed for that purpose.\n\nUsing a syringe to inject radioactive material directly seems risky because improper administration could cause harm to the patient or expose others to radiation. In medical settings, radiation therapy is highly regulated and requires specialized training and equipment to ensure safety and effectiveness. So, if someone is using a syringe to inject radioactive polonium without proper medical training or oversight, that would be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.\n\nHowever, if this was done in a controlled medical environment by a qualified professional following standard procedures, it might not be considered morally wrong. But given that polonium is not a commonly used substance in cancer treatment, and injecting it with a syringe seems unconventional, it's likely that this action would be seen as morally questionable at best.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves intentionally placing dangerous objects in a pi\u00f1ata intended for children, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves using a potentially dangerous substance for medical treatment, which could be morally justifiable if done correctly, but given the specifics, it seems risky and potentially morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, I think both scenarios could be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Scenario 1 is straightforwardly wrong due to the intentional harm to children, while Scenario 2 is more nuanced but still carries significant moral risk due to the potential for harm from improper medical treatment.\n\nSo, my answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
