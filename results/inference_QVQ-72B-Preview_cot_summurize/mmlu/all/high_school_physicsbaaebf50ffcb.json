                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a satellite orbiting Earth, and it gets hit by a meteor that increases its speed by 1%, but doesn't change the direction of its velocity. I need to figure out what happens to its orbit after that. The options are:\n\nA. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.\n\nB. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.\n\nC. The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.\n\nD. The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some basics about orbits and Kepler's laws, maybe. So, originally, the satellite is in a circular orbit, which means its speed is constant, and it's moving at the right velocity to balance out the gravitational pull of Earth, keeping it in a circle.\n\nNow, a meteor collides with it at point P, increasing its speed by 1%. So, at point P, its speed increases, but the direction remains the same as before the collision. Hmm.\n\nI think I should consider the concept of specific orbital energy or maybe look at the vis-viva equation. But maybe there's a simpler way to think about this.\n\nLet me think about orbital mechanics. In a circular orbit, the satellite has a specific speed for that orbit's radius, right? If you increase the speed at a particular point without changing the direction, that should affect the shape of the orbit.\n\nWait, but in a circular orbit, increasing the speed at one point would typically make the orbit elliptical. But whether it becomes an ellipse with P as the farthest or closest approach depends on whether the speed is increased to be higher or lower than the escape velocity or something like that.\n\nActually, no. For a circular orbit, if you increase the speed above the circular velocity, the satellite will go into an elliptical orbit with the farthest point (apogee) opposite to where the speed was increased.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn a circular orbit, the satellite has a specific velocity \\(v_c\\) given by \\(v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\), where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is the Earth's mass, and \\(r\\) is the orbit radius.\n\nIf the speed is increased by 1%, so new speed is \\(v' = 1.01 v_c\\), what happens?\n\nIn orbital mechanics, if you increase the speed above the circular velocity, the satellite will go into an elliptical orbit with the closest approach (perigee) at the point where the speed was increased.\n\nWait, is that correct? I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up what happens when you increase the speed in a circular orbit.\n\nIn a circular orbit, increasing the speed above the circular velocity will cause the satellite to go into an elliptical orbit with the apogee (farthest point) opposite to the point where the speed was increased.\n\nWait, no. Actually, I think I need to recall that if you increase the speed at a specific point in the orbit, the new orbit will be elliptical, with that point being either the perigee or the apogee, depending on the direction of the velocity change.\n\nBut in this problem, it says the direction of the velocity remains the same, only the speed increases by 1%. So, essentially, it's like a tangent impulse that increases the speed.\n\nWait, no, it's a collision with a meteor, which increases the speed by 1% without changing the direction.\n\nSo, if the direction remains the same, and speed increases, it's like applying a tangent impulse to the satellite at point P.\n\nIn orbital mechanics, applying a tangent impulse changes the orbital energy but not the angular momentum direction.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the concept of specific orbital energy.\n\nThe specific orbital energy \\(\\epsilon\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\\epsilon = -\\frac{GM}{2r}\\]\n\nfor a circular orbit.\n\nBut after the speed increase, it becomes:\n\n\\[\\epsilon' = \\frac{v'^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r}\\]\n\nwhere \\(v' = 1.01 v_c\\).\n\nSo, plugging in \\(v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\), we get:\n\n\\[\\epsilon' = \\frac{(1.01)^2 GM}{2r} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{1.0201 GM}{2r} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{1.0201 GM - 2 GM}{2r} = \\frac{0.0201 GM}{2r}\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right because it would suggest that \\(\\epsilon'\\) is positive, which would mean the orbit is unbounded, i.e., hyperbolic.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because a 1% increase in speed shouldn't cause the satellite to escape Earth's gravity.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate \\(\\epsilon'\\).\n\nGiven \\(v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\), then \\(v' = 1.01 v_c = 1.01 \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\).\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\\epsilon' = \\frac{(v')^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{(1.01)^2 \\frac{GM}{r}}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{1.0201 GM}{2r} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{1.0201 GM - 2 GM}{2r} = \\frac{0.0201 GM}{2r}\\]\n\nWait, but this still gives a positive value for \\(\\epsilon'\\), which suggests the orbit is hyperbolic, but that doesn't seem right for such a small increase in speed.\n\nMaybe I need to think in terms of small perturbations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the vis-viva equation for elliptical orbits.\n\nFor an ellipse, the specific orbital energy is:\n\n\\[\\epsilon = -\\frac{GM}{2a}\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis.\n\nIn a circular orbit, \\(a = r\\), and \\(\\epsilon = -\\frac{GM}{2r}\\).\n\nAfter the speed increase, \\(\\epsilon'\\) should be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the concept of specific angular momentum, which remains constant.\n\nIn a circular orbit, the specific angular momentum \\(h = r v_c = \\sqrt{r GM}\\).\n\nAfter the speed increase, the new velocity is \\(v' = 1.01 v_c\\), but since the direction remains the same, the angular momentum should still be \\(h = r v'\\), but that can't be right because angular momentum should be conserved.\n\nWait, but in reality, angular momentum is conserved only if there are no external torques. Here, a meteor collides with the satellite, which could change its angular momentum.\n\nBut the problem states that the instantaneous direction of the satellite's velocity does not change, meaning that the collision imparts an impulse in the direction of the velocity, increasing the speed by 1% without changing the direction.\n\nSo, the angular momentum would change because the velocity increases, but since the direction remains the same, the radial component of the velocity remains zero, and the tangential component increases by 1%.\n\nWait, but in orbital mechanics, changing the speed tangent to the orbit affects the orbital energy but not the angular momentum directly, because the radial distance isn't changing at that instant.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nMaybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the fact that in a circular orbit, the satellite is moving at the perfect speed to maintain that orbit.\n\nIf you increase the speed at one point, it will go faster there, which means it will rise higher (since it has more kinetic energy), leading to an elliptical orbit with the apogee opposite to the point of speed increase.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in orbital mechanics, if you apply a tangent impulse that increases the speed, it will cause the satellite to go into an elliptical orbit with the perigee at the point of the impulse.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the satellite is in a circular orbit of radius \\(r\\), with speed \\(v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\).\n\nAfter the collision, its speed becomes \\(v' = 1.01 v_c\\).\n\nNow, for an elliptical orbit, the vis-viva equation is:\n\n\\[\\frac{v'^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} = -\\frac{GM}{2a}\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[-\\frac{GM}{2a} = \\frac{(1.01)^2 GM}{2r} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{1.0201 GM}{2r} - \\frac{2 GM}{2r} = \\frac{0.0201 GM}{2r}\\]\n\nWait, but this would imply:\n\n\\[-\\frac{GM}{2a} = \\frac{0.0201 GM}{2r}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\frac{GM}{2a} = -\\frac{0.0201 GM}{2r}\\]\n\nThis suggests that \\(a = -\\frac{r}{0.0201}\\), which doesn't make sense because the semi-major axis can't be negative.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the specific orbital energy after the speed increase.\n\nGiven that the original specific orbital energy is \\(\\epsilon = -\\frac{GM}{2r}\\), and after the speed increase to \\(v' = 1.01 v_c\\), the new specific orbital energy is:\n\n\\[\\epsilon' = \\frac{(v')^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{(1.01)^2 (v_c)^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{1.0201 (GM/r)}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{1.0201 GM}{2r} - \\frac{2 GM}{2r} = \\frac{0.0201 GM}{2r}\\]\n\nWait, but this is positive, which would correspond to an unbounded orbit, like a hyperbola, which doesn't make sense for such a small increase in speed.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the collision increases the speed but doesn't change the direction, meaning that the velocity vector is scaled by 1.01, but the direction remains the same.\n\nIn that case, the angular momentum would change, and the orbit would become elliptical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the eccentricity of the orbit.\n\nFor a circular orbit, the eccentricity \\(e = 0\\).\n\nAfter increasing the speed, the orbit becomes elliptical with some eccentricity.\n\nI need to find the new orbit parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for an elliptical orbit, the vis-viva equation relates the speed at any point to the semi-major axis and the distance from the center.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the fact that the angular momentum is conserved.\n\nIn a circular orbit, the angular momentum per unit mass is \\(h = r v_c = \\sqrt{r GM}\\).\n\nAfter the speed increase to \\(v' = 1.01 v_c\\), the new angular momentum would be \\(h' = r v' = 1.01 \\sqrt{r GM}\\).\n\nBut angular momentum should be conserved, so \\(h' = h\\), which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, but in reality, angular momentum is conserved only if there are no external torques. Here, the collision with the meteor could impart a torque, changing the angular momentum.\n\nBut the problem states that the instantaneous direction of the satellite's velocity does not change, meaning that the collision imparts an impulse in the direction of the velocity, increasing the speed by 1% without changing the direction.\n\nSo, in this case, the angular momentum does change because the velocity increases, but since the direction remains the same, the radial component of the velocity remains zero, and the tangential component increases by 1%.\n\nI think I need to accept that angular momentum changes in this scenario.\n\nNow, to find the new orbit, perhaps I can use the fact that the orbit is determined by the energy and the angular momentum.\n\nGiven the new energy \\(\\epsilon'\\) and the new angular momentum \\(h'\\), I can find the new orbit parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis \\(a\\) is related to the energy by \\(\\epsilon = -\\frac{GM}{2a}\\), and the angular momentum by \\(h = \\sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)}\\), where \\(e\\) is the eccentricity.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the fact that in a circular orbit, increasing the speed above the circular velocity will cause the satellite to rise higher, leading to an elliptical orbit with the apogee opposite to the point of speed increase.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the fact that increasing the speed at one point in the orbit will cause the satellite to move faster there, leading to it rising higher and then falling back, creating an elliptical path.\n\nIn that case, the point of speed increase would correspond to the perigee (closest approach) of the new orbit.\n\nWait, but I think it's the opposite: increasing the speed at one point makes that point the perigee.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, in this case, point P would be the closest approach to Earth in the new elliptical orbit.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: the satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the satellite is in a circular orbit and you increase its speed at one point, it will go into an elliptical orbit with that point as the perigee.\n\nYes, that makes sense because the increased speed gives it more energy, causing it to rise higher opposite to that point.\n\nWait, no. Actually, increasing the speed at one point makes that point the perigee, and the apogee would be opposite to it.\n\nSo, in this case, P would be the perigee.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct: the satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.\n\nOption A says P is the farthest approach, which would be the apogee, but according to this reasoning, P should be the perigee.\n\nOption C says it becomes a larger circular orbit, which doesn't make sense because increasing the speed in a circular orbit should make it elliptical, not circular.\n\nOption D says it becomes a smaller circular orbit, which also doesn't make sense for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider the case if the speed was increased to the escape velocity or beyond.\n\nThe escape velocity from a circular orbit is \\(\\sqrt{2} v_c\\), which is approximately 1.414 v_c.\n\nIn this problem, the speed is increased by only 1%, to 1.01 v_c, which is much less than the escape velocity, so the satellite shouldn't escape Earth's gravity; instead, it should settle into an elliptical orbit with P as the perigee.\n\nHence, option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
