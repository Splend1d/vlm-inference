The student-defendant found several men willing to testify that the woman was promiscuous, that they had relations with her and that she was very prolific in her sexual life. Will the trial court likely permit the witnesses to testify to the woman's sexual predisposition under the Federal Rules of Evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because the rules permit evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition to test credibility.\nB. Yes, because the evidence will help the jury see that there may be two sides to the story and that the woman was thus the sexual predator instead of the man.\nC. No, because such \"sexual predisposition\" evidence is generally prohibited by the rules of evidence except under narrow exceptions.\nD. No, because the rules of evidence prohibit all evidence of a victim's prior sexual history.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether witnesses can testify about a rape victim's sexual history in court. The scenario is that a college student is charged with raping a young woman, and now he has found some guys who are willing to say that the woman is promiscuous and has had multiple sexual partners. The question is whether the court will allow this kind of testimony under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the rules say about introducing evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition in a rape case. I know that in many jurisdictions, there are specific rules to protect rape victims from having their past sexual history brought up in court because it can be really damaging and may not be relevant to the case at hand.\n\nLet me look up the Federal Rules of Evidence to see what they say about this. I think there's a rule specifically about sexual assault cases and the admissibility of evidence regarding the victim's sexual behavior.\n\nAh, here it is. Federal Rule of Evidence 412 is titled \"Sexual Assault Cases; Victim's Past Sexual Behavior and Reputation.\" It generally states that evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior is not admissible in a civil or criminal case involving alleged sexual misconduct. There are some exceptions, though.\n\nThe rule allows for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as when the evidence is about the plaintiff's past sexual behavior with the defendant, and it's offered to prove that consent was given to the alleged act. But even then, there are restrictions.\n\nIn this case, the witnesses are not testifying about the victim's past sexual behavior with the defendant but about her general promiscuity, meaning her reputation or predisposition towards sexual activity with multiple partners.\n\nSo, according to Rule 412, evidence of a victim's past sexual behavior with persons other than the defendant is generally inadmissible. That would include evidence of her general reputation for promiscuity.\n\nBut the answer options suggest that there might be some circumstances where such evidence could be admitted. Option A says yes, because the rules permit evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition to test credibility. Option B says yes, because it helps the jury see that maybe the woman was the aggressor. Option C says no, because such evidence is generally prohibited except under narrow exceptions. Option D says no, because the rules prohibit all evidence of a victim's prior sexual history.\n\nI need to think carefully about this. Rule 412 seems pretty clear that evidence of a victim's past sexual behavior with persons other than the defendant is not admissible to prove that the victim consented to the sexual activity in question. However, it might be admissible for other purposes, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\nLet me check the exceptions under Rule 412. One exception is when the evidence is about the plaintiff's past sexual behavior with the defendant, and it's offered to prove consent. But in this case, the witnesses are talking about her behavior with other people, not the defendant.\n\nAnother exception is when the evidence is about specific instances of sexual behavior by the alleged victim with third persons, to show that such behavior made the source of semen, injury, or other physical evidence uncertain. But that doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nAlso, Rule 412(b)(1) says that evidence of the victim's reputation or prior sexual behavior is not admissible to prove that the victim consented to the sexual activity charged in the offense.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the witnesses' testimony about the victim's promiscuity would not be admissible to suggest that she consented to having sex with the defendant.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Perhaps the defense could argue that her reputation for promiscuity affects her credibility, since she might have a motive to lie about the rape to cover up her sexual activities.\n\nWait, but Rule 412(c) says that evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition is not admissible to attack or support the victim's character for truthfulness. So, it seems like even using it to attack her credibility is prohibited.\n\nOption A suggests that the rules permit this evidence to test credibility, but according to Rule 412(c), that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nOption B says that the evidence helps the jury see that there are two sides to the story and that the woman was the sexual predator. This seems like an attempt to imply that because she's promiscuous, she must have consented this time too. But this is exactly the kind of reasoning that Rule 412 is designed to prevent, as it's unfair and can lead to biased judgments.\n\nOption C says that such evidence is generally prohibited except under narrow exceptions. From what I've read in Rule 412, this seems accurate. The rule generally bars evidence of a victim's past sexual behavior and reputation for promiscuity, except in specific circumstances, like when it's directly related to consent with the defendant or when it's relevant to the source of physical evidence.\n\nOption D says that the rules prohibit all evidence of a victim's prior sexual history. While Rule 412 does restrict such evidence, it's not an absolute prohibition; there are exceptions, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nGiven this, I think Option C is the most accurate answer. The trial court is unlikely to permit the witnesses to testify about the woman's sexual predisposition because such evidence is generally prohibited by the rules of evidence, except under narrow exceptions which don't seem to apply in this scenario.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. If the defense were to argue that the victim's prior consensual sexual activity with others is relevant to show that she was more likely to consent to sexual activity with the defendant, would that fly? According to Rule 412, no, because evidence of a victim's other sexual behavior isn't admissible to prove consent to the charged act, unless it's with the defendant and meets specific criteria.\n\nMoreover, allowing such evidence could lead to unfair prejudice and character attacks on the victim, which is why the rules are designed to shield victims from this kind of intrusive and potentially irrelevant questioning.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the trial court will likely not permit the witnesses to testify about the victim's sexual predisposition, and Option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
