                    "text": "So I have this problem about lead iodide, PbI2, and its solubility in water at 25\u00b0C. It says that the maximum amount that can dissolve in one liter of pure water is 1.0 mmol. And since it's assumed to completely dissociate, I need to find the solubility product, K_sp. The options are a few different values, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what K_sp represents. The solubility product constant, K_sp, is an equilibrium constant for the dissolution of a sparingly soluble salt in water. For PbI2, which dissociates into Pb\u00b2\u207a and 2I\u207b ions, the equilibrium would be:\n\nPbI2(s) \u21cc Pb\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2I\u207b(aq)\n\nSo, the K_sp expression would be:\n\nK_sp = [Pb\u00b2\u207a][I\u207b]^2\n\nGiven that 1.0 mmol of PbI2 dissolves in 1.00 L of water, that means the molar solubility, s, is 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.\n\nSince each mole of PbI2 produces 1 mole of Pb\u00b2\u207a and 2 moles of I\u207b, the concentrations at equilibrium would be:\n\n[Pb\u00b2\u207a] = s = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\n[I\u207b] = 2s = 2 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nNow, plugging these into the K_sp expression:\n\nK_sp = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-3)(2 \u00d7 10^-3)^2\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate (2 \u00d7 10^-3)^2:\n\n(2 \u00d7 10^-3)^2 = 4 \u00d7 10^-6\n\nThen, multiply by (1.0 \u00d7 10^-3):\n\n(1.0 \u00d7 10^-3)(4 \u00d7 10^-6) = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nSo, the K_sp should be 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check because the problem is offering multiple choices and I want to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nFirst, the dissociation of PbI2:\n\nPbI2(s) \u21cc Pb\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2I\u207b(aq)\n\nGiven that s = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M, and assuming complete dissociation, which is a reasonable approximation for a sparingly soluble salt at low concentrations.\n\nThen, [Pb\u00b2\u207a] = s = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\n[I\u207b] = 2s = 2.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nThus, K_sp = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-3)(2.0 \u00d7 10^-3)^2 = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-3)(4.0 \u00d7 10^-6) = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nHowever, I notice that option C is 1.0 \u00d7 10^-9, which is close but not matching our calculation. Option B is 1.0 \u00d7 10^-6, which is much larger, and option A is 1.0 \u00d7 10^-3, which is even larger. So, based on my calculation, D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the solubility or the K_sp value.\n\nAt 25\u00b0C, the temperature is constant, so no temperature effects to consider.\n\nAssuming pure water with no other dissolved ions, so no common ion effect.\n\nAlso, assuming no complex ion formation, which is likely not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the straightforward calculation should hold.\n\nSo, I conclude that the K_sp for PbI2 at 25\u00b0C is 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
