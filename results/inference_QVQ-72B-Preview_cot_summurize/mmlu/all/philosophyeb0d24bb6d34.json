                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Socrates and what he thinks about breaking out of prison. The question is saying that Socrates tells Crito he should attempt to break out of prison if and only if doing so would be:\n\nA. to his advantage.\n\nB. harmful to his enemies and advantageous to his friends.\n\nC. pleasing to the gods.\n\nD. just.\n\nAnd I need to pick which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Socrates believed about justice and breaking out of prison. I remember that in Plato's \"Crito,\" Socrates has a famous dialogue with Crito about whether he should escape from prison. Socrates is in prison, sentenced to death, and Crito comes to see him with a plan to help him escape.\n\nIn that dialogue, Socrates argues against escaping, even though he could probably do so. He says that escaping would be wrong because it would involve breaking the laws of the state, which he believes are just. He thinks that one should obey the laws and accept the consequences of one's actions.\n\nSo, according to Socrates, breaking out of prison would only be justified if it were just. That means option D: just.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: to his advantage. Well, Socrates doesn't think that just because something is advantageous, it's the right thing to do. He emphasizes doing what's right, not necessarily what's beneficial for oneself.\n\nOption B: harmful to his enemies and advantageous to his friends. Socrates doesn't seem to base his moral decisions on harm to enemies or advantage to friends. He's more concerned with absolute moral truths.\n\nOption C: pleasing to the gods. While Socrates does mention the gods in his dialogues and believes in divine knowledge, his decision not to escape in \"Crito\" is more grounded in the idea of justice and the social contract with the state.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that Socrates would only consider breaking out of prison if it were just. But wait, in the \"Crito,\" he decides not to escape because escaping would be unjust. So, in his case, he sees breaking out of prison as unjust, therefore he shouldn't do it.\n\nBut the question is phrased generally: he should attempt to break out if and only if doing so would be just. So, it's like a general principle: breaking out is permissible only if it's just.\n\nBut in the \"Crito,\" Socrates argues that breaking out would be unjust, so he shouldn't do it. Therefore, breaking out is only acceptable if it's just, which in his case, he believes it isn't.\n\nSo, according to Socrates, breaking out is only permissible if it's just, which aligns with option D.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Maybe there are exceptions or other considerations.\n\nFor example, if the laws are unjust, should one still obey them? Socrates believes in the social contract: by living in the state, one agrees to abide by its laws. He sees himself as having benefited from the state and therefore owes it obedience, even if it means accepting an unjust punishment.\n\nSo, in his view, breaking out of prison would be breaking that contract, which is unjust. Therefore, he shouldn't do it.\n\nHence, breaking out is only acceptable if it's just, meaning it doesn't violate the social contract or the laws he has agreed to follow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: just.\n\nI think that's the best conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
