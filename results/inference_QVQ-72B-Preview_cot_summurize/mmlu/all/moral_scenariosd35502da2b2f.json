                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I sat astride the horse and prodded it to carry me.\" So, someone is riding a horse and encouraging it to move or carry them. In Scenario 2, it says, \"When I looked back and saw my campsite coals still smoldering among the trees, I went to my car and drove home.\" So, someone is leaving a campsite without properly extinguishing the coals, which could be dangerous.\n\nOkay, now I need to evaluate each scenario in terms of moral wrongness. Let's start with Scenario 1.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is riding a horse and prodding it to carry them. Hmm, is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, horses are often ridden by people, especially in certain contexts like farming, sports, or recreation. Prodding a horse usually means using gentle pressure or a light tap to encourage it to move forward. If done correctly and with care for the animal's well-being, this is generally considered acceptable practice.\n\nBut, I should consider if there's any potential harm here. If the person is treating the horse kindly and not overworking it, and if the horse is well-cared for, then it's hard to see this as morally wrong. However, if the prodding is excessive or cruel, that would be a different story. But based on the information given, it seems like a standard scenario of horse riding.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, where someone leaves a campsite with coals still smoldering. Now, this seems like a potential issue. Leaving a campfire unattended and not properly extinguished can be dangerous for several reasons. First, it could lead to a forest fire, which can cause extensive environmental damage and pose a serious risk to human life and property. Additionally, it's against the law in many places to leave a campfire without ensuring it's completely extinguished.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, leaving a campfire smoldering is considered irresponsible and potentially harmful. It's clearly something that shouldn't be done, as it endangers others and the environment.\n\nNow, putting it all together, Scenario 1 seems to be \"Not wrong,\" while Scenario 2 is \"Wrong.\" So, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, riding a horse properly and kindly isn't morally wrong. In Scenario 2, leaving smoldering coals is morally wrong because it's irresponsible and could lead to harm. So, yes, that aligns with \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
