                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a survey from 2008 where 82% of 500 households said they use grocery coupons. The margin of error is 3%, and I need to figure out what that means from the given options. I'm not super confident with statistics, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a margin of error is. From what I recall, in statistics, when you conduct a survey, you're sampling a portion of the population, and there's always some uncertainty about how well that sample represents the entire population. The margin of error gives an idea of how much the results might vary from the true population value.\n\nSo, if the survey found that 82% of households use coupons with a margin of error of 3%, that probably means that the actual percentage of the entire population that uses coupons could be anywhere from 79% to 85%. But I need to see which option best describes this situation.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"Three percent of those surveyed refused to participate in the poll.\" This seems unrelated to the margin of error. The margin of error is about the precision of the estimate, not about non-response rates. So, I think this is a distractor.\n\nOption B says, \"It would not be unexpected for 3% of the population to begin using coupons or stop using coupons.\" Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. The margin of error is about the accuracy of the estimate, not about changes in behavior over time. So, I don't think this accurately describes the margin of error in this context.\n\nOption C states, \"Between 395 and 425 of the 500 households surveyed responded that they used grocery coupons.\" Okay, let's see. If 82% of 500 is 410 households, then a margin of error of 3% would correspond to plus or minus 3% of 500, which is plus or minus 15 households (since 3% of 500 is 15). So, that would be from 395 to 425 households. This seems plausible, but I need to think carefully.\n\nWait a minute, the margin of error is usually expressed in terms of the proportion or percentage, not the raw number of responses. So, in this case, the survey found that 82% use coupons with a margin of error of 3%, which means the proportion could be between 79% and 85%. But option C is talking about the number of households surveyed, not the population proportion. Maybe this is a common confusion.\n\nOption D says, \"It is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons.\" This seems to directly align with my initial understanding of the margin of error. If the survey estimate is 82% with a margin of error of 3%, then the confidence interval should be 82% plus or minus 3%, so between 79% and 85%.\n\nBut I should make sure I'm not missing something here. The margin of error is typically associated with a certain confidence level, often 95%. So, in this case, if the margin of error is 3%, it's likely that the true population proportion is within 3% of the sample proportion of 82%, at a certain confidence level.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the best description of what the margin of error means in this context. It directly relates to the range of possible population proportions based on the sample estimate and the margin of error.\n\nLet me double-check. Option A is about non-response, which isn't related to margin of error. Option B is about changes in behavior, which is also unrelated. Option C is about the number of households surveyed, which is a possible way to interpret the margin of error in terms of the sample, but the margin of error is generally about the population parameter, not the sample observations.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option D: it is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
