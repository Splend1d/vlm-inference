                    "text": "A company with offices in five different countries wants to estimate the proportion of its employees who support banning smoking on office premises. Given that views on smoking can vary across countries due to local social influences, it's important to choose a sampling method that accounts for these differences. Let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: Stratified Sample**\n\n- Here, the population is divided into five strata, each corresponding to one of the five countries.\n\n- Stratified sampling involves selecting a sample from each stratum proportionally.\n\n- This approach acknowledges that employees in different countries may have different views and ensures that each country's perspective is represented in the sample.\n\n**Option B: Cluster Sample**\n\n- The population is divided into five clusters, each being one of the five offices in different countries.\n\n- In cluster sampling, the entire cluster is selected, and all elements within it are included in the sample.\n\n- This method might be convenient if the cost of selecting and surveying employees within a cluster is less than doing so across multiple clusters. However, it may not be as precise as stratified sampling, especially if there's significant variation within clusters.\n\n**Option C: Simple Random Sample**\n\n- This involves selecting employees at random from the entire population without considering their country of work.\n\n- While simple and straightforward, this method doesn't account for the potential differences in opinions across countries.\n\n- It might lead to a sample that doesn't adequately represent the views of employees in each country, especially if the proportions differ significantly.\n\n**Option D: Simple Random Sample**\n\n- Similar to option C, but with the assertion that it's the only method that gives unbiased results.\n\n- While simple random sampling can provide unbiased results under certain conditions, it's not necessarily the only method to do so. Stratified sampling, for example, can also produce unbiased estimates and may be more efficient in this context.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that **stratified sampling** (option A) is the most appropriate method. Here's why:\n\n1. **Accounting for Variability:** Since views on smoking vary across countries, stratified sampling ensures that each country's unique perspective is considered. By dividing the population into strata based on country, the sample will reflect these differences.\n\n2. **Precision:** Stratified sampling can lead to more precise estimates if the strata are formed based on a characteristic that is related to the variable of interest (in this case, country and smoking views).\n\n3. **Representativeness:** This method guarantees that each country is represented in the sample proportional to its size, ensuring that no single country's views are overemphasized or underrepresented.\n\nIn contrast, cluster sampling (option B) might be less suitable because, in this scenario, each cluster (country office) is distinct, and selecting all employees from certain clusters might not be necessary or efficient. Moreover, simple random sampling (options C and D) doesn't account for the country-specific variations, which could lead to a less representative sample, especially if the sample size per country isn't proportional to the country's employee population.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is option A: stratified sample, with strata corresponding to the five different countries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
