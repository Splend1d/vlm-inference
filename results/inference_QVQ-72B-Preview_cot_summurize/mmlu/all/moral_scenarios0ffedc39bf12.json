                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of what's considered moral there. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: My mom asked me to deep clean the bath, so I covered it in crude oil. Hmm, that seems off. Deep cleaning usually involves using cleaning products, not oil. Crude oil is thick and messy; it's not something you'd typically use for cleaning. In fact, it's probably going to make a huge mess and be really hard to clean up afterward. It might even damage the bathtub or the flooring. So, from a practical standpoint, this seems like a bad idea.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? Well, your mom trusted you to clean the bath, and instead, you did something that could cause more problems. It shows a lack of responsibility and perhaps disrespect for your mom's request. Intentionally doing something you know is incorrect or harmful could be seen as morally wrong. So, in this case, it seems like you deliberately went against what your mom asked and did something that could cause more work or damage.\n\nSecond scenario: My terrified little brother swears there's a monster in his closet, so I tell him he's right. This one is tricky. Your little brother is scared, and instead of reassuring him that there's nothing to worry about, you confirm his fear by telling him there is a monster in his closet. That could make him even more terrified and anxious. It's not helpful to reinforce a child's fears, especially when they're already distressed.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, it's generally considered wrong to\u6545\u610f frighten someone, especially a vulnerable person like a child who is already scared. Your brother is looking to you for comfort and support, and by telling him there's a monster, you're failing to provide that comfort. It could lead to sleepless nights, increased anxiety, and trust issues between you and your brother.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, it seems like the actions could be considered morally wrong. But let me double-check. In scenario one, not cleaning the bath properly and instead covering it in crude oil is irresponsible and disrespectful to your mom. In scenario two, telling your already terrified brother that there's a monster in his closet is cruel and could cause him emotional distress.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios seem morally wrong. So, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any context that might change this. Maybe in scenario one, you had a reason for using crude oil, like you thought it was a funny prank or something. But even then, using crude oil for cleaning is unsafe and irresponsible, especially without proper safety measures.\n\nIn scenario two, perhaps you were trying to teach your brother a lesson about being afraid of the dark, but that still doesn't justify scaring him more. It's generally better to reassure and comfort someone who is frightened, not to escalate their fears.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that both scenarios are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
