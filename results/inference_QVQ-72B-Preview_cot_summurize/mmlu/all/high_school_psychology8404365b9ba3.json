                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about infant brain development and sleep. The question mentions Dr. William Sears, who is supposedly an authority on infants and child-rearing, and says that infant brain development is influenced by longer and more frequent periods of active sleeping and dreaming. It then asks what this type of sleep is called, giving options: A. REM sleep, B. NREM sleep, C. delta sleep, D. stage 3 sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what different types of sleep involve, especially in infants. I know that sleep has different stages, and some of them are more active than others. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with REM sleep: I remember that REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement, and it's a stage of sleep where we dream. It's characterized by increased brain activity and muscle paralysis to prevent us from acting out our dreams. In infants, I've heard that they spend a lot more time in REM sleep compared to adults, which might be important for brain development.\n\nNext, NREM sleep, which stands for Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep. This is the opposite of REM sleep and includes the earlier stages of sleep. It's generally quieter and less active than REM sleep. Dreams can occur during NREM sleep, but they're usually less vivid than those during REM sleep.\n\nThen there's delta sleep, which is a deep stage of NREM sleep. It's characterized by slow brain waves and is important for restorative processes in the body. Infants spend quite a bit of time in delta sleep, which is crucial for their growth and development.\n\nLastly, stage 3 sleep is another name for delta sleep, so that's essentially the same as option C.\n\nGiven that the question mentions \"active sleeping and dreaming,\" it seems like it's referring to the more active type of sleep where dreams are more frequent and vivid. REM sleep is known for its active nature and is associated with dreaming. NREM sleep is quieter, and delta sleep is deep and restorative, not typically associated with active dreaming.\n\nHowever, I should consider that in infants, the patterns might be different from adults. Maybe their NREM sleep has different characteristics. But generally, REM sleep is still considered the most active sleeping stage across different ages.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"longer and more frequent periods of active sleeping and dreaming.\" So, if REM sleep is the stage where active dreaming occurs, then it would make sense that more REM sleep is beneficial for brain development in infants.\n\nBut I should double-check. Maybe look up some information about infant sleep patterns and brain development.\n\nI recall that infants spend about 50% of their sleep in REM sleep, whereas adults only spend about 20-25%. This higher percentage in infants is thought to be important for brain maturation and development, especially for the neural connections that are forming rapidly in early life.\n\nAlso, REM sleep is involved in consolidating memories and learning, which is crucial for infants as they are constantly taking in new information about the world around them.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that REM sleep is the type of sleep that corresponds to the description in the question.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider delta sleep again. Delta sleep is important for physical restoration and growth, which is also important for infants, but the question specifically mentions active sleeping and dreaming, which align more closely with REM sleep.\n\nMoreover, dreams during delta sleep are possible but they are generally less intense and vivid compared to those during REM sleep.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer to the question is REM sleep.\n\nI think the correct choice is A. REM sleep.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ REM sleep}} \\]"
