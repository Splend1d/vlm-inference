The company provided security protection to the owner's property for two years. The owner then notified the company that he was planning to sell the cottage.

                    "text": "Alright, let's dive into this scenario. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, there's a home security protection company that offers 24-hour protection services to property owners in the area. A summer cottage owner hires them to provide security during the winter months when the house is unoccupied. The security includes periodic patrols and an \"armed response\" to any unauthorized individuals found trespassing.\n\nThis arrangement has been in place for two years. Then, the cottage owner decides to sell the property and notifies the security company to discontinue their services immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar breaks into the cottage. As the burglar is leaving with a portable television, he's spotted by a security guard from the same company. The guard, who wasn't informed that the protection services had been discontinued, shouts at the burglar to stop and threatens to shoot him. The burglar drops the TV and tries to flee, and the guard shoots him in the leg, causing a serious wound.\n\nNow, the burglar wants to sue the cottage owner for negligently failing to supervise the security services provided by the company. The question is, will the burglar likely prevail based on the given options?\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Prevail, because the burglar was unarmed when he was shot.\n\nHmm, being unarmed might be a factor, but I don't think that's the primary issue here. The burglar was committing a crime by breaking into the house and stealing property. Even if he was unarmed, the security guard might have had reason to believe he was a threat, especially if he thought the burglar was trying to escape. So, I don't think this is the main reason the burglar would prevail.\n\nB. Prevail, because the owner knew or had reason to know that the company provided an \"armed response\" to suspected trespassers.\n\nThis seems relevant. The owner had hired the security company to provide an armed response to trespassers. Although the services were discontinued, the burglar is arguing that the owner negligently failed to supervise the security services. If the owner knew that the company used armed responses and didn't properly supervise or control how that was carried out, perhaps there's a case for negligence.\n\nBut wait, the owner had discontinued the services. So, at the time of the shooting, the security company wasn't supposed to be providing any services. If the guard was still patrolling the area without authorization, is that the owner's responsibility?\n\nC. Not prevail, because the owner was not present when the shooting occurred.\n\nJust because the owner wasn't present doesn't necessarily mean they can't be held responsible. Owners can be liable for the actions of their agents or employees, even if they weren't present. So, this doesn't seem like a strong argument against the burglar's claim.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.\n\nThis is an interesting point. The owner had canceled the security services, and the shooting occurred two weeks after that cancellation. So, theoretically, the security guard shouldn't have been on the property or patrolling it at that time.\n\nIf the guard was acting outside the scope of his employment or without the authority of the security company, perhaps the owner isn't liable. However, if the guard was still under the impression that he was supposed to be patrolling the property, maybe there's some confusion or miscommunication there.\n\nBut, the owner had explicitly requested that the services be discontinued immediately. So, any actions by the guard after that point would be unauthorized.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the owner took steps to terminate the security services, so they shouldn't be responsible for any actions taken by the security guard after the services were discontinued.\n\nTherefore, the burglar would probably not prevail because the owner had discontinued the protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the owner had discontinued the services, and the guard was acting on his own without authorization, then the owner shouldn't be held liable for the guard's actions. The burglar would have to look to the security company or the guard himself for any compensation.\n\nHowever, the burglar is suing the owner for negligently failing to supervise the security services. So, perhaps there's an argument that the owner didn't properly supervise the discontinuation of services, leading to the guard still being on the property and acting in a negligent manner.\n\nBut, if the owner had properly notified the security company to stop services immediately, and the guard was acting beyond his authority, it's hard to see how the owner is negligent in supervising the security services.\n\nUnless there's some law that requires the owner to ensure that the security company has indeed stopped services, which I don't think is the case.\n\nSo, overall, I think the burglar will not prevail because the owner had discontinued the protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
