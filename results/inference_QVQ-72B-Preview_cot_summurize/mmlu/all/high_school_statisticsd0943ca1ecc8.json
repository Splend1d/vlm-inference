                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about a randomized block design for a drug trial. The pharmaceutical company is testing a new cholesterol-reducing drug against an old one. They don't think there's much association between cholesterol level and gender, but they do think there's an association between cholesterol level and the amount of exercise a person gets. So, for a randomized block design, they should:\n\nOption A: Block on gender because it's not associated with cholesterol level.\n\nOption B: Block on gender because males and females are different.\n\nOption C: Block on the type of drug because it may be associated with cholesterol level.\n\nOption D: Block on exercise level because it is associated with cholesterol level.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what a randomized block design is. I think it's a way to control for variability in the experiment by grouping similar subjects together. So, blocks are groups of experimental units that are similar in some way that might affect the response to the treatment.\n\nIn this case, the treatment is the type of drug, and the response is the change in cholesterol level.\n\nThe question mentions that cholesterol level isn't strongly associated with gender, but it is associated with exercise level.\n\nSo, if I'm to choose blocks based on some characteristic that might influence the response, I should probably block on exercise level, since it's related to cholesterol levels.\n\nLet me think about why that makes sense. If exercise level affects cholesterol levels, then by blocking on exercise level, I can control for that variability. That means within each block, all participants have similar exercise levels, and then they're randomly assigned to the new drug or the old one.\n\nThis should help in isolating the effect of the drug on cholesterol levels, without the confounding influence of different exercise levels.\n\nNow, option A suggests blocking on gender because it's not associated with cholesterol level. But that seems counterintuitive. If gender isn't associated with cholesterol level, then blocking on gender wouldn't help control for variability in cholesterol levels. In fact, it might just add unnecessary complexity without providing any benefit.\n\nOption B says to block on gender because males and females are different. Well, yes, they are different in many ways, but if those differences don't affect cholesterol levels, then blocking on gender wouldn't help with the specific outcome of interest.\n\nOption C suggests blocking on the type of drug because it may be associated with cholesterol level. But the type of drug is the treatment being tested; it's what we're trying to compare. Blocking on the treatment itself doesn't make much sense because the whole point is to randomly assign the treatment to see its effect.\n\nOption D says to block on exercise level because it's associated with cholesterol level. That seems logical. By blocking on exercise level, we can control for its influence and more accurately assess the effect of the drug.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the purpose of blocking more carefully. Blocking is used to reduce experimental error by minimizing the variability within blocks, thereby making treatment comparisons more precise.\n\nSo, if exercise level is related to cholesterol levels, then not blocking on it could introduce variability into the experiment. By blocking on exercise level, we can ensure that any differences in cholesterol reduction are more likely due to the drug and not due to differences in exercise levels between the groups.\n\nAlso, since gender isn't associated with cholesterol levels in this context, blocking on gender wouldn't help reduce variability. It might even introduce bias if, for some reason, gender is related to other factors that affect cholesterol levels, but the question states that it's not directly associated.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to block on exercise level, which is option D.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
