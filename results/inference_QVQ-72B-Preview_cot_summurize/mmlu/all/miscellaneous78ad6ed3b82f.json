                    "text": "So I have this question here about the TV show \"My Three Sons.\" I'm supposed to figure out which one of the boys is adopted. The options are Mike, Ernie, Chip, and Robbie. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this show, but let's see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"My Three Sons\" is a classic television sitcom that aired in the 1960s and 70s. It's about a widowed father raising his three sons. The father's name is Steve Douglas, and his sons are Mike, Robbie, and Chip. But wait, the question mentions Ernie. Is Ernie one of the sons? Let me think.\n\nI recall that Steve Douglas was played by Fred MacMurray, and his sons were Mike, played by Tim Considine; Robbie, played by Don Grady; and Chip, played by Stanley Livingston. But sometimes, shows add new characters or replace actors. Maybe Ernie is a later addition?\n\nLet me consider the timeline. The show ran from 1960 to 1972, which is a pretty long run. During that time, there might have been changes in the cast or additions to the family structure.\n\nI think I remember that one of the sons was adopted at some point in the series. Maybe it was Ernie? But that seems confusing because the title is \"My Three Sons,\" implying that there are three sons, and Ernie is an additional character. Wait, perhaps the number increases beyond three at some point.\n\nLet me try to recall the basic premise. Steve Douglas is a widower raising his three sons: Mike, Robbie, and Chip. As the show progresses, perhaps Steve remarries or adopts another child, introducing Ernie into the family.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the original three sons was adopted. But that seems unlikely, as they are referred to as his sons from the start.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up some information about the show to get a better understanding. Since this is a thought exercise, I'll have to rely on my memory and logical deduction.\n\nConsidering that the show is titled \"My Three Sons,\" it's probably centered around Steve and his three biological sons. If one of them was adopted, it might create some dramatic tension or unique storylines. But I think the show was more of a family comedy, so maybe adoption wasn't a significant plot point.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps Ernie is an adopted son who joins the family later in the series. That could explain why he's included in the options.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific episodes or storylines that involve adoption. I'm drawing a blank here. Maybe I need to think about the characters' backstories.\n\nI know that Steve is a widower, so his three sons are likely from his previous marriage. If he adopted another child later, that would make sense. Perhaps Ernie is that adopted child.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the original sons was adopted by Steve after their biological father passed away or something like that. But that seems less probable.\n\nAnother thought: in some shows, characters foster children or take in relatives, which might be confused with adoption. Maybe Ernie is a foster child or a relative who comes to live with the family.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions adoption, so I should focus on that.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Mike\n\nMike is the oldest son, and I think he's Steve's biological son. I don't recall any storyline where Mike was adopted. In fact, he seems to be the typical first-born character, responsible and sometimes overbearing. So, it's unlikely that Mike is adopted.\n\nB. Ernie\n\nErnie is the one I'm most unsure about since he's not one of the original three sons. Maybe he's a later addition to the family through adoption. Alternatively, perhaps he's a cousin or something who comes to live with them. But the question presents him as one of the boys, so maybe he's adopted.\n\nC. Chip\n\nChip is the youngest of the three sons. He's known for being mischievous and playful. Again, I think he's Steve's biological son. I don't remember any adoption storylines involving him.\n\nD. Robbie\n\nRobbie is the middle son, often portrayed as the peacemaker. Similar to Mike and Chip, I believe he's also Steve's biological son. No adoption there either.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most plausible answer is B. Ernie, as he's not one of the original three sons and could have been adopted into the family later in the series.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps the show had multiple seasons, and Ernie was introduced in a later season as an adopted son.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Often, TV shows introduce new characters to keep the storyline fresh. So, it's possible that Steve adopts Ernie, adding a new dynamic to the family.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ernie is a friend of the family or a neighbor's child who spends a lot of time with them, but that doesn't align with the question's phrasing.\n\nNo, the question clearly lists Ernie as one of the boys on the show, so he must be considered part of the family.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Ernie.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
