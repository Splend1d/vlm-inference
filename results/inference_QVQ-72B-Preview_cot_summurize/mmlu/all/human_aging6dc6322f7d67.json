I need to think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that cremation is a method of final disposition where a body is reduced to ashes through high-temperature incineration. It's an alternative to burial, and different cultures and religions have varying views on cremation.\n\nLet me consider each country one by one.\n\nStarting with Japan. I've heard that in Japan, cremation is very common. In fact, I think it's the most prevalent method of handling remains there. Japanese culture has a long history with Buddhism, which traditionally accepts cremation. Also, given Japan's limited land space, cremation might be a practical choice due to the high population density.\n\nNext, the USA. Here, cremation has been on the rise in recent years. More people are choosing it over traditional burial, possibly for economic reasons or environmental concerns. But I don't think it's as high as Japan's rate. Maybe in certain states, like California or Florida, cremation is more common, but overall, I suspect Japan has a higher cremation rate.\n\nThen there's Kenya. I don't know much about Kenyan funeral practices, but I believe that burial is more traditional there, especially in rural areas. Maybe in urban centers, cremation is becoming more accepted, but I doubt it's the majority method nationwide.\n\nLastly, Mexico. Mexican culture is heavily influenced by Catholicism, which historically favored burial. While cremation is allowed in Mexico, it's not as common as burial. I think most Mexicans still opt for burial.\n\nSo, comparing all these, Japan seems to have the highest cremation rate among these options. I recall reading somewhere that over 90% of Japanese choose cremation. That's way higher than the USA, which might be around 50% or so nationally. Kenya and Mexico are likely much lower.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the correct answer is Japan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Japan}} \\]"
