                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about self-instructional training for impulsive children. It's asking what this training involves, and there are four options: A, B, C, and D. I need to pick the one that best describes what self-instructional training is all about for these kids.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what self-instructional training is. From what I recall, it's a type of intervention that helps children who have trouble controlling their impulses to think before they act. It's like teaching them to talk to themselves in a way that guides their behavior towards more thoughtful actions.\n\nSo, option A says it involves helping them attend better to tasks by writing down their lesson objectives in advance. Hmm, that sounds a bit too structured and maybe more about academic planning. While writing down objectives might help with organization, I don't think it directly addresses impulse control or self-instruction. Maybe I'm missing something, but this doesn't seem like the primary focus of self-instructional training.\n\nOption B suggests changing their self-statements to increase their task-oriented behavior. This sounds more promising. Self-instructional training is about teaching children to use inner speech to guide and regulate their behavior. So, if they can change what they say to themselves, like from \"I can't do this; it's too hard\" to \"Let me try step by step; I can figure this out,\" that could help them stay on task and control their impulses better. This seems aligned with what I know about self-instructional training.\n\nOption C mentions focusing their thoughts on mood-elevating cognitions. While positive thinking can be beneficial, I'm not sure if this is the main goal of self-instructional training. The emphasis here seems to be more on improving mood rather than controlling impulses and staying focused on tasks. Maybe it's a related but not the primary aspect of the training.\n\nOption D talks about using programmed instructions to shape adaptive behavior gradually. This sounds a bit like behavior modification, where you reinforce certain behaviors over time to encourage positive changes. While this might be part of a larger treatment plan, I don't think it's specifically what self-instructional training is about. Self-instructional training is more about teaching children to manage their own behavior through self-talk, not about external programming.\n\nSo, comparing all four options, B seems to be the most accurate description of self-instructional training for impulsive children. It's directly related to changing how they talk to themselves, which in turn helps them be more task-oriented and less impulsive.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about an example. Suppose a child is impulsive and tends to blurt out answers in class without thinking. Self-instructional training would involve teaching them to pause and say to themselves something like, \"Wait a minute, let me think before I speak,\" or \"I should listen to the whole question first.\" This is changing their self-statements to be more reflective and task-focused, which matches option B.\n\nOption A, writing down lesson objectives, might help with organization and preparation, but it doesn't directly address the impulse to act without thinking.\n\nOption C, focusing on mood-elevating cognitions, might help with emotional regulation, but again, it's not specifically about controlling impulses in the context of task performance.\n\nOption D, using programmed instructions to shape behavior, sounds more like a behavioral therapy approach, perhaps using rewards or penalties to modify behavior, which isn't the same as teaching children to manage their own impulses through self-talk.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option B is the correct answer. Self-instructional training involves helping impulsive children change their self-statements to increase their task-oriented behavior.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
