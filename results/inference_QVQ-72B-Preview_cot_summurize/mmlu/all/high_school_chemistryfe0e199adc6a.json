                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about heating and mixing substances, and I need to figure out which statement is correct based on the given information. Let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a 25 g sample of some solid that's heated to 100 \u00b0C and then quickly moved into an insulated container with 100 g of water at 26 \u00b0C. After mixing, the final temperature is 37 \u00b0C. So, the solid starts at 100 \u00b0C and ends at 37 \u00b0C, while the water starts at 26 \u00b0C and ends at 37 \u00b0C.\n\nOption A says that the sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample's temperature changed more than the water's did. Hmm, that seems plausible at first glance, but I need to think carefully.\n\nOption B contradicts A by saying that even though the sample's temperature changed more, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained. This also seems possible, but I need to verify.\n\nOption C suggests that because the sample's temperature changed more, its heat capacity must be greater than that of water. Heat capacity is the amount of heat required to change a substance's temperature by one degree Celsius, so it's related to the mass and the specific heat capacity.\n\nOption D mentions that the final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures and concludes that the equilibrium constant must be less than 1. Wait, equilibrium constant? This sounds like it's mixing thermodynamics with chemical equilibrium concepts, which might not be relevant here.\n\nLet me recall the basic principles of heat transfer in isolated systems. Since the container is insulated, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, so the total heat lost by the sample should equal the total heat gained by the water. That is, heat lost by sample = heat gained by water.\n\nBut option A says the sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained, which contradicts the principle I just stated. So, option A can't be correct.\n\nOption B says that the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained, which aligns with my understanding of heat transfer in isolated systems. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C is about heat capacity. Heat capacity is given by \\(C = m \\times c\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass and \\(c\\) is the specific heat capacity. So, the total heat capacity depends on both mass and the material's specific heat capacity.\n\nGiven that the sample's temperature change is larger than that of water, but it has less mass (25 g vs. 100 g), it's not immediately clear whether its heat capacity is larger or smaller than water's. I need to do some calculations to figure this out.\n\nOption D brings in the concept of the equilibrium constant, which seems out of place here. This problem is about heat transfer, not chemical reactions, so I think this option is irrelevant.\n\nLet me try to calculate the heat lost by the sample and the heat gained by the water to verify option B.\n\nThe heat lost by the sample can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[q_{\\text{lost}} = m_{\\text{sample}} \\times c_{\\text{sample}} \\times (T_{\\text{initial,sample}} - T_{\\text{final}})\\]\n\nSimilarly, the heat gained by the water is:\n\n\\[q_{\\text{gained}} = m_{\\text{water}} \\times c_{\\text{water}} \\times (T_{\\text{final}} - T_{\\text{initial,water}})\\]\n\nSince the system is isolated, \\(q_{\\text{lost}} = -q_{\\text{gained}}\\), meaning the heat lost by the sample is equal to the heat gained by the water (ignoring any heat capacities of the container itself, but assuming it's insulated and doesn't affect the process).\n\nHowever, I don't know \\(c_{\\text{sample}}\\), so I can't directly calculate \\(q_{\\text{lost}}\\). Maybe I can express \\(c_{\\text{sample}}\\) in terms of the known quantities.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\n\\[m_{\\text{sample}} \\times c_{\\text{sample}} \\times (100 - 37) = m_{\\text{water}} \\times c_{\\text{water}} \\times (37 - 26)\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[25 \\times c_{\\text{sample}} \\times 63 = 100 \\times 4.184 \\times 11\\]\n\nWait, I think I need to solve for \\(c_{\\text{sample}}\\):\n\nFirst, calculate the right side:\n\n\\[100 \\times 4.184 \\times 11 = 4184 \\times 11 = 46024 \\text{ joules}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[25 \\times c_{\\text{sample}} \\times 63 = 46024\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(c_{\\text{sample}}\\):\n\n\\[c_{\\text{sample}} = \\frac{46024}{25 \\times 63} = \\frac{46024}{1575} \\approx 29.24 \\text{ J/g\u00b0C}\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. The specific heat capacity of most substances is much lower than that of water, which is 4.184 J/g\u00b0C. 29.24 J/g\u00b0C seems too high.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, \\(100 \\times 4.184 = 418.4\\) joules per degree, times 11 degrees is \\(418.4 \\times 11 = 4602.4\\) joules. That seems correct.\n\nThen, \\(25 \\times 63 = 1575\\), and dividing 4602.4 by 1575 gives approximately 2.92 J/g\u00b0C, not 29.24. I must have misplaced a decimal point earlier. So, \\(c_{\\text{sample}} \\approx 2.92\\) J/g\u00b0C.\n\nComparing to water's specific heat capacity of 4.184 J/g\u00b0C, the sample has a lower specific heat capacity.\n\nNow, going back to option C, which says the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than that of the water. But according to my calculation, it's less. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption B seems to be correct based on the principle of conservation of energy in an isolated system. The heat lost by the sample should equal the heat gained by the water, which aligns with option B.\n\nBut let's double-check option A to make sure. Option A claims that the sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample's temperature changed more. But according to the principle of conservation of energy, the heat lost should equal the heat gained, assuming no losses to the surroundings.\n\nMoreover, the amount of thermal energy change depends on the product of mass, specific heat capacity, and temperature change. Even though the sample has a larger temperature change, its mass is smaller, and its specific heat capacity is less than that of water. In this case, the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water, as per the calculation.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect, and option B is correct.\n\nOption D mentions the equilibrium constant being less than 1, which doesn't make sense in this context because this is a physical heat transfer problem, not a chemical equilibrium problem. So, option D is irrelevant.\n\nSo, the correct conclusion is option B: even though the sample's temperature changed more than the water's did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
