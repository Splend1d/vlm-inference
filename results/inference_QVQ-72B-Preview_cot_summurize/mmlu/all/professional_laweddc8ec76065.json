                    "text": "So I've got this contract law scenario here, and I need to figure out the best defense for the man if the woman sues him for breach of contract. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.\n\nFirst, the man mails a letter to the woman, offering to sell her his motorcycle for $1,000. So, this is an offer to sell, right? It's in writing and sent by mail.\n\nThen, the woman responds with a fax, saying, \"The price is a little high, I'll give you $800.\" Hmm, this sounds like a counteroffer. She's proposing a different price, which typically constitutes a rejection of the original offer and makes a new offer instead.\n\nThe man then replies via fax, saying, \"I will not accept $800.\" So, he's rejecting her counteroffer.\n\nThe next day, the woman calls the man and says, \"I changed my mind, I will pay $1,000 for the motorcycle.\" But the man refuses to sell it to her.\n\nNow, if the woman sues the man for breach of contract, she must be claiming that there was a binding contract between them, and the man breached it by refusing to sell the motorcycle.\n\nBut wait, the man initially offered to sell the motorcycle for $1,000, the woman made a counteroffer of $800, which was rejected by the man. Then she tried to accept the original offer of $1,000, but the man refused.\n\nSo, the question is, was there a meeting of the minds at any point to form a contract?\n\nLet me look at the options for the man's best defense:\n\nA. Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.\n\nHmm, the original offer was in writing (a letter), and the woman's acceptance was oral (over the phone). But does that matter?\n\nI recall that generally, acceptance can be communicated in any reasonable manner unless specified otherwise in the offer. So, unless the man specified that acceptance must be in writing, the woman could accept orally. So, this might not be a strong defense.\n\nB. The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.\n\nThe statute of frauds generally requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, like contracts for the sale of goods over a certain amount, I think it's $500 or $1,000, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nIn this case, the motorcycle is being sold for $1,000, which might fall under the statute of frauds if it's above the threshold. But the initial offer was in writing, so perhaps that satisfies the writing requirement.\n\nHowever, the acceptance was oral, which might not be sufficient under the statute of frauds. But I'm not entirely sure about this. Maybe I need to look this up later.\n\nC. The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\n\nThis seems interesting. When someone makes a counteroffer, does that automatically terminate their power to accept the original offer?\n\nI think that making a counteroffer generally operates as a rejection of the original offer, meaning that the offeree (the woman) can no longer accept the original terms unless the offeror (the man) revives the offer.\n\nSo, when the woman made a counteroffer of $800, she was rejecting the $1,000 offer and proposing a new one. Therefore, her power to accept the original $1,000 offer was terminated.\n\nThis means that when she later tried to accept the $1,000 offer over the phone, that acceptance was\u65e0\u6548 because the offer was no longer open for acceptance.\n\nD. The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n\nWait, the man rejected the woman's counteroffer of $800. Does that have any effect on her ability to accept the original offer?\n\nI think that rejecting a counteroffer doesn't directly affect the original offer, which had already been terminated by the woman's counteroffer.\n\nSo, this defense might not be as strong as option C.\n\nBetween options A, B, C, and D, option C seems the strongest. The woman's counteroffer terminated her power to accept the original offer, so her later acceptance was\u65e0\u6548.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any possibility that the original offer could still be accepted after making a counteroffer?\n\nI don't think so. Generally, once you make a counteroffer, you can't go back and accept the original offer unless the offeror revives it or indicates that the original offer is still open.\n\nIn this scenario, the man didn't do anything to revive the original offer after the woman's counteroffer. He just rejected her counteroffer and that was it.\n\nTherefore, the woman's attempt to accept the original offer was too late, and the man is not obligated to sell her the motorcycle.\n\nSo, if the woman sues for breach of contract, the man's best defense is that her acceptance was\u65e0\u6548 because her prior counteroffer had terminated her power to accept the original offer.\n\nOption C seems to capture that idea.\n\nOption D is close but not as accurate, because rejecting a counteroffer doesn't terminate the power to accept the original offer; it's already terminated by the counteroffer itself.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
