                    "text": "Let's tackle this tax problem step by step. So, Vale is a 50% partner in the Ball Partnership. That means Vale owns half of the partnership's profits and losses, right? The problem gives us some specific information about Vale's tax basis in Ball on January 2 of year 1, which was $60,000. But I think for this particular question, the tax basis might not be directly relevant yet.\n\nOn December 31 of year 1, Ball made a $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner. Since Vale is a 50% partner, and there are two partners (I assume), each got $10,000. But the question is about gross income included in Vale's adjusted gross income for year 1.\n\nThe Ball Partnership reported tax-exempt interest income of $80,000 and dividend income of $12,000 for year 1. Now, in partnerships, generally, each partner includes their share of the partnership's income or gains in their own taxable income, regardless of whether cash distributions are made.\n\nBut wait, the income reported by the partnership includes tax-exempt interest income. Tax-exempt income doesn't get included in taxable income, does it? So, the $80,000 of tax-exempt interest income wouldn't be included in Vale's gross income. On the other hand, dividend income is usually taxable unless there's some exception.\n\nSo, Vale's share of the dividend income would be 50% of $12,000, which is $6,000. That should be included in Vale's gross income.\n\nBut the problem mentions that Ball made a $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner. A nonliquidating distribution typically means that it's a distribution of cash proportional to each partner's interest, but it's not a liquidation of the partnership interest.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total amount of gross income from Ball that should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income. So, it's not just the dividend income, but possibly other items as well.\n\nWait a minute, the partnership had tax-exempt interest income and dividend income. Are there any other types of income that might be allocable to Vale?\n\nThe problem states that Ball did not have unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or properties that had been contributed by its partners. So, perhaps there are no adjustments related to these items.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that on January 2 of year 1, Vale's tax basis in Ball was $60,000. But again, I'm not sure if that's directly relevant to the calculation of gross income for year 1.\n\nLet me think about this again. In partnerships, each partner includes their share of the partnership's taxable income in their own taxable income. Tax-exempt income doesn't add to taxable income, but it does affect the partner's basis in the partnership.\n\nSo, if the partnership has tax-exempt income, that should increase Vale's basis in the partnership, but not his taxable income.\n\nSimilarly, dividend income is taxable unless it's qualified or something, but let's assume it's ordinary dividend income.\n\nSo, Vale's share of dividend income is $6,000, which should be included in his gross income.\n\nBut the partnership also made a $10,000 cash distribution to each partner. Since it's a nonliquidating distribution, it's typically tax-free to the extent of the partner's basis.\n\nBut does that affect Vale's gross income? Or does it only affect his basis in the partnership?\n\nI think the cash distribution reduces Vale's basis in the partnership, but doesn't directly affect his gross income unless it exceeds his basis.\n\nGiven that Vale's basis was $60,000 on January 2, and he received a $10,000 distribution, his basis would be reduced by that amount, assuming it's a return of capital.\n\nBut the question is specifically about gross income, not about the distribution.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the adjustment to basis first, and then determine the gross income.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with Vale's basis on January 2, year 1: $60,000.\n\n2. Add Vale's share of partnership income or gains:\n\n- Dividend income: 50% of $12,000 = $6,000.\n\n- Tax-exempt interest income: $80,000, but this is tax-exempt, so it doesn't add to taxable income.\n\nSo, only $6,000 is added to Vale's gross income.\n\n3. Then, consider the distribution of $10,000.\n\n- Since it's a nonliquidating distribution, it's generally tax-free to the extent of Vale's basis.\n\n- So, it reduces Vale's basis by $10,000, but since the basis was $60,000, reducing it by $10,000 makes it $50,000.\n\n- But since the distribution doesn't exceed the basis, there's no taxable gain or loss on the distribution.\n\nTherefore, the only amount included in Vale's gross income from the partnership is the $6,000 dividend income.\n\nBut looking back at the options, $6,000 is one of them (option A), but there are higher amounts. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps there are other items that need to be considered for gross income.\n\nWait, maybe the tax-exempt interest income affects the basis, and there's an adjustment needed there.\n\nLet me look up the rules for partnership allocations.\n\nIn partnerships, each partner includes their share of the partnership's income, deductions, and credits in their own tax return, regardless of whether cash is distributed or not.\n\nMoreover, tax-exempt income increases the partner's basis but is not included in gross income.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- Dividend income: $6,000 (taxable)\n\n- Tax-exempt interest income: $80,000 (increases basis but not included in gross income)\n\n- Distribution: $10,000 (reduces basis, no taxable gain if basis is sufficient)\n\nTherefore, the gross income from the partnership that Vale should include in his adjusted gross income is only the $6,000 dividend income.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the partnership made a $10,000 distribution to each partner. Is there any chance that this distribution is considered a constructive dividend or something like that? No, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distribution is in excess of Vale's share of income, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the timing of the distribution. It was made on December 31, year 1, after the income was earned.\n\nIn that case, the distribution would be reducing Vale's basis, but since his basis was $60,000, and the distribution is $10,000, his basis becomes $50,000.\n\nBut again, the distribution itself doesn't add to gross income unless it's a taxable distribution, which it's not in this case.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the tax-exempt interest income in some way.\n\nWait, tax-exempt interest income increases the partner's basis but is not included in gross income. So, Vale's basis would be increased by his share of the tax-exempt income, which is $80,000 * 50% = $40,000.\n\nSo, starting basis on January 2, year 1: $60,000.\n\nAdd: Share of tax-exempt income: $40,000 (increases basis but not gross income)\n\nAdd: Share of dividend income: $6,000 (included in gross income)\n\nTotal before distribution: $60,000 + $40,000 + $6,000 = $106,000\n\nThen, distribution of $10,000 reduces the basis to $96,000.\n\nBut for the purpose of calculating gross income for year 1, only the $6,000 dividend income is included.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. $6,000.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAlternative perspective:\n\nSometimes, distributions in excess of a partner's basis can be taxable, but in this case, the distribution is $10,000, and the basis before distribution is $106,000, so the distribution doesn't exceed the basis.\n\nTherefore, no taxable gain on the distribution.\n\nHence, the only gross income from the partnership is the $6,000 dividend income.\n\nSo, the answer is A. $6,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
