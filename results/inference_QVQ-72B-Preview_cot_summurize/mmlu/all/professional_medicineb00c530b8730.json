                    "text": "Let's dive into this case. So, we have a 10-year-old girl who's been flagged by her school nurse as possibly having Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, and it's typically caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which codes for fibrillin-1, a protein that's crucial for building supporting structures in many parts of the body.\n\nThe girl is tall for her age\u2014she's at the 95th percentile for height but only the 25th percentile for weight. She has a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. These are all signs that could be associated with Marfan syndrome.\n\nNow, molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference, but importantly, this change doesn't alter the amino acid at that particular locus. So, it's a silent mutation; the DNA sequence has changed, but the protein sequence remains the same.\n\nHer mother is 163 cm tall, which is about average height, and there's no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in her. However, the mother carries the same single nucleotide change as the daughter. Moreover, this same nucleotide change is found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. That suggests that this variation is present in a significant portion of the general population without the disease.\n\nSo, the question is, what does this single nucleotide change represent in the patient and her mother?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother.\n\nBut, given that the mother doesn't have any clinical signs of Marfan syndrome, and yet carries the same mutation, it's unlikely that this change is directly causing the disease in the patient. Moreover, the mutation is silent, meaning it doesn't change the amino acid sequence of the protein. Typically, disease-causing mutations result in changes to the protein structure or function.\n\nB. It is a polymorphism.\n\nA polymorphism is a common variation in the DNA sequence that occurs in at least 1% of the population. Given that this nucleotide change is found in 15 out of 200 individuals (which is 7.5%), it seems to be a relatively common variation. Polymorphisms are generally considered neutral and don't cause disease on their own.\n\nC. It is a sequence variant of unknown significance.\n\nThis is a category often used when a genetic change is identified, but its impact on health is not well understood. It could be a benign variation or a potential risk factor for a disease. However, in this case, since the change is silent and found in a significant portion of the population without Marfan syndrome, it's less likely to be pathogenic.\n\nD. It will change the folding of the protein.\n\nThis seems unlikely because the mutation is silent; it doesn't change the amino acid, so the primary structure of the protein remains unchanged. Changes in protein folding are typically associated with alterations in the amino acid sequence.\n\nGiven all this information, it seems that option B\u2014 it is a polymorphism\u2014 is the most fitting description for this single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Polymorphisms are common variations that are usually benign. The fact that this change is found in 15 of 200 controls (people without Marfan syndrome) suggests it's a common variant in the population and not directly associated with the disease.\n\nHowever, it's possible that this polymorphism could be in linkage disequilibrium with another mutation that causes Marfan syndrome. But in this specific case, since the mother carries the polymorphism without any clinical signs of the disease, and it's found in a significant portion of the general population, it's reasonable to conclude that this is a polymorphism.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the mutation is silent suggests that it doesn't directly affect the protein's function, which aligns with the idea that it's a benign polymorphism.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. It is a polymorphism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
