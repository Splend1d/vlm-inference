                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"In 1960, Nazi official Adolph Eichmann was finally captured in what country?\" And the options are Brazil, East Germany, Argentina, and Paraguay. Hmm, I need to figure out where Eichmann was captured. I'm not super familiar with all the details of his capture, but I think he was hiding in South America after World War II.\n\nLet me think about this. I recall that many Nazi officials fled to South America after the war, places like Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. There was a whole network that helped them escape prosecution for their crimes. Eichmann was one of them, and I think he was living under a\u5047\u540d in one of these countries.\n\nI remember learning about Operation Finale, which was the Israeli intelligence operation that led to Eichmann's capture. The Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, found and kidnapped him, then brought him back to Israel for trial. That was a big deal because it was the first time Israel had captured and tried a major Nazi war criminal.\n\nBut specifically, which country was he in when he was captured? Let me see. I think it was Argentina. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Argentina. I think he was living in Buenos Aires or somewhere nearby, and the Mossad agents posed as tourists or something to capture him.\n\nWait, but I should double-check that. Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. Let me think of another way to confirm this.\n\nI recall that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina using a pseudonym, and that he was working in a factory or something similar. Then, Israeli agents confirmed his identity and abducted him from his home.\n\nThere was some controversy about this because Israel didn't have diplomatic relations with Argentina at the time, so they were operating without the permission of the local authorities. But Israel justified it by saying they were bringing a war criminal to justice.\n\nAlso, I think that after his capture, Eichmann was tried in Jerusalem, found guilty of war crimes, and executed. That was a significant event in the 1960s, and it brought a lot of attention to the Holocaust and the fate of Jewish people during World War II.\n\nSo, based on what I remember, I would say that Eichmann was captured in Argentina. Let me just make sure I'm not mixing him up with another Nazi fugitive who might have been captured in a different country.\n\nFor example, Josef Mengele, another infamous Nazi official, also fled to South America and lived for many years in Brazil before he died. But that's Mengele, not Eichmann.\n\nAnother one was Ernst Barbie, who was extradited from Bolivia to France for trial. So, different person, different country.\n\nTherefore, I think I'm on the right track with Eichmann being captured in Argentina.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that he could have been in one of the other countries listed.\n\nBrazil: As I mentioned, Mengele was in Brazil, but I don't recall Eichmann being there.\n\nEast Germany: That seems unlikely because East Germany was part of the Communist bloc, and Eichmann was a Nazi, so they wouldn't have been allies.\n\nParaguay: I don't remember any significant Nazi presence there, although it's possible some fugitives hid there.\n\nGiven that, I think Argentina is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
