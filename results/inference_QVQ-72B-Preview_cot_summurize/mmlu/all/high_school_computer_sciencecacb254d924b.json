                    "text": "So I need to figure out how a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack differs from a regular denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The options are:\n\nA. The goal of the attack\n\nB. The number of computers being attacked\n\nC. The number of computers launching the attack\n\nD. The time period in which the attack occurs\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a DoS attack is. From what I recall, a DoS attack is when an attacker floods a computer system or network with so much traffic or requests that it can't handle them all, causing the system to slow down or crash. This prevents legitimate users from accessing the services provided by that system.\n\nNow, a DDoS attack seems similar but with a twist. The \"distributed\" part suggests that it involves multiple systems or locations. So, probably, instead of just one attacker sending traffic, there are multiple computers or devices sending traffic to the target.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The goal of the attack.\n\nI need to consider if the goal is different between DoS and DDoS attacks. From what I know, both types of attacks aim to make a service unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic or requests. So, the goal seems to be the same. Therefore, this can't be the primary difference.\n\nOption B: The number of computers being attacked.\n\nThis seems a bit vague. If I interpret \"the number of computers being attacked\" as the number of targets, then both DoS and DDoS attacks can target one or multiple systems. However, DDoS attacks are often used to target larger networks or servers because they can handle more traffic. But I don't think that's the main difference. Maybe it's about the scale, but it's not the primary distinguishing factor.\n\nOption C: The number of computers launching the attack.\n\nThis seems promising. In a DoS attack, typically a single system or a small number of systems are used to flood the target. In contrast, a DDoS attack uses a network of multiple compromised computers or devices (often called a botnet) to simultaneously attack the target. This means that the attack traffic comes from many different sources, making it much harder to defend against because blocking one source doesn't stop the others.\n\nOption D: The time period in which the attack occurs.\n\nThis seems unrelated to the primary difference between DoS and DDoS attacks. Both types of attacks can occur over varying time periods, from minutes to hours or even days. The duration isn't what defines the difference between them.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems that the main difference is the number of computers launching the attack. In a DDoS attack, multiple systems work together to flood the target, whereas in a DoS attack, it's typically a single system or a small number of systems.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. The number of computers launching the attack.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another perspective. Maybe the number of computers being attacked is different, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Both can target a single system or multiple systems depending on the attacker's goals and capabilities.\n\nAlso, the goal is the same for both: to deny service to legitimate users. So, option A is definitely not the difference.\n\nOption D doesn't make much sense because the time period can vary in both types of attacks.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
