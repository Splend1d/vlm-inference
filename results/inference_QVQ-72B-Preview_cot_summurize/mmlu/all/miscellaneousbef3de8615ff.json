Daihatsu. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these companies used to make Datsun cars.\n\nFirst off, I know that Datsun was a famous brand, especially popular in the 1970s and 1980s. I think they made cars like the 240Z and the 510, which were pretty iconic back then. But I don't remember which company produced them.\n\nLet me think about this. I know that Nissan is a big Japanese carmaker that's been around for a long time. They make a lot of different models, from sedans to SUVs. But did they used to be called Datsun?\n\nWait, maybe Datsun was a subsidiary of Nissan or something like that. I recall that sometimes car companies have different brands under their name. For example, Toyota has Lexus, and Honda has Acura. Maybe Datsun was Nissan's way of targeting a different market segment.\n\nLet me consider the other options. Mazda is also a well-known Japanese carmaker, known for cars like the Miata and the CX-5. But I don't think they ever made Datsun cars. Similarly, Toyota is huge, making everything from Corollas to Camrys, and Daihatsu is known for smaller cars and kei cars in Japan. But neither of these seems to ring a bell with Datsun.\n\nI think I should look up some information about the history of Datsun to see which company it was associated with. Maybe find out when the Datsun brand started and ended, and who owned it during that time.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Datsun was indeed a brand of Nissan Motors. It seems that Nissan used the Datsun name for their exports before deciding to sell cars under the Nissan name globally. So, in the past, Datsun was Nissan's export brand, and they sold cars in various markets outside of Japan under that name.\n\nI also learn that in the 1980s, Nissan phased out the Datsun name and started using Nissan worldwide. So, that's why I might not have heard of Datsun recently; it's been rebranded as Nissan.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check if any of the other companies had any involvement with Datsun. From what I can see, Mazda, Toyota, and Daihatsu were separate entities and never part of Nissan's group. They each had their own brands and models, none of which were Datsun.\n\nSo, based on this information, it's clear that Nissan was the car company that manufactured and sold the Datsun line of automobiles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
