Go down a slippery slope.\n\nC. Treat disease.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nHmm, let's start by understanding what therapeutic cloning is. I know that cloning in general involves creating a genetically identical copy of an organism, but there are different types of cloning with different purposes.\n\nReproductive cloning is when you clone an entire organism to produce a baby, like the famous cloned sheep Dolly. But that's not what this question is about.\n\nTherapeutic cloning, on the other hand, sounds like it's more related to medicine and treating diseases. So, option C seems plausible, but I should make sure.\n\nLet me think about this. If therapeutic cloning is about treating disease, then it probably involves using cloned cells or tissues for medical purposes, right? For example, maybe creating stem cells that can be used to replace damaged tissue in patients with certain diseases.\n\nWait, but option A says \"produce and raise a child.\" That sounds more like reproductive cloning, not therapeutic cloning. So, maybe A is incorrect for therapeutic cloning.\n\nOption B, \"go down a slippery slope,\" seems odd. It sounds like it's referring to some ethical concern, perhaps suggesting that therapeutic cloning could lead to unethical practices or a series of undesirable consequences. But that doesn't seem to be the primary goal of therapeutic cloning; it's more about the potential risks or ethical issues that could arise from its use.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between the options, I'd say that the goal of therapeutic cloning is to treat disease, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if any of the other options could be considered correct in some contexts.\n\nOption A: Producing and raising a child is definitely the goal of reproductive cloning, not therapeutic cloning.\n\nOption B: The \"slippery slope\" argument is often used in ethics to suggest that taking a certain action could lead to a chain of events with negative outcomes. While there may be ethical debates around therapeutic cloning, this isn't its primary goal.\n\nOption D: None of the above seems like a default choice if none of the options fit, but in this case, since option C seems appropriate, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nSo, my final answer is C: Treat disease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
