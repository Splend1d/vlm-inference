                    "text": "So I have this problem here about calculating the tax shield in a levered firm. The value of the firm is $5 million, and if it were unlevered, its value would be $4.78 million. Additionally, the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000. I need to find the value of the tax shield from these pieces of information.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the tax shield is in the context of corporate finance. The tax shield is the benefit a firm gets from deducting interest expenses on debt, which reduces the amount of income tax the firm has to pay. Essentially, because interest payments are tax-deductible, taking on debt can increase the firm's value.\n\nThere's a famous formula by Modigliani and Miller that relates the value of a levered firm to the value of an unlevered firm plus the present value of the tax shield, minus any costs associated with leverage, like bankruptcy and agency costs.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nValue of levered firm = Value of unlevered firm + PV of tax shield - PV of bankruptcy and agency costs\n\nIn this problem, I'm given the value of the levered firm ($5 million) and the value of the unlevered firm ($4.78 million), and the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs ($360,000). I need to solve for the PV of the tax shield.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\n$5 million = $4.78 million + PV of tax shield - $360,000\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but let's be careful with the signs.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for PV of tax shield:\n\nPV of tax shield = $5 million - $4.78 million + $360,000\n\nCalculating that:\n\n$5,000,000 - $4,780,000 = $220,000\n\nThen, $220,000 + $360,000 = $580,000\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right because $580,000 is one of the options, but I need to make sure I'm understanding the relationship correctly.\n\nLet me double-check the formula. The standard Modigliani-Miller proposition II with taxes is:\n\nValue of levered firm = Value of unlevered firm + PV of tax shield\n\nBut in this problem, there are also bankruptcy and agency costs, which are costs of leverage, so the formula adjusts to subtract those costs.\n\nSo, Value of levered firm = Value of unlevered firm + PV of tax shield - PV of bankruptcy and agency costs\n\nGiven that, plugging in the numbers:\n\n$5,000,000 = $4,780,000 + PV of tax shield - $360,000\n\nSolving for PV of tax shield:\n\nPV of tax shield = $5,000,000 - $4,780,000 + $360,000\n\nWhich is $220,000 + $360,000 = $580,000\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the tax shield should be adding value, and the costs are subtracting. Wait, no, the formula is correct as is.\n\nLet me see: Value of levered firm = Value of unlevered firm + PV of tax shield - PV of bankruptcy and agency costs\n\nGiven that, and plugging in the numbers, I get $5,000,000 = $4,780,000 + PV of tax shield - $360,000\n\nSolving for PV of tax shield:\n\nPV of tax shield = $5,000,000 - $4,780,000 + $360,000 = $580,000\n\nBut looking back at the options, $580,000 is one of the choices, but I have a feeling that it might not be the correct one.\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to think about the relationship differently. Perhaps the tax shield is already net of the bankruptcy and agency costs in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the difference between the levered and unlevered firm values already accounts for the tax shield minus the costs.\n\nLet me see: Value of levered firm - Value of unlevered firm = PV of tax shield - PV of bankruptcy and agency costs\n\nGiven that, $5,000,000 - $4,780,000 = $220,000, which would be equal to PV of tax shield - PV of bankruptcy and agency costs\n\nTherefore, PV of tax shield = $220,000 + $360,000 = $580,000\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nBut looking back at the options, $580,000 is one of them, but perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me try another way. Maybe I can use the concept of WACC or something similar, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tax shield is simply the difference between the levered and unlevered firm values plus the bankruptcy and agency costs.\n\nWait, no, that's essentially what I did before.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other formula or concept that applies here.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the tax rate or the cost of debt, but that information isn't provided in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tax shield is a component that needs to be calculated based on the interest deductions over time, but again, without knowing the debt level or the tax rate, that's not feasible.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, Value of levered firm = Value of unlevered firm + PV of tax shield - PV of bankruptcy and agency costs\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n$5,000,000 = $4,780,000 + PV of tax shield - $360,000\n\nSolving for PV of tax shield:\n\nPV of tax shield = $5,000,000 - $4,780,000 + $360,000 = $580,000\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $580,000, which is option D.\n\nBut I have a nagging feeling that perhaps I've misapplied the formula.\n\nLet me check with actual numerical calculations to verify.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the tax shield is indeed $580,000.\n\nThen, plugging back into the formula:\n\nValue of levered firm = $4,780,000 + $580,000 - $360,000 = $4,780,000 + $220,000 = $5,000,000, which matches the given value.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the tax shield is less than $580,000, say $220,000, then:\n\nValue of levered firm = $4,780,000 + $220,000 - $360,000 = $4,780,000 - $140,000 = $4,640,000, which is not the given $5,000,000.\n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, $580,000 seems to be the correct value for the tax shield.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking it, and the correct answer is indeed $580,000.\n\nAlright, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{580,000} \\]"
