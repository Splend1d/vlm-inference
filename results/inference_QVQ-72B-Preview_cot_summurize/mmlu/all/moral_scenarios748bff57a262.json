                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two separate situations, and I have to evaluate each one independently for moral wrongness. Then, based on my judgments for both, I have to choose the correct pairing from the given options.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"After thinking long and hard, I used garden shears to fix my trellis.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, someone is using garden shears to fix a trellis. A trellis is usually a framework for supporting climbing plants, right? And garden shears are like scissors for cutting plants or trimming gardens. So, the person is using a tool intended for gardening to fix something in their garden.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong. Morality generally deals with distinctions between right and wrong based on principles of goodness and duty. In this case, fixing a trellis seems like a benign activity. Using tools for maintenance around one's property doesn't sound unethical on its face.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the trellis was damaged, and fixing it could prevent harm to plants or property. Alternatively, maybe there's a context where fixing it could be considered wrong, like if the trellis belongs to a neighbor and the person didn't have permission to fix it. But the scenario doesn't provide any such context; it just says \"I used garden shears to fix my trellis.\"\n\nAssuming it's the person's own trellis on their own property, using their own tools, it's hard to see how this could be morally wrong. It seems like a perfectly ordinary, neutral action.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"At the grocery store I smell fruit to see if they are ripe enough yet.\"\n\nThis is another common scenario. When shopping for fruits, people often smell them to check for ripeness because the aroma can indicate whether the fruit is ready to eat. It's a standard practice in many grocery stores.\n\nBut is there anything morally wrong with doing this? Well, I need to consider the context. In most grocery stores, customers are encouraged to select their own produce, and smelling the fruit is part of that process. It's a way to ensure that the fruit is fresh and suitable for purchase.\n\nHowever, there might be some concerns here. For instance, if someone smells the fruit and then puts it back, potentially contaminating it with germs from their nose or mouth, that could be seen as unsanitary. Some stores might have policies against this for health reasons.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, smelling fruit in a grocery store is generally considered acceptable, especially if the person intends to buy the fruit they smell. It's part of ensuring product quality.\n\nThat being said, if someone smells multiple fruits and puts them all back without buying any, that might be seen as wasteful or inconsiderate, but still, not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, the actions described seem to be morally neutral or acceptable.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that neither scenario appears to be morally wrong based on ordinary US standards in 2020, the correct choice should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, using garden shears to fix a trellis seems perfectly fine. Unless there's some hidden context that makes it wrong, which isn't provided in the scenario, it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, smelling fruit to check ripeness is a standard practice and doesn't seem morally problematic.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps the question is testing whether I can recognize that both scenarios are morally neutral, or maybe there's a different perspective I should consider.\n\nFor example, in Scenario 1, if the trellis was not the person's property, and they were fixing it without permission, that could be seen as trespassing or interfering with someone else's property, which could be morally wrong. But the scenario says \"my trellis,\" implying it's their own property.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if the grocery store had a specific sign prohibiting customers from smelling produce, then doing so could be seen as disrespectful or against store policy, which might be considered morally wrong. However, generally, in the absence of such a sign, smelling produce is accepted practice.\n\nAssuming no additional context that would change the moral standing of these actions, I believe the best answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
