Let's see, option A says it's to regulate access to posts in the field. Hmm, that sounds a bit vague. Maybe it's about ensuring that only qualified people can work in public relations positions. But is that the main purpose?\n\nOption B talks about creating an elite of public relations practitioners. That seems a bit off to me. Licensing is usually about setting standards and ensuring competence, not necessarily creating an elite group. So, maybe that's not the primary goal.\n\nOption C says to preserve the well-being of society. That sounds noble and important. Public relations can have a significant impact on how information is disseminated and perceptions are formed, so maybe licensing helps ensure that practitioners act ethically and in the public's best interest.\n\nOption D is about achieving better wages for licensed practitioners. While licensing might lead to better wages because it certifies a certain level of skill and knowledge, I don't think that's the main purpose. It seems more like a side effect rather than the primary goal.\n\nLet me think about this again. Licensing in many professions is about protecting the public by ensuring that practitioners meet certain standards of knowledge and competence. In public relations, where professionals are involved in communicating with the public, media relations, and managing reputations, it's crucial that they understand ethical practices and the potential impact of their work on society.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I think option C, preserving the well-being of society, is the most accurate answer. Licensing helps maintain professional standards, ensures ethical practice, and ultimately protects the public from incompetent or unethical practitioners. That aligns well with the role of licensing in other professions like medicine, law, or engineering.\n\nI don't think it's just about regulating access to posts (option A), although that's part of it. It's more about ensuring that those who have access to certain positions are qualified and competent. Creating an elite (option B) seems beside the point; licensing is about breadth of qualified professionals, not a select few. And as for option D, while licensing might lead to better wages, that's more of an outcome for the practitioners rather than the purpose of licensing itself.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: to preserve the well-being of society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
