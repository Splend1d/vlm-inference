                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find out how many ways there are to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, with the condition that all three cards must be of different suits. And since the order doesn't matter, I should consider combinations, not permutations.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of a standard deck. There are 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards.\n\nThe problem asks for selecting 3 cards, each from a different suit. So, I need to choose 3 different suits and then select one card from each of those suits.\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n1. Choose 3 suits out of the 4 available suits.\n\n2. For each of these 3 suits, choose 1 card from the 13 available in each suit.\n\nSince the order doesn't matter, the way I select these cards should be in combinations.\n\nLet's start with step 1: Choosing 3 suits out of 4.\n\nThis is a combination problem: C(4,3) = 4. There are 4 ways to choose which 3 suits to select.\n\nNow, for each of these 3 suits, I need to choose 1 card from each suit. Since there are 13 cards in each suit, and I'm choosing 1 from each, the number of ways to choose 1 card from each of the 3 suits is 13 * 13 * 13 = 2197.\n\nBut wait, since the order doesn't matter, I need to account for the fact that choosing cards from different suits in different orders would be considered the same combination.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps I should treat this as a product of selecting one card from each of three different suits, without considering the order.\n\nLet me consider that for each combination of 3 suits, I have 13 choices from each suit, and since the suits are different, the choices are distinct.\n\nSo, for each of the 4 combinations of 3 suits, I have 13 choices from the first suit, 13 from the second, and 13 from the third.\n\nTherefore, for each combination of 3 suits, there are 13^3 = 2197 ways to choose the cards.\n\nSince there are 4 ways to choose the 3 suits, the total number of ways is 4 * 2197.\n\nLet me calculate that: 4 * 2197 = 8788.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about selecting the first card, then the second, and then the third, making sure that each card is from a different suit.\n\nSince the order doesn't matter, I should divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 cards, which is 3!.\n\nSo, starting with the first card: I can choose any card from the deck, which is 52 choices.\n\nThen, for the second card, I need to choose from a different suit. There are 39 cards from the remaining suits (since 13 cards are from the same suit as the first card).\n\nThen, for the third card, I need to choose from the last remaining suit, which has 13 cards.\n\nSo, the total number of ordered ways is 52 * 39 * 13.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, I need to divide by 3! (which is 6) to account for the different orders of the same three cards.\n\nSo, the number of combinations is (52 * 39 * 13) / 6.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 52 * 39: 52 * 40 is 2080, and 52 * 1 is 52, so 2080 - 52 = 2028.\n\nThen, 2028 * 13: 2000 * 13 is 26000, and 28 * 13 is 364, so 26000 + 364 = 26364.\n\nNow, divide by 6: 26364 / 6 = 4394.\n\nWait, this gives me 4394, which is different from the previous result of 8788. There must be something wrong with this approach.\n\nLet me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered choosing 3 suits, then choosing one card from each suit, which gave me 4 * 2197 = 8788.\n\nIn the second approach, I considered selecting the first card (52 options), then the second from a different suit (39 options), and the third from the remaining suit (13 options), and then dividing by 6 to account for the order not mattering, which gave me 4394.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the second approach is incorrect because when selecting the first card, then the second from a different suit, and the third from the remaining suit, and then dividing by 6, it might be overcompensating for the order.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nActually, when selecting without regard to order, the correct combination formula should be:\n\nFirst, choose 3 suits out of 4: C(4,3) = 4.\n\nThen, for each suit, choose 1 card out of 13: 13^3 = 2197.\n\nThen, since the order of the suits doesn't matter, I need to account for the different permutations of the same three suits.\n\nWait, but in combinations, when you choose 3 suits out of 4, C(4,3) already accounts for the order not mattering.\n\nSo, multiplying C(4,3) by 13^3 should give the correct number of ways.\n\nThat gives 4 * 2197 = 8788.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFirst, choose the three suits in any order: C(4,3) = 4.\n\nThen, for each of these combinations, choose one card from each suit: 13^3 = 2197.\n\nTherefore, total ways: 4 * 2197 = 8788.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the number of ways to assign a unique suit to each card position, but since order doesn't matter, I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Calculate the number of ordered selections and then divide by the number of orders.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of ordered ways to choose 3 different suits and one card from each: C(4,3) * (13^3) = 4 * 2197 = 8788.\n\nThen, since order doesn't matter among the three cards, divide by 3! (6).\n\nSo, 8788 / 6 = 1464.666..., which can't be right because the number of combinations can't be a fraction.\n\nWait, that can't be. There must be an error in this approach.\n\nActually, I think I'm confusing permutations and combinations here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nConsider that I'm choosing 3 cards, each from a different suit.\n\nFirst, choose the three suits: C(4,3) = 4.\n\nThen, for each of these three suits, choose one card: 13^3 = 2197.\n\nTherefore, total combinations: 4 * 2197 = 8788.\n\nAlternatively, think about it as:\n\nFirst, pick any card (52 options).\n\nThen, pick a card from a different suit. There are 39 cards that are from the remaining three suits.\n\nThen, pick a card from the last remaining suit: 13 options.\n\nSo, total ordered ways: 52 * 39 * 13.\n\nBut since order doesn't matter, divide by 3! (6).\n\nSo, (52 * 39 * 13) / 6 = 4394.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous result of 8788.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI think the first approach is correct because in the second approach, when you divide by 6, you're correcting for the permutations of the same three cards, but in reality, when you choose cards from different suits, each ordered selection corresponds to a unique combination.\n\nWait, perhaps neither is correct.\n\nLet me try to think of it differently.\n\nConsider that I'm choosing 3 cards, each from a different suit.\n\nFirst, choose the three suits: C(4,3) = 4.\n\nThen, for each suit, choose one card: 13^3 = 2197.\n\nTherefore, total ways: 4 * 2197 = 8788.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as selecting the suits first and then the cards.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Choose 3 suits out of 4: C(4,3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: For each of these 3 suits, choose 1 card: 13^3 = 2197.\n\nTotal combinations: 4 * 2197 = 8788.\n\nAlternatively, think about selecting the cards in sequence, ensuring that each is from a different suit.\n\nFirst card: 52 options.\n\nSecond card: must be from one of the remaining 3 suits, so 39 options.\n\nThird card: must be from the last remaining suit, so 13 options.\n\nTotal ordered ways: 52 * 39 * 13.\n\nBut since order doesn't matter, divide by 3! (6).\n\nSo, (52 * 39 * 13) / 6 = 4394.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous result.\n\nI think the error in the second approach is that when you divide by 6, you're correcting for the permutations of the same three cards, but in reality, each ordered selection corresponds to a unique combination because the suits are distinct.\n\nIn other words, choosing card A from suit 1, card B from suit 2, and card C from suit 3 is different from choosing card B from suit 2, card C from suit 3, and card A from suit 1, even if the suits are the same.\n\nWait, no. If the order doesn't matter, then these two selections are considered the same.\n\nBut in reality, since the suits are distinct, and the cards are distinct, the order in which they are chosen shouldn't matter.\n\nI think the first approach is more accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of ways is 8788.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8788\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 2197\n\nD. 21\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 8788.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 8788} \\]"
