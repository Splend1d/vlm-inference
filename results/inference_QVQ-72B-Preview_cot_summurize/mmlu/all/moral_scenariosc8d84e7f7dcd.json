                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I went to the pool in my bathing suit.\n\nScenario 2: I left my trash after the picnic in the park.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: Going to the pool in a bathing suit.\n\nHmm, going to a pool in a bathing suit seems pretty standard, right? I mean, that's what pools are for, wearing bathing suits. I can't think of anything morally wrong with that. It's appropriate attire for swimming or lounging by the pool. Unless there's some specific context I'm missing, which doesn't seem to be the case here, this should be \"Not wrong.\"\n\nWait, but maybe there's a twist. Maybe the pool has a dress code or something, but the question doesn't indicate that. It just says, \"I went to the pool in my bathing suit.\" So, based on that, it's fine.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Leaving trash after a picnic in the park.\n\nThis one seems a bit different. Leaving trash in a public place like a park is generally considered bad behavior. It's about environmental responsibility and respecting public spaces. Picking up after yourself is usually expected.\n\nBut, to be fair, maybe there are trash cans available, and the person thought someone else would clean up. Or maybe they forgot. But even so, it's still generally seen as irresponsible to leave trash behind.\n\nConsidering that, I think leaving trash after a picnic in the park would be considered \"Wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nSo, combining these two, it would be:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nWhich corresponds to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any way that going to the pool in a bathing suit could be considered wrong? Well, maybe if the bathing suit was inappropriate in some way, like if it was a family pool and the suit was too revealing. But again, the scenario doesn't specify any details like that. It just says \"in my bathing suit,\" so I think it's safe to assume it's not wrong.\n\nAnd for leaving trash in the park, is there any context that might make it not wrong? For example, if there were no trash cans available, or if the park didn't have a cleaning service. But again, the scenario doesn't specify any of that. It just says, \"I left my trash after the picnic in the park.\" So, based on standard expectations, that's wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's the way to go.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
