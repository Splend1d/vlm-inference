                    "text": "So the problem is about increasing the number of days in a school year by 5%. Right now, there are 180 days in a school year. They want to add a 5% increase to that. The options are 181, 183, 185, or 189 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 5% increase means. Percentage increase is calculated on the current amount. So, if there are 180 days now, a 5% increase would mean adding 5% of 180 to the original 180 days.\n\nLet me recall how to calculate percentage increase. The formula is:\n\nIncreased Amount = Original Amount + (Percentage Increase * Original Amount)\n\nOr, Increased Amount = Original Amount * (1 + Percentage Increase)\n\nIn this case, the percentage increase is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal form.\n\nSo, Increased Amount = 180 * (1 + 0.05) = 180 * 1.05\n\nNow, I need to calculate 180 multiplied by 1.05.\n\nLet me think about how to do this multiplication.\n\nOne way is to break it down:\n\n180 * 1 = 180\n\n180 * 0.05 = 9\n\nSo, 180 * 1.05 = 180 + 9 = 189 days\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate 5% of 180 and then add it to the original amount.\n\n5% of 180 is (5/100) * 180 = 9 days.\n\nSo, 180 + 9 = 189 days.\n\nThat matches the first calculation.\n\nBut, I should consider if the increase is being applied correctly. Is the increase directly on the number of days, or is there another factor involved?\n\nThe problem says, \"a 5% increase in the number of days in a school year.\" It doesn't mention any other factors, so I think it's a straightforward percentage increase.\n\nLet me see if 189 days makes sense. If 5% of 180 is 9, then adding that to 180 gives 189. That seems logical.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret the increase.\n\nSuppose the increase is based on a different reference point, but the problem clearly states it's a 5% increase in the number of days in a school year, currently at 180 days.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the proposed school year would be 189 days long.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 181 days\n\nB. 183 days\n\nC. 185 days\n\nD. 189 days\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 189 days.\n\nBut, to make sure, perhaps there's a different approach to solve this problem.\n\nMaybe using proportions or another method.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for percentage increase again.\n\nIncreased Amount = Original Amount * (1 + Percentage Increase/100)\n\nWhich is what I did earlier: 180 * (1 + 5/100) = 180 * 1.05 = 189 days.\n\nAnother way could be to use decimals directly.\n\n5% is 0.05, so 180 * 1.05 = 189.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the problem in terms of decimals.\n\nIf 100% represents the current 180 days, then a 5% increase would make it 105% of 180.\n\n105% of 180 is 1.05 * 180 = 189 days.\n\nYes, consistent results across different methods.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me check the other options to see why they might be incorrect.\n\nA. 181 days: That would be a 0.55% increase approximately (181 - 180 = 1, which is about 0.55% of 180). Not a 5% increase.\n\nB. 183 days: That would be a 1.67% increase approximately (183 - 180 = 3, which is 1.67% of 180). Still not 5%.\n\nC. 185 days: That would be a 2.78% increase approximately (185 - 180 = 5, which is 2.78% of 180). Not 5%.\n\nD. 189 days: As calculated, this matches a 5% increase.\n\nTherefore, D. 189 days is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 189 \\ \\text{days}} \\]"
