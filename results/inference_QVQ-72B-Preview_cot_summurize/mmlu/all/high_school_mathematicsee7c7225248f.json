                    "text": "So I've got this problem here that involves some kind of conversion between these units called daps, yaps, and baps. It says that 4 daps equal 7 yaps, and 5 yaps equal 3 baps. The question is asking how many daps equal 42 baps. Okay, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between these units. We have two equations here:\n\n1. 4 daps = 7 yaps\n\n2. 5 yaps = 3 baps\n\nI need to find a way to relate daps directly to baps so I can find out how many daps equal 42 baps.\n\nMaybe I can express everything in terms of yaps first, since yaps appears in both equations.\n\nFrom the first equation, 4 daps = 7 yaps. If I want to find out how many yaps are in one dap, I can divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ dap} = \\frac{7}{4} \\text{ yaps}\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if I have the number of yaps in terms of daps.\n\nNow, from the second equation, 5 yaps = 3 baps. Similarly, to find out how many baps are in one yap, I can divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ yap} = \\frac{3}{5} \\text{ baps}\n\\]\n\nNow, if I want to find out how many baps are in one dap, I can combine these two relationships.\n\nSince 1 dap = \\(\\frac{7}{4}\\) yaps, and 1 yap = \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) baps, then:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ dap} = \\frac{7}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{5} \\text{ baps} = \\frac{21}{20} \\text{ baps}\n\\]\n\nWait, but that's not directly helpful because the question is asking for how many daps equal 42 baps. So, if 1 dap equals \\(\\frac{21}{20}\\) baps, then how many daps make 42 baps?\n\nLet me set up an equation for that.\n\nLet\u2019s say the number of daps is \\(x\\), then:\n\n\\[\nx \\times \\frac{21}{20} = 42\n\\]\n\nNow, solving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{42}{\\frac{21}{20}} = 42 \\times \\frac{20}{21} = \\frac{840}{21} = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, 40 daps equal 42 baps.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to find a chain of conversions from daps to yaps to baps.\n\nStarting with 4 daps = 7 yaps, I can find out how many yaps are in 42 baps.\n\nBut first, I need to relate yaps to baps. From 5 yaps = 3 baps, I can find out how many baps are in terms of yaps.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to think in terms of ratios.\n\nLet me see.\n\nGiven 4 daps = 7 yaps, so the ratio of daps to yaps is \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\).\n\nSimilarly, 5 yaps = 3 baps, so the ratio of yaps to baps is \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\).\n\nTo find the ratio of daps to baps, I can multiply these ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{20}{21}\n\\]\n\nSo, 20 daps = 21 baps.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for how many daps equal 42 baps, which is double 21 baps.\n\nSo, if 20 daps = 21 baps, then 40 daps = 42 baps.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to confirm this.\n\nAnother approach could be to express everything in terms of a common unit, like yaps.\n\nFrom 4 daps = 7 yaps, I can express 1 dap in terms of yaps:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ dap} = \\frac{7}{4} \\text{ yaps}\n\\]\n\nFrom 5 yaps = 3 baps, I can express 1 yap in terms of baps:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ yap} = \\frac{3}{5} \\text{ baps}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, combining these:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ dap} = \\frac{7}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{21}{20} \\text{ baps}\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\(x\\) daps:\n\n\\[\nx \\times \\frac{21}{20} = 42\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 42 \\div \\frac{21}{20} = 42 \\times \\frac{20}{21} = 40\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 40 daps equal 42 baps.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try using cross-multiplication or another ratio method.\n\nStarting with the given:\n\n4 daps : 7 yaps\n\n5 yaps : 3 baps\n\nI need to find the ratio of daps to baps.\n\nFirst, find a common term for yaps in both ratios.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 5 is 35.\n\nSo, scale the first ratio by 5:\n\n4 daps \u00d7 5 = 20 daps\n\n7 yaps \u00d7 5 = 35 yaps\n\nAnd scale the second ratio by 7:\n\n5 yaps \u00d7 7 = 35 yaps\n\n3 baps \u00d7 7 = 21 baps\n\nNow, combining these:\n\n20 daps : 35 yaps : 21 baps\n\nSo, 20 daps = 21 baps.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 20 daps : 21 baps.\n\nTo find how many daps equal 42 baps, set up a proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20 \\text{ daps}}{21 \\text{ baps}} = \\frac{x \\text{ daps}}{42 \\text{ baps}}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 42 = 21 \\times x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n840 = 21x\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{840}{21} = 40\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get \\(x = 40\\).\n\nThis consistent result across multiple methods reinforces that 40 daps equal 42 baps.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 40.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 28\n\nB. 21\n\nC. 40\n\nD. 30\n\nSo, option C. 40 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
