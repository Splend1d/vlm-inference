                    "text": "So I have this question about the Council of Europe, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me see what options I have here.\n\nOption A says the Council of Europe was established in 1950 and consists of 27 member states.\n\nOption B says it was established in 1949 and consists of 47 member states.\n\nOption C says it was established in 1959 and consists of 34 member states.\n\nOption D says it was established in 1984 and consists of 19 member states.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details of the Council of Europe. I know that it's an international organization that promotes human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe. But I don't remember the exact year it was established or how many member states it has currently.\n\nLet me think about this. I recall that the Council of Europe was founded after World War II, probably in the late 1940s or early 1950s. So options A and B seem plausible in terms of the establishment year\u20141950 and 1949.\n\nOption C says 1959, which is a bit later, and option D says 1984, which seems too recent. The Cold War was still going on in 1984, so it's unlikely that a pan-European council was established then.\n\nWait, but maybe the Council of Europe was founded during the Cold War era. I need to double-check that.\n\nI think the Council of Europe was indeed founded in the aftermath of World War II, with the aim of fostering greater cooperation among European countries and preventing future conflicts.\n\nLet me consider the number of member states. Option A says 27, option B says 47, option C says 34, and option D says 19.\n\nI know that the European Union currently has 27 member states, but the Council of Europe is a different organization. The Council of Europe has more member states than the EU because it includes countries that are not part of the EU.\n\nWait, but according to my knowledge, the Council of Europe has many more members than just the EU countries. I think it has around 40-something member states.\n\nLet me see: the Council of Europe was founded by several Western European countries after the war, and over time, more countries joined, especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Cold War.\n\nSo, it's possible that the Council of Europe has expanded to include most European countries, including those from Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nGiven that, option B seems the most plausible: established in 1949 and consisting of 47 member states.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should look up the official website of the Council of Europe or find some reliable sources to confirm this information.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a multiple-choice question, and I have to pick one option, I can eliminate the ones that seem less likely.\n\nOption D says 1984 and 19 member states. That seems too recent a founding year and too few members, considering that even back then, there were many more European countries.\n\nOption C says 1959 and 34 member states. While 1959 is possible, I think the Council of Europe was founded earlier, maybe in the early 1950s.\n\nOption A says 1950 and 27 member states. But I know that the EU has 27 members, so that might be confusing.\n\nOption B says 1949 and 47 member states. That seems reasonable, as the Council of Europe was likely founded in the late 1940s and has since expanded to include more countries.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact number of member states. Let me try to recall.\n\nI think the Council of Europe has around 47 member states, including almost all European countries, except for a few like Belarus and Vatican City.\n\nYes, that rings a bell. So, option B seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any possibility that another option could be right.\n\nOption A: 1950 and 27 member states. That might be confusing the Council of Europe with the European Union, which has 27 member states as of now.\n\nOption C: 1959 and 34 member states. That seems like it might be referring to a different organization or perhaps a point in time when the Council of Europe had fewer members.\n\nOption D: 1984 and 19 member states. That seems unlikely, as many European organizations were established much earlier.\n\nTherefore, based on my reasoning, option B seems to be the correct answer: the Council of Europe was established in 1949 and consists of 47 member states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
