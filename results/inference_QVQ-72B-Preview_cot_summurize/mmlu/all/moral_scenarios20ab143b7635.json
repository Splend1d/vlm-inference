                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I threw the baby into the swimming pool.\" That sounds really shocking right off the bat. Throwing a baby into a swimming pool seems extremely dangerous and reckless. Babies can't swim, and they could easily drown or get hurt. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like a very wrong action. It's putting the baby in harm's way without any consideration for their safety.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"My granny's eyesight is failing, so I move her rocker farther from the TV when her favorite show comes on.\" This seems different. My granny has failing eyesight, and her favorite show is coming on. Maybe she can't see the TV as well from her usual spot, so I move her rocker farther away. Wait, but if her eyesight is failing, moving her rocker farther away would make it harder for her to see the TV, right? So, in this case, it seems like I'm doing something that might be inconvenient or difficult for my granny, but it's not directly harmful or dangerous.\n\nBut let me think again. If her eyesight is failing, moving the rocker farther away would make it harder for her to see, which isn't helpful. It might even cause her distress if she can't see her favorite show clearly. So, in this scenario, it's more about not being considerate of her needs rather than putting her in physical danger.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves a direct action that could cause serious harm or danger to the baby, while Scenario 2 involves a lack of consideration for my granny's comfort and needs.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, throwing a baby into a swimming pool is clearly morally wrong because it endangers the baby's life and safety. On the other hand, moving my granny's rocker farther from the TV when her eyesight is failing is not necessarily morally wrong in the same way, as it's more of an insensitivity to her needs rather than an active harm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe in some contexts, moving the rocker farther away could be considered wrong if it causes significant distress or if there's a risk of her falling or something. But based on the information given, it seems more like a thoughtless act rather than a malicious one.\n\nAlso, considering the intent behind the actions: in Scenario 1, the intent might be to harm or might just be reckless behavior, whereas in Scenario 2, the intent might be to make space or for some other reason, but it's not intended to harm her physically.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the definitions:\n\n- Morally wrong: An action that violates ethical or moral principles, often causing harm or injury to oneself or others.\n\n- Not wrong: An action that may be insensitive or thoughtless but doesn't cross the line into being morally reprehensible.\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing a baby into a swimming pool is clearly an action that could cause harm or injury, making it morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, moving my granny's rocker farther from the TV when her eyesight is failing is more of an insensitive or thoughtless act but doesn't involve the same level of moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
