The options are:\n\nA. pleasure.\n\nB. that which we desire.\n\nC. that which we desire to desire.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nI need to recall who Moore is and what his view on goodness is. I think G.E. Moore was an ethical philosopher who discussed the nature of good. Let me try to remember his main ideas.\n\nMoore is known for his book \"Principia Ethica,\" right? In that, he presented an intuitionist ethical theory. He argued that good is a simple, non-natural property that can't be defined in terms of natural properties or other ethical concepts.\n\nWait, so he had this idea of \"moral intuition,\" where we just intuitively know what's good or bad, right? But let's focus on his definition of good.\n\nI recall that Moore rejected defining good in terms of pleasure or desire. He thought that identifying good with pleasure was a mistake, what he called the \"naturalistic fallacy.\" He believed that good is a fundamental, indefinable quality.\n\nSo, if he thought that defining good as pleasure or desire was a naturalistic fallacy, then options A and B would be incorrect.\n\nOption C is \"that which we desire to desire.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit more complex. Is this some kind of higher-order desire? Maybe related to John Stuart Mill or something? Wait, Mill thought that some pleasures are higher than others, but I don't remember Moore aligning with that exactly.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider what Moore positively said about good. He thought that good is a simple, intrinsic quality that we recognize through moral intuition. So, none of the options seem to capture that.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which might be the answer if Moore didn't define good in any of the ways presented.\n\nBut perhaps I should double-check. Maybe there's a specific quote or concept I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider the context. Moore was responding to utilitarianism, which often defined good in terms of pleasure or happiness. He criticized this approach, arguing that good is something distinct and cannot be reduced to pleasure or desire.\n\nSo, since he rejected defining good as pleasure or desire, options A and B are out. Option C, \"that which we desire to desire,\" seems like a variation on desire, which Moore also likely wouldn't agree with.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any possibility that Moore did define good in terms of higher-order desires. But I don't think so. His main point was that good is a simple, indefinable property, not something derived from desires or pleasures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. none of the above.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any possibility that Moore had a different view that I'm not recalling. Maybe I should think about his concept of intrinsic value. He talked about some things being good in themselves, having intrinsic value, regardless of their consequences.\n\nBut again, that doesn't directly align with any of the options provided. So, I think D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
