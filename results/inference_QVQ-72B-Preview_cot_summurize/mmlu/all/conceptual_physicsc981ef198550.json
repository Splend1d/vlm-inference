                    "text": "So I've got this question about how colors work on a TV screen. It says that when you see yellow on your TV, which phosphors are being activated? The options are mainly yellow, blue and red, green and yellow, or red and green.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how TV screens create colors. I think TVs use something called RGB, which stands for red, green, and blue. These are the primary colors of light, and when you mix them in different intensities, you can create a wide range of colors.\n\nSo, for example, if all three\u2014red, green, and blue\u2014are activated at full brightness, you get white. If none of them are activated, you get black. But what about yellow? Yellow is kind of in between, right?\n\nLet me think about this. In the RGB color model, yellow is a combination of red and green. Wait, is that right? Let me visualize the color wheel. Red is opposite to cyan, green opposite to magenta, and blue opposite to yellow. No, that seems confusing.\n\nActually, in the RGB model, which is additive, yellow is made by combining red and green. So, if I turn on the red phosphors and the green phosphors, but not the blue ones, I should see yellow on the screen.\n\nLet me double-check this. Imagine I have a TV screen with red, green, and blue phosphors for each pixel. If I activate only the red phosphors, I see red. If I activate only the green phosphors, I see green. If I activate only the blue phosphors, I see blue.\n\nNow, if I activate both the red and green phosphors, their light combines to produce yellow. Yeah, that makes sense. So, it's not just one color being used, but a combination of red and green.\n\nWait a minute, what about the other options? Option A says mainly yellow, but that seems vague. TVs don't have yellow phosphors per se; they have red, green, and blue phosphors.\n\nOption B says blue and red. Hmm, that would be magenta, I think. Magenta is red and blue combined, which is different from yellow.\n\nOption C says green and yellow, but since there are no yellow phosphors, this would be green and some combination of red and green, which might still end up being a shade of yellow, but it's not directly corresponding.\n\nOption D says red and green, which aligns with my initial thought about creating yellow.\n\nSo, based on this, I believe the correct answer is D. red and green.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor involved. For example, sometimes TVs might use different color systems or there might be some color correction happening, but in general, RGB is the standard for television displays.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the color opposites in the RGB model. Yellow is opposite to blue, so if I want yellow, I would activate red and green, and not blue.\n\nAlternatively, in some color models like CMYK, which is used in printing, yellow is a primary color, but that's not relevant for TV screens, which use RGB.\n\nSo, to sum it up, on a TV screen, yellow is produced by activating the red and green phosphors together.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. red and green.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
