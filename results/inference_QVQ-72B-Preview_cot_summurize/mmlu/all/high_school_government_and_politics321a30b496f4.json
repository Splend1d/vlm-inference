I think it's a type of funding that the government gives out, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nOption A says it's money provided to individuals to fund research projects. Hmm, that sounds more like a research grant or maybe a scholarship. I don't think block grants go directly to individuals; I think they're given to state or local governments. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B says funds with few restrictions that are provided to state or local governments for general-purpose use. This sounds plausible. Block grants are supposed to give recipients more flexibility in how they use the money, right? So, if it's with few restrictions and for general purposes, that aligns with what I think block grants are.\n\nOption C mentions funds distributed among states according to a set formula. Well, that's interesting. I know that some grants are allocated based on specific formulas, like population size or other statistical measures. But is this characteristic specific to block grants, or could it apply to other types of grants as well? Maybe formula grants work this way too. So, maybe this isn't the best description of a block grant.\n\nOption D says money that can only be used for a specific purpose. That sounds more like a categorical grant, where the federal government specifies exactly how the money should be spent. Block grants, on the other hand, are supposed to offer more flexibility in usage. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nLet me summarize what I've thought through:\n\n- Option A: Probably not, because block grants are likely given to governments, not individuals.\n\n- Option B: Seems promising, as it emphasizes few restrictions and general-purpose use, which aligns with the flexibility block grants are known for.\n\n- Option C: While some block grants might be distributed via a formula, this might not be unique to block grants and could apply to other grant types as well.\n\n- Option D: This seems more like a categorical grant, where the money is earmarked for specific purposes.\n\nI think the best answer is Option B: Funds with few restrictions that are provided to state or local governments for general-purpose use.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. I recall that block grants are designed to give state and local governments more discretion in addressing the needs of their communities without stringent federal guidelines. So, yes, that matches with Option B.\n\nOption C might be relevant in some cases, but it's not the defining characteristic of a block grant. Some block grants might use a formula for allocation, but that's more about how the money is distributed rather than what defines the grant type.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
