In 1979, a neighbor, owner of a farm abutting the northeast corner of the 10-acre tract, began to use a portion of the 10-acre tract for ingress and egress to his farm. He used this access road openly, visibly, and notoriously until 2000. The period of prescription in this particular jurisdiction was 20 years. In March 2000, the neighbor decided to sell the farm to a skier. Thereupon, the neighbor and the skier entered into a written real estate sales contract, with closing set for May 1, 2000. On April 1, 2000, the president of the town development association was approached by the skier with the request that a written easement be given over the used area and that an appropriate instrument be delivered to the skier concurrently with the skier's closing with the neighbor. Following the president's meeting with the skier, the town development association held a duly announced meeting and voted unanimously to authorize its trustees to grant such an easement.

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out who should win this declaratory judgment action about an easement on a piece of land. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a landowner who owns a 10-acre tract of land. In 1974, this landowner gives the land to the town development association, but with a condition. The condition is that a ski lodge and resort area must be built there, and the land must be used solely for skiing purposes. If it's not used as a ski resort, the property should revert back to the grantor, which is the landowner, or their heirs or assigns.\n\nSo, this sounds like a conditional fee simple grant. The land is given on the condition that it's used for skiing purposes, and if not, it reverts back to the original owner or their successors.\n\nNow, a ski lodge was built, and the land was used as a ski resort for more than 20 years. That seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nIn 1979, a neighbor who owns a farm next to the northeast corner of this 10-acre tract starts using a portion of the 10-acre tract for access to his farm. He uses this access road openly, visibly, and notoriously until 2000. The period of prescription in this jurisdiction is 20 years.\n\nSo, from 1979 to 2000, that's 21 years. That means the neighbor has been using this access road for over 20 years, which is the prescription period. In many jurisdictions, if someone uses someone else's land continuously and openly for a certain period, they can acquire an easement by prescription.\n\nIn this case, the neighbor has been using the land for over 20 years, so it seems like he has a prescriptive easement over that portion of the 10-acre tract.\n\nIn March 2000, the neighbor decides to sell his farm to a skier. They enter into a real estate sales contract with a closing date of May 1, 2000.\n\nOn April 1, 2000, the president of the town development association meets with the skier, who requests a written easement over the used area and wants an appropriate instrument delivered at closing.\n\nThe town development association holds a meeting and votes unanimously to authorize their trustees to grant such an easement.\n\nBut then, on April 15, 2000, the original landowner dies. His sole descendant and successor is his wife. She immediately notifies the town development association that if they grant the easement to the skier, the 10-acre tract will revert back to her.\n\nThe skier then brings a lawsuit, joining the neighbor, the wife, and the town development association, seeking a declaratory judgment that the neighbor has a perpetual easement appurtenant to the 10-acre tract.\n\nNow, I need to determine who should prevail in this action.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The wife, because the skier could not obtain rights against the town development association by prescription.\n\nB. The wife, because the easement would violate the negative restriction that the landowner originally sought to impose.\n\nC. The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.\n\nD. The skier, because the language of the conveyance to the town development association was too vague to support any claim by the wife.\n\nFirst, let's think about the prescriptive easement.\n\nThe neighbor has been using a portion of the 10-acre tract for over 20 years openly, visibly, and notoriously. The prescription period is 20 years, so he has likely acquired a prescriptive easement.\n\nNow, the skier is trying to get a written easement from the town development association, but the wife is claiming that if they grant it, the property reverts back to her because of the original condition.\n\nWait, but the land was given to the town development association with a condition that it be used for skiing purposes. As long as it's being used for that purpose, the condition is being met.\n\nBut the neighbor is using a portion of it for access to his farm, which is not skiing-related. So, does that violate the condition?\n\nHmm.\n\nBut the condition says the land must be used solely for skiing purposes. If the neighbor is using a portion for access, that might be considered a violation of the condition.\n\nHowever, the neighbor has a prescriptive easement, which means he has a legal right to use that portion for access.\n\nNow, the skier is trying to buy the farm from the neighbor and wants a written easement over that portion.\n\nThe town development association has voted to grant the easement, but the wife is objecting, saying that granting the easement would violate the condition and cause the property to revert back to her.\n\nSo, the question is, does granting the easement violate the condition, and can the wife enforce the reversion?\n\nFirst, let's consider the prescriptive easement.\n\nThe neighbor has used the land for over 20 years openly, so he likely has a prescriptive easement.\n\nPrescriptive easements are generally recognized in law as a way to acquire rights through long-term use.\n\nSo, the neighbor has a valid easement over the portion he's been using.\n\nNow, does this easement violate the condition that the land be used solely for skiing purposes?\n\nWell, the easement is for access to the neighbor's farm, which isn't directly related to skiing.\n\nBut the main use of the land is still as a ski resort, so perhaps the easement doesn't completely negate the skiing use.\n\nHowever, the condition says the land must be used solely for skiing purposes.\n\nIf there's another use, like the easement for access, does that violate the sole use condition?\n\nProbably yes.\n\nSo, the condition has been violated, and the property should revert back to the grantor or their heirs.\n\nBut the grantor died in 2000, and his wife is the sole descendant and successor.\n\nSo, the wife can claim reversion of the property back to her.\n\nBut wait, the town development association has been using the land as a ski resort for over 20 years, and they've invested in building a ski lodge and maintaining it.\n\nIf the property reverts back to the wife, what happens to their investment?\n\nThis seems unfair to the town development association.\n\nMaybe there's a doctrine that prevents the reversion if the condition was violated innocently or if the violation is minor.\n\nBut generally, in property law, conditions precedent in fee simple determinable estates are strictly enforced.\n\nWait, is this a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent?\n\nLet's see.\n\nThe deed says, \"on condition that a ski lodge and resort area be built thereon and the land be used solely for skiing purposes and, in the event that said property is not used as a ski resort, the property shall revert to myself, the grantor, my heirs or assigns.\"\n\nThis sounds like a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.\n\nBecause it says \"on condition that...\" and \"in the event that... the property shall revert...\"\n\nIn fee simple determinable, it would say something like \"so long as\" it's used for skiing purposes, and upon cessation of that use, it automatically reverts.\n\nBut here, it's \"on condition that\" and \"in the event that,\" which suggests it's a condition subsequent.\n\nIn fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, the grantor or their heirs can enforce the reversion only if they choose to do so.\n\nSo, in this case, the wife, as the grantor's heir, can demand reversion if the condition is violated.\n\nBut, the town development association has been using it for the intended purpose for over 20 years, and the neighbor has a prescriptive easement.\n\nSo, perhaps the wife can demand reversion, but the town development association might argue that the violation is minor and that the main use is still for skiing purposes.\n\nAlternatively, they might argue that the prescriptive easement is a valid right that the neighbor has acquired, and that it shouldn't negate the entire grant.\n\nBut according to the condition, the land must be used solely for skiing purposes, and any other use might trigger the reversion.\n\nNow, the skier is trying to get a written easement from the town development association.\n\nIf the town development association grants the easement, does that make the violation more explicit?\n\nProbably yes.\n\nBecause by granting the easement, they are acknowledging that part of the land will be used for access to the farm, which is not skiing-related.\n\nSo, if they grant the easement, it's clear that the condition is being violated.\n\nTherefore, the wife can demand reversion.\n\nBut, the neighbor already has a prescriptive easement, which he acquired through long use.\n\nSo, even if the town development association didn't grant the easement, the neighbor still has the right to use that portion for access.\n\nSo, the violation has already occurred through the prescriptive easement.\n\nGranting the easement might just formalize it, but the essence of the violation is already there because of the prescriptive easement.\n\nSo, perhaps the wife could have demanded reversion earlier, once the prescriptive easement was established.\n\nBut she only acted in April 2000, after her husband's death.\n\nSo, maybe she wasn't aware of the prescriptive easement until then.\n\nNow, in this declaratory judgment action, the skier is seeking a judgment that the neighbor has a perpetual easement appurtenant to the 10-acre tract.\n\nSo, the skier is acknowledging that the neighbor has an easement and wants it to be recognized as perpetual and appurtenant to the farm.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA. The wife, because the skier could not obtain rights against the town development association by prescription.\n\nBut the skier isn't trying to obtain rights by prescription; the neighbor already has a prescriptive easement.\n\nThe skier is trying to get a written easement from the town development association, probably to make it clearer for the sale.\n\nSo, this option doesn't seem to fit.\n\nB. The wife, because the easement would violate the negative restriction that the landowner originally sought to impose.\n\nWell, the negative restriction is that the land be used solely for skiing purposes.\n\nThe easement for access to the farm is indeed a violation of that restriction.\n\nSo, this seems like a valid point.\n\nBut, the neighbor has a prescriptive easement, which is a legally recognized right.\n\nSo, even if it violates the restriction, the prescriptive easement stands.\n\nTherefore, the restriction has been overridden by the prescriptive easement.\n\nSo, perhaps the wife can't enforce the restriction against the neighbor's easement.\n\nC. The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.\n\nYes, the neighbor has a prescriptive easement, which gives him the right to use that portion of the land for access.\n\nSo, the skier, as the buyer of the farm, would step into the neighbor's shoes and inherit that easement.\n\nTherefore, the skier should have the right to continue using that easement.\n\nD. The skier, because the language of the conveyance to the town development association was too vague to support any claim by the wife.\n\nI don't think the language is vague.\n\nThe deed says, \"on condition that a ski lodge and resort area be built thereon and the land be used solely for skiing purposes and, in the event that said property is not used as a ski resort, the property shall revert to myself, the grantor, my heirs or assigns.\"\n\nThis seems clear enough.\n\nSo, this option doesn't seem correct.\n\nNow, between options B and C, which one is stronger?\n\nOption B says the wife should prevail because the easement violates the negative restriction.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, the neighbor has a prescriptive easement, which is a valid right that trumps the restriction.\n\nSo, the restriction can't be enforced against the prescriptive easement.\n\nTherefore, the skier should prevail.\n\nOption C seems accurate because the neighbor has a prescriptive easement, and the skier, as the buyer, should be able to continue to use that easement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
