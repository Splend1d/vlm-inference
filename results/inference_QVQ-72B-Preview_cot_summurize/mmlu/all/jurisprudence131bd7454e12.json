                    "text": "So I've come across this Latin phrase, \"Lex iniusta non est lex,\" and I need to figure out what it means from the given options. I'm not too familiar with Latin, but I do know that understanding legal phrases often requires looking at their origins and the context in which they're used.\n\nFirst off, \"lex\" means law, right? That much I remember from school. \"Iniusta\" seems like it's related to injustice or unfairness, and \"non est lex\" would translate to \"is not law.\" So put together, \"an unjust law is not a law.\" That sounds a lot like option C: \"An unjust law is not law.\"\n\nBut I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's see, option A says, \"The law is not valid unless it is formally enacted.\" That seems more about the procedural aspect of making laws, like they have to go through certain steps to be valid. But the original phrase seems to be more about the morality or justice of the law itself, not about how it was enacted.\n\nOption B says, \"Law has lexical priority over morality.\" Hmm, \"lexical priority\" sounds like laws come before moral considerations in some way. But the phrase seems to suggest the opposite\u2014that the justice of a law is important for it to be considered a proper law. So maybe not this one.\n\nOption D is \"No-one is above the law.\" That's a common principle in law, meaning that everyone, regardless of status, is subject to the law. But again, the original phrase is more about the nature or validity of the law based on its justice, not about who is subject to it.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, C seems the most fitting. \"An unjust law is not law\" aligns directly with the translation of the Latin phrase.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should think about the philosophical implications. There's a debate in legal theory about whether laws must be just to be considered legitimate. Some theorists argue that a law can be valid even if it's unjust, as long as it's properly enacted. Others, like the natural law theorists, believe that laws must be just to be considered true laws.\n\nGiven that, \"lex iniusta non est lex\" seems to align with the natural law perspective, which holds that an unjust law is not a real law. So, that reinforces my initial thought that option C is the correct interpretation.\n\nI don't think it's A, because that's more about the formal enactment process, which doesn't relate directly to the justice or injustice of the law.\n\nOption B suggests that law takes precedence over morality, which contradicts the meaning of the phrase, which implies that morality (justice) is a prerequisite for a law to be considered a law.\n\nAnd option D, while a important legal principle, doesn't relate directly to the idea of justice in the law itself.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C: An unjust law is not law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
