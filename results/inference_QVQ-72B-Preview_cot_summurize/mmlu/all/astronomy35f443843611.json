                    "text": "So I have this question about Titan, which is a moon of Saturn, I believe. Let's see, the question is: Which of the following is/are true?\n\nOption A says: Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere.\n\nOption B: Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity.\n\nOption C: Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons.\n\nAnd Option D: A and D.\n\nWait, Option D says \"A and D\"? That seems like a typo because it refers to itself. Maybe it's supposed to say \"A and B\" or something else. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's tackle Option A. Is Titan the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere?\n\nI know that in the outer solar system, there are several moons, but Titan is particularly famous for having a thick atmosphere. In fact, it's often mentioned that Titan has a thicker atmosphere than Earth's. It's mainly composed of nitrogen, with traces of methane and other hydrocarbons. Now, is it the only one with a thick atmosphere?\n\nLet me think about other moons in the outer solar system. There's Ganymede and Callisto, moons of Jupiter, but I don't recall them having thick atmospheres. Europa has a thin oxygen atmosphere, but it's not thick like Titan's. Saturn has other moons like Enceladus and Mimas, but they don't have significant atmospheres either. So, based on this, Option A seems correct.\n\nMoving on to Option B: Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity.\n\nRecent geologic activity would include things like cryovolcanism, tectonic activity, or changes in the surface over time. Titan is known for its active geology, with features like methane lakes, dunes, and possibly cryovolcanoes. But is it the only one with such evidence?\n\nAgain, thinking about other outer solar system moons, Enceladus is famous for its geysers and active ice chemistry, which suggest geologic activity. Europa is another candidate with evidence of a subsurface ocean and possible cryovolcanism. So, if that's the case, Titan isn't the only one with recent geologic activity. Therefore, Option B is not true.\n\nOption C: Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons.\n\nI know that Titan's atmosphere is dominated by nitrogen, similar to Earth's atmosphere. Methane and other hydrocarbons are present but in lesser amounts. So, it's not mostly composed of hydrocarbons. Therefore, Option C is false.\n\nNow, Option D says \"A and D.\" That seems self-referential, which doesn't make much sense. If it was supposed to say \"A and B,\" then based on my earlier conclusions, A is true and B is false, so \"A and B\" would be false because B is not true. Alternatively, if \"D\" refers to another option, this seems confusing.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, and Option D should be something else. Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo.\n\nAssuming that Option D is incorrectly stated and should be something else, perhaps it was meant to say \"A and C.\" In that case, A is true, but C is false, so \"A and C\" would be false.\n\nAlternatively, if Option D is \"A and B,\" then A is true and B is false, so \"A and B\" would be false.\n\nGiven that, and considering the other options, the correct answer seems to be Option A: Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not missing something, let me double-check.\n\nFirst, Titan does indeed have a thick atmosphere, primarily nitrogen with some hydrocarbons, and it's the only moon in the outer solar system known to have such an atmosphere.\n\nSecond, regarding geologic activity, while Titan does exhibit active geology, other moons like Enceladus and Europa also show signs of recent geologic activity, so B is not true.\n\nThird, Titan's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, not hydrocarbons, so C is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n\nHowever, since Option D is \"A and D,\" which doesn't make sense, and assuming it might be a typo, the intended answer might have been just A, or perhaps A and something else, but based on the options provided, A is the only true statement.\n\nSo, the final answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
