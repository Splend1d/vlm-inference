                    "text": "So I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the partial pressure of oxygen at equilibrium. Let's see what information I'm given and how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, there's a reaction: sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide, and it's catalyzed. The balanced equation should be:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{SO}_2 + \\text{O}_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2 \\text{SO}_3 \\]\n\nWait, actually, the problem says sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide, but in the presence of a catalyst. But the equation I wrote is the forward reaction. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOh, hold on. The problem says sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide, and there's a catalyst involved. But in the problem statement, it's written as SO2 reacting with O2 to form SO3, with the equilibrium constant Kp given as 3.0 \u00d7 10^22 at a certain temperature.\n\nAlright, so the reaction is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{SO}_2 + \\text{O}_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2 \\text{SO}_3 \\]\n\nAnd the equilibrium constant Kp is 3.0 \u00d7 10^22.\n\nNow, a 2.0-liter flask has enough SO3 added to it to produce a pressure of 0.789 atm Hg. Wait, 0.789 atm Hg? That seems a bit confusing. Normally, pressure is in atm or torr or mm Hg, but here it's atm Hg. Is that a typo? Maybe it's supposed to be atm or torr.\n\nWait, looking back: \"a pressure of 0.789 atm Hg.\" That might be atmospheres times mercury, but that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a misprint, and it's supposed to be 0.789 atm or 0.789 torr. I might need to clarify that.\n\nAssuming it's 0.789 atm, that makes sense because it's a pressure unit. So, let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, initially, there's only SO3 in the flask, at a pressure of 0.789 atm.\n\nThen, the reaction proceeds to the left, producing O2 and SO2 until equilibrium is reached.\n\nI need to find the partial pressure of O2 at equilibrium.\n\nAlright, let's set up the ICE table for this reaction.\n\nFirst, define the initial pressures:\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial:} \\quad \\text{SO}_2 = 0 \\text{ atm}, \\quad \\text{O}_2 = 0 \\text{ atm}, \\quad \\text{SO}_3 = 0.789 \\text{ atm} \\]\n\nThen, define the changes:\n\nLet's say the reaction proceeds to the left by an amount 'x', where:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{SO}_3 \\rightleftharpoons 2 \\text{SO}_2 + \\text{O}_2 \\]\n\nSo, for every 2 moles of SO3 that decompose, 2 moles of SO2 and 1 mole of O2 are produced.\n\nTherefore, the changes in pressure would be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\text{SO}_3 = -2x \\text{ atm} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\text{SO}_2 = +2x \\text{ atm} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\text{O}_2 = +x \\text{ atm} \\]\n\nBut wait, initially, there's only SO3, so the reaction can only proceed to the left, consuming SO3 and producing SO2 and O2.\n\nSo, the ICE table would look like:\n\nInitial (P):\n\nSO2: 0 atm\n\nO2: 0 atm\n\nSO3: 0.789 atm\n\nChange (P):\n\nSO2: +2x atm\n\nO2: +x atm\n\nSO3: -2x atm\n\nEquilibrium (P):\n\nSO2: 2x atm\n\nO2: x atm\n\nSO3: (0.789 - 2x) atm\n\nNow, the equilibrium constant Kp is defined as:\n\n\\[ K_p = \\frac{P_{\\text{SO}_3}^2}{P_{\\text{SO}_2}^2 \\cdot P_{\\text{O}_2}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{22} \\]\n\nSo, plugging in the equilibrium pressures:\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{(0.789 - 2x)^2}{(2x)^2 \\cdot x} \\]\n\nThis looks like a quadratic equation. Let's see if I can solve for x.\n\nFirst, simplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{(0.789 - 2x)^2}{4x^2 \\cdot x} = \\frac{(0.789 - 2x)^2}{4x^3} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ (0.789 - 2x)^2 = 4x^3 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^{22} \\]\n\n\\[ (0.789 - 2x)^2 = 12x^3 \\times 10^{22} \\]\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I can make an approximation since Kp is very large, suggesting the reaction strongly favors the products.\n\nGiven that Kp is 3.0 \u00d7 10^22, which is extremely large, it means that at equilibrium, the concentration of reactants is very low compared to the products. Therefore, the amount of SO3 that decomposes (2x) should be much smaller than the initial amount of SO3.\n\nSo, if 2x << 0.789 atm, then (0.789 - 2x) \u2248 0.789 atm.\n\nLet's make that approximation:\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{0.789^2}{(2x)^2 \\cdot x} \\]\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{0.789^2}{4x^3} \\]\n\n\\[ 4x^3 = \\frac{0.789^2}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ x^3 = \\frac{0.789^2}{4 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ x^3 = \\frac{0.789^2}{12 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ x^3 = \\frac{0.622521}{12 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ x^3 = 0.0518767 \\times 10^{-22} \\]\n\n\\[ x^3 = 5.18767 \\times 10^{-24} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt[3]{5.18767 \\times 10^{-24}} \\]\n\n\\[ x \u2248 1.73 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ atm} \\]\n\nNow, check if the approximation holds:\n\n2x = 2 \u00d7 1.73 \u00d7 10^{-8} = 3.46 \u00d7 10^{-8} atm\n\nCompared to initial SO3 pressure: 0.789 atm, 3.46 \u00d7 10^{-8} is indeed negligible.\n\nSo, the approximation is valid.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium partial pressures are:\n\nP_SO2 = 2x \u2248 3.46 \u00d7 10^{-8} atm\n\nP_O2 = x \u2248 1.73 \u00d7 10^{-8} atm\n\nP_SO3 \u2248 0.789 atm\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the partial pressure of O2 in torr. So, I need to convert atm to torr.\n\nI know that 1 atm = 760 torr.\n\nSo,\n\nP_O2 = 1.73 \u00d7 10^{-8} atm \u00d7 760 torr/atm = 1.31 \u00d7 10^{-5} torr\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2.88 \u00d7 10^-6 torr\n\nB. 3 \u00d7 10^-18 mm Hg\n\nC. 1100 mm Hg\n\nD. 1.32 \u00d7 10^-5 torr\n\nSo, option D is 1.32 \u00d7 10^-5 torr, which matches my calculation of 1.31 \u00d7 10^{-5} torr.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\nBut let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the balanced equation is correct: 2 SO2 + O2 \u21cc 2 SO3\n\nInitial pressures: SO3 = 0.789 atm, SO2 and O2 = 0 atm\n\nICE table:\n\nInitial: SO2 = 0, O2 = 0, SO3 = 0.789\n\nChange: SO2 = +2x, O2 = +x, SO3 = -2x\n\nEquilibrium: SO2 = 2x, O2 = x, SO3 = 0.789 - 2x\n\nKp = (P_SO3)^2 / (P_SO2)^2 * P_O2) = 3.0 \u00d7 10^22\n\nSo,\n\n3.0 \u00d7 10^22 = (0.789 - 2x)^2 / (4x^3)\n\nApproximation: 0.789 - 2x \u2248 0.789\n\nThen,\n\n3.0 \u00d7 10^22 = (0.789)^2 / (4x^3)\n\n4x^3 = (0.789)^2 / (3.0 \u00d7 10^22)\n\nx^3 = (0.789)^2 / (12 \u00d7 10^22)\n\nx^3 = 0.622521 / 12 \u00d7 10^22 = 0.0518767 \u00d7 10^-22\n\nx^3 = 5.18767 \u00d7 10^-24\n\nx = (5.18767 \u00d7 10^-24)^(1/3) \u2248 1.73 \u00d7 10^-8 atm\n\nP_O2 = x \u2248 1.73 \u00d7 10^-8 atm\n\nConvert to torr: 1.73 \u00d7 10^-8 \u00d7 760 \u2248 1.31 \u00d7 10^-5 torr\n\nWhich matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the expected partial pressure of O2 at equilibrium is 1.32 \u00d7 10^-5 torr.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
