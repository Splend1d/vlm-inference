                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The development of an egg without fertilization is known as...\" and the options are A. meiosis, B. parthenogenesis, C. embryogenesis, D. vegetative propagation. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what the question is asking. It's about the development of an egg without fertilization. So, normally, an egg needs to be fertilized by a sperm to develop into an embryo, right? But in some cases, an egg can develop into an organism without being fertilized. That sounds like a special process.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Meiosis: I know that meiosis is the process where a cell divides to produce gametes, like eggs and sperm. It's a way to reduce the chromosome number by half, preparing them for fertilization. But meiosis involves the production of gametes, not the development of an egg without fertilization. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nB. Parthenogenesis: This term sounds familiar. I think it refers to the development of an unfertilized egg into an embryo. Let me double-check that. Parthenogenesis literally means \"virgin production,\" which suggests that an organism can develop from an unfertilized egg. I recall that this process occurs in some species, like certain types of insects and reptiles, where females can produce offspring without male involvement. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nC. Embryogenesis: This is the developmental process of an embryo from the zygote (fertilized egg) to a fully formed organism. But that involves fertilization. The question is specifically about development without fertilization, so embryogenesis doesn't fit here.\n\nD. Vegetative propagation: This is a type of asexual reproduction in plants where new plants grow from existing plant parts, like roots or leaves, without involving seeds or flowers. Since the question is about the development of an egg, which is typically associated with animals or humans, vegetative propagation seems unrelated.\n\nSo, based on this elimination, parthenogenesis seems to be the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that another option could also apply.\n\nMeiosis is definitely involved in producing gametes, but it's not about the development of an egg without fertilization. Embryogenesis requires fertilization, and vegetative propagation is about plant reproduction, not animal or human development from an egg.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B. parthenogenesis. It's the process where an egg can develop into an organism without being fertilized.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if this process occurs in humans or only in other species. I think in most animals, parthenogenesis is rare, and in humans, it's even rarer, if it occurs at all. But the question doesn't specify the context, so perhaps it's referring to the general biological process across species.\n\nGiven that, I think parthenogenesis is still the correct term for the development of an egg without fertilization, regardless of the species.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. parthenogenesis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. parthenogenesis}} \\]"
