                    "text": "So I'm given this problem about a 3x3 matrix A, and it says that the determinant of (A - \u03bbI) is equal to -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, and III are true for A.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the determinant of (A - \u03bbI) represents. I know that det(A - \u03bbI) is the characteristic polynomial of A, and its roots give the eigenvalues of A. Since A is a 3x3 matrix, the characteristic polynomial should be a cubic polynomial, which matches what's given: -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is:\n\ndet(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3 = 0.\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues of A, which are the roots of this equation. Maybe I can factor this polynomial to find its roots.\n\nLet me try to factor the polynomial: -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3.\n\nFirst, I'll look for rational roots using the rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -3 and the leading coefficient is -1, so possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b13.\n\nLet's test \u03bb = 1:\n\n- (1)^3 + 3*(1)^2 + (1) - 3 = -1 + 3 + 1 - 3 = 0.\n\nSo, \u03bb = 1 is a root. That means (\u03bb - 1) is a factor of the polynomial.\n\nNow, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (\u03bb - 1).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: -1, 3, 1, -3.\n\nRoot: 1.\n\nBring down the -1.\n\nMultiply by 1: -1 * 1 = -1.\n\nAdd to the next coefficient: 3 + (-1) = 2.\n\nMultiply by 1: 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nAdd to the next coefficient: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nMultiply by 1: 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nAdd to the last coefficient: -3 + 3 = 0.\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (\u03bb - 1)(-\u03bb^2 + 2\u03bb + 3) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero:\n\n(\u03bb - 1) = 0 \u21d2 \u03bb = 1.\n\n(-\u03bb^2 + 2\u03bb + 3) = 0 \u21d2 \u03bb^2 - 2\u03bb - 3 = 0.\n\nNow, solve \u03bb^2 - 2\u03bb - 3 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\u03bb = [2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 \u221a16]/2 = [2 \u00b1 4]/2.\n\nSo, \u03bb = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3, or \u03bb = (2 - 4)/2 = -2/2 = -1.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of A are 1, 3, and -1.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. The trace of A is 3.\n\nI recall that the trace of A, which is the sum of its diagonal elements, is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues.\n\nSo, trace(A) = sum of eigenvalues = 1 + 3 + (-1) = 3.\n\nTherefore, statement I is true.\n\nII. The determinant of A is -3.\n\nI know that the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\n\nSo, det(A) = 1 * 3 * (-1) = -3.\n\nTherefore, statement II is true.\n\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues -3 and 1.\n\nWait, according to my earlier calculation, the eigenvalues are 1, 3, and -1. There is no eigenvalue -3 in this list. So, statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. I and II only.\n\nBut let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the characteristic polynomial is given as det(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3.\n\nI factored it and found roots 1, 3, and -1.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, trace(A) is indeed the sum of eigenvalues, which is 1 + 3 + (-1) = 3.\n\nDeterminant is the product, which is 1 * 3 * (-1) = -3.\n\nAnd eigenvalues are 1, 3, and -1, not -3 and 1 as stated in III.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. I and II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
