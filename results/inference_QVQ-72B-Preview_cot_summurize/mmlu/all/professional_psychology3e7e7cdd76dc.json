                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about the theory of planned behavior. It's asking for the three components that make up a person's behavioral intention according to this theory. The options are:\n\nA. attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.\n\nB. degree of liking or attraction, beliefs, and action tendencies.\n\nC. level of ability, degree of motivation, and extent of behavioral control.\n\nD. attitudinal strength, social desirability, and perceived self-efficacy.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what the theory of planned behavior is all about. I remember that it's a model that tries to predict whether a person will perform a specific behavior based on their intentions. So, behavioral intention is like the immediate precursor to actually doing something.\n\nNow, the theory of planned behavior was developed by Icek Ajzen, and I think it builds on his earlier work on the theory of reasoned action. But in this case, it's the theory of planned behavior we're dealing with.\n\nLet me think about the components one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.\n\nAttitude toward the behavior sounds right. That's basically how positive or negative a person feels about performing the behavior. Subjective norms would be about the perceived social pressure to perform the behavior. And perceived behavioral control is about how easy or difficult the person thinks it is to perform the behavior.\n\nThat seems comprehensive. But let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: degree of liking or attraction, beliefs, and action tendencies.\n\nDegree of liking or attraction might be related to attitude, but it seems a bit too narrow. Beliefs could be a part of attitude or perceived behavioral control. Action tendencies sound similar to behavioral intentions themselves, but not necessarily a component of it.\n\nMaybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nOption C: level of ability, degree of motivation, and extent of behavioral control.\n\nLevel of ability and degree of motivation sound like factors that could influence behavioral intention, but in the theory of planned behavior, I don't recall ability being a direct component. Motivation might be related to attitude or subjective norms. Extent of behavioral control seems similar to perceived behavioral control in option A.\n\nHmm, maybe not the correct one.\n\nOption D: attitudinal strength, social desirability, and perceived self-efficacy.\n\nAttitudinal strength might be related to attitude toward the behavior, but it's not the same. Social desirability could be related to subjective norms, as it involves conforming to social expectations. Perceived self-efficacy is similar to perceived behavioral control, which is about confidence in one's ability to perform the behavior.\n\nWhile some of these concepts are related, they aren't the exact components of the theory of planned behavior.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that in the theory of planned behavior, behavioral intention is determined by three things: attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.\n\nAttitude is about personal evaluation, subjective norms are about perceived social pressure, and perceived behavioral control is about perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behavior.\n\nSo, option A seems to match this description perfectly.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other components that might be considered part of behavioral intention in this theory.\n\nWait a minute, sometimes, people might include things like past behavior or demographic variables, but in the core theory of planned behavior, those aren't direct components of behavioral intention.\n\nAlso, in some extensions of the theory, additional variables might be included, but the basic model consists of those three components: attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A.\n\nTo make sure, let's think about it differently. If I were to explain the theory of planned behavior to someone, what would I say about its components?\n\nI'd say that behavioral intention is influenced by:\n\n1. Attitude toward the behavior: how much a person likes or dislikes performing the behavior.\n\n2. Subjective norms: the person's perception of what important others think they should do.\n\n3. Perceived behavioral control: the person's belief in their ability to perform the behavior.\n\nYes, that lines up exactly with option A.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
