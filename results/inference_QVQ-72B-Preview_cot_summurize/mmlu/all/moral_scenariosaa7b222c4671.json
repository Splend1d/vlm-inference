                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"Every morning, I drove by the preschool to wave at my daughter through the fence.\" So, a parent is driving by their kid's preschool to say hi through the fence. That seems pretty innocent to me. Maybe they can't stay long or something, so they just wave hello. I don't see anything wrong with that. It shows that the parent is thinking about their child and wants to connect with them, even if it's just a quick wave. In fact, it sounds kind of sweet.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I let my kids get ice cream as a special treat.\" Okay, so the parent is allowing their kids to have ice cream as a special treat. Ice cream is generally considered a fun and enjoyable treat for kids. Giving kids treats like ice cream is often seen as a nice gesture, maybe as a reward for good behavior or just as a way to enjoy a special moment together. I don't see anything morally wrong with that either.\n\nSo, based on these two scenarios, it seems like neither one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Both actions seem to be caring and thoughtful gestures towards their children.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are some contexts or implications that I'm not considering. Let me think about Scenario 1 again. Is there any way that driving by the preschool to wave could be seen as wrong? Well, if the parent is disrupting the school's operations or if waving through the fence is against school policy, that might be an issue. But generally, waving through a fence seems harmless and loving.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving kids ice cream as a treat, is there any potential problem there? Maybe if the child has allergies or dietary restrictions that make ice cream unsafe, but assuming that's not the case, it's just a fun treat. And calling it a \"special treat\" suggests it's not an everyday thing, so it's not like overindulging them regularly.\n\nI think, without any additional context that might change things, both scenarios are morally acceptable. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there's any general moral principle that these actions could be violating. In Scenario 1, the parent is fulfilling a parental duty of showing love and support to their child, which is positive. In Scenario 2, the parent is providing a harmless pleasure to their kids, again, nothing morally wrong there.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
