He was a pretty influential philosopher and theologian, right? I think he wrote a lot about ethics and the purpose of human existence. So, according to Aquinas, what's the ultimate goal or end of human life?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Pleasure.\n\nHmm, that seems plausible at first glance because many people seek pleasure in their lives. But I recall that in philosophy, there are different schools of thought on this. For example, hedonism posits that pleasure is the highest good, but is that Aquinas's view?\n\nB. Happiness or beatitude.\n\nThis sounds familiar. I think Aquinas discussed happiness as the supreme good, but I'm not sure about the exact term he used. Beatitude might be related to divine happiness or perfect bliss, which could be considered the ultimate end.\n\nC. The satisfaction of desire.\n\nThis seems related to pleasure, in a way. If desires are satisfied, that often brings pleasure. But again, I'm not sure if this is specifically Aquinas's perspective.\n\nD. Freedom from anxiety.\n\nThis sounds more like a state of mind or emotional well-being. While it's desirable, I don't recall Aquinas emphasizing freedom from anxiety as the ultimate end of human life.\n\nLet me think more deeply about this. Aquinas was a Thomist, following the thought of Thomas Aquinas, who integrated Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. In Aristotle's ethics, the highest good is eudaimonia, often translated as happiness or flourishing. Did Aquinas adopt this view, or did he modify it in light of Christian doctrine?\n\nI think Aquinas built upon Aristotle's idea of eudaimonia but aligned it with Christian concepts of salvation and union with God. So, perhaps the ultimate end for Aquinas is a kind of perfect happiness or beatitude that comes from knowing and loving God.\n\nLet me consider the context. In Aquinas's moral philosophy, particularly in his Summa Theologica, he discusses the ultimate end of human actions. He argues that all human actions are directed towards some end, and there is a hierarchy of ends, with the highest end being God Himself.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option B, happiness or beatitude, might be the correct answer. But I need to confirm whether Aquinas uses the term \"happiness\" or \"beatitude\" to refer to this ultimate end.\n\nI recall that in the Summa Theologica, Aquinas discusses the beatific vision, which is the direct, intuitive knowledge of God that the saints enjoy in heaven. This seems very much like a state of perfect happiness or beatitude.\n\nOn the other hand, pleasure, as in option A, seems too limited. Pleasure can be a component of happiness, but it's not the same thing. Happiness is a more comprehensive concept that involves fulfillment and purpose.\n\nOption C, the satisfaction of desire, is also too broad. Desires can be for many things, some of which may not lead to true happiness or the ultimate end.\n\nOption D, freedom from anxiety, is more about the absence of a negative state rather than a positive fulfillment or end.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of Aquinas's philosophy, the correct answer should be B. happiness or beatitude.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check a few key points. First, Aquinas believed that human beings are naturally oriented towards an ultimate end that only God can fulfill. He argues that our natural capacities are directed towards this end, and only by achieving it can we find true happiness.\n\nHe also discusses the concept of the \"beatific vision,\" which is the direct contemplation of God, as the ultimate end of human life. This vision is considered to be the source of the highest possible happiness or beatitude.\n\nSo, yes, it seems that Aquinas did indeed consider happiness or beatitude as the last end of man.\n\nWait a minute, but could there be a different interpretation? For example, some might argue that for Aquinas, the ultimate end is God Himself, rather than happiness or beatitude, which are more like the result of achieving that end.\n\nHowever, Aquinas does use the term \"beatitude\" to describe the state of being that comes from achieving the ultimate end, which is union with God through the beatific vision.\n\nTherefore, happiness or beatitude can be seen as the state of perfect fulfillment that comes from attaining the ultimate end, which is God.\n\nSo, in that sense, option B is still accurate.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another angle. In Aquinas's ethics, he discusses the concept of the \"summit of the moral life\" being the attainment of the beatific vision. He also emphasizes that all human desires ultimately point towards this beatific vision as their fulfillment.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that for Aquinas, the last end of man is happiness or beatitude.\n\nI think I've covered the main points here. Based on this reflection, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. happiness or beatitude.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
