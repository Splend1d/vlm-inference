                    "text": "Let's dive into this genetics problem. It's about \u03b1-thalassemia, which is a blood disorder affecting hemoglobin production. The couple coming for genetic counseling both have family histories of this condition, and they themselves show some signs of it. The woman has a slightly decreased hemoglobin level with a single gene deletion, and the man has microcytic anemia with a two-gene deletion. The question is, if the two-gene deletion is in trans (meaning one deletion is on the maternal gene and the other on the paternal gene), what percentage of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basics of \u03b1-thalassemia. Hemoglobin is made up of alpha and beta globin chains. Alpha-thalassemia occurs when there's a defect in the alpha globin gene, leading to reduced production of alpha chains. The severity depends on how many of the four alpha genes are affected. Normally, humans have four alpha genes (two on each chromosome 16), so deletions can range from one to four genes.\n\nGiven that the woman has a single gene deletion, she likely has \u03b1-thalassemia trait, which is usually mild or asymptomatic. The man has a two-gene deletion, which typically causes Hb H disease, a more severe form of anemia.\n\nNow, the term \"in trans\" is important here. It means that the two gene deletions are on different chromosomes. So, in the man's case, if he has a two-gene deletion in trans, that means one chromosome has one deletion, and the other chromosome has another deletion.\n\nTo figure out the probability of their offspring having a two-gene deletion, I need to consider the genotypes of both parents and how these deletions are inherited.\n\nLet's denote the alpha genes as \u03b1. A normal person has four \u03b1 genes: \u03b1\u03b1 on one chromosome and \u03b1\u03b1 on the other, so \u03b1\u03b1/\u03b1\u03b1.\n\n- The woman has a single gene deletion: so her genotype is likely \u03b1-/\u03b1\u03b1, where - represents a deleted gene.\n\n- The man has a two-gene deletion in trans: so his genotype is \u03b1-/-\u03b1, meaning one chromosome has one deletion (\u03b1-), and the other has another deletion (-\u03b1).\n\nNow, let's consider the gametes each parent can produce.\n\nFor the woman (\u03b1-/\u03b1\u03b1):\n\n- Possible gametes:\n\n- \u03b1\u03b1 (from \u03b1\u03b1 chromosome) + -\n\n- \u03b1- (from \u03b1- chromosome) + \u03b1\u03b1\n\nBut since chromosomes separate during meiosis, each gamete will carry one chromosome. So, her gametes would be:\n\n- 50% \u03b1\u03b1\n\n- 50% \u03b1-\n\nFor the man (\u03b1-/-\u03b1):\n\n- Possible gametes:\n\n- \u03b1- from the chromosome that has \u03b1-\n\n- -\u03b1 from the chromosome that has -\u03b1\n\nSo, his gametes are:\n\n- 50% \u03b1-\n\n- 50% -\u03b1\n\nNow, to find the genotype of their offspring, we need to consider all possible combinations of the gametes from both parents.\n\nLet's make a Punnett square to visualize this.\n\n|   | \u03b1\u03b1 | \u03b1- |\n\n|---|----|----|\n\n| \u03b1-| \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1- | \u03b1-\u03b1- |\n\n| -\u03b1| \u03b1\u03b1-\u03b1 | -\u03b1\u03b1- |\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let's try again more carefully.\n\nFirst, list the possible combinations:\n\n1. \u03b1\u03b1 from mother and \u03b1- from father: \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1-\n\n2. \u03b1\u03b1 from mother and -\u03b1 from father: \u03b1\u03b1-\u03b1\n\n3. \u03b1- from mother and \u03b1- from father: \u03b1-\u03b1-\n\n4. \u03b1- from mother and -\u03b1 from father: \u03b1--\u03b1\n\nNow, we need to see how these combinations affect the number of functional \u03b1 genes.\n\nLet's analyze each one:\n\n1. \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1-: This has three functional \u03b1 genes (\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1-), which is equivalent to having one gene deletion, like the mother.\n\n2. \u03b1\u03b1-\u03b1: Similarly, this also has three functional \u03b1 genes (\u03b1\u03b1-\u03b1), again one gene deletion.\n\n3. \u03b1-\u03b1-: This has two functional \u03b1 genes (\u03b1-\u03b1-), which is a two-gene deletion, like the man.\n\n4. \u03b1--\u03b1: This also has two functional \u03b1 genes (\u03b1--\u03b1), another two-gene deletion.\n\nSo, the offspring can have either three functional \u03b1 genes (one gene deletion) or two functional \u03b1 genes (two-gene deletion).\n\nNow, let's determine the probabilities.\n\nSince each combination is equally likely (assuming independent assortment), and there are four possible combinations:\n\n- Two combinations have three functional \u03b1 genes: \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1- and \u03b1\u03b1-\u03b1\n\n- Two combinations have two functional \u03b1 genes: \u03b1-\u03b1- and \u03b1--\u03b1\n\nTherefore, 50% of the offspring will have two-gene deletions.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the probabilities based on the gametes.\n\nThe woman produces:\n\n- 50% \u03b1\u03b1\n\n- 50% \u03b1-\n\nThe man produces:\n\n- 50% \u03b1-\n\n- 50% -\u03b1\n\nSo, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- \u03b1\u03b1 from mother and \u03b1- from father: \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1- (three functional \u03b1 genes)\n\n- \u03b1\u03b1 from mother and -\u03b1 from father: \u03b1\u03b1-\u03b1 (three functional \u03b1 genes)\n\n- \u03b1- from mother and \u03b1- from father: \u03b1-\u03b1- (two functional \u03b1 genes)\n\n- \u03b1- from mother and -\u03b1 from father: \u03b1--\u03b1 (two functional \u03b1 genes)\n\nEach of these four combinations has a 25% chance (50% * 50% for each), so:\n\n- Two combinations with three functional \u03b1 genes: 25% + 25% = 50%\n\n- Two combinations with two functional \u03b1 genes: 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nTherefore, 50% of the offspring will have a two-gene deletion.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Is there any chance that the offspring could have more or fewer deletions?\n\nConsidering that the man has two deletions in trans, it's fixed that his deletions are on different chromosomes, so we've accounted for that correctly.\n\nAlso, the woman has only one deletion, so her gametes will carry either the normal chromosome or the one with one deletion.\n\nThus, the calculation seems accurate.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 50%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\nFor example, could there be any genetic crossover that might affect the deletion status? In general, crossovers can complicate inheritance patterns, but in this case, since the deletions are on specific chromosomes, and assuming no recombination occurs within the alpha gene cluster, the simple Mendelian inheritance should hold.\n\nAdditionally, assuming no new mutations occur, the only possible combinations are those we've considered.\n\nTherefore, the probability remains 50% that the offspring will have a two-gene deletion.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. 50%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
