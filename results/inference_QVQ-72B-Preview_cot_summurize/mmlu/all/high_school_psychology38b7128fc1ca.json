                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this question about a single-trial free-recall task. There's a list of words presented one at a time: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad. And the question is asking, based on the serial position curve, which word is the participant most likely to forget? The options are A. House, B. Computer, C. Flower, D. License.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the serial position curve is. From what I remember in psychology classes, the serial position effect refers to the tendency for people to recall items at the beginning and the end of a list better than the items in the middle. So, there's a primacy effect for the beginning of the list and a recency effect for the end of the list. That means the middle items are often the ones that are forgotten the most.\n\nLet me list out the words in order to visualize this:\n\n1. House\n\n2. Flower\n\n3. Dog\n\n4. Table\n\n5. License\n\n6. Water\n\n7. Computer\n\n8. Salad\n\nNow, according to the serial position curve:\n\n- Items at the beginning (positions 1-2 maybe) should be recalled well due to primacy effect.\n\n- Items at the end (positions 7-8) should be recalled well due to recency effect.\n\n- Items in the middle (around positions 3-5) are more likely to be forgotten.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. House - that's the first word, so it should be recalled well.\n\nB. Computer - that's the seventh word, near the end, so it should be recalled well.\n\nC. Flower - that's the second word, still part of the beginning, so probably recalled well.\n\nD. License - that's the fifth word, which is in the middle.\n\nWait, License is in the middle, where recall is typically poorer. So, compared to the others, License seems like a likely candidate to be forgotten.\n\nBut let's double-check. House is position 1 (primacy effect), Computer is position 7 (recency effect), Flower is position 2 (still primacy), and License is position 5 (middle).\n\nSo, House, Flower, and Computer are all in positions where recall is better, while License is in a position where recall is worse.\n\nIs there any chance that License could be recalled better due to some other factors? For example, maybe it's a unique word in the list, or it stands out in some way.\n\nLet's see the list again: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad.\n\nLooking at the list, License might stand out because it's a bit more complex or less common compared to the other words like house, flower, dog, etc. But I don't think that affects the serial position effects directly. The position in the list is the primary factor here.\n\nSo, based on the serial position curve, License, being in the middle of the list, is the most likely to be forgotten compared to the other options provided.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could influence recall, like the distinctiveness of the word or its association with other words in the list.\n\nFor example, License might be associated with dog, as in a dog license, but I don't think that has a significant impact on recall in this context.\n\nAlso, Computer is towards the end and should be recalled well due to the recency effect, despite being in position 7.\n\nSimilarly, House and Flower are at the beginning, so they should be recalled well due to the primacy effect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. License.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possible confusion with the terms.\n\nIs there a chance that Computer, being a common word, might be forgotten more easily? No, that doesn't seem likely. Typically, common words are recalled better, not worse.\n\nAlso, House is a very common word and should be recalled well.\n\nFlower is another common word, and it's early in the list, so it should be recalled well.\n\nLicense is less common, but again, its position in the middle makes it more likely to be forgotten.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. License.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
