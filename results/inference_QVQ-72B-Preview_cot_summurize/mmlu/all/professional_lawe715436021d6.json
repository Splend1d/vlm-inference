The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery. The prosecution seeks to introduce the ski mask and the money found in his home into evidence. A motion by the defendant's attorney to exclude the items will be\n\nA. granted with respect to the ski mask, but denied with respect to the money.\nB. granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask.\nC. granted with respect to both the ski mask and the money.\nD. denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario about evidence admissibility in a bank robbery case. There are a bunch of robberies, and the police arrest someone based on a tip. During the arrest, they find a ski mask and some stolen money. Now, the defense wants to exclude these items as evidence. I need to decide whether the motion should be granted for the ski mask, the money, both, or neither.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic principles of search and seizure law, particularly the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The exclusionary rule comes into play here, which generally prevents evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment from being used in court.\n\nLet's break down the events:\n\n1. **Arrest Warrant and Initial Contact:**\n\n- The police have a valid arrest warrant for the defendant.\n\n- They go to his home, ring the doorbell, and he opens the door.\n\n- He is arrested.\n\nSo far, everything seems straightforward and lawful. Arrest warrants are generally sufficient for entering a home to make an arrest.\n\n2. **Accompanying the Defendant to Change Clothes:**\n\n- The defendant is only wearing underwear and asks to change.\n\n- An officer accompanies him to the bedroom for safety reasons, probably to prevent him from escaping or accessing weapons.\n\nThis seems reasonable under the circumstances, as officers often take precautions when dealing with suspects.\n\n3. **Inspecting the Closet:**\n\n- The defendant wants to get pants from the closet.\n\n- The officer decides to inspect the closet first.\n\n- In the closet, the officer sees a ski mask that matches the one used in the robberies.\n\nThis is where things get tricky. The officer is conducting a search within the home, beyond just accompanying the defendant. I need to consider whether this search is justified.\n\n**Possible Justifications for the Closet Search:**\n\n- **Consent:** Did the defendant consent to the search of the closet? It doesn't seem like it from the description.\n\n- **Plain View Doctrine:** The ski mask was in plain view, but was the officer lawfully present in the closet?\n\n- **Search Incident to Arrest:** Officers can search the area within the immediate control of the arrestee for safety reasons or to prevent evidence destruction. But does this extend to a closet?\n\n- **Exigent Circumstances:** If there was an emergency or immediate danger, a search might be justified, but that doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nGiven that the officer was in the closet to ensure safety during the clothing change, it might be argued that the search was incident to the arrest for safety reasons. However, it's not entirely clear if this extends to searching the closet.\n\n4. **Protective Sweep by the Partner Officer:**\n\n- While the first officer is in the bedroom with the defendant, the partner decides to conduct a protective sweep of the house to check for accomplices.\n\n- In a back storage room, the officer finds a box of stolen money.\n\nAgain, I need to assess the legality of this protective sweep.\n\n**Possible Justifications for the Protective Sweep:**\n\n- **Terry Stop and Frisk Analogy:** In Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court allowed a limited pat-down for officer safety. Maybe this could be extended to a quick sweep of the house for safety.\n\n- **Exigent Circumstances:** If there's reason to believe that accomplices might be present and pose a danger, a quick sweep might be justified.\n\n- **Consent:** Unless the defendant gave permission for a broader search, this might be a stretch.\n\n- **Inventory Search:** Not really applicable here.\n\nGiven that the officer was conducting a protective sweep for safety reasons, it might be considered reasonable under the circumstances, especially if there was a concern for officer safety or the possibility of accomplices.\n\nNow, considering all this, let's evaluate the admissibility of the ski mask and the money.\n\n**Ski Mask:**\n\n- Found in the closet during an officer's inspection.\n\n- The inspection might be justified as part of the search incident to arrest for safety reasons.\n\n- Even if it's a bit of a stretch, it's possible that the closet could contain weapons or means for escape.\n\n- The plain view doctrine applies since the mask was in open view.\n\n**Money:**\n\n- Found during a protective sweep for accomplices.\n\n- The sweep was for officer safety, which is a valid concern.\n\n- The money was in plain view in a back storage room.\n\n- It's directly related to the crime, as it's stolen money from the robberies.\n\nGiven these considerations, both pieces of evidence were likely obtained during searches that were justified for officer safety and as incident to the arrest. Therefore, the motion to exclude should probably be denied for both items.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any overreach or lack of probable cause for the searches.\n\n**Potential Arguments for Exclusion:**\n\n- **Ski Mask:** The defendant might argue that the officer's inspection of the closet was beyond what was necessary for ensuring safety during the clothing change.\n\n- **Money:** The protective sweep was overly broad and not limited to areas where an accomplice could be hiding.\n\nBut, in practice, courts often allow officers to take reasonable steps to ensure their safety during arrests, which can include quick sweeps of the premises.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the correct answer is D. denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
