                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this question about Norcross's claim. It says that if morality demands that we don't torture puppies just to enhance our own eating pleasure, then morality also demands that we not support factory farming. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the premise is that morality demands we don't torture puppies for the sake of enhancing our eating pleasure. So, basically, it's wrong to cause unnecessary suffering to animals just to make our food taste better or something like that. That seems pretty straightforward. Animal rights and all that.\n\nNow, the conclusion is that morality also demands that we not support factory farming. So, there's a link being drawn between torturing puppies for eating pleasure and supporting factory farming.\n\nI need to see why Norcross thinks that if you accept the first part, you should accept the second part.\n\nFactory farming is a system where animals are raised in confined spaces, often in large numbers, to produce meat, eggs, and dairy products efficiently. It's known for being cost-effective but has been criticized for animal welfare issues. Animals in factory farms might live in cages, be given hormones and antibiotics, and not have much space to move around.\n\nSo, if we believe it's wrong to torture puppies for eating pleasure, which involves causing unnecessary suffering to animals, then supporting factory farming, which also involves causing suffering to animals, should also be wrong.\n\nWait, but is factory farming just about causing suffering, or is it more complex?\n\nWell, factory farming does involve practices that can cause suffering to animals, like overcrowding, lack of natural behaviors, and sometimes painful procedures without adequate pain relief. So, if we care about minimizing animal suffering, supporting a system that involves a lot of suffering might be morally problematic.\n\nBut maybe there are differences between torturing a puppy and factory farming. For example, factory farming is on a much larger scale, involving millions of animals, whereas torturing a puppy is a more personal act.\n\nDoes that make a difference morally? Maybe. Some people might think that the scale matters; harming one animal is bad, but harming many is worse, so we should be more against factory farming.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the principle is the same: causing unnecessary suffering to animals is wrong, regardless of the number.\n\nBut then, is the suffering in factory farming unnecessary? Some might argue that it's necessary to feed the population affordably.\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, perhaps there are alternatives that are less cruel but still efficient.\n\nBut even if factory farming is efficient, does that justify the suffering?\n\nBack to the original premise: if it's wrong to torture puppies for eating pleasure, then it's wrong to cause unnecessary suffering for that purpose.\n\nSo, if factory farming causes unnecessary suffering, then it's wrong.\n\nBut is the suffering in factory farming unnecessary? Maybe some would argue that it's a necessary evil.\n\nBut animal rights advocates would say that there are ways to produce food without causing as much suffering, like free-range farming or plant-based alternatives.\n\nSo, perhaps the suffering isn't necessary.\n\nTherefore, if we accept that it's wrong to torture puppies for eating pleasure, we should also accept that supporting factory farming, which causes unnecessary suffering, is wrong.\n\nThat seems to be the logic.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. We try to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nWell, reducing our carbon footprint is about environmental sustainability and climate change, which is a different issue from animal suffering. While factory farming does contribute to carbon emissions, the original premise is about animal suffering, not environmental impact. So, this might be indirectly related, but it's not the direct connection.\n\nB. We donate money to Oxfam.\n\nOxfam is an organization that focuses on poverty and hunger relief, among other things. While they might support better farming practices, donating to them isn't directly tied to the premise about not torturing puppies for eating pleasure. It's a bit of a stretch.\n\nC. We not support factory farming.\n\nThis seems to directly align with Norcross's claim. If we accept that it's wrong to cause unnecessary suffering to animals for eating pleasure, then supporting a system that does that is also wrong.\n\nD. We follow the Golden Rule.\n\nThe Golden Rule is about treating others as you would like to be treated. While that could be applied to animals, it's a more general principle and not specifically about factory farming.\n\nSo, based on the premise, the most direct conclusion is that we should not support factory farming, which is option C.\n\nBut let me think if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe Norcross is trying to say that if you care about animal suffering in one context, you should care about it in others, like factory farming.\n\nSo, if you don't torture puppies for eating pleasure, you shouldn't support factory farming because it involves similar kinds of suffering.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a consistency argument: if you believe in not harming animals unnecessarily in one case, you should be consistent and not support it in other cases.\n\nYes, that seems plausible.\n\nSo, in that case, supporting factory farming would be inconsistent with the belief that it's wrong to torture puppies for eating pleasure.\n\nTherefore, to be consistent, you should not support factory farming.\n\nHence, option C is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's the best conclusion based on the given premise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
