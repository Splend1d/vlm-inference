                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Marquis's argument against abortion. From what I've read, he seems to think that abortion is morally wrong because a fetus is a person with full moral rights, including the right to life. That sounds like option A. But let me think about this more carefully.\n\nOption A says that Marquis argues abortion is morally wrong by showing that a fetus is a person with full moral rights, including the right to life. That seems straightforward. But I recall that Marquis's argument is a bit more nuanced than that. He talks about the future of the fetus and its potential to become a person with interests and rights.\n\nOption B mentions that Marquis appeals to the fact that a fetus is biologically human and argues that it's presumptively morally wrong to kill biologically human beings. Hmm, that sounds familiar, but I think Marquis's main focus is more on the potential future of the fetus rather than just its biological classification.\n\nOption C suggests that Marquis shows the fetus is sentient and that it's morally wrong to harm and kill sentient creatures. I don't remember Marquis emphasizing sentience in his arguments. His main point, I think, is about the fetus's potential for a future life.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to recall the specifics of Marquis's argument. I think he argues that abortion is wrong because it deprives the fetus of its future life, which has value. So, it's not just about the fetus being a person now or being biologically human, but about the potential future that is cut short by abortion.\n\nLet me see if that aligns with any of these options. Option A talks about the fetus being a person with full moral rights, which might imply that it has a right to life, but Marquis's argument seems to be more about the value of the future life that the fetus would have had.\n\nOption B is about the fetus being biologically human and that killing human beings is presumptively wrong. While that might be a common argument against abortion, I don't think it's the main thrust of Marquis's position.\n\nOption C is about sentience, which I don't recall being central to Marquis's argument. He seems more focused on the potential future of the fetus.\n\nMaybe the answer is D, none of the above. But that seems unlikely. Perhaps Marquis's argument is a combination of these approaches, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nLet me try to rephrase Marquis's argument to myself. He believes that abortion is morally wrong because it ends a potential life that has value. He compares it to other actions that wrongfully deprive someone of their future, like murder. So, in that sense, he is arguing that the fetus has a right to its future life, which is being unjustly terminated by abortion.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A seems the closest because it mentions the fetus having full moral rights, including the right to life. But Marquis's argument is based on the potential future of the fetus, not necessarily on its current status as a person.\n\nWait, maybe Marquis does consider the fetus to be a person with moral rights. I need to check that. I think he does argue that from the moment of conception, the fetus has moral status because it is a potential person with a future like ours.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option A would be correct. But I'm still a bit unsure because I thought his focus was more on the value of the future life that the fetus would have had.\n\nLet me consider this differently. If Marquis argues that abortion is wrong because it deprives the fetus of its future life, which has value, then that implies that the fetus has some moral status or rights that are being violated by abortion.\n\nOption A states that Marquis shows the fetus is a person with full moral rights, including the right to life. If that's his position, then yes, that would align with the idea that abortion is wrong because it violates the fetus's right to life.\n\nOption B is about the fetus being biologically human and that killing human beings is wrong. While that's a common argument, I don't think it's the primary focus of Marquis's argument.\n\nOption C is about sentience, which again, I don't recall being central to Marquis's position.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is likely option A: Marquis argues that abortion is morally wrong by showing that a fetus is a person with full moral rights, including the right to life.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm whether Marquis actually claims that the fetus is a person with full moral rights. I recall that he does argue for the moral status of the fetus based on its potential future, but I'm not sure if he uses the term \"person\" in the same way that other philosophers might.\n\nPerhaps \"person\" is too strong a term, and Marquis might not use it in the same sense as, say, Tom Regan or other personhood theorists. Marquis might use different terminology.\n\nGiven that, maybe option A isn't the best way to capture Marquis's argument. Perhaps the answer is D, none of the above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to summarize Marquis's main point, and option A is the closest match, even if it's not perfectly phrased.\n\nIn any case, based on my understanding, I'll go with option A: Marquis argues that abortion is morally wrong by showing that a fetus is a person with full moral rights, including the right to life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
