                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that V is a finite-dimensional real vector space, and P is a linear transformation on V such that P squared equals P. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what's going on. P is a linear transformation, and it satisfies P^2 = P. That means that applying P twice is the same as applying it once. This kind of transformation is called a projection, right? Because it projects vectors onto a subspace.\n\nOkay, so projections have some properties that I should recall. Let's think about what this implies for the transformation P.\n\nStatement I says that P is invertible. Hmm, is that necessarily true for a projection? Well, if P is the identity transformation, then it's invertible, but there are other projections that aren't invertible. For example, if P is the zero transformation, which projects every vector to the zero vector, then it's not invertible because it's not one-to-one. But wait, the problem says that P is either the identity or the zero transformation in statement III. But I think that's not always the case.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose V is R^2, and P is the projection onto the x-axis. So, if you have a vector (x, y), P maps it to (x, 0). Then P^2 would map (x, 0) to (x, 0), which is the same as P. So P^2 = P. Is P invertible in this case? No, because P is not onto; it maps everything to the x-axis, and information about the y-component is lost. So, P is not invertible here. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, statement II says that P is diagonalizable. What does it mean for a linear transformation to be diagonalizable? It means that there exists a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of P. In other words, the matrix representation of P with respect to this basis is diagonal.\n\nFor projections, I recall that they have eigenvalues of 0 and 1. Let's see: if P^2 = P, then for any eigenvector v with eigenvalue \u03bb, we have P(v) = \u03bbv, and P^2(v) = P(\u03bbv) = \u03bb^2 v. But P^2 = P, so \u03bb^2 v = \u03bb v, which implies \u03bb^2 = \u03bb. Therefore, \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb = 1.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of P are 0 and 1. Now, is P diagonalizable? Well, if V has a basis consisting of eigenvectors of P, then yes, P is diagonalizable. Given that V is finite-dimensional and the eigenvalues are 0 and 1, and since P satisfies the polynomial P^2 - P = 0, which means P satisfies its minimal polynomial, it should be diagonalizable.\n\nWait, is that always true? Let me think about it differently. Suppose V can be decomposed into the direct sum of the eigenspace for \u03bb = 0 and the eigenspace for \u03bb = 1. That is, V = ker(P) \u2295 im(P), where ker(P) is the eigenspace for \u03bb = 0 and im(P) is the eigenspace for \u03bb = 1.\n\nGiven that P^2 = P, it's a standard result in linear algebra that V can indeed be decomposed this way. So, P is diagonalizable with respect to this decomposition.\n\nTherefore, statement II is true.\n\nNow, statement III says that P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation. But from my earlier example, P can be a projection onto a subspace that's neither the whole space nor the zero subspace. For instance, in R^2 projecting onto the x-axis, which is neither the identity nor the zero transformation.\n\nSo, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, only statement II must be true.\n\nWait a minute, the answer options are:\n\nA. None\n\nB. I only\n\nC. II only\n\nD. III only\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, C. II only is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, P is a linear transformation on a finite-dimensional real vector space V, and P^2 = P.\n\nI already considered that P could be the zero transformation or the identity, but also other projections.\n\nFor statement I, P is invertible: my counterexample was the projection onto the x-axis in R^2, which is not invertible, so I concluded that I is not necessarily true.\n\nFor statement II, P is diagonalizable: based on the eigenvalues being 0 and 1, and the decomposition of V into ker(P) and im(P), I concluded that P is diagonalizable.\n\nFor statement III, P is either the identity or the zero transformation: my counterexample shows that there are other projections that satisfy P^2 = P, so III is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, only II must be true.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
