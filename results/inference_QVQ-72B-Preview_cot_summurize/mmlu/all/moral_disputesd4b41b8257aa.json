                    "text": " So I'm trying to figure out which statement Macedo would disagree with. The options are:\n\nA. States should give special weight to their own citizens.\n\nB. Immigration policies can have powerful economic effects.\n\nC. Self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate.\n\nD. There are reasons to think U.S. immigration policy has had detrimental effects on income distribution among citizens.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Macedo's views are on these topics. Since I don't have the original text, I'll have to make some educated guesses based on common positions in immigration debates.\n\nStarting with option A: States should give special weight to their own citizens.\n\nThis seems like a pretty standard position. Many people believe that a country should prioritize the well-being of its own citizens over non-citizens. This could be for various reasons, such as a duty to those who have contributed to the society or who are most affected by the country's policies. If Macedo is someone who emphasizes national sovereignty or the importance of citizenship, he might agree with this statement.\n\nBut the question is asking for what he would disagree with, so maybe he has a different perspective. Perhaps he believes in more open borders or that helping non-citizens is equally important. However, that seems less common, as most political theories acknowledge some form of special obligation to one's own citizens.\n\nMoving on to option B: Immigration policies can have powerful economic effects.\n\nThis seems like a factual statement rather than a normative one. It's widely accepted that immigration can affect the economy in various ways, such as influencing wages, employment rates, and economic growth. Both restrictionists and proponents of open immigration acknowledge that there are economic impacts, though they might disagree on whether those impacts are positive or negative.\n\nIf Macedo is knowledgeable about economics, he would likely agree that immigration policies have economic effects. Disagreeing with this would require denying a substantial body of economic research.\n\nOption C: Self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate.\n\nThis is an interesting one. Self-governance refers to the ability of a country to make its own decisions without external interference. In the context of immigration, this could involve setting immigration policies based on national interests and priorities.\n\nIf Macedo believes that countries have the right to control their borders and determine who enters and stays in their territory, he would likely disagree with the statement that self-governance is morally irrelevant. That is, he would consider self-governance to be morally relevant in the immigration debate.\n\nAlternatively, if he thinks that there are moral obligations that transcend national boundaries and require open borders, he might agree that self-governance is morally irrelevant. However, this is a minority view, as most people recognize the importance of national sovereignty in some form.\n\nFinally, option D: There are reasons to think U.S. immigration policy has had detrimental effects on income distribution among citizens.\n\nThis seems to suggest that current or past immigration policies in the U.S. may have worsened income inequality among citizens. There is evidence to suggest that immigration can affect wages, particularly for low-skilled workers. Some studies indicate that increased immigration may put downward pressure on wages for less-educated native workers.\n\nIf Macedo is someone who acknowledges these potential negative impacts, he might agree with this statement. On the other hand, if he believes that immigration has overall positive effects or that any negative effects are minimal or outweighed by other benefits, he might disagree.\n\nConsidering all this, I need to think about which of these statements Macedo would most likely disagree with.\n\nLet me consider that Macedo is probably someone who values national sovereignty and the right of states to control their borders. In that case, he might agree with options A and B, as they align with standard views on citizenship and economic impacts.\n\nOption C suggests that self-governance is morally irrelevant, which would contradict his likely belief in national sovereignty. Therefore, he would probably disagree with option C.\n\nAs for option D, even if he recognizes that immigration can have economic effects, he might still disagree that there are reasons to think it has had detrimental effects on income distribution. Perhaps he believes that any negative effects are exaggerated or that the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nHowever, given that the statement acknowledges \"reasons to think\" rather than asserting it as a fact, it's hard to disagree with that phrasing. It's reasonable to say that there are reasons to think immigration policy has had detrimental effects, even if one doesn't agree with the conclusion.\n\nBetween options C and D, I think option C is more directly contrary to what Macedo would believe. If he values national sovereignty, he would strongly disagree that self-governance is morally irrelevant in the immigration debate.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that Macedo would disagree with option C: Self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
