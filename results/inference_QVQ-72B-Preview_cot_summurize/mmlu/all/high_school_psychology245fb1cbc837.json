I'm a bit rusty on my neuroscience, but I remember that the nervous system is divided into a few main parts. Let's start by recalling the basic structure.\n\nThe nervous system in humans can be divided into two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord, which are protected by bone\u2014skull for the brain and vertebrae for the spinal cord. The PNS, on the other hand, includes all the nerves that branch out from the spinal cord and the brain to the rest of the body.\n\nNow, the peripheral nervous system can be further divided into two subsystems: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system is responsible for controlling voluntary movements and sensory information from the body. The autonomic nervous system, as its name suggests, regulates involuntary functions like heart rate, digestion, and respiration.\n\nSo, from this, it seems like the somatic nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system. That would make option B the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Central nervous system: That's the brain and spinal cord. The somatic nervous system is about the body's voluntary movements and sensations, which are handled by the nerves outside the CNS. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nB. Peripheral nervous system: This includes all the nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body. The somatic nervous system is indeed part of this, as it deals with sensory and motor functions of the body.\n\nC. Autonomic nervous system: This is the other division of the PNS, responsible for involuntary functions. The somatic nervous system is separate from this; it handles voluntary actions.\n\nD. Parasympathetic nervous system: This is a subsystem of the autonomic nervous system that calms the body down after stress, promoting relaxation and digestion. It's not directly related to the somatic nervous system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. peripheral nervous system.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that there isn't some trick here. Maybe I should think about the functions again.\n\nThe somatic nervous system is involved in sensory input and motor output for voluntary movements. It includes sensory neurons that bring information from the senses to the CNS and motor neurons that carry commands from the CNS to the muscles and glands.\n\nThe autonomic nervous system, on the other hand, is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, which regulate involuntary functions. So, again, the somatic nervous system is distinct from the autonomic system.\n\nThe central nervous system is where all the processing happens, in the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system is the network that connects the CNS to the rest of the body.\n\nGiven this, it's clear that the somatic nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that the peripheral nervous system is divided into somatic and autonomic parts. The somatic nervous system is further divided into somatosensory and somatomotor divisions, which handle sensory and motor functions, respectively.\n\nThe autonomic nervous system is further divided into sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric divisions, which handle involuntary functions.\n\nSo, no confusion there. The somatic nervous system is definitely part of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be B. peripheral nervous system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
