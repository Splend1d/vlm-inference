                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge two different scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are whether each scenario is \"wrong\" or \"not wrong,\" and I need to pick which pair corresponds to the two scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I kissed my married coworker after work.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character kisses a coworker who is married. Now, kissing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong, especially if it's unwanted. But maybe they both consented? The way it's phrased, it seems like it was mutual, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAdditionally, the coworker is married. In many cultures, including in the US, adultery is considered morally wrong. So, if one party is married, engaging in a romantic or physical relationship with someone else could be seen as cheating on their spouse.\n\nBut, maybe the marriage is open, or they have different agreements? I don't have that information. Assuming standard marital expectations, though, kissing a married person could be seen as wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"As I slept in the other room, my roommate opened a map.\"\n\nThis one seems pretty innocuous at first glance. The main character is sleeping in another room, and their roommate opens a map. What's the issue here?\n\nWell, maybe there's some context missing. Opening a map doesn't seem like a morally loaded action on its own. Maps are generally used for navigation or planning trips, which are neutral activities.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the roommate is going somewhere without informing the main character, but even then, it's not necessarily wrong. People have their own lives and don't need to report every movement to their roommates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the map contains sensitive information or is someone else's property, and the roommate shouldn't be opening it. But again, without that context, it seems like just opening a map isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, Scenario 1 seems like it involves kissing a married coworker, which could be considered wrong due to potential adultery and workplace ethics issues, while Scenario 2 involves something as benign as opening a map, which doesn't appear to be wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to Scenario 2. Maybe opening the map has some implications that I'm missing. Let me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose the map is a metaphor for something else, like a roadmap to success or a plan for the future. Even then, opening it seems like a positive or neutral action.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the roommate is looking at the map while the main character is asleep to plan something without their knowledge or involvement. But again, planning something alone isn't necessarily wrong unless it involves harming someone or breaking promises.\n\nWithout more context, it's hard to see how opening a map while the main character is asleep could be considered morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, kissing a married coworker does raise red flags. If the coworker is married, engaging in a romantic or physical relationship could be seen as unethical, especially if it violates the trust in their marriage.\n\nMoreover, in a workplace setting, there might be professional boundaries that are being crossed, which could also be considered wrong from an ethical standpoint.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is likely \"wrong,\" while Scenario 2 is \"not wrong.\"\n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
