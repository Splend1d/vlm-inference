                    "text": "So I have this problem here: compute the product (20)(-8) in Z_26. And the options are A. 0, B. 1, C. 11, D. 22. Okay, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on modular arithmetic, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, Z_26 is the set of integers modulo 26, right? So, any integer operations are performed and then reduced by taking the remainder when divided by 26. That means that in Z_26, numbers wrap around every 26 units. For example, 26 is congruent to 0, 27 is congruent to 1, and so on.\n\nSo, I need to compute (20)(-8) in Z_26. Hmm, negative numbers can be a bit tricky in modular arithmetic, but I think I can handle it. Maybe I should first compute the product as if it were in regular integer arithmetic and then apply the modulus.\n\nLet me calculate 20 times -8:\n\n20 * (-8) = -160\n\nAlright, so now I have -160. I need to find what -160 is congruent to modulo 26. That means I need to find the remainder when -160 is divided by 26. But remainders with negative numbers can be a bit confusing.\n\nI recall that when dealing with negative numbers in modular arithmetic, I can add multiples of the modulus to the number until I get a positive result that's within the range of 0 to 26-1, which is 0 to 25 in this case.\n\nSo, let's add 26 to -160 repeatedly until I get a positive number:\n\n-160 + 26 = -134\n\n-134 + 26 = -108\n\n-108 + 26 = -82\n\n-82 + 26 = -56\n\n-56 + 26 = -30\n\n-30 + 26 = -4\n\nNow, -4 is still negative. So, let's add 26 one more time:\n\n-4 + 26 = 22\n\nOkay, so 22 is positive and within the range of 0 to 25. Therefore, -160 is congruent to 22 modulo 26.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, 22 is one of the choices. So, that seems promising. But just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could reduce 20 and -8 modulo 26 first and then multiply.\n\nFirst, 20 modulo 26 is 20, since 26 - 6 = 20.\n\nAnd -8 modulo 26: let's see, 26 - 8 = 18, so -8 is congruent to 18 modulo 26.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If -8 plus 26 is 18, then yes, -8 \u2261 18 mod 26.\n\nSo, now I can compute (20)(18) modulo 26.\n\n20 * 18 = 360\n\nNow, 360 divided by 26 is... let's see, 26 * 13 = 338, and 360 - 338 = 22.\n\nSo, 360 modulo 26 is 22.\n\nTherefore, (20)(-8) in Z_26 is 22.\n\nWait, but is there a simpler way to think about this? Maybe using properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the calculation.\n\nI know that multiplication in modular arithmetic can be done by reducing each factor modulo the modulus before multiplying. So, as I did above, 20 mod 26 is 20, and -8 mod 26 is 18, so 20 * 18 mod 26 is 22.\n\nAlternatively, since -8 \u2261 18 mod 26, and 20 \u2261 20 mod 26, their product should be congruent to 20 * 18 mod 26, which is 360 mod 26, which is 22.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that in modular arithmetic, negative numbers can be represented by their positive counterparts that are congruent to them.\n\nSo, -8 \u2261 18 mod 26, as 18 - (-8) = 26, which is divisible by 26.\n\nTherefore, (20)(-8) \u2261 (20)(18) mod 26.\n\nAnd as calculated, 20 * 18 = 360, and 360 mod 26 is 22.\n\nSo, the answer should be 22.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1\n\nC. 11\n\nD. 22\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 22.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can use another approach.\n\nPerhaps I can use the property that in modular arithmetic, multiplication distributes over addition.\n\nSo, 20 * (-8) = 20 * (-1*8) = -20*8 = -160, which is what I had before.\n\nThen, -160 mod 26.\n\nTo find -160 mod 26, I can add 26 repeatedly until I get a positive number.\n\nLet's see:\n\n-160 + 26 = -134\n\n-134 + 26 = -108\n\n-108 + 26 = -82\n\n-82 + 26 = -56\n\n-56 + 26 = -30\n\n-30 + 26 = -4\n\n-4 + 26 = 22\n\nAgain, we arrive at 22.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for negative numbers in modular arithmetic:\n\na mod n = (a + k*n) mod n, where k is an integer chosen such that a + k*n is within the desired range.\n\nIn this case, a = -160, n = 26.\n\nI need to choose k such that -160 + 26*k is positive and less than 26.\n\nLet me solve for k:\n\n-160 + 26k > 0\n\n26k > 160\n\nk > 160/26\n\n160 divided by 26 is approximately 6.15, so k must be at least 7.\n\nLet's try k = 7:\n\n-160 + 26*7 = -160 + 182 = 22\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, (20)(-8) in Z_26 is 22.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 22.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can check if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nFor example, perhaps considering that in some contexts, negative numbers might be normalized differently in modular arithmetic, but according to standard definitions, this should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of exponents or other properties, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently through different methods, and they all lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 22} \\]"
