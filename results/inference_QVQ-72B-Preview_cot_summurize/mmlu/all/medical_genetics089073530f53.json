                    "text": "So I have this question here about monosomy. It's asking which of the given options is an example of monosomy. The options are:\n\nA. 46,XX\n\nB. 47,XXX\n\nC. 69,XYY\n\nD. 45,X\n\nFirst, I need to remember what monosomy is. I recall that monosomy is a condition where there is a single copy of a chromosome instead of the normal pair. So, in humans, we typically have 23 pairs of chromosomes, meaning 46 chromosomes in total. If someone has only one copy of a particular chromosome, that's monosomy for that chromosome.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 46,XX\n\nThis looks like a normal female karyotype. Humans normally have 46 chromosomes, and XX indicates female sex chromosomes. So, this should be the normal condition, not monosomy.\n\nOption B: 47,XXX\n\nThis shows 47 chromosomes, which is one extra chromosome compared to normal. Specifically, it's an extra X chromosome in females. I think this is trisomy X, which is the opposite of monosomy; it's having three copies of a chromosome instead of two.\n\nOption C: 69,XYY\n\nThis has 69 chromosomes, which is way above the normal 46. It seems like this is a triploid condition, meaning three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The XYY indicates an extra Y chromosome on top of the normal XY male complement. Again, this isn't monosomy; it's more chromosomes than normal.\n\nOption D: 45,X\n\nThis has 45 chromosomes, which is one less than the normal 46. The X indicates that one of the sex chromosomes is missing. So, this seems like monosomy for one of the sex chromosomes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. In humans, the normal female has 46 chromosomes with XX, and normal male has 46 chromosomes with XY. So, 45,X would mean there's only one sex chromosome, which is X, and no Y chromosome. This is typically known as Turner syndrome.\n\nTurner syndrome is a condition where a female is born with only one X chromosome instead of two. So, yes, that fits the definition of monosomy for the X chromosome.\n\nNow, just to make sure, let's think about the other options again.\n\nOption A: 46,XX \u2013 Normal female, not monosomy.\n\nOption B: 47,XXX \u2013 Extra X chromosome, which is trisomy, not monosomy.\n\nOption C: 69,XYY \u2013 Triploid with extra Y, still not monosomy.\n\nOption D: 45,X \u2013 Missing one sex chromosome, which is monosomy.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be D: 45,X.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's any possibility of monosomy for autosomes, not just sex chromosomes. For example, if someone has only one copy of a particular autosome, like monosomy 21, but that's not listed here.\n\nIn this question, all options are related to sex chromosomes or total chromosome counts. So, given these options, D: 45,X is the only one that fits the description of monosomy.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what monosomy means in general. Monosomy refers to having one copy of a chromosome instead of two. In humans, this can occur for both autosomes and sex chromosomes. However, monosomy for autosomes is often lethal, except in some specific cases.\n\nBut in this question, the options provided are:\n\nA. 46,XX\n\nB. 47,XXX\n\nC. 69,XYY\n\nD. 45,X\n\nOut of these, 45,X is the only option that represents monosomy, specifically monosomy X.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 45,X.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
