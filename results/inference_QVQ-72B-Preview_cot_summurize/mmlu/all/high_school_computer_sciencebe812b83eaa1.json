                    "text": "So I have this question here about Python operators. It's asking which operator in Python 3 performs exponential, or power, calculations on operands. The options are **, //, is, and not in. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that exponentiation is raising a number to the power of another number. So, like 2 to the power of 3 is 8, right? So, I need to find out which operator does that in Python.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. **: I've seen this before. I think it's the exponentiation operator. Let me confirm. If I type 2 ** 3 in Python, does that give me 8? Yeah, I think so. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nB. //: This is the floor division operator, I believe. Floor division means division that rounds down to the nearest integer. For example, 10 // 3 would be 3 because it's the largest integer less than or equal to the exact result. So, this doesn't seem related to exponentiation.\n\nC. is: This is a comparison operator used for identity checking. It checks if two variables point to the same object. For example, a is b would return True if a and b are the same object. Not related to exponentiation.\n\nD. not in: This is a membership operator. It's used to check if a value is not present in a sequence. For example, x not in [1, 2, 3] would check if x is not in that list. Again, not related to exponentiation.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like ** is the correct operator for exponentiation.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should check with an example. Let's say I have 2 ** 3. In Python, that should be 8. Yeah, that makes sense. And none of the other operators perform exponentiation.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to do exponentiation in Python? I think there's a pow() function, but that's not an operator. It's a function that can take two arguments, like pow(2, 3), which also gives 8. But the question specifically asks for an operator, so pow() wouldn't count.\n\nAlso, I recall that in some programming languages, you might use ^ for exponentiation, but in Python, ^ is the bitwise XOR operator. So, that's not it.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that ** is the operator for exponentiation in Python.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if there are any changes in Python 3 that might affect this. But no, I don't think so. The ** operator has been used for exponentiation in Python for a long time.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be A. **.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ **} \\]"
