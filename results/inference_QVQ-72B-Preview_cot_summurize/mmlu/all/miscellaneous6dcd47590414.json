                    "text": "So I need to figure out which singer appeared in the 1992 baseball film \"A League of Their Own.\" The options are Brandy, Madonna, Garth Brooks, and Whitney Houston. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"A League of Their Own\" is a movie about women playing baseball during World War II. It's a classic film, and I think Tom Hanks is in it too. But anyway, focusing on the singers:\n\n- Brandy: She's a singer and actress, known for her roles in TV shows and movies, but I don't recall her being in this particular film.\n\n- Madonna: She's a mega-popular singer and sometimes acts in movies. I think she was in films like \"Evita\" and \"Desperately Seeking Susan,\" but not sure about \"A League of Their Own.\"\n\n- Garth Brooks: He's a famous country music singer. I don't remember him being in any movies, especially not this one.\n\n- Whitney Houston: Another mega-popular singer, known for her powerful voice. I think she mostly did music and maybe some acting later on, but again, not sure about this specific movie.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe I should look up the cast of \"A League of Their Own\" and see who among these singers was actually in the film.\n\nOkay, so I recall that Tom Hanks is in it, and there are several actresses like Geena Davis and Lori Petty. But none of these options are in that list. Wait, maybe Madonna was in it? I think I've heard her name associated with the movie before.\n\nLet me consider Madonna. I know she's been in a few movies, and I think \"A League of Their Own\" might be one of them. I remember seeing pictures of her in a baseball uniform, maybe from this movie.\n\nBrandy, on the other hand, I think she was more active in the late '90s and early 2000s, so maybe a bit after 1992. But I could be wrong.\n\nGarth Brooks, I'm pretty sure, is primarily a musician and hasn't acted in many films. I don't think he was in \"A League of Their Own.\"\n\nWhitney Houston, while she did some acting later in her career, like in \"The Bodyguard,\" I don't think she was in this baseball film.\n\nSo, based on my recollection, Madonna seems like the most plausible option among the given choices. I think she was indeed in \"A League of Their Own.\"\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try to recall any specific scenes or moments from the movie that might feature one of these singers. I remember a scene where the team is practicing and Tom Hanks is coaching, and there's a famous line, \"There's no crying in baseball!\" But that doesn't help with the singers.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the soundtrack. If one of these singers contributed to the soundtrack and possibly appeared in the movie, that could be a possibility. But the question specifies that they appeared in the film, not just on the soundtrack.\n\nHmm, I don't think Brandy was involved in the 1992 version of the movie. Maybe in a later remake or something, but not the original.\n\nGarth Brooks, again, I don't think he was in the movie. He's more known for his music career in country music, and I don't recall any acting roles from him around that time.\n\nWhitney Houston, while she had a successful music career, I don't think she ventured into acting until later, like in the '90s with \"The Bodyguard\" in 1992. Wait, that was the same year as \"A League of Their Own.\" Maybe she was in both? But that seems unlikely.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, \"The Bodyguard\" came out in 1992, and \"A League of Their Own\" was also released in 1992. But just because they were both released in the same year doesn't mean she was in both films.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that none of these singers were in \"A League of Their Own.\" But that seems unlikely, as the question specifically mentions these four options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and the answer is none of the above. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of them had a cameo appearance or something small in the film.\n\nWait a minute, I think Madonna was indeed in \"A League of Their Own.\" I remember seeing her in a role where she played a member of the baseball team. Her character was named All-American Girl or something like that.\n\nLet me try to recall the character names. I think Geena Davis played Dottie Hinson, and Lori Petty was Kit Keller. Madonna, I believe, played a character named Madonna Fortunato or something similar. Wait, no, I think her character was named Erin Moran or maybe Mae Mordabito.\n\nActually, now that I'm thinking about it, I think Madonna's character was named Mae Mordabito. She was part of the Rockford Peaches team.\n\nTo double-check, I can try to recall the scenes she was in. I remember a scene where the team is practicing and Mae is flirting with the coach, which I think was Tom Hanks' character, Jimmy Dugan.\n\nSo, based on this recollection, Madonna definitely appeared in \"A League of Their Own\" in the role of Mae Mordabito.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Madonna.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly summarize why the other options are unlikely:\n\n- A. Brandy: While she has acted in other projects, I don't think she was in \"A League of Their Own.\"\n\n- C. Garth Brooks: Primarily a musician, no significant acting roles in movies around that time.\n\n- D. Whitney Houston: Although she was active in 1992 with \"The Bodyguard,\" I don't think she was in \"A League of Their Own.\"\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that Madonna is the singer who appeared in the 1992 baseball film \"A League of Their Own.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Madonna}} \\]"
