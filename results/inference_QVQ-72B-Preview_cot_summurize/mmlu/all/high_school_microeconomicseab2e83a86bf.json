                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"When the cross-price elasticity of demand is negative, the goods in question are necessarily A. normal B. inferior C. complements D. substitutes.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me first make sure I understand what cross-price elasticity of demand is.\n\nCross-price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. The formula is (change in quantity demanded of good A) divided by (change in price of good B), usually expressed as a percentage. If the cross-price elasticity is negative, that means when the price of good B increases, the quantity demanded of good A decreases, and vice versa.\n\nOkay, so that suggests that these two goods are related in such a way that they are used together or are complementary. Like, if the price of gasoline goes up, people might drive less, so the quantity demanded of cars might decrease. So, in this case, cars and gasoline are complements.\n\nLet me see the options again:\n\nA. normal\n\nNormal goods are those where demand increases as income increases, and decreases as income decreases. But this is about the relationship between two goods based on their prices, not about income effects. So, I don't think this is the right choice.\n\nB. inferior\n\nInferior goods are the opposite of normal goods; demand decreases as income increases. Again, this is about income effects, not about how the price of one good affects the demand for another. So, probably not this one either.\n\nC. complements\n\nThis seems to align with what I was thinking earlier. When two goods are complements, an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the demand for the other, resulting in a negative cross-price elasticity.\n\nD. substitutes\n\nSubstitutes are goods that can replace each other. If the price of one substitute good increases, people would switch to the other substitute, so the demand for the other good increases. That would mean a positive cross-price elasticity because quantity demanded moves in the same direction as the price of the substitute.\n\nSo, based on this, if the cross-price elasticity is negative, it suggests that the goods are complements, not substitutes.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that a good could be both a complement and a substitute at the same time? No, that doesn't make much sense. Goods are either substitutes or complements based on how their demands respond to each other's prices.\n\nLet me consider another example. Suppose the price of coffee increases, and as a result, the quantity demanded of tea increases. That would be a substitute relationship, with positive cross-price elasticity. But if the price of coffee increases and the quantity demanded of coffee makers decreases, that would be a complement relationship, with negative cross-price elasticity.\n\nSo, in both cases, the relationship is clear: substitutes have positive cross-price elasticity, and complements have negative cross-price elasticity.\n\nTherefore, when the cross-price elasticity is negative, the goods must be complements.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, is there any possibility that a good could have a negative cross-price elasticity with another good in a different context? For example, could a normal good have a negative cross-price elasticity with an inferior good or something like that?\n\nLet me think about this. No, because the nature of the relationship between the goods is what determines the sign of the cross-price elasticity, not the income classification of the goods.\n\nSo, normal and inferior goods are classifications based on how demand responds to changes in income, whereas complements and substitutes are about how demand responds to changes in the price of another good.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. complements.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the definition again: when the cross-price elasticity of demand is negative, the goods are necessarily complements. Yes, that aligns with economic theory.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here. It seems straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. complements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
