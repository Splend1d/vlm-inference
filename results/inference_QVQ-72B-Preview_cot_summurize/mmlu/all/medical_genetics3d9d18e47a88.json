                    "text": "So I have this question about positional cloning. It says, \"Positional cloning refers to...\" and there are four options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says, \"using a selection procedure to clone a cDNA.\" Hmm, cDNA is complementary DNA, which is typically made from mRNA. So, cloning a cDNA would involve making copies of a specific gene's DNA sequence from its mRNA form. But the question is about positional cloning, which I think is more about finding a gene based on its location on a chromosome, not necessarily cloning a cDNA using selection.\n\nOption B says, \"cloning a portion of a gene using PCR.\" PCR is Polymerase Chain Reaction, which is a method to amplify DNA sequences. So, using PCR, you can clone or make multiple copies of a specific part of a gene. But again, positional cloning seems different. It's more about locating a gene based on its position on a chromosome, not about cloning a portion of it using PCR.\n\nOption C says, \"isolating a gene by PCR using primers from another species.\" This sounds interesting. So, if you have primers from another species, you could potentially use them to amplify a similar gene in a different species through PCR. This might be called homology-based cloning or something like that, but I don't think it's specifically positional cloning. Positional cloning is more about mapping a gene to a specific location on a chromosome and then cloning it based on that position.\n\nOption D says, \"mapping a gene to a chromosomal region and then identifying and cloning a genomic copy of the gene from the region.\" This sounds a lot like what I understand positional cloning to be. It involves first mapping where the gene is on a chromosome and then finding and cloning the actual gene from that region.\n\nLet me think about this again. Positional cloning is a strategy used to identify and clone a gene based on its location or position on a chromosome. It's often used when the function of the gene is unknown, but there's a known location associated with a particular trait or disease. So, you map the region, narrow it down to a small enough area, and then identify the gene within that region.\n\nSo, comparing this to the options:\n\nA is about cloning a cDNA using selection, which is more about expressing genes or selecting for specific traits, not about mapping and cloning based on position.\n\nB is about cloning a portion of a gene using PCR, which is more about amplifying known sequences, not about mapping unknown genes based on their position.\n\nC is about using primers from another species to isolate a gene, which could be a form of homology cloning, but it's not specifically positional cloning.\n\nD is about mapping a gene to a chromosomal region and then cloning it from there, which matches my understanding of positional cloning.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: mapping a gene to a chromosomal region and then identifying and cloning a genomic copy of the gene from the region.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe positional cloning could involve PCR in some way, like using PCR to verify the position or to clone specific parts once the region is identified. But the way the question is phrased, it seems like it's asking for the overall process, which is indeed mapping and then cloning from the identified region.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
