                    "text": "So I need to figure out which of these options represents a combination of contractionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policy. Let's start by understanding what contractionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policies are.\n\nFirst, fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. Contractionary fiscal policy means the government is trying to reduce aggregate demand in the economy, usually to fight inflation. This can be done by increasing taxes or decreasing government spending.\n\nOn the other hand, monetary policy is about managing the money supply and interest rates, typically handled by the central bank. Expansionary monetary policy aims to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply or decreasing interest rates, making it easier for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend money.\n\nSo, I need to find an option where the fiscal policy is contractionary (either higher taxes or lower government spending) and the monetary policy is expansionary (actions that increase the money supply or decrease interest rates).\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A: Higher taxes and selling Treasury securities.\n\n- Higher taxes are contractionary fiscal policy because they reduce disposable income and thus consumer spending.\n\n- Selling Treasury securities is typically associated with contractionary monetary policy. When the central bank sells Treasury securities, it reduces the money supply in the economy because banks and investors buy these securities, taking money out of circulation. This should lead to higher interest rates, which slows down spending and investment.\n\nSo, Option A combines contractionary fiscal policy with contractionary monetary policy. Not what we're looking for.\n\nOption B: Lower taxes and buying Treasury securities.\n\n- Lower taxes are expansionary fiscal policy because they increase disposable income and encourage consumer spending.\n\n- Buying Treasury securities is expansionary monetary policy. When the central bank buys Treasury securities, it injects money into the economy, increasing the money supply. This should lead to lower interest rates, stimulating spending and investment.\n\nOption B combines expansionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policies. Not the right match.\n\nOption C: Lower government spending and increasing the reserve ratio.\n\n- Lower government spending is contractionary fiscal policy because it directly reduces aggregate demand.\n\n- Increasing the reserve ratio is contractionary monetary policy. When the central bank increases the reserve ratio, banks have to hold more money in reserve and can lend less, which decreases the money supply and leads to higher interest rates, slowing down economic activity.\n\nOption C combines contractionary fiscal and contractionary monetary policies.\n\nOption D: Higher taxes and buying Treasury securities.\n\n- Higher taxes are contractionary fiscal policy.\n\n- Buying Treasury securities is expansionary monetary policy.\n\nSo, Option D combines contractionary fiscal policy with expansionary monetary policy, which is exactly what the question is asking for.\n\nTo make sure, let's quickly recap:\n\n- Contractionary fiscal policy: higher taxes or lower government spending.\n\n- Expansionary monetary policy: actions like buying Treasury securities that increase the money supply and decrease interest rates.\n\nOption D has higher taxes (contractionary fiscal) and buying Treasury securities (expansionary monetary). This seems correct.\n\nI should also consider if there's any interaction between these policies. For example, higher taxes might reduce aggregate demand, and buying Treasury securities might stimulate it. So, in a way, they are offsetting each other to some extent, but the question is only asking for the combination, not the net effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option D: higher taxes and buying Treasury securities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
