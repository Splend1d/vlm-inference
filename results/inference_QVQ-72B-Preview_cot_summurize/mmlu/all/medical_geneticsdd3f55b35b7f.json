                    "text": "Let's tackle this genetics problem. So, we have two individuals with the genotype AaBbCc, and we want to find out the frequency of offspring with the genotype AABBCC. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the basics of Mendelian genetics. When two heterozygous parents are crossed, we can use a Punnett square to determine the possible combinations of alleles for each gene. But since we have three genes here (A, B, and C), each with two alleles, and both parents are heterozygous for all three, it might get a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nI recall that for each gene independently, the probability of getting a particular combination can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's desired allele. Since the genes are independent (assuming no linkage), their probabilities multiply.\n\nSo, let's consider each gene separately.\n\nStarting with gene A: both parents are Aa. The possible gametes they can produce are A or a, each with a probability of 1/2.\n\nSimilarly for gene B: both parents are Bb, so gametes B or b, each with a probability of 1/2.\n\nAnd for gene C: both parents are Cc, so gametes C or c, each with a probability of 1/2.\n\nNow, we want an offspring with genotype AABBCC. That means both parents have to contribute A, B, and C alleles to the offspring.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each gene first.\n\nFor gene A: the offspring needs to have two A alleles. Since both parents are Aa, the probability of getting an A allele from one parent is 1/2, and the same from the other parent. So, the probability for gene A is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B: the probability of getting B from both parents is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nAnd for gene C: the probability of getting C from both parents is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nNow, since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities together to get the overall probability.\n\nSo, overall probability = (1/4) for A * (1/4) for B * (1/4) for C.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1/4 * 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/64.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1.0/64 is one of them. But let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using Punnett squares for each gene pair.\n\nFor example, for genes A and a:\n\nParent 1: Aa\n\nParent 2: Aa\n\nPossible gametes for each: A and a.\n\nThe possible combinations for offspring:\n\nA from male and A from female: AA\n\nA from male and a from female: Aa\n\na from male and A from female: Aa\n\na from male and a from female: aa\n\nSo, the probability of getting AA is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly for genes B and b, and C and c.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting AABBCC is indeed (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/64.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance of epistasis or linkage between these genes that could affect the outcome? The problem doesn't specify any linkage, so I think it's safe to assume independent assortment.\n\nAlso, epistasis typically affects the phenotype, not the genotype frequencies, so it shouldn't be relevant here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the number of possible gametes and their combinations.\n\nEach parent can produce 2^3 = 8 different gametes because there are 3 genes each with 2 alleles.\n\nBut since all genes are segregating independently, the probability of getting specific alleles from each parent multiplies.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the general formula for multiplying independent probabilities.\n\nThe probability of event A and event B and event C all happening is P(A) * P(B) * P(C), assuming independence.\n\nIn this case, each gene's segregation is an independent event, so multiplying their probabilities is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of AABBCC individuals from the mating of two AaBbCc individuals is 1/64.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1.0/64\n\nB. 1.0/32\n\nC. 1.0/128\n\nD. 1.0/256\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's see if perhaps there's a different way to look at it.\n\nConsidering that both parents are identical in genotype, so the probabilities should be the same for both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the concept of haplotypes or something, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nNo, I think the initial approach is correct and straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 1.0/64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
