                    "text": "So I have this problem here about Jane's quiz scores. She had five quizzes with scores of 98, 97, 92, 85, and 93. The question is asking for her mean score. Okay, mean score usually means the average score, right? So, to find the average, I need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of scores.\n\nLet me first add up the scores: 98 plus 97 is 195, plus 92 is 287, plus 85 is 372, and plus 93 is 465. So, the total score is 465.\n\nNow, there are five quizzes, so I need to divide the total score by 5 to get the mean. Let's do that: 465 divided by 5.\n\nHmm, 465 \u00f7 5. Well, 5 times 93 is 465, because 5 times 90 is 450 and 5 times 3 is 15, so 450 + 15 = 465. So, 465 \u00f7 5 = 93.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should add up the scores again to confirm.\n\nOkay, 98 + 97 = 195\n\n195 + 92 = 287\n\n287 + 85 = 372\n\n372 + 93 = 465\n\nYes, total score is definitely 465.\n\nNow, dividing 465 by 5:\n\n5 * 93 = 465\n\nSo, 465 \u00f7 5 = 93\n\nAlright, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should try another approach to verify. Perhaps I can arrange the scores in order, just to see if there's any pattern or if maybe the median is the same or something. But no, the question is specifically asking for the mean.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the mean, which is just the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores. Yeah, that's what I did.\n\nLet me see if maybe I can calculate it differently. Suppose I subtract the smallest score from the total and see what's left. The smallest score is 85. So, total minus 85 is 380, and then divide by 4. But that wouldn't give me the mean, because I'm only dividing by four scores instead of five.\n\nNo, that's not the right approach. Maybe I should calculate the mean excluding one score and see if it affects the overall mean, but that seems unnecessary and complicates things.\n\nI think the simplest and most straightforward way is to add up all the scores and divide by the number of scores, which is what I did initially.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe weighted averages or something, but no, the problem seems straightforward: just find the mean of the five scores.\n\nSo, total score is 465, number of scores is 5, mean is 93.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 92\n\nB. 93\n\nC. 94.5\n\nD. 95\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be B. 93.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any trick here. Maybe the number of quizzes is not five, but that can't be right because the problem clearly states five quizzes: 98, 97, 92, 85, and 93.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scores are out of different maximum points, but no, they are all presumably out of 100, as they are quiz scores.\n\nAnother thought: maybe \"mean score\" refers to something else, like the mode or the median, but no, mean is specifically the average.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The question is straightforward: find the mean of the five scores, which is simply the sum divided by the count.\n\nSo, final answer is 93.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{93} \\]"
