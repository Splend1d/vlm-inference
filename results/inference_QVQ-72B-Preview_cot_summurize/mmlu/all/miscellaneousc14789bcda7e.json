                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Which part of the electromagnetic spectrum has the shortest wavelength? And the options are A. Gamma rays, B. X-rays, C. Radio waves, D. Microwaves. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I remember that the electromagnetic spectrum is like a big range of different waves, all moving at the speed of light, but they have different wavelengths and frequencies. The relationship between wavelength and frequency is given by the equation c = \u03bb * f, where c is the speed of light, \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. So, higher frequency means shorter wavelength, and lower frequency means longer wavelength.\n\nOkay, so I need to recall the order of the electromagnetic spectrum. Starting from the longest wavelength to the shortest, I think it goes: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Wait, is that right? Let me see if I can remember the order. Radio waves are the longest, then microwaves, then infrared, then visible light, then ultraviolet, then X-rays, and finally gamma rays. So, according to this, gamma rays have the shortest wavelength.\n\nBut let me double-check. I think the mnemonic ROYGBIV is for the colors of the visible spectrum: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. But that's just the visible light portion. To remember the entire electromagnetic spectrum from longest to shortest wavelength, maybe I can think of it as Radio waves, Microwaves, Infrared, Visible light, Ultraviolet, X-rays, Gamma rays. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, according to this, gamma rays have the shortest wavelength. But wait, I should make sure that there aren't any other types of radiation that might have shorter wavelengths. For example, cosmic rays are sometimes mentioned in relation to the electromagnetic spectrum, but actually, cosmic rays are not part of the electromagnetic spectrum; they are high-energy particles, mostly protons and electrons, not electromagnetic waves. So, gamma rays are indeed the part of the electromagnetic spectrum with the shortest wavelength.\n\nLet me consider some properties of gamma rays to make sure I understand. Gamma rays are produced by atomic nuclei and are very high in energy. They are used in medical applications like cancer treatment and in astronomy to study phenomena like supernovae and black holes. Their wavelengths are extremely short, much shorter than X-rays, which are used in medical imaging and can penetrate through many materials.\n\nSo, comparing to X-rays, gamma rays have even shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies, hence higher energies. Radio waves, on the other hand, have the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies, used for communication like FM radio and TV broadcasts. Microwaves are used for things like radar and microwave ovens, and they have wavelengths longer than infrared light but shorter than radio waves.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, gamma rays should be the correct answer to the question \"Which part of the electromagnetic spectrum has the shortest wavelength?\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it in terms of frequency as well. Since frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional (c = \u03bb * f), the highest frequency corresponds to the shortest wavelength. So, gamma rays have the highest frequency among all the electromagnetic waves, which aligns with them having the shortest wavelength.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the energy of the photons in each type of radiation. The photon energy E is equal to h times f, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency. So, higher frequency means higher energy photons. Gamma rays have the highest energy photons, followed by X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves.\n\nSo, again, this reinforces that gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies and energies.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be A. Gamma rays.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Gamma rays}} \\]"
