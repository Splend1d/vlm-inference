                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. So, statement 1 says: \"There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.\" Hmm, what does that mean? Well, a free abelian group is basically an abelian group that has a basis, kind of like how vector spaces have bases. The rank of a free abelian group is just the number of elements in that basis. So, if I have a free abelian group of rank n, that means it's generated by n elements, and any relation among those elements is trivial.\n\nNow, the statement is claiming that for any positive integer n, there exists such a group. That sounds familiar. In fact, we can construct a free abelian group of any rank we want. For example, the integers Z form a free abelian group of rank 1. The direct sum of n copies of Z, denoted Z^n, is a free abelian group of rank n. So, for every positive integer n, there is such a group. Therefore, statement 1 should be true.\n\nMoving on to statement 2: \"A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\" Okay, this one seems a bit more involved. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, a finitely generated abelian group is an abelian group that can be generated by a finite set of elements. Now, such groups can be classified using the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups. According to this theorem, any finitely generated abelian group G can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups: Z^{r} \u2295 Z_{n_1} \u2295 Z_{n_2} \u2295 ... \u2295 Z_{n_s}, where r is the Betti number (or the rank), and the Z_{n_i} are finite cyclic groups.\n\nA free abelian group is one where none of these finite cyclic factors are present, meaning s = 0. So, a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if and only if it has no finite cyclic factors, which is equivalent to saying that its Betti number equals the number of generators in any minimal generating set.\n\nBut wait, the statement says \"equals the number of elements in some generating set.\" Hmm, that seems a bit vague. Any finitely generated abelian group has generating sets of various sizes, but the minimal generating set corresponds to the Betti number plus the number of finite cyclic factors.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The Betti number r of a finitely generated abelian group G is the maximal number of independent generators, i.e., the rank of G as a free abelian group. If G is free abelian, then its minimal generating set has exactly r elements, and there are no relations among them.\n\nHowever, if G is not free abelian, say it has some finite cyclic factors, then any generating set must include generators for these finite parts, so the generating set will have more than r elements.\n\nTherefore, if G is free abelian, its Betti number r equals the number of elements in any minimal generating set. But the statement says \"some generating set,\" which could be any generating set, not necessarily minimal. But in practice, for free abelian groups, any generating set can be reduced to a minimal one with r elements, so the Betti number would indeed equal the number in some (minimal) generating set.\n\nOn the other hand, if G is not free abelian, its Betti number r is less than the number of elements in any generating set, since you'd have to include generators for the finite cyclic factors.\n\nWait a minute, is there a generating set of exactly r elements even when there are finite cyclic factors? No, because the finite cyclic factors require additional generators beyond the free part.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 seems to be saying that G is free abelian if and only if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set. But actually, in any finitely generated abelian group, the Betti number is the minimal number of generators needed. So, if the Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set, that would imply that there exists a generating set of exactly that minimal size, meaning no finite cyclic factors are present, hence G is free abelian.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Suppose G has a generating set of size r, but it also has some finite cyclic factors. Is that possible? No, because the finite cyclic factors would require additional generators beyond the free part.\n\nTherefore, if there exists a generating set of exactly r elements, then G must be free abelian. Conversely, if G is free abelian, then there exists a generating set of exactly r elements.\n\nSo, statement 2 seems to be true as well.\n\nBut let me double-check. Consider the group Z \u2295 Z_2. Its Betti number is 1. Does there exist a generating set of size 1? If I take the element (1,0), does that generate the whole group? No, because (0,1) cannot be generated by any multiple of (1,0). So, no, there is no generating set of size 1 for Z \u2295 Z_2, even though its Betti number is 1.\n\nOn the other hand, Z \u2295 Z has a generating set of size 2: {(1,0), (0,1)}. But Z \u2295 Z is free abelian of rank 2, so its Betti number is 2, which equals the number of elements in this generating set.\n\nSimilarly, Z_2 has Betti number 0, and its generating set has 1 element, but according to the statement, it's not free abelian, which is correct.\n\nWait, but the statement specifies \"finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\" It's phrased as an \"if\" statement, not \"if and only if.\" So, it's saying that if the Betti number equals the number in some generating set, then the group is free abelian.\n\nBut in reality, if the group is free abelian, then its Betti number equals the minimal number of generators, which is the number in any minimal generating set. So, there exists at least one generating set whose number of elements equals the Betti number. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nHowever, to be precise, the converse is also true: if the group is free abelian, then its Betti number equals the number of elements in any generating set (when minimized). But the statement only claims the forward direction, which seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ True, True}} \\]"
