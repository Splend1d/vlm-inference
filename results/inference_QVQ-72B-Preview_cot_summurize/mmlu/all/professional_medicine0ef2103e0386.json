The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 .

                    "text": "So I've got this case about a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who's been admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. He's been having some increased lethargy and decreased ability to move around lately. His daughter mentioned that his tremors get worse at certain times of the day, but he's still managing on his own at home. He has high blood pressure too, and he's taking a few medications: hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa.\n\nLet me see what his vital signs are. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C, which is pretty high, almost 102\u00b0F. His pulse is 60 lying down and 68 standing up. Blood pressure is 100/60 lying down and drops to 80/50 when standing. That's a significant drop in blood pressure when he stands up, which could be a problem.\n\nHe looks older than his age and is lethargic, but he's fully oriented. On examination, he has some breathing sounds in his right mid-lung field, which is probably the pneumonia. His abdomen is fine, and his neuro exam shows masked facies, which means his face lacks expression, bradykinesia, which is slowness of movement, and cogwheel rigidity, which is a type of muscle stiffness. They didn't assess his gait because he was admitted, but his daughter said his ambulation has decreased.\n\nA chest X-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate, which confirms the pneumonia. His ECG is normal, which is good. They started him on IV antibiotics, which is the right thing to do for pneumonia.\n\nNow, the question is asking what's the most appropriate step prior to discharge. The options are:\n\nA. Obtain CT scan of the chest\n\nB. Obtain a swallowing evaluation\n\nC. Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube\n\nD. Prescribe fludrocortisone\n\nAlright, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A: obtain a CT scan of the chest. He already had a chest X-ray that showed a right lower lobe infiltrate, which is consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan might show more detail, but is it necessary before discharge? Maybe if there's a suspicion of something else going on, like a mass or another issue, but based on the information given, it seems like the pneumonia is being treated appropriately. So, maybe not the top priority.\n\nOption B: obtain a swallowing evaluation. This is interesting. Parkinson's disease can affect swallowing, and he's been admitted with pneumonia, which could be related to aspiration due to poor swallowing. A swallowing evaluation could help assess if he's at risk for aspiration and provide interventions to prevent future pneumonia. That sounds like a good idea.\n\nOption C: place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. This is a tube inserted into the stomach for feeding. It's commonly used in people who can't swallow well or have difficulty eating. Given that he has Parkinson's and might have swallowing issues, this could be considered. However, PEG tubes are not without risks, and they're usually considered when nutritional needs can't be met otherwise. Is it necessary right now? He's still managing at home and caring for himself, so maybe not immediately, but it's something to consider in the future if his condition worsens.\n\nOption D: prescribe fludrocortisone. Fludrocortisone is a medication used to treat orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure when standing up. He does have a significant drop in blood pressure when he stands, which could be related to his Parkinson's disease or his medications. Prescribing fludrocortisone could help manage this issue and prevent dizziness or fainting episodes.\n\nSo, between these options, I need to decide which one is the most appropriate step before discharge.\n\nLet me consider his overall condition. He has Parkinson's disease, which affects movement and can also affect swallowing and autonomic functions like blood pressure regulation. He's been admitted with pneumonia, likely due to aspiration from poor swallowing. He's being treated with antibiotics, and his vital signs are being monitored.\n\nGiven that, a swallowing evaluation (option B) seems particularly important because it can help prevent future episodes of pneumonia by ensuring he's swallowing safely. This could involve modifying his diet, teaching him specific swallowing techniques, or even considering a PEG tube if necessary, but that's a more invasive option.\n\nOption D, prescribing fludrocortisone for his orthostatic hypotension, is also a valid consideration. However, managing his blood pressure is important to prevent dizziness and falls, but it might not be as directly related to preventing future pneumonia as improving his swallowing.\n\nOption C, placing a PEG tube, is a more invasive procedure and might not be necessary at this stage since he's still managing his self-care at home.\n\nOption A, getting a CT scan of the chest, might be useful for more detailed imaging of the pneumonia, but it's not clear if it's necessary before discharge, especially since he's already being treated with antibiotics.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B, obtaining a swallowing evaluation, is the most appropriate step prior to discharge. It addresses a key issue that likely led to his pneumonia and can help prevent future complications.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nB. Obtain a swallowing evaluation"
