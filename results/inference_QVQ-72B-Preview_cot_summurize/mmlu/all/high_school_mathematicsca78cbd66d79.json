                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to simplify the expression \\((x\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\) and find out what the exponent of \\(x\\) is after simplification. The options are 5, 10, 2, or 12. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you have exponents and square roots, there are some rules that might help. Let's recall that \\(\\sqrt{x^3}\\) can be written as \\(x^{3/2}\\), right? Because the square root is the same as raising to the power of \\(1/2\\). So, the expression becomes \\((x \\cdot x^{3/2})^4\\).\n\nNow, inside the parentheses, I have \\(x\\) multiplied by \\(x^{3/2}\\). I remember that when you multiply two exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So, \\(x^1 \\cdot x^{3/2} = x^{1 + 3/2} = x^{5/2}\\). Then, the entire expression simplifies to \\((x^{5/2})^4\\).\n\nNext, I need to deal with the exponent outside the parentheses. There's a rule that says when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply the exponents. So, \\((x^{5/2})^4 = x^{(5/2) \\cdot 4} = x^{10/2} = x^5\\).\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Starting from the beginning:\n\nI have \\((x\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\). I replaced \\(\\sqrt{x^3}\\) with \\(x^{3/2}\\), which makes sense because \\(\\sqrt{x^3} = (x^3)^{1/2} = x^{3 \\cdot 1/2} = x^{3/2}\\).\n\nThen, \\(x \\cdot x^{3/2} = x^{1 + 3/2} = x^{5/2}\\). That looks correct.\n\nFinally, raising \\(x^{5/2}\\) to the 4th power: \\((x^{5/2})^4 = x^{5/2 \\cdot 4} = x^{20/2} = x^{10}\\). Wait, that gives \\(x^{10}\\), but according to my earlier step, it should be \\(x^5\\). Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nLet me recalculate: \\((x^{5/2})^4 = x^{5/2 \\cdot 4} = x^{20/2} = x^{10}\\). No, that seems correct. But earlier I thought it was \\(x^5\\), which was a mistake. So, according to this, the exponent should be 10.\n\nBut let me verify another way to be sure. Maybe I'll expand everything step by step.\n\nStarting with \\((x\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\), let's first simplify inside the parentheses.\n\n\\(\\sqrt{x^3} = x^{3/2}\\), as before.\n\nSo, \\(x \\cdot x^{3/2} = x^{1 + 3/2} = x^{5/2}\\).\n\nNow, \\((x^{5/2})^4\\). Using the power of a power rule: \\((x^{a})^{b} = x^{a \\cdot b}\\), so \\(x^{5/2 \\cdot 4} = x^{20/2} = x^{10}\\).\n\nYes, that confirms it again. So, the exponent of \\(x\\) is 10.\n\nBut wait, the answer choices include 5, 10, 2, and 12. So, maybe there's a different approach that could lead to a different answer, but I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the expression. Let's consider expanding it differently.\n\nStarting with \\((x\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\), maybe I can write it as \\(x^4 (\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\). Is that valid?\n\nYes, because \\(x \\cdot x \\cdot x \\cdot x = x^4\\), and \\((\\sqrt{x^3})^4 = (x^{3/2})^4 = x^{6}\\), so overall \\(x^4 \\cdot x^6 = x^{10}\\). Again, the exponent is 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of logarithms or properties of exponents, but that seems overkill for this problem.\n\nSo, based on these different methods, it seems consistent that the exponent of \\(x\\) is 10.\n\nWait, but the answer choice includes 5, which makes me wonder if perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's a different approach that leads to a different exponent.\n\nLet me try another method. Suppose I write everything in terms of fractional exponents from the beginning.\n\n\\((x\\sqrt{x^3})^4 = (x \\cdot x^{3/2})^4 = (x^{1 + 3/2})^4 = (x^{5/2})^4 = x^{10}\\).\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values for \\(x\\) to test the expression.\n\nLet's pick \\(x = 2\\). Then, \\((2\\sqrt{2^3})^4 = (2\\sqrt{8})^4 = (2 \\cdot 2)^4 = (4)^4 = 256\\).\n\nNow, \\(x^{10} = 2^{10} = 1024\\), which doesn't match 256. Hmm, that's not consistent. Maybe I made a mistake in choosing \\(x = 2\\).\n\nWait, let's recalculate with \\(x = 2\\):\n\nFirst, \\(\\sqrt{x^3} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\), so \\(x\\sqrt{x^3} = 2 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThen, \\((4\\sqrt{2})^4 = 4^4 (\\sqrt{2})^4 = 256 \\cdot 4 = 1024\\).\n\nBut \\(x^{10} = 2^{10} = 1024\\), which matches. So, actually, my earlier calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, no, let's re-examine:\n\n\\((2\\sqrt{2^3})^4 = (2\\sqrt{8})^4 = (2 \\cdot 2)^4 = 16^4 = 65536\\), which doesn't match \\(x^{10} = 1024\\). Wait, this is confusing.\n\nActually, \\(\\sqrt{2^3} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\), so \\(2\\sqrt{2^3} = 2 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\\), and \\((4\\sqrt{2})^4 = 4^4 (\\sqrt{2})^4 = 256 \\cdot 4 = 1024\\), which matches \\(x^{10} = 2^{10} = 1024\\).\n\nEarlier, I thought \\((2\\sqrt{8})^4 = (2 \\cdot 2)^4 = 16^4\\), but that's incorrect because \\(\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\), not 2. So, it should be \\(2 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\\), and then \\((4\\sqrt{2})^4 = 256 \\cdot 4 = 1024\\), which aligns with \\(x^{10} = 1024\\).\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation was wrong, and the correct simplification does lead to \\(x^{10}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(x\\) is 10, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another value for \\(x\\). Let's pick \\(x = 1\\).\n\nThen, \\((1\\sqrt{1^3})^4 = (1 \\cdot 1)^4 = 1^4 = 1\\).\n\nAnd \\(x^{10} = 1^{10} = 1\\), which matches.\n\nAnother check: \\(x = 4\\).\n\n\\((4\\sqrt{4^3})^4 = (4\\sqrt{64})^4 = (4 \\cdot 8)^4 = 32^4 = 1048576\\).\n\nAnd \\(x^{10} = 4^{10} = 1048576\\), which again matches.\n\nTherefore, it's consistent that the exponent is 10.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the exponent of \\(x\\) is 10, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
