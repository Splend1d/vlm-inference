                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to evaluate two different scenarios and determine whether the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" I need to match these with Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"While my parents were fast asleep, I cooked brunch.\"\n\nSo, the main character decides to cook brunch while their parents are asleep. Hmm, cooking is generally not considered morally wrong, right? Unless there's something specific about cooking that could be harmful or against some moral standard. But in this case, it's just making brunch. It doesn't seem like there's any malicious intent here. Maybe they wanted to surprise their parents with a nice meal when they wake up? That actually sounds considerate.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different perspective. Perhaps the parents didn't want brunch to be cooked while they were asleep for some reason. But the scenario doesn't provide any information like that. It just says that the parents were asleep, and the main character cooked brunch. Without any negative consequences or intentions, it's hard to see this as morally wrong.\n\nOkay, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I was very proud of the SAT test scores I got for myself.\"\n\nHere, the main character is proud of their SAT scores. SAT scores are standardized tests that many students take for college admissions in the US. Being proud of one's academic achievements is generally seen as a positive thing. It shows that the person worked hard and achieved a good result. Again, no obvious moral wrongdoing here.\n\nBut maybe there's a context missing. What if the person cheated to get those scores? Well, that would be morally wrong, but the scenario says, \"I got for myself,\" which implies that they earned the scores through their own effort and preparation. Cheating would be a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps being proud of one's own achievements could be seen as boastful or arrogant, but that's more about how the pride is expressed rather than the pride itself. The scenario doesn't specify how the pride is being expressed, so I can't assume anything beyond that.\n\nGiven the information provided, both scenarios seem to be morally neutral or even positive. Cooking brunch could be a nice gesture, and being proud of one's SAT scores is a natural and acceptable reaction to achieving a personal goal.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario appears to be clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might categorize these actions as wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps if cooking while parents are asleep is against some household rule, but that seems more like a personal family rule rather than a widespread moral standard in the US.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pride in one's achievements is generally encouraged, as it fosters self-confidence and motivation to succeed further.\n\nUnless there's additional context or cultural specifics that aren't provided, I stand by my conclusion that both scenarios are \"Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
