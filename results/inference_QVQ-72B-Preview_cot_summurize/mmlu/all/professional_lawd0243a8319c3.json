                    "text": "Alright, I've got this scenario about three parcels of land on a mountain, owned by different people, and there's a private drainage system that was built before the properties were sold off. I need to figure out what kind of easement this drainage system would be considered from the perspective of the friend and the cousin, who are the current owners of parcels B and C.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what an easement is. An easement is a right to use another person's land for a specific purpose. There are different types of easements, and they can be created in various ways, so I need to sort through the options given: easement appurtenant, easement by implication, prescriptive easement, and express easement.\n\nLet's start by defining each type:\n\n1. **Easement appurtenant:** This is an easement that benefits one piece of land (the dominant tenement) and burdens another (the servient tenement). It's typically attached to the land and passes with the land when it's sold.\n\n2. **Easement by implication:** This is an easement that arises when there's a necessity or apparent continued use from the prior unified ownership. It's based on the idea that the original owner intended to create an easement when dividing the property.\n\n3. **Prescriptive easement:** This is an easement acquired by continuous and open use over a certain period, usually without the owner's permission.\n\n4. **Express easement:** This is an easement that's explicitly created by a written agreement or deed.\n\nNow, let's look at the scenario:\n\n- There are three parcels: A, B, and C, owned originally by one man.\n\n- In 2000, he built a private drainage system that runs across all three parcels, taking sewage from A to the municipal sewer at the bottom of the mountain.\n\n- In 2005, he sold parcel B to his friend, and in 2006, parcel C to his cousin.\n\n- The deeds for B and C didn't mention the drainage system.\n\n- Each parcel has a large ranch-style home occupied by the owners.\n\nFrom the friend's and cousin's perspectives, what kind of easement is this drainage system?\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n**Option A: Easement appurtenant.**\n\n- This would suggest that the drainage system benefits one parcel and burdens another.\n\n- But in this case, the drainage system is benefitting parcel A by disposing of its sewage, and it's burdening parcels B and C by running across their land.\n\n- However, parcels B and C don't seem to be benefitting directly from this system; it's only parcel A that's benefitting.\n\n- Easements appurtenant typically involve both a dominant and a servient tenement, where the dominant tenement benefits from the easement, and the servient tenement is burdened by it.\n\n- Here, parcel A is the dominant tenement, and parcels B and C are servient tenements.\n\n- But from the friend's and cousin's perspectives, they are the owners of the servient tenements, and the easement is benefiting someone else's land (parcel A).\n\n- So, from their perspective, it's an easement appurtenant to parcel A, but burdening their parcels.\n\n- But the question is asking from their standpoint, so maybe this is a consideration.\n\n**Option B: Easement by implication.**\n\n- This type of easement arises when there's a necessity or apparent continued use from the prior unified ownership.\n\n- In this case, the original owner had all three parcels and built the drainage system.\n\n- When he sold parcels B and C, the drainage system was already in place.\n\n- If the friend and cousin were aware of the system and its use, they might have implied consent to its continued use.\n\n- However, the deeds didn't mention the system, so perhaps there was an assumption that it would continue.\n\n- But for an easement by implication, there needs to be a necessity or apparent use.\n\n- Here, the drainage system is necessary for parcel A to dispose of its sewage, so it could be seen as necessary.\n\n- Therefore, when the properties were divided, an easement by implication might have been created.\n\n- From the friend's and cousin's perspectives, they might consider this easement was implied by the original setup.\n\n**Option C: Prescriptive easement.**\n\n- This requires continuous and open use over a certain period without the owner's permission.\n\n- The system was built in 2000, and the properties were sold in 2005 and 2006.\n\n- Depending on the jurisdiction, the prescriptive period might be anywhere from 5 to 30 years.\n\n- Assuming the prescriptive period is longer than the time between construction and sale, this might not apply.\n\n- Also, the original owner built the system, so it was with his permission.\n\n- After selling B and C, if the new owners didn't give permission, but the system continued to operate, perhaps without their consent, then maybe prescriptive rights could be claimed.\n\n- But it seems unlikely in this scenario, as the original owner had the right to build it initially.\n\n- So, probably not the best fit.\n\n**Option D: Express easement.**\n\n- This would require a written agreement or deed that explicitly creates the easement.\n\n- The deeds to the friend and cousin didn't mention the drainage system.\n\n- So, unless there was a separate written agreement, this doesn't seem to apply.\n\n- Therefore, it's unlikely to be an express easement.\n\nConsidering all this, the most plausible options seem to be easement appurtenant or easement by implication.\n\nFrom the friend's and cousin's perspectives, they might see the drainage system as an easement appurtenant to parcel A, burdening their parcels. However, since the deeds didn't mention the system, they might argue that it was implied by the original setup and necessary for parcel A's use.\n\nI think the key here is the necessity and the original unified ownership. The drainage system was in place before the properties were sold, and it's essential for parcel A's function. Therefore, when the properties were divided, an easement by implication likely arose to allow the continued use of the drainage system for parcel A.\n\nSo, my answer would be Option B: easement by implication.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
