Hmm, I need to figure this out. I remember that in linear algebra, a Hermitian operator is a type of matrix that has some special properties, especially regarding its eigenvalues.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand what a Hermitian operator is. In linear algebra, an operator (or matrix) is Hermitian if it's equal to its own conjugate transpose. So, if we have an operator represented by a matrix \\(A\\), then being Hermitian means \\(A = A^\\dagger\\), where \\(A^\\dagger\\) is the conjugate transpose of \\(A\\). This is a key property in quantum mechanics, where Hermitian operators represent observable quantities.\n\nNow, the question is about the eigenvalues of such an operator. Eigenvalues are those scalars that appear in the eigenvalue equation \\(A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nSo, the question is asking what can always be said about these \\(\\lambda\\)s when \\(A\\) is Hermitian.\n\nLet me recall some properties of Hermitian matrices and their eigenvalues. I think there's a theorem that states that the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are always real. Is that right?\n\nLet me try to recall the proof or at least the reasoning behind it. If \\(A\\) is Hermitian, meaning \\(A = A^\\dagger\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), then we have \\(A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\nIf I take the conjugate transpose of both sides, I get \\((A\\mathbf{v})^\\dagger = (\\lambda\\mathbf{v})^\\dagger\\), which is \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\dagger A^\\dagger = \\mathbf{v}^\\dagger \\lambda^*\\). But since \\(A = A^\\dagger\\), this becomes \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\dagger A = \\mathbf{v}^\\dagger \\lambda^*\\).\n\nBut from the eigenvalue equation, \\(A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathmathbf{v}\\), so \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\dagger A\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}^\\dagger \\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). Substituting \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\dagger A = \\mathbf{v}^\\dagger \\lambda^*\\), we get \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\dagger \\lambda^* \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}^\\dagger \\lambda \\mathbf{v}\\).\n\nAssuming \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\dagger \\mathbf{v}\\) is not zero (which it isn't for a non-zero vector), we can divide both sides by \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\dagger \\mathbf{v}\\), and we get \\(\\lambda^* = \\lambda\\). This implies that \\(\\lambda\\) is real.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always real. That should be the answer, which corresponds to option A.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is \"imaginary.\" Well, if the eigenvalues are real, they're not imaginary, so this can't be right.\n\nOption C is \"degenerate.\" Degeneracy refers to having multiple eigenvalues of the same value. That's not necessarily always the case for Hermitian operators; they can have distinct eigenvalues or degenerate ones, but it's not a guaranteed property.\n\nOption D is \"linear.\" I'm not sure what this refers to in this context. Linearity usually applies to functions or operators, not directly to eigenvalues. Eigenvalues can be real numbers, complex numbers, etc., but \"linear\" doesn't seem to fit.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. real.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ real}} \\]"
