                    "text": "So I've got this situation here with Denise Developer and her high-tech office building. She bought a commercial property in downtown Pleasantville, hired an architect to design a fancy office building, and then signed a lease with Microhard for over half of the space. This lease wasn't recorded, but she used it to attract other wealthy tenants and also disclosed it on her application for a $1.5 million construction loan from Maximum Mortgage Company. Denise signed a mortgage and a promissory note with Maximum, and they recorded the mortgage right away.\n\nThe building was completed and was fully occupied from the start. But one year later, Denise defaulted on her mortgage, and Maximum took possession of the property. Then, Maximum told all the tenants that their leases were canceled, they were evicted, and they had to leave unless they agreed to pay double the previous rent.\n\nNow, the tenants have hired me to make sure that Maximum honors their leases at the lower rents. I need to figure out which statement is the most accurate advice in this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the recording statute in this jurisdiction. It says that \"every conveyance, encumbrance, or lease not recorded is void as against any subsequent party recording first.\" So, basically, if a lease isn't recorded, it might not be valid against someone who later records a mortgage or another interest in the property.\n\nDenise had a lease with Microhard that wasn't recorded, but she disclosed it to Maximum when applying for the loan. Maximum knew about this lease before giving the loan and recording the mortgage.\n\nFor the other tenants, I don't know if their leases were recorded or not. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume that none of the leases were recorded, unless stated otherwise.\n\nOption A says that all the tenants will prevail (unless otherwise in default on their leases), because Maximum loaned money to Denise with actual knowledge that she intended to enter into binding leases with the tenants.\n\nOption B says that Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had constructive notice of their prior lease.\n\nOption C says that Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease.\n\nOption D suggests that all the tenants should renegotiate their leases with Maximum.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, regarding Microhard's lease:\n\n- Denise had a lease agreement with Microhard, which was not recorded, but she disclosed it to Maximum when applying for the loan.\n\n- Maximum had actual knowledge of this lease before giving the loan and recording the mortgage.\n\n- Now, according to the recording statute, unrecorded leases are void against subsequent parties who record first.\n\n- But in this case, Maximum had actual knowledge of Microhard's lease before recording the mortgage.\n\n- Generally, if a subsequent party has actual knowledge of a prior unrecorded interest, they cannot claim the benefit of the recording statute to avoid that interest.\n\n- So, even though the lease wasn't recorded, Maximum knew about it, so they should be bound by it.\n\n- Therefore, Microhard should be able to continue their lease at the lower rent because Maximum had actual notice of the lease.\n\nNow, for the other tenants:\n\n- Their leases were not mentioned as being recorded.\n\n- Since they were attracted based on the Microhard lease and possibly other factors, but without recording, their leases might be void against Maximum's recorded mortgage.\n\n- However, Maximum had actual knowledge that Denise was attracting other wealthy tenants, as stated in the problem.\n\n- But the problem doesn't specify whether Maximum had actual knowledge of each individual tenant's lease or just general knowledge that Denise was leasing to other tenants.\n\n- If Maximum had actual knowledge of specific leases with these tenants, then similar to Microhard, those leases might be enforceable despite not being recorded.\n\n- But if Maximum only had general knowledge that Denise was leasing to other tenants but didn't know the specifics of those leases, then they might not be bound by the unrecorded leases.\n\nGiven that, it seems that only Microhard has a strong case because Maximum had actual knowledge of their specific lease.\n\nFor the other tenants, unless Maximum had actual knowledge of their specific leases, they might be out of luck based on the recording statute.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Denise disclosed the Microhard lease on her loan application, which likely included information about the building's occupancy and lease agreements.\n\nMaybe Maximum had some knowledge about the building being fully occupied and the existence of other leases, but again, without specific knowledge of each lease's terms, they might not be bound by them.\n\nOption A suggests that all tenants will prevail because Maximum had actual knowledge that Denise intended to enter into binding leases.\n\nBut this seems a bit broad. If Maximum only knew that Denise intended to lease to other tenants but didn't know the specifics of those leases, does that mean they have to honor all leases?\n\nProbably not, because the recording statute is meant to protect subsequent parties who record their interests first, without knowledge of prior unrecorded interests.\n\nIf Maximum had actual knowledge of specific leases, they can't claim ignorance, but if they only knew that there were other leases in place without knowing the details, it might be different.\n\nOption B says that Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had constructive notice of their prior lease.\n\nBut in this case, Maximum had actual knowledge of Microhard's lease, not just constructive notice.\n\nConstructive notice usually comes from recording the document, which didn't happen here.\n\nSo, constructive notice isn't applicable because the lease wasn't recorded.\n\nOption C says that Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease.\n\nThis seems accurate, as discussed earlier.\n\nOption D suggests that all tenants should renegotiate their leases with Maximum.\n\nWell, that might be a practical solution, but from a legal standpoint, it's not necessarily the most accurate advice.\n\nSome tenants might have stronger claims than others, especially Microhard, who had their lease disclosed to Maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps advising all tenants to renegotiate is not the best course if some leases are actually enforceable as is.\n\nGiven all this, I think Option C is the most accurate statement.\n\nMicrohard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease.\n\nFor the other tenants, it's less clear, but based on the information provided, it seems that only Microhard has a strong case.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C."
