                    "text": "So I have this problem here: there's a sorted list of 120 integers, and I need to search for the value 100. The question is asking for the maximum number of elements that must be examined if the most efficient searching algorithm is used. The options are 7, 8, 20, or 100.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a sorted list, the most efficient search algorithm is binary search. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Each step, it looks at the middle element of the current interval. If that middle element is the target value, great, we're done. If not, depending on whether the middle element is larger or smaller than the target, we know which half of the interval to search next.\n\nSo, with binary search, the maximum number of comparisons needed is log base 2 of the number of elements, rounded up to the nearest integer. Because each comparison halves the search space.\n\nGiven that, for 120 elements, I need to calculate the ceiling of log2(120).\n\nLet me calculate log2(120). I know that 2^7 is 128, and 2^6 is 64. 120 is between 64 and 128, so log2(120) is between 6 and 7.\n\nActually, let me check the exact value. I think log2(128) is exactly 7, since 2^7 = 128. So log2(120) is slightly less than 7.\n\nBut since we're dealing with the number of operations, which is an integer, and we might need to round up, I need to be careful.\n\nWait, in binary search, to find any element in a list of size n, the maximum number of comparisons is floor(log2(n)) + 1.\n\nSo for n=120, log2(120) is approximately 6.906, since 2^6=64 and 2^7=128.\n\nFloor of that is 6, and adding 1 gives 7.\n\nSo, in theory, it should be 7 comparisons maximum to find any element in a sorted list of 120 elements using binary search.\n\nBut let me think about it more carefully.\n\nThe question is: what is the maximum number of elements that must be examined?\n\nIn binary search, each comparison eliminates half of the remaining elements.\n\nSo, starting with 120 elements:\n\n1. Middle index is 60. If the 60th element is 100, we're done. If not, depending on the comparison, we go to positions 1-59 or 61-120.\n\n2. Now, with 60 elements left, middle index is 30 (if lower half) or 90 (if upper half). Compare with 100.\n\n3. Continue this process: 30 elements, middle at 15 or 75, etc.\n\nEach step reduces the search space by half.\n\nSo, the number of steps is log2(n), rounded up.\n\nFor 120, log2(128) is 7, so 7 steps should suffice.\n\nBut wait, 2^7 is 128, which is more than 120, so yes, 7 steps should be enough.\n\nBut let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose I have a sorted list of 128 numbers, and I'm searching for the 128th element.\n\nStep 1: middle is 64. Compare with 128. If less, go to 65-128.\n\nStep 2: middle is 96. Compare with 128. If less, go to 97-128.\n\nStep 3: middle is 112. Compare with 128. If less, go to 113-128.\n\nStep 4: middle is 120. Compare with 128. If less, go to 121-128.\n\nStep 5: middle is 124. Compare with 128. If less, go to 125-128.\n\nStep 6: middle is 126. Compare with 128. If less, go to 127-128.\n\nStep 7: middle is 127. Compare with 128. If less, go to 128.\n\nStep 8: element 128.\n\nWait, that's 8 steps.\n\nHmm, so maybe it's 8 steps for 128 elements.\n\nBut in our case, we have 120 elements, which is less than 128.\n\nSo, perhaps it's 7 steps.\n\nLet me check with 120.\n\nSuppose I have 120 elements.\n\nStep 1: middle is 60.\n\nStep 2: if lower half, middle is 30.\n\nStep 3: middle is 15.\n\nStep 4: middle is 7.\n\nStep 5: middle is 3.\n\nStep 6: middle is 1.\n\nStep 7: compare with element 1.\n\nSo, 7 steps for 120 elements.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example with 128, it took 8 steps.\n\nSo, for 120, which is less than 128, it should take fewer steps.\n\nHence, 7 steps should suffice.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 7 is one of them.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if it's indeed 7.\n\nLet me consider that log2(128) is 7, and 120 is less than 128, so 7 steps should be enough.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the formula for binary search.\n\nThe maximum number of comparisons is ceil(log2(n) + 1).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with different formulas.\n\nThe standard formula for the maximum number of comparisons in binary search is ceil(log2(n) + 1).\n\nWait, no, I think it's floor(log2(n)) + 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for n=120, floor(log2(120)) + 1.\n\nLog2(128) is 7, log2(64) is 6.\n\n120 is between 64 and 128, so log2(120) is between 6 and 7.\n\nFloor of log2(120) is 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of comparisons is 7.\n\nBut let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, in binary search, the maximum number of steps is the smallest integer k such that 2^k >= n.\n\nIn this case, 2^7 = 128, which is greater than 120, so k=7.\n\nHence, 7 steps are sufficient.\n\nBut the question is phrased to ask for the maximum number of elements that must be examined.\n\nIn binary search, each comparison examines one element.\n\nSo, in the worst case, you examine up to 7 elements.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor.\n\nIs there any scenario where more than 7 elements would be examined?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the list isn't perfectly balanced in terms of divisions, but in binary search, it should still be logarithmic.\n\nWait, but the list has 120 elements, which is not a power of 2, so the divisions aren't perfectly halving in terms of integer division.\n\nBut even so, the number of steps should still be 7.\n\nLet me verify by calculating the number of steps.\n\nStarting with 120 elements:\n\nStep 1: 120 / 2 = 60. Examine element 60.\n\nStep 2: If less, examine elements 1-59; if greater, 61-120.\n\nAssuming less, 59 elements.\n\nStep 3: 59 / 2 \u2248 29. Examine element 29.\n\nStep 4: If less, examine 1-28; if greater, 30-59.\n\nAssuming less, 28 elements.\n\nStep 5: 28 / 2 = 14. Examine element 14.\n\nStep 6: If less, examine 1-13; if greater, 15-28.\n\nAssuming less, 13 elements.\n\nStep 7: 13 / 2 \u2248 6. Examine element 6.\n\nStep 8: If less, examine 1-5; if greater, 7-13.\n\nAssuming less, 5 elements.\n\nStep 9: 5 / 2 \u2248 2. Examine element 2.\n\nStep 10: If less, examine 1; if greater, 3-5.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, this seems to be taking more than 7 steps.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 7 steps.\n\nI must have miscalculated.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting with 120 elements:\n\nStep 1: Examine element 60.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to elements 1-59.\n\nStep 2: Examine element 30.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to 1-29.\n\nStep 3: Examine element 15.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to 1-14.\n\nStep 4: Examine element 7.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to 1-6.\n\nStep 5: Examine element 3.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to 1-2.\n\nStep 6: Examine element 1.\n\nIf 100 is greater, go to 2.\n\nStep 7: Examine element 2.\n\nIf 100 is greater, go to 3.\n\nStep 8: Examine element 3.\n\nThis seems to take 8 steps.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 7 steps.\n\nI'm getting conflicting results here.\n\nLet me check with a different approach.\n\nI know that for a list of size n, the maximum number of steps in binary search is ceil(log2(n)).\n\nFor n=120, log2(120) is approximately 6.906, so ceil(6.906) = 7.\n\nBut in my step-by-step example, it seems to take 8 steps.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me try with n=128, which is the next power of 2.\n\nFor n=128, log2(128)=7.\n\nStep 1: Examine element 64.\n\nStep 2: Examine element 96.\n\nStep 3: Examine element 112.\n\nStep 4: Examine element 120.\n\nStep 5: Examine element 124.\n\nStep 6: Examine element 126.\n\nStep 7: Examine element 127.\n\nStep 8: Examine element 128.\n\nSo, for n=128, it takes 8 steps to reach the last element.\n\nBut for n=120, which is less than 128, it should take fewer steps.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step for n=120, it seems to take 8 steps.\n\nBut according to the formula, it should be 7 steps.\n\nI must be doing something wrong in the step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting with 120 elements:\n\nStep 1: Examine element 60.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to elements 1-59.\n\nStep 2: Examine element 30.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to 1-29.\n\nStep 3: Examine element 15.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to 1-14.\n\nStep 4: Examine element 7.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to 1-6.\n\nStep 5: Examine element 3.\n\nIf 100 is less, go to 1-2.\n\nStep 6: Examine element 1.\n\nIf 100 is greater, go to 2.\n\nStep 7: Examine element 2.\n\nIf 100 is greater, go to 3.\n\nBut element 3 is already examined in step 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm double-counting.\n\nIn binary search, each comparison is unique, and you don't revisit elements.\n\nSo, in step 5, examining element 3, if 100 is greater, you go to elements 4-6, but in this case, since we're assuming 100 is less, we're going to elements 1-2.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nIn binary search, the number of steps is log2(n), rounded up.\n\nFor n=120, log2(120) is approximately 6.906, so rounded up to 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements examined should be 7.\n\nBut in my step-by-step approach, it seems to take 8 steps.\n\nPerhaps I'm miscounting the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 7, and my step-by-step approach has an error.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with 7 as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
