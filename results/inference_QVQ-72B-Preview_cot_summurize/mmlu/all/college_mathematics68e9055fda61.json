                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out which of these events is most likely to happen when I toss a fair coin 100 times. The options are:\n\nA. Getting exactly 50 heads.\n\nB. Getting 60 or more tails.\n\nC. Getting between 51 and 55 heads, inclusive.\n\nD. Getting at least 48 heads and at least 48 tails.\n\nHmm, okay, first things first, I know that when you toss a fair coin, each toss has a 1/2 chance of being heads and 1/2 of being tails. Since it's a fair coin, each toss is independent, so previous tosses don't affect future ones.\n\nSo, if I toss the coin 100 times, the total number of heads (H) and tails (T) will add up to 100, right? Because every toss is either heads or tails.\n\nI think this is a binomial distribution problem. In a binomial setting, the number of heads H follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=100 (number of trials) and p=0.5 (probability of success, where success is heads).\n\nSo, H ~ Binomial(100, 0.5)\n\nSimilarly, T, the number of tails, would be T = 100 - H, since every toss is either heads or tails.\n\nAlright, let's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: H = 50**\n\nThis is the probability of getting exactly 50 heads in 100 tosses.\n\nThe probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nSo, P(H = 50) = C(100, 50) * (0.5)^50 * (0.5)^(100-50) = C(100, 50) * (0.5)^100\n\nNow, C(100, 50) is a large number, but since it's multiplied by (0.5)^100, which is a very small number, this probability should be relatively small. But how small?\n\n**Option B: T >= 60**\n\nThis means T is 60 or more, which is the same as T >= 60.\n\nBut T = 100 - H, so T >= 60 is the same as 100 - H >= 60, which simplifies to H <= 40.\n\nSo, P(T >= 60) = P(H <= 40)\n\nThis is the cumulative probability from H = 0 to H = 40.\n\nSo, P(H <= 40) = sum from k=0 to 40 of C(100, k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(100-k)\n\nThis is the sum of probabilities for H from 0 to 40.\n\n**Option C: 51 <= H <= 55**\n\nThis is the probability that the number of heads is between 51 and 55, inclusive.\n\nSo, P(51 <= H <= 55) = sum from k=51 to 55 of C(100, k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(100-k)\n\nThis is the sum of probabilities for H = 51, 52, 53, 54, 55.\n\n**Option D: H >= 48 and T >= 48**\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. It says that both H is at least 48 and T is at least 48.\n\nSince T = 100 - H, the condition T >= 48 translates to 100 - H >= 48, which means H <= 52.\n\nSo, the condition H >= 48 and T >= 48 is equivalent to H >= 48 and H <= 52, which simplifies to H = 48, 49, 50, 51, or 52.\n\nTherefore, P(H >= 48 and T >= 48) = P(48 <= H <= 52) = sum from k=48 to 52 of C(100, k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(100-k)\n\nSo, this is the sum of probabilities for H = 48, 49, 50, 51, 52.\n\nAlright, now I need to compare these probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's think about the binomial distribution. When n is large and p = 0.5, the distribution is approximately normal with mean \u03bc = n*p = 100*0.5 = 50 and variance \u03c3\u00b2 = n*p*(1-p) = 100*0.5*0.5 = 25, so standard deviation \u03c3 = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nSo, H is approximately normally distributed with mean 50 and standard deviation 5.\n\nUsing this approximation, I can estimate the probabilities.\n\n**Option A: P(H = 50)**\n\nIn a binomial distribution, P(H = 50) is the probability at the peak of the distribution. Since the distribution is approximately normal with mean 50 and standard deviation 5, this is like evaluating the normal distribution at its mean.\n\n**Option B: P(H <= 40)**\n\nThis is the cumulative probability from H = 0 to 40. Since the mean is 50, this is like finding the area to the left of 40 in a normal distribution with mean 50 and SD 5.\n\nStandardizing, Z = (40 - 50)/5 = -2.\n\nSo, P(H <= 40) \u2248 P(Z <= -2) \u2248 0.0228\n\n**Option C: P(51 <= H <= 55)**\n\nThis is the probability between H = 51 and H = 55.\n\nStandardizing H = 51: Z = (51 - 50)/5 = 0.2\n\nH = 55: Z = (55 - 50)/5 = 1.0\n\nSo, P(51 <= H <= 55) \u2248 P(0.2 <= Z <= 1.0)\n\nLooking at standard normal tables, P(Z <= 1.0) \u2248 0.8413\n\nP(Z <= 0.2) \u2248 0.5793\n\nSo, P(0.2 <= Z <= 1.0) \u2248 0.8413 - 0.5793 = 0.2620\n\n**Option D: P(48 <= H <= 52)**\n\nThis is the probability between H = 48 and H = 52.\n\nStandardizing H = 48: Z = (48 - 50)/5 = -0.4\n\nH = 52: Z = (52 - 50)/5 = 0.4\n\nSo, P(48 <= H <= 52) \u2248 P(-0.4 <= Z <= 0.4)\n\nP(Z <= 0.4) \u2248 0.6554\n\nP(Z <= -0.4) \u2248 0.3446\n\nSo, P(-0.4 <= Z <= 0.4) \u2248 0.6554 - 0.3446 = 0.3108\n\nNow, comparing these approximate probabilities:\n\n- Option A: P(H = 50): this is a single point probability, which is relatively small.\n\n- Option B: P(H <= 40): approximately 0.0228\n\n- Option C: P(51 <= H <= 55): approximately 0.2620\n\n- Option D: P(48 <= H <= 52): approximately 0.3108\n\nFrom these, Option D has the highest probability among the given options.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's a more precise way to calculate these probabilities or if there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem asks for the event with the greatest probability, and given that the binomial distribution is symmetric when p = 0.5, perhaps there's a smarter way to look at this.\n\nLet me consider the exact binomial probabilities for each option.\n\n**Option A: P(H = 50)**\n\nP(H = 50) = C(100, 50) * (0.5)^100\n\n**Option B: P(H <= 40)**\n\nThis is the cumulative probability from H = 0 to 40.\n\nSimilarly for Options C and D.\n\nCalculating these exact probabilities would be computationally intensive without software, but since this is a thought exercise, perhaps I can make some observations.\n\nFirst, since the distribution is symmetric, P(H <= 40) = P(H >= 60), because being 10 heads below the mean is the same as being 10 heads above the mean.\n\nBut in Option B, it's P(T >= 60), which is P(100 - H >= 60) = P(H <= 40), so yes, it's the same as P(H <= 40).\n\nOption C: P(51 <= H <= 55) is the probability of being within 1 to 5 heads above the mean.\n\nOption D: P(48 <= H <= 52) is the probability of being within 2 heads of the mean.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the bell shape of the normal distribution, the probability is highest around the mean and decreases as you move away.\n\nTherefore, Option D, which includes the mean and a range close to it, should have a higher probability compared to the other options.\n\nBut wait, Option D is P(48 <= H <= 52), which is 5 values around the mean, while Option C is P(51 <= H <= 55), which is also 5 values, but farther from the mean.\n\nWait, no: 48 to 52 is within 2 heads of the mean, while 51 to 55 is within 1 to 5 heads above the mean.\n\nActually, 48 to 52 includes the mean and is a narrower range in terms of standard deviations.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nThe mean is 50, standard deviation is 5.\n\nSo, H = 48 is (48 - 50)/5 = -0.4 SD\n\nH = 52 is (52 - 50)/5 = 0.4 SD\n\nSimilarly, H = 51 is (51 - 50)/5 = 0.2 SD\n\nH = 55 is (55 - 50)/5 = 1.0 SD\n\nSo, Option D covers from -0.4 SD to +0.4 SD, while Option C covers from +0.2 SD to +1.0 SD.\n\nGiven that the normal curve is highest at the mean and decreases as you move away, the area from -0.4 to +0.4 SD should be larger than from +0.2 to +1.0 SD.\n\nSimilarly, Option B covers from -2 SD to the mean, which is a much smaller area.\n\nOption A is just a single point, which in a continuous distribution would have probability zero, but in a discrete distribution, it's still very small.\n\nTherefore, Option D seems to cover the region with the highest density of probability.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's a better way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the properties of binomial coefficients.\n\nRecall that C(n, k) = C(n, n-k), which reflects the symmetry.\n\nAlso, C(n, k) is maximized when k is closest to n/2, which in this case is k=50.\n\nMoreover, the ratio of consecutive binomial coefficients can be used to compare probabilities.\n\nFor example, P(H = k+1)/P(H = k) = (n - k)/ (k + 1)\n\nBut in this case, since p = 0.5, the ratio simplifies.\n\nWait, in our case, p = 0.5, so P(H = k+1)/P(H = k) = (n - k)/(k + 1)\n\nWait, actually, for a binomial distribution, P(X = k+1)/P(X = k) = (n - k)/ (k + 1) * (p/(1-p))\n\nSince p = 0.5, this ratio is (n - k)/(k + 1)\n\nSo, P(H = k+1)/P(H = k) = (100 - k)/(k + 1)\n\nThis tells us how the probabilities decrease as k increases beyond the mean.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated for our purposes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the fact that the binomial distribution is approximately normal and use the continuity correction.\n\nFor example, to find P(H <= 40), I can use the normal approximation with continuity correction: P(H < 40.5)\n\nSimilarly for other ranges.\n\nBut since I already used the normal approximation earlier and got some estimates, perhaps I can proceed with those.\n\nGiven that, and considering that Option D covers the central part of the distribution, it seems plausible that it has the highest probability among the given options.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if there's a way to calculate these probabilities more accurately.\n\nFor Option A: P(H = 50)\n\nThis is a single point probability, which in a binomial distribution with n=100 and p=0.5, is C(100,50)*(0.5)^100.\n\nThis is a very small number, much smaller than the cumulative probabilities in the other options.\n\nFor Option B: P(H <= 40)\n\nThis is the sum of probabilities from H=0 to H=40.\n\nGiven that the mean is 50, this is like finding the area to the left of 40 in a normal distribution with mean 50 and SD 5, which is Z = (40 - 50)/5 = -2, so P(Z <= -2) \u2248 0.0228.\n\nFor Option C: P(51 <= H <= 55)\n\nThis is the sum from H=51 to H=55.\n\nUsing the normal approximation, this is P(50.5 < H <= 55.5) in continuity correction.\n\nStandardizing, Z1 = (50.5 - 50)/5 = 0.05 and Z2 = (55.5 - 50)/5 = 1.1\n\nSo, P(0.05 < Z <= 1.1) \u2248 P(Z <= 1.1) - P(Z <= 0.05) \u2248 0.8643 - 0.5199 = 0.3444\n\nWait, this is different from my earlier estimate of 0.2620.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nP(51 <= H <= 55) without continuity correction is P(51 <= H <= 55)\n\nWith continuity correction, it's P(50.5 < H <= 55.5)\n\nStandardizing:\n\nZ1 = (50.5 - 50)/5 = 0.05\n\nZ2 = (55.5 - 50)/5 = 1.1\n\nSo, P(0.05 < Z <= 1.1) = P(Z <= 1.1) - P(Z <= 0.05) \u2248 0.8643 - 0.5199 = 0.3444\n\nWait, but earlier I thought P(51 <= H <= 55) was approximately 0.2620, but with continuity correction, it's higher.\n\nMaybe I need to be more careful with the continuity correction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a binomial distribution, the probability of a range can be approximated by the normal distribution without continuity correction for rough estimates.\n\nIn any case, it's clear that Option C has a higher probability than Option B.\n\nNow, for Option D: P(48 <= H <= 52)\n\nWithout continuity correction: P(48 <= H <= 52)\n\nWith continuity correction: P(47.5 < H <= 52.5)\n\nStandardizing:\n\nZ1 = (47.5 - 50)/5 = -0.5\n\nZ2 = (52.5 - 50)/5 = 0.5\n\nSo, P(-0.5 < Z <= 0.5) \u2248 P(Z <= 0.5) - P(Z <= -0.5) \u2248 0.6915 - 0.3085 = 0.3830\n\nAgain, this is higher than the previous estimates.\n\nComparing the approximate probabilities:\n\n- Option A: very small (single point)\n\n- Option B: \u2248 0.0228\n\n- Option C: \u2248 0.3444\n\n- Option D: \u2248 0.3830\n\nSo, Option D has the highest probability among these.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to confirm this more accurately?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution.\n\nIn this case, H is the sum of 100 independent Bernoulli trials, each with p=0.5, so the normal approximation should be quite good.\n\nTherefore, using the normal approximation with continuity correction, it seems that Option D has the highest probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the exact binomial probabilities for Option D.\n\nP(48 <= H <= 52) = P(H=48) + P(H=49) + P(H=50) + P(H=51) + P(H=52)\n\nEach P(H=k) = C(100, k)*(0.5)^100\n\nSo, this sum is 5 * C(100,50)*(0.5)^100, but actually, it's not exactly 5 times because C(100,48) \u2260 C(10"
