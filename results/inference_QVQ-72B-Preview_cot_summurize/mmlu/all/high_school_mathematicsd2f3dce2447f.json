                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says to find the equation of the line tangent to the curve defined by F(t) = (t^2 + 1, 2^t) at the point where y = 4. And there are four options given for the answer. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what F(t) represents. It's a parametric function, right? So, x is given by t^2 + 1 and y is given by 2^t. And I need to find the tangent line at the point where y = 4.\n\nOkay, so step one is to find the value of t that corresponds to y = 4. So, set 2^t equal to 4 and solve for t.\n\n2^t = 4\n\nI know that 2^2 = 4, so t = 2.\n\nNow, I need to find the coordinates of the point on the curve where t = 2. So, plug t = 2 into both x and y.\n\nx = (2)^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\ny = 2^(2) = 4\n\nSo, the point is (5, 4).\n\nNext, I need the slope of the tangent line at this point. Since it's a parametric curve, I can find dy/dx by using the chain rule: dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt), provided dx/dt \u2260 0.\n\nSo, let's find dy/dt and dx/dt.\n\ndy/dt = d(2^t)/dt = 2^t * ln(2)\n\ndx/dt = d(t^2 + 1)/dt = 2t\n\nTherefore, dy/dx = (2^t * ln(2)) / (2t)\n\nNow, plug in t = 2 to find the slope at the point (5,4).\n\ndy/dx = (2^2 * ln(2)) / (2*2) = (4 * ln(2)) / 4 = ln(2)\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at (5,4) is ln(2).\n\nNow, I have a point (5,4) and the slope ln(2), so I can write the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form.\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\ny - 4 = ln(2)(x - 5)\n\nLooking back at the options, this matches with option D.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check because all the options have y - 4 on the left side, but different expressions on the right.\n\nOption A: y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 2)\n\nOption B: y \u2013 4 = 4 ln 2(x \u2013 2)\n\nOption C: y \u2013 4 = 4(x \u2013 5)\n\nOption D: y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 5)\n\nMy calculation gives me y - 4 = ln(2)(x - 5), which is exactly option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's verify if there's any possibility of misinterpretation.\n\nIs there any chance that y = 4 corresponds to another value of t? Well, we have y = 2^t = 4, which is t = 2, as I found earlier. So, no other real solutions for t.\n\nAlso, confirming the derivatives:\n\ndy/dt = 2^t * ln(2), which is correct for exponential functions.\n\ndx/dt = 2t, correct for the x component.\n\nThus, dy/dx = (2^t * ln(2)) / (2t)\n\nAt t = 2, it's (4 * ln(2)) / 4 = ln(2), which matches.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 5)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
