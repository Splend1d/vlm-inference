                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, in December, a toy store sold 934 puzzles. Each puzzle costs $6, and that includes tax. We need to find out the total cost of all the puzzles sold, including tax. The options are A. $5,434, B. $5,484, C. $5,604, and D. $5,684.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It wants the total cost of all the puzzles sold, including tax. Each puzzle costs $6, and that already includes tax, so I don't need to add any additional tax per puzzle. That makes sense.\n\nSo, basically, I need to find the total sales from these puzzles. To do that, I should multiply the number of puzzles sold by the cost per puzzle. That is, multiply 934 by $6.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal cost = number of puzzles \u00d7 cost per puzzle\n\nTotal cost = 934 \u00d7 $6\n\nOkay, now I need to calculate 934 multiplied by 6. I can do this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down 934 into its place values:\n\n900 (hundreds place)\n\n30 (tens place)\n\n4 (ones place)\n\nThen, I'll multiply each part by 6 and add them up.\n\nSo, 900 \u00d7 6 = 5,400\n\n30 \u00d7 6 = 180\n\n4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nNow, add these up: 5,400 + 180 + 24.\n\nLet's add 5,400 and 180 first: 5,400 + 180 = 5,580\n\nThen, add 24 to that: 5,580 + 24 = 5,604\n\nSo, the total cost is $5,604.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $5,434\n\nB. $5,484\n\nC. $5,604\n\nD. $5,684\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. $5,604.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps by considering the units. The cost per puzzle is $6, and there are 934 puzzles. Multiplying them should give the total revenue, which is indeed what we did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach, like using addition instead of multiplication, but that seems unnecessary here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved. The problem says \"including tax,\" so I don't think I need to add any extra for tax since the cost per puzzle already includes it.\n\nAnother thing I can do is to estimate. Let's say 934 is roughly 930, and 930 \u00d7 $6 would be 900 \u00d7 $6 = $5,400 plus 30 \u00d7 $6 = $180, so total $5,580. But earlier, I calculated 934 \u00d7 $6 as $5,604. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, 934 is 900 + 30 + 4, and 900 \u00d7 6 = 5,400, 30 \u00d7 6 = 180, and 4 \u00d7 6 = 24. Adding them up gives 5,400 + 180 = 5,580 + 24 = 5,604. So, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in the estimation step. If I take 934 as 930, then 930 \u00d7 6 = 5,580, and the difference between 934 and 930 is 4, so I need to add 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 to 5,580 to get the exact total. So, 5,580 + 24 = 5,604. That confirms my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard multiplication algorithm to multiply 934 by 6.\n\nLet's write it out:\n\n```\n\n  934\n\n\u00d7    6\n\n------\n\n  5,604\n\n```\n\nYes, that's the same result I got earlier.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. $5,604.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check the other options quickly. Option A is $5,434, which is less than my calculation, and option D is $5,684, which is more than my calculation. Option B is $5,484, which is also less than my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $5,604.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ \\$5,604} \\]"
