                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about how mutations in DNA can lead to the expression of a new phenotype. The options are:\n\nA. A different polypeptide is produced.\n\nB. The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA.\n\nC. Nucleic acids are methylated.\n\nD. The gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that DNA carries genetic information, and this information is used to make proteins through the process of transcription and translation. So, if there's a mutation in DNA, it could potentially change the protein that's made, right? And proteins are crucial for the structure and function of cells, so changing them could lead to a new phenotype.\n\nOption A says that a different polypeptide is produced. A polypeptide is essentially a protein or a protein component. So, if a mutation leads to a different polypeptide being produced, that could certainly result in a new phenotype because the protein's function might be altered.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B mentions the polarity of tRNA becoming the opposite of that of DNA. I know that tRNA (transfer RNA) is involved in translation, carrying amino acids to the ribosome and matching them to the mRNA sequence via base pairing. The polarity of tRNA is important for its function, but I'm not sure how a mutation in DNA would directly change the polarity of tRNA. Maybe if there's a mutation in the gene encoding tRNA, it could affect its structure, including polarity, but that seems indirect. And even then, it's not immediately clear how that would result in a new phenotype, unless it affects the production of a specific protein.\n\nOption C says that nucleic acids are methylated. Methylation is a type of epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. So, if nucleic acids are methylated, it could turn genes on or off, but it doesn't directly result in the expression of a new phenotype in the same way that a mutation changing the protein sequence would. It's more about regulating which genes are expressed, not changing the actual protein product.\n\nOption D mentions that the gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. Normally, DNA is read from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction during transcription. If the direction were reversed to 3\u2032 to 5\u2032, that would significantly alter the sequence of the mRNA produced, which would in turn change the protein sequence. However, I don't recall any natural mechanisms where DNA is read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. This seems unlikely to occur due to a mutation, as the cellular machinery is designed to read DNA in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction.\n\nSo, considering all this, option A seems the most straightforward and direct way that a mutation in DNA could result in the expression of a new phenotype. If a mutation changes a base in the DNA sequence, it could lead to a different amino acid being incorporated into the polypeptide chain, which could alter the protein's function and thus the phenotype.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about some examples. Take a point mutation, like a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which changes one base to another. This can result in a single amino acid change in the protein, which might affect the protein's structure or function. For example, sickle cell anemia is caused by a single base change in the beta-globin gene, leading to a different amino acid in the hemoglobin protein, which causes red blood cells to sickle under certain conditions.\n\nNow, considering option B again, if the polarity of tRNA were altered, it might affect how tRNA interacts with mRNA during translation, potentially leading to incorrect amino acid incorporation. However, this would be a general effect on translation, not specific to one gene or phenotype. Moreover, tRNAs are molecules that carry amino acids to the ribosome, and their polarity is crucial for their function. A mutation in DNA that affects tRNA structure could potentially cause widespread disruptions in protein synthesis, but again, it's not as direct a path to a new phenotype as a mutation that specifically changes one protein.\n\nOption C, methylation of nucleic acids, is an epigenetic modification that can influence gene expression. For example, methylation of promoter regions can silence gene expression. So, if a mutation leads to altered methylation patterns, it could affect whether certain genes are expressed or not. This could indirectly lead to changes in phenotype, but it's not as direct as a mutation that changes the protein sequence itself.\n\nLastly, option D suggests that the gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. If this were to happen, it would completely change the sequence of the mRNA transcribed from the gene, likely resulting in a non-functional or completely different protein. However, as I mentioned earlier, the cellular machinery is not set up to read DNA in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. Transcription factors and RNA polymerases bind to specific sequences and initiate transcription in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. It's hard to imagine a mutation that would cause the direction of transcription to reverse.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I believe that option A, \"a different polypeptide is produced,\" is the best explanation for how mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
