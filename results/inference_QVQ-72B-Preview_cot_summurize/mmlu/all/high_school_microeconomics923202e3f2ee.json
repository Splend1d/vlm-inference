                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about a measure of a firm's monopoly pricing or market power. It says that the larger the value of this index, the greater the firm's market pricing power. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that correctly represents this measure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what market power or monopoly pricing means. Market power refers to the ability of a firm to influence the price of its product above competitive levels. In perfect competition, price equals marginal cost (P=MC), but with market power, a firm can set prices above marginal cost (P>MC).\n\nSo, the measure should capture the extent to which a firm can set its price above its marginal cost. The options are:\n\nA. (MC - P)/MC\n\nB. (MC - P)/P\n\nC. (P - MC)/P\n\nD. (P - MC)/MC\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nOption A is (MC - P)/MC. If P > MC, this would be negative, which doesn't make sense for a measure of market power since having market power should correspond to P > MC, not P < MC.\n\nOption B is (MC - P)/P. Again, if P > MC, this is negative, which seems counterintuitive for a measure of market power.\n\nOption C is (P - MC)/P. This seems promising because if P > MC, this is positive, and as P increases relative to MC, this ratio increases, indicating greater market power.\n\nOption D is (P - MC)/MC. This also seems relevant because P - MC is the markup over marginal cost, which could be a measure of market power.\n\nBut between options C and D, which one is more commonly used?\n\nI recall that in economics, the Lerner Index is a measure of market power, and it's defined as (P - MC)/P. So that would be option C.\n\nLet me double-check. The Lerner Index is indeed (P - MC)/P, which measures the markup as a proportion of the price. So, higher values of this index indicate greater market power.\n\nOption D, (P - MC)/MC, is related to the markup rate, which is also used in some contexts, but it's not the standard measure of market power like the Lerner Index is.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option C: (P - MC)/P.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose P = $100 and MC = $60.\n\nOption C: (100 - 60)/100 = 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.\n\nOption D: (100 - 60)/60 = 40/60 \u2248 0.6667 or 66.67%.\n\nIf market power increases, say P rises to $120 with MC still at $60,\n\nOption C: (120 - 60)/120 = 60/120 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nOption D: (120 - 60)/60 = 60/60 = 1.0 or 100%.\n\nBoth increase, but the Lerner Index is consistently defined as (P - MC)/P.\n\nMoreover, the Lerner Index ranges from 0 (perfect competition) to 1 (monopoly), which makes sense as a measure of market power.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: (P - MC)/P.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
