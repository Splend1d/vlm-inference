                    "text": "So I've got this expression to simplify: (5x + 3) - 2(2x - 4). Hmm, let's see how to approach this. I remember that when you have parentheses and there's a minus sign in front, you need to distribute that minus sign to the terms inside the parentheses that are being subtracted. So, first, I need to distribute the -2 to the terms inside the second set of parentheses.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(5x + 3) - 2(2x - 4)\n\nFirst, distribute -2 to 2x and -4.\n\n-2 times 2x is -4x, and -2 times -4 is +8. So, the expression becomes:\n\n5x + 3 - 4x + 8\n\nNow, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. So, 5x and -4x are like terms, and 3 and 8 are also like terms.\n\nLet's combine 5x and -4x:\n\n5x - 4x = 1x, or just x.\n\nNow, combine 3 and 8:\n\n3 + 8 = 11.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the simplified expression should be:\n\nx + 11.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 + x\n\nB. x + 11\n\nC. 5x + 3\n\nD. 7 + 2x\n\nSo, option B seems to match my answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I should try distributing the negative sign differently or check if there are any algebraic properties I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about adding the opposite of 2(2x - 4), which is the same as subtracting. So, (5x + 3) + (-2)(2x - 4). That should give the same result.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n(5x + 3) + (-2)(2x - 4)\n\nFirst, distribute -2 to 2x - 4:\n\n-2 * 2x = -4x\n\n-2 * -4 = +8\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n5x + 3 - 4x + 8\n\nAgain, combining like terms:\n\n5x - 4x = x\n\n3 + 8 = 11\n\nSo, x + 11.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. Maybe I should try plugging in a value for x to check if this makes sense.\n\nLet's choose x = 2.\n\nPlug x = 2 into the original expression:\n\n(5(2) + 3) - 2(2(2) - 4) = (10 + 3) - 2(4 - 4) = 13 - 2(0) = 13 - 0 = 13\n\nNow, plug x = 2 into the simplified expression:\n\nx + 11 = 2 + 11 = 13\n\nThey both give the same result, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let's check with another value, just to be sure.\n\nLet's try x = 0.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(5(0) + 3) - 2(2(0) - 4) = 3 - 2(-4) = 3 - (-8) = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nSimplified expression:\n\n0 + 11 = 11\n\nAgain, they match.\n\nOne more check, let's say x = -1.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(5(-1) + 3) - 2(2(-1) - 4) = (-5 + 3) - 2(-2 - 4) = -2 - 2(-6) = -2 - (-12) = -2 + 12 = 10\n\nSimplified expression:\n\n-1 + 11 = 10\n\nPerfect, it matches again.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the simplified form of the expression is x + 11.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. x + 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{x + 11} \\]"
