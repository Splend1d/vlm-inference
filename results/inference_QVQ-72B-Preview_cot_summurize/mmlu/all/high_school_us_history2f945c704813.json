Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The \"Know-Nothings,\" lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day\u2026.But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers\u2026..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst\u2014a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War\u2014Poland and Italy.\"\nRobert H.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about why there was a big increase in immigrants to the United States between 1880 and 1910. The options are:\n\nA. Many Southern and Eastern Europeans came to America for money and political freedom.\n\nB. Irish farmers had to leave because of problems with farming.\n\nC. Germans were trying to skip military service.\n\nD. The U.S. was really nice to immigrants, giving them places to live and jobs.\n\nOkay, let's think about this. I know that during that time, there was a lot of immigration from Europe to the U.S., but I need to figure out the main reasons for this surge.\n\nFirst, option A says that Southern and Eastern Europeans were coming for financial gain and political freedom. I recall that many people from these regions were facing economic hardships and sometimes political unrest. So, it makes sense that they would look to America as a place where they could find better opportunities and maybe escape tricky political situations.\n\nBut wait, option B mentions Irish farmers leaving due to agricultural disasters. I remember learning about the Irish Potato Famine in the mid-19th century, which was before 1880. That caused a lot of Irish people to immigrate to the U.S., but I think that was more in the 1840s and 1850s. So, maybe by 1880, that wasn't the main driver anymore.\n\nOption C is about Germans avoiding military conscription. I know that Germany had a strong military tradition, and conscription was common. Maybe some people didn't want to serve in the army and decided to leave the country. But was this a significant factor during the 1880-1910 period? I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLastly, option D says that the U.S. was providing housing and employment to immigrants. That sounds too good to be true. I know that there was a demand for labor in the U.S., especially with all the industrial growth happening at that time, but I don't think the government was offering housing and jobs to every immigrant. Maybe some programs existed, but not on a large scale.\n\nSo, considering all this, option A seems the most plausible. It covers both economic and political motivations, and it's specific to Southern and Eastern Europeans, who were indeed coming to the U.S. in large numbers during that period.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about some specific examples. For instance, Italians from Southern Europe were immigrating in large numbers around that time, often fleeing poverty and sometimes escaping from the mafia's influence. That fits with the financial and political freedom aspects of option A.\n\nSimilarly, Eastern European Jews were coming to the U.S. to escape persecution and antisemitism in places like Russia and Poland. Again, that aligns with seeking political and religious freedom, which is part of option A.\n\nAs for Southern and Eastern Europeans in general, many were farmers facing hard times due to overpopulation and limited land, pushing them to look for better lives abroad.\n\nOption B, focusing on Irish farmers, might have been more relevant in the earlier part of the 19th century, during the Potato Famine, but by 1880, other groups were becoming more prominent among immigrants.\n\nOption C, about Germans avoiding military service, might have been a factor for some, but I think economic opportunities were a bigger draw for German immigrants. Plus, Germany was a pretty industrialized country by then, so maybe not as many were seeking work abroad as before.\n\nOption D seems too rosy. While the U.S. economy was growing and needed workers, I don't think the government was offering housing and jobs to immigrants. It was more of a situation where private companies might recruit workers from abroad, but that was more localized and not a general policy.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think option A is the best answer. It captures the main reasons why so many Southern and Eastern Europeans immigrated to the U.S. between 1880 and 1910: they were seeking better economic opportunities and freedom from political oppression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
