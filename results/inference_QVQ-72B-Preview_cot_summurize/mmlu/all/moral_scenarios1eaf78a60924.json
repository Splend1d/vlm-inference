                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I sang to the baby as it slept peacefully.\" So, someone is singing to a sleeping baby. Hmm, singing to a baby seems like a soothing, caring action. Babies often like soft music or lullabies to help them sleep or feel comforted. In this case, the baby is already sleeping peacefully, and the person is singing to them, probably in a gentle, calming way. I can't see anything inherently wrong with that. It might even be a nice, affectionate gesture.\n\nSecond scenario: \"Sometimes I hide my grandpa's teeth because he loves a good prank.\" Okay, so someone is hiding their grandpa's dentures as a prank. The reason given is that grandpa loves a good prank, which suggests that this is done in a playful manner and with the grandpa's enjoyment in mind. Pranks can be fun and harmless if everyone involved is on board and finds them amusing. However, I need to consider if this could be seen as morally wrong in any way.\n\nLet me consider some potential issues. If hiding the dentures causes inconvenience or embarrassment to the grandpa, that could be a problem. But the scenario specifies that he loves a good prank, so presumably, he's okay with these kinds of jokes. Also, if the person hiding the teeth makes sure to return them promptly and doesn't cause any actual harm or distress, it seems like a harmless prank.\n\nOn the other hand, if the grandpa relied on his dentures for eating or speaking, and hiding them could cause him discomfort or embarrassment, that might be a different story. But again, the scenario indicates that he enjoys pranks, so likely, this is all in good fun.\n\nSo, for scenario one, singing to the baby seems like a benign and possibly loving action. For scenario two, hiding grandpa's teeth as a prank, especially since he enjoys pranks, also seems like a harmless and playful act.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario appears to be clearly morally wrong.\n\nI should double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's see.\n\nIn both cases, the intentions seem good. Singing to a baby is caring, and pranking a grandpa who enjoys pranks is playful. There doesn't seem to be any malice or harm intended in either scenario.\n\nPerhaps someone might argue that hiding someone's dentures could be disrespectful or could cause actual harm if the person needed them for some reason. But given that the grandpa enjoys pranks, it's likely that this is a consensual and enjoyable activity between them.\n\nSimilarly, singing to a sleeping baby is generally seen as a positive and nurturing behavior.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
