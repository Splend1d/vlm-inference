                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about electron diffraction in a crystal. It says that under certain conditions, a beam of electrons hitting a crystal surface will diffract and produce a scattering pattern. I need to find the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons required to see this pattern, and the lattice spacing of the crystal is given as 0.4 nm. The options are 0.1 eV, 1 eV, 10 eV, and 100 eV.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Electron diffraction occurs because electrons have both particle and wave properties. The wavelength associated with a moving electron is called the de Broglie wavelength, and it's given by the formula:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength, \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, and \\(p\\) is the momentum of the electron.\n\nSince the electrons are moving relativistically (well, actually, for electrons at low energies, they're non-relativistic), I should use the non-relativistic expression for momentum in terms of kinetic energy. The kinetic energy \\(E_k\\) is related to the momentum by:\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the electron.\n\nCombining these two equations, I can express the wavelength in terms of the kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mE_k}}\\]\n\nNow, for diffraction to occur and for me to see a pattern, the wavelength of the electrons should be comparable to the lattice spacing of the crystal. That makes sense because diffraction phenomena are most pronounced when the wavelength matches the size of the structures in the material.\n\nGiven that the lattice spacing is 0.4 nm, I need to set \\(\\lambda \\approx 0.4\\) nm and solve for \\(E_k\\).\n\nFirst, let's convert everything to SI units for consistency. 1 nm = \\(10^{-9}\\) m, so 0.4 nm = \\(0.4 \\times 10^{-9}\\) m = \\(4 \\times 10^{-10}\\) m.\n\nNow, plug in the values into the equation:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mE_k}}\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\(E_k\\):\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{h^2}{2m\\lambda^2}\\]\n\nI know that Planck's constant \\(h\\) is approximately \\(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\) Js, the mass of an electron \\(m\\) is about \\(9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg, and \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(4 \\times 10^{-10}\\) m.\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times (4 \\times 10^{-10})^2}\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(h^2\\):\n\n\\[(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.377 \\times 10^{-67} \\, \\text{J}^2\\,\\text{s}^2\\]\n\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times (4 \\times 10^{-10})^2 = 2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 16 \\times 10^{-20} = 2 \\times 9.109 \\times 16 \\times 10^{-51}\\]\\[= (2 \\times 16) \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-51} = 32 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-51}\\]\\[= 291.5 \\times 10^{-51} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2\\]\\[= 2.915 \\times 10^{-49} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2\\]\n\nNow, divide:\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{4.377 \\times 10^{-67}}{2.915 \\times 10^{-49}} \\, \\text{J}\\]\\[= 1.50 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}\\]\n\nTo convert this to electronvolts (eV), I recall that 1 eV = \\(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\) J.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\, \\text{eV}\\]\\[= 9.36 \\, \\text{eV}\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, 9.36 eV is closest to 10 eV.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if relativistic effects are significant at this energy level. For electrons with kinetic energies up to around 10 keV, non-relativistic mechanics should be sufficient, and at 10 eV, it's definitely non-relativistic.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I can calculate the velocity of the electron at 10 eV and see what fraction of the speed of light that is.\n\nFirst, find the momentum from the wavelength equation.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{4 \\times 10^{-10}} \\, \\text{kg m/s}\\]\\[= 1.6565 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{kg m/s}\\]\n\nThen, velocity \\(v = \\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{1.6565 \\times 10^{-24}}{9.109 \\times 10^{-31}} \\, \\text{m/s}\\]\\[= 1.818 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m/s}\\]\n\nThe speed of light is approximately \\(3 \\times 10^8\\) m/s, so:\n\n\\[\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{1.818 \\times 10^6}{3 \\times 10^8} = 0.00606\\]\\[= 0.606\\% \\, \\text{of the speed of light}\\]\n\nThis is indeed a very small fraction of the speed of light, so non-relativistic mechanics are entirely appropriate here.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy required is approximately 10 eV, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"seeing the pattern.\" I wonder if there's any consideration about the visibility of the diffraction pattern that might influence the required energy.\n\nAlso, in crystal diffraction experiments like Bragg diffraction, there's a condition for constructive interference:\n\n\\[2d \\sin \\theta = n\\lambda\\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the lattice spacing, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of incidence, and \\(n\\) is an integer.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's a relationship between the wavelength and the lattice spacing that needs to be satisfied for a diffraction pattern to be observable.\n\nBut I think the key point here is that for diffraction to occur, the wavelength should be comparable to the lattice spacing, which is 0.4 nm, and my calculation shows that a kinetic energy of around 10 eV gives a wavelength of about 0.4 nm.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula that directly relates the kinetic energy of the electron to its de Broglie wavelength without going through the momentum step, but I think the approach I took is valid.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nFirst, \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mE_k}}\\), and set \\(\\lambda = 0.4 \\times 10^{-9}\\) m.\n\nPlugging in \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\) Js, \\(m = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[0.4 \\times 10^{-9} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{\\sqrt{2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times E_k}}\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[(0.4 \\times 10^{-9})^2 = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times E_k}\\]\n\n\\[0.16 \\times 10^{-18} = \\frac{4.377 \\times 10^{-67}}{18.218 \\times 10^{-31} \\times E_k}\\]\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let's recalculate.\n\nFirst, \\((0.4 \\times 10^{-9})^2 = 0.16 \\times 10^{-18} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\) m\u00b2.\n\nAnd \\((6.626 \\times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.377 \\times 10^{-67}\\) J\u00b2 s\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: \\(2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} = 18.218 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg.\n\nWait, no. \\(2 \\times 9.109 = 18.218\\), but with units of kg, so \\(18.218 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg.\n\nWait, no. \\(2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} = 18.218 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg.\n\nSo, the denominator is \\(18.218 \\times 10^{-31} \\times E_k\\) in kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2, which is kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nWait, but \\(E_k\\) is in J, and 1 J = 1 kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, denominator is \\(18.218 \\times 10^{-31} \\times E_k\\) J.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\[1.6 \\times 10^{-19} = \\frac{4.377 \\times 10^{-67}}{18.218 \\times 10^{-31} \\times E_k}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(E_k\\):\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{4.377 \\times 10^{-67}}{18.218 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}}\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[18.218 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} = 18.218 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-50}\\]\\[= 29.1488 \\times 10^{-50} \\, \\text{kg m}^2/\\text{s}^2\\]\\[= 2.91488 \\times 10^{-49} \\, \\text{kg m}^2/\\text{s}^2\\]\n\nNow, divide:\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{4.377 \\times 10^{-67}}{2.91488 \\times 10^{-49}} \\, \\text{J}\\]\\[= 1.50 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}\\]\n\nConverting to eV:\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\, \\text{eV}\\]\\[= 9.36 \\, \\text{eV}\\]\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the kinetic energy in eV can be approximated by the formula:\n\n\\[E_k (\\text{in eV}) \\approx \\frac{150}{\\lambda (\\text{in nm})^2}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\lambda = 0.4\\) nm,\n\n\\[E_k \\approx \\frac{150}{(0.4)^2} = \\frac{150}{0.16} = 937.5 \\, \\text{eV}\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't match my previous calculation. There must be something wrong with this approximation.\n\nOh, I think I have the formula wrong. I believe the correct formula is:\n\n\\[E_k (\\text{in eV}) \\approx \\frac{150}{\\lambda (\\text{in nm})^2}\\]\n\nBut according to my previous calculation, for \\(\\lambda = 0.4\\) nm, \\(E_k \\approx 9.36\\) eV, which is much lower than 937.5 eV.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering the formula. Let me look it up.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula for the de Broglie wavelength in terms of kinetic energy in eV is:\n\n\\[\\lambda (\\text{in nm}) = \\frac{12.27}{\\sqrt{E_k (\\text{in eV})}}\\]\n\nRearranged, this gives:\n\n\\[E_k (\\text{in eV}) = \\left(\\frac{12.27}{\\lambda (\\text{in nm})}\\right)^2\\]\n\nFor \\(\\lambda = 0.4\\) nm,\n\n\\[E_k = \\left(\\frac{12.27}{0.4}\\right)^2 = (30.675)^2 = 940.8 \\, \\text{eV}\\]\n\nThis is significantly higher than my previous calculation of 9.36 eV. There must be a discrepancy here.\n\nI think the issue is that the formula I used earlier is for the rest energy of the electron, not the kinetic energy. Let me double-check the relationship between wavelength and kinetic energy.\n\nActually, the de Broglie wavelength is related to the total energy, not just the kinetic energy. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by:\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\]\n\nAnd the wavelength is:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mE_k}}\\]\n\nThis seems correct. Perhaps the formula I found online is for relativistic particles.\n\nLet me check the derivation again.\n\nIn non-relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is indeed \\(E_k = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\), and \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\), so combining them gives:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mE_k}}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(E_k\\):\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{h^2}{2m\\lambda^2}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times (0.4 \\times 10^{-9})^2}\\]\\[= \\frac{4.377 \\times 10^{-67}}{2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 0.16 \\times 10^{-18}}\\]\\[= \\frac{4.377 \\times 10^{-67}}{2.91488 \\times 10^{-49}}\\]\\[= 1.50 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}\\]\\[= 9.36 \\, \\text{eV}\\]\n\nThis seems consistent. Maybe the formula I found online is incorrect or applies to a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula relates to the total energy, not just kinetic energy. In relativistic terms, the total energy is \\(E = \\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m^2c^4}\\), but at 10 eV, the electron's speed is much less than the speed of light, so relativistic effects are negligible.\n\nTherefore, I trust my non-relativistic calculation.\n\nGiven that, the kinetic energy required is approximately 9.36 eV, which is closest to option C: 10 eV.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 10 eV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
