I need to figure out which one is correctly identified as the written form of the Oral Torah.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the Oral Torah is. I know that in Judaism, the Torah is divided into two main parts: the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. The Written Torah is the Five Books of Moses, also known as the Pentateuch, which is part of the Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible. So, since the question is about the Oral Torah's written form, it's likely not the Pentateuch or the Tanakh itself.\n\nNow, between Mishnah and Midrash, which one is the written form of the Oral Torah?\n\nI recall that the Mishnah is a collection of oral laws and teachings that were compiled in written form around the 2nd century CE. It's organized into six orders, each containing multiple tractates, and it forms the basis of Jewish law and theology.\n\nOn the other hand, Midrash is a genre of rabbinic literature that consists of interpretations of the written Torah, often providing commentary on specific passages or exploring the biblical text's deeper meanings. It's more about exegesis and less about the codification of law.\n\nGiven that the Oral Torah primarily concerns the transmission and interpretation of Jewish law and tradition, which was originally passed down orally from generation to generation, the written form that captures this would be the Mishnah.\n\nSo, option A. Mishnah seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. The Mishnah was compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince around 200 CE, and it serves as a central text for the development of Jewish law. It's the earliest written compendium of Jewish oral laws and traditions.\n\nThe Midrash, while an important part of Jewish scholarship, is more focused on interpreting the written Torah rather than being the direct written form of the Oral Torah.\n\nThe Tanakh is the Hebrew Bible, which includes the Torah, Prophets, and Writings. It's the written scripture, not the oral tradition.\n\nThe Pentateuch is the first five books of the Tanakh, which is again the written Torah, not the oral one.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be A. Mishnah.\n\nWait a minute, I've heard of something called the Talmud. Isn't that related to the Oral Torah as well? Yes, the Talmud is another important text in Judaism, which combines the Mishnah and the Gemara (rabbinical discussions and commentary on the Mishnah). So, the Mishnah is indeed a part of the Talmud, which is considered the written form of the Oral Torah.\n\nHence, confirming that A. Mishnah is the correct answer to the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Mishnah}} \\]"
