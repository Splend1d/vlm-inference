Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a type of psychotherapy that helps people change negative thoughts and behaviors. It's pretty effective for a lot of mental health issues, but not all disorders respond the same way. So, I need to recall which one of these disorders is most responsive to CBT.\n\nLet me start by considering major depressive disorder, which is option D. I know that CBT is commonly used to treat depression. It helps people challenge and change negative thoughts and behaviors that contribute to their depressive symptoms. There's a lot of research supporting its effectiveness for depression, so this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nNext, bipolar disorder, option B. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by episodes of mania and depression. While CBT can be helpful as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for bipolar disorder, it's often used in conjunction with medication. It might not be the first-line treatment compared to major depressive disorder, where CBT is more straightforwardly effective.\n\nOption C is dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder. This is a complex and controversial disorder involving the fragmentation of identity. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy aimed at integrating different identities, which might not be directly aligned with the approaches of CBT. CBT might have some role, but it's probably not the primary or most effective treatment method for this condition.\n\nThen there's option A, disorganized schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder involving delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking and behavior. While CBT can be beneficial for some symptoms of schizophrenia, especially in helping patients manage their thoughts and perceptions, it's generally used alongside medication. Disorganized schizophrenia, in particular, might present more challenges due to the severity of symptoms.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that major depressive disorder, option D, responds best to CBT. Not only is CBT a first-line treatment for depression, but there's also substantial evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing symptoms and preventing relapses.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. I recall that in the case of bipolar disorder, CBT is often used to help manage symptoms, but it's not as standalone effective as it is for depression. For dissociative identity disorder, the treatment is more focused on integration and trauma therapy, which isn't directly addressed by CBT. And for schizophrenia, especially disorganized type, medication is crucial, and CBT can be an adjunct but isn't the primary treatment.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that major depressive disorder is the disorder that responds best to cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
