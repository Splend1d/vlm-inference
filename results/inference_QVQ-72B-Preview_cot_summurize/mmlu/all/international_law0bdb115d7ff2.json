Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Vienna Declaration was about. I remember that it was adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993. It's a significant document in the field of human rights, and it addressed various aspects of human rights protection and promotion.\n\nOption A says that third-generation rights are of primary importance. Hmm, third-generation rights refer to collective rights, like the rights of peoples to self-determination, to a healthy environment, and so on. While these are important, I don't recall the Vienna Declaration placing them above other rights. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B states that civil and political rights are core rights. Civil and political rights are indeed fundamental, including things like the right to life, freedom of speech, and the right to a fair trial. But again, I think the Vienna Declaration emphasized the equality of all human rights, not that some are more core than others.\n\nOption D suggests that social and economic rights are non-enforceable. Social and economic rights include the rights to work, to health, to education, and so on. I know that in international law, there's a debate about whether these rights are as enforceable as civil and political rights. But I don't think the Vienna Declaration took the position that they're non-enforceable. In fact, I believe it supported the enforceability of all human rights.\n\nThat leaves Option C: all types of rights are indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent. This sounds familiar. I think the Vienna Declaration emphasized the holistic nature of human rights, meaning that civil, cultural, economic, social, and political rights are all important and cannot be separated. They support each other, and none can be fully realized without the others.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I recall correctly, the Declaration affirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, and interdependent. So, yes, that aligns with Option C. It didn't prioritize one generation of rights over another or declare any rights non-enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. All types of rights are indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly summarize why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The Declaration didn't declare third-generation rights as primary.\n\nB. It didn't single out civil and political rights as core rights, but rather emphasized the importance of all human rights.\n\nD. It didn't state that social and economic rights are non-enforceable; instead, it supported the implementation and enforcement of all human rights.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
