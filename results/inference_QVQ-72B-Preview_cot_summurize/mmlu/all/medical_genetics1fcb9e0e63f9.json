                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and how known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explain variation in body mass index (BMI). The question mentions that despite evidence from twin and family studies showing greater than 50% heritability, known SNPs explain only a small portion of the variation in BMI.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the terms involved. GWAS are studies that look across the genome for common variations, like SNPs, that are associated with a particular trait or condition. SNPs are changes in a single DNA building block, and they can be used to identify regions of the genome that might be involved in a particular trait.\n\nHeritability refers to how much of the variation in a trait within a population is due to genetic differences. So, if twin and family studies show that more than 50% of the variation in BMI is heritable, that means that over half of the differences in BMI among people are due to their genetic differences.\n\nBut the question is saying that despite this high heritability, known SNPs explain only a small portion of that variation. The options given are:\n\nA. only 5%\n\nB. less than 1%\n\nC. only 13%\n\nD. less than 2%\n\nI need to figure out which of these percentages is correct in explaining the variation in BMI based on known SNPs.\n\nI recall that one of the challenges in genetic research is something called \"missing heritability.\" This refers to the discrepancy between the heritability estimates from twin and family studies and the proportion of variance explained by identified genetic variants in GWAS.\n\nSo, if twin studies suggest that more than 50% of BMI variation is heritable, but GWAS SNPs only explain a much smaller portion, that gap is the missing heritability.\n\nNow, I need to recall what the current understanding is regarding how much of the BMI variation known SNPs can explain.\n\nI think back to some studies I've read about. I remember that early GWAS for BMI identified several loci, but collectively, these explained only a small fraction of the total heritability. For example, some early reports suggested that known SNPs could explain around 1% to 5% of the variation in BMI.\n\nBut I need more precise information to answer this question correctly.\n\nLet me consider looking up a specific study or review on this topic to get an accurate figure.\n\nI recall that in 2010, the Genome-wide Association Study of Alliance for Population Genomics (GIANT) consortium published a study identifying dozens of loci associated with BMI. However, even with those loci, the explained variation was quite low.\n\nAnother study from 2012 increased the number of identified loci, but still, the explained variation was only around 1.5% to 2.5% of the total BMI variation.\n\nMore recently, with larger sample sizes and more powerful GWAS, the number of identified BMI-associated loci has increased, but the explained variation is still much lower than the heritability estimates from twin studies.\n\nI think I read somewhere that even with the latest GWAS, known SNPs explain around 5% to 10% of the variation in BMI, whereas twin studies suggest over 50% heritability.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that the explained variation is less than that.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the question is referring to the proportion of variance explained by all known SNPs combined, not just the top hits from GWAS.\n\nI recall that methods like genomic-relatedness-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) can estimate the total variance explained by all common SNPs, not just those reaching genome-wide significance.\n\nIn one such study, all common SNPs together explained around 10% to 15% of the variation in BMI, which is still much lower than the 50% heritability from twin studies.\n\nBut again, that's higher than some of the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring specifically to the variance explained by SNPs reaching genome-wide significance in GWAS, which is even lower.\n\nFor example, in a particular GWAS, the top associated SNPs might together explain only 1% to 2% of the BMI variation.\n\nThat could make sense given the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to an earlier state of research where only a very small portion of the heritability was explained by known SNPs.\n\nBut I need to consider the context of when this question might have been written or based on.\n\nGiven that genomic research is rapidly advancing, estimates can change over time as more data becomes available.\n\nHowever, based on my knowledge, even with the most recent GWAS, known SNPs explain a minority of the BMI variation, certainly much less than the 50% heritability suggested by twin studies.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. only 5%\n\nB. less than 1%\n\nC. only 13%\n\nD. less than 2%\n\nIf I had to choose between these, and considering that even with recent advances, known SNPs explain around 5% to 10% of BMI variation, which is still less than 50%, but among the options, 13% seems higher than I would expect.\n\nOption A is 5%, which seems plausible.\n\nOption B is less than 1%, which might be too low, given that even early GWAS could explain more than that.\n\nOption C is 13%, which seems too high, as it's closer to the heritability estimates from twin studies.\n\nOption D is less than 2%, which is also possible, but again, recent studies might explain more than that.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nPerhaps the question is referring to a specific study or a particular time when known SNPs explained less than 2% of the variation in BMI.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering only certain types of SNPs or specific populations.\n\nAnother angle to consider is that not all heritability is captured by common SNPs, and some of the missing heritability might be due to rare variants, structural variations, or gene-gene interactions that aren't detected in standard GWAS.\n\nThis further supports the idea that known common SNPs explain only a portion of the heritability.\n\nGiven all this, I need to make an educated guess based on the options provided.\n\nBetween options A (5%), C (13%), and D (less than 2%), I think 5% is a reasonable estimate for the variation explained by known SNPs in BMI, whereas 13% seems too high, and less than 2% might be too low.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option A: only 5%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
