                    "text": "So there's this problem about a falling alarm and how its frequency changes as perceived by the person who dropped it. The alarm is emitting a sound at 400 Hz, and it's dropped from a third-floor window. The person dropping it is measuring the frequency with an oscilloscope, which is pretty sensitive. The question is asking what the measured frequency will be and how it changes as the alarm falls.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some physics about how moving sources affect the frequency of sound that an observer hears. I think this has to do with the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect is when there's a change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.\n\nSo, in this case, the alarm is the source, and the person is the observer. Initially, the source is at rest relative to the observer, and it's emitting a sound at 400 Hz. But then the alarm starts falling, so it's moving towards the observer. As it falls, its speed increases due to acceleration from gravity.\n\nNow, when the source is moving towards the observer, the frequency that the observer hears is higher than the actual frequency emitted by the source. That's because the waves are getting closer together as the source moves closer. So, initially, the frequency should appear higher than 400 Hz.\n\nBut the question also says that the frequency increases or decreases as it falls. So, I need to think about how the perceived frequency changes over time as the alarm falls.\n\nSince the alarm is falling faster and faster due to gravity, its speed towards the observer increases with time. The Doppler effect formula for a moving source and a stationary observer is:\n\n\\[ f = f_0 \\left( \\frac{v}{v - u} \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( f \\) is the observed frequency\n\n- \\( f_0 \\) is the emitted frequency\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound in the medium\n\n- \\( u \\) is the speed of the source towards the observer\n\nAs the alarm falls, \\( u \\) increases, so the denominator \\( v - u \\) decreases. That means the observed frequency \\( f \\) increases because you're dividing by a smaller number.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the direction. Since \\( u \\) is positive (towards the observer), \\( v - u \\) decreases as \\( u \\) increases, so yes, \\( f \\) increases.\n\nSo, combining this, the observed frequency starts higher than 400 Hz and increases further as the alarm falls faster.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency increase as it falls\n\nB. appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls\n\nC. appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls\n\nD. appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency increases as it falls\n\nBased on my reasoning, option A seems correct: it appears higher than 400 Hz and increases as it falls.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI know that when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher, and as the speed increases, the frequency should increase further. So, in this scenario, since the alarm is falling faster and faster, the observed frequency should keep increasing.\n\nI don't think there's any decrease in frequency here unless the source starts moving away from the observer, which isn't the case.\n\nSo, option A seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe there's something about the vertical component and the angle, but the problem states that the person is measuring it with a very sensitive oscilloscope, so perhaps we can assume that the measurement is being done in a way that accounts for the changing distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the vertical component of the motion and how it affects the perceived frequency.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the alarm is falling straight down, and the person is right below it. As the alarm falls, its speed increases, and since it's moving towards the observer, the frequency should indeed increase as per the Doppler effect.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that as the alarm falls, the time between successive wavefronts reaching the observer decreases because the source is getting closer at an increasing speed, leading to a higher frequency.\n\nSo, my initial conclusion stands: the observed frequency is higher than 400 Hz and increases as the alarm falls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
