                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Moral theories that say that the rightness of actions depends solely on their consequences are _____.\" And the options are A. deontological, B. virtue oriented, C. consequentialist, D. egoistic. Hmm, I need to figure out which one fits best.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. Starting with deontological: I think deontology is a moral theory that emphasizes duties and rules. So, it's more about following certain rules or principles, regardless of the outcomes. Like, \"Thou shalt not steal,\" no matter what the consequences might be. So, it doesn't sound like it focuses on consequences; it's more about the action itself. So, option A might not be the right choice.\n\nNext, virtue-oriented. I've heard of virtue ethics. That's about cultivating moral character traits, like honesty, courage, and compassion. It's more concerned with what kind of person you are rather than the specific actions or their consequences. So, again, not directly about the consequences of actions. Maybe not the best fit for the description in the question.\n\nThen there's consequentialist. The word itself seems to suggest a focus on consequences. Consequentialism is a moral theory that judges the rightness of actions based on their outcomes or consequences. So, it seems to match the description perfectly: the rightness of actions depends solely on their consequences. That would make option C the correct answer.\n\nLastly, egoistic. I believe egoism is a moral theory that suggests individuals should act in their own self-interest. So, the rightness of an action is determined by how much it benefits the individual performing it, not necessarily by its overall consequences for others. So, while it does consider consequences, it's specifically about the consequences for the self, not necessarily for everyone affected. Therefore, it doesn't quite fit the description provided in the question.\n\nPutting it all together, the moral theory that says the rightness of actions depends solely on their consequences is consequentialist. So, the answer should be C. consequentialist.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, let me think about another example. Suppose I have to choose between lying to protect someone's feelings or telling the truth and hurting them. A consequentialist would probably consider which option leads to the better overall outcome, perhaps minimizing harm or maximizing happiness. A deontologist might say that lying is always wrong, regardless of the consequences, because it violates a moral rule against lying. A virtue ethicist might consider which choice aligns better with virtues like kindness and honesty. An egoist might choose the option that serves their own interests best. So, again, consequentialism is the one that directly ties moral rightness to the consequences of actions.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider utilitarianism, which is a type of consequentialism. Utilitarians believe that the most moral action is the one that produces the greatest overall good, usually measured in terms of happiness or well-being. So, if a action leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people, it's considered right. That's entirely based on its consequences.\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice here. The description in the question matches consequentialism pretty closely. So, the answer is C. consequentialist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
