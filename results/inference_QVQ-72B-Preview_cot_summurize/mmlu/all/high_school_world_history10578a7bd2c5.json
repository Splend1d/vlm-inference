                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we've got this passage from \"The Book of Routes and Realms\" by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, who was an eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer. He's describing the city of Ghana, which consists of two towns: one inhabited by Muslims with mosques and imams, and another place where the king and his court are located. There are some interesting details here that suggest trade connections, possibly with Asia.\n\nFirst off, the passage mentions that the king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury, and most of his ministers are Muslims. This indicates that there's a significant Muslim presence in the government and administration of Ghana. Muslims were known for their role in trade during this period, often acting as merchants and intermediaries across different regions, including Africa and Asia.\n\nIt also says that only the royalty may wear sewn clothes, while others wear robes made of cotton, silk, or brocade, depending on their means. Silk and brocade are particularly noteworthy. Silk has historically been associated with China and the Silk Road, the famous trade route that connected Asia to the Mediterranean world. Brocade is a type of fabric with a raised pattern, often made using silk threads, and it was also a luxury item traded along these routes.\n\nMoreover, the passage mentions that the king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces and bracelets. While this might reflect local cultural practices, it's possible that such jewelry could include gems or materials that were traded from distant lands, perhaps even Asia.\n\nAnother detail is about the king's pavilion, which is domed, and around it stand ten horses. Horses were valuable commodities in trade, especially in West Africa, where they were imported from North Africa or other regions. The Mongols, as mentioned in option A, were known for their horses, but it's not clear from the passage whether these horses specifically came from the Mongols.\n\nThe passage also talks about the economic aspects of Ghana. For instance, the king levies taxes on salt and copper imports and exports. Salt was a crucial commodity in West Africa, and its trade was extensive, reaching as far as the Mediterranean. Copper was also an important trade good, used for various purposes, including coinage.\n\nAdditionally, it mentions that all gold nuggets found in the mines of the country are reserved for the king, with only gold dust left for the people. Gold was a major export of West African kingdoms like Ghana, and it was highly sought after in Europe and the Middle East, often traded for goods from Asia via these regions.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided to see which one is best supported by the evidence in the passage:\n\nA. They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.\n\nWhile the passage does mention that there are ten horses around the king's pavilion, it doesn't specify the origin of these horses. Horses could have come from various places, including North Africa or other parts of West Africa. The Mongols were primarily located in Central Asia and China, and while they were known for their horses, it's not directly indicated in the passage that the horses in Ghana's court came from them. So, this option is possible but not directly supported by the passage.\n\nB. The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow.\n\nThe passage describes that when people who share the king's religion approach him, they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads as a greeting. For Muslims, the greeting is clapping their hands. The kow-tow is a Chinese tradition involving kneeling and touching the ground with the forehead, often associated with paying respect to the emperor. Sprinkling dust on the head might be a similar act of reverence but isn't directly comparable to the kow-tow. Without more specific information, it's hard to conclude that the Ghanian king adopted the Chinese kow-tow. So, this option seems less likely based on the passage.\n\nC. The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n\nThe passage does mention that the king adorns himself with necklaces and bracelets, which could be made of gold and possibly jewels. However, it doesn't specify the origin of these materials. Gold was abundant in West Africa, particularly in Ghana, which was known as the \"land of gold.\" Jewels could have come from various sources. While India was a significant producer of diamonds and other gems, and was involved in trade networks, the passage doesn't provide enough information to confirm that the jewels came specifically from India. So, this option is speculative based on the given information.\n\nD. The people in his court wore silk robes.\n\nThe passage clearly states that the people in the court wear robes made of cotton, silk, or brocade, depending on their means. Silk is a material that was primarily produced in Asia, especially in China, and was traded along the Silk Road to various parts of the world, including Africa. The presence of silk robes in the court of Ghana suggests that there was a trade connection, either direct or indirect, with Asia, where silk was produced.\n\nGiven these considerations, option D seems to be the most directly supported by the evidence in the passage. The mention of silk robes indicates that the people in Ghana had access to Asian luxury goods, which implies engagement in trade networks that connected West Africa with Asia, either through direct trade or through intermediaries.\n\nSo, the answer is D. The people in his court wore silk robes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
