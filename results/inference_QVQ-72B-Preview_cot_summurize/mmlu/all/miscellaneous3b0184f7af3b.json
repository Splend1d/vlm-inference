Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not entirely sure, but I think I can recall some information about Marge Simpson.\n\nFirst off, Marge Simpson is a character from \"The Simpsons,\" right? That's an animated TV show that's been around for a really long time. I remember seeing some episodes when I was younger, but it's been a while. I think Marge has distinctive hair, maybe it's blue? Let me think carefully.\n\nI recall that Marge has tall, blue hair that's styled in a big updo. Yeah, that sounds familiar. It's pretty iconic. So, if I'm remembering correctly, her hair is blue. But let me make sure I'm not confusing her with another character.\n\nWait a minute, in \"The Simpsons,\" the family members all have yellow skin, which is their signature look. But Marge's hair is definitely not yellow; it's another color. So, option A is yellow, which I think is incorrect for her hair.\n\nOption B is purple. I don't remember her hair being purple. Purple seems more associated with characters like Grimace from McDonald's or something like that. Not Marge.\n\nOption C is blue, which is what I initially thought. But to be thorough, I should consider if there's any chance it could be another color. Maybe sometimes in different episodes, her hair might appear differently, but I think blue is the consistent color.\n\nOption D is brown. Brown hair seems too ordinary for a cartoon character like Marge. I don't think it's brown; I'm pretty sure it's blue.\n\nLet me try to visualize it. Marge is the mother of the Simpson family, and she's known for her blue hair. Yeah, that rings a bell. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I can think about some other characters from the show to make sure I'm not mixing up the colors. For example, Lisa Simpson, her daughter, has red hair, I think, or is it something else? Wait, actually, I think Lisa has red hair, but I might be confusing it with another character.\n\nNo, Lisa Simpson has red hair, I believe. So, if Lisa has red hair and Marge has blue hair, that makes sense because they're distinct colors. So, that reinforces my thought that Marge's hair is blue.\n\nI don't think the answer is yellow, purple, or brown. Yellow is the skin color, purple doesn't ring any bells, and brown seems too mundane for her character design.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to go with option C: blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
