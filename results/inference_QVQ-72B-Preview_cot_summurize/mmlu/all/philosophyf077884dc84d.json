                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Ross's view on how we learn about our prima facie duties. The options are:\n\nA. by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.\n\nB. by apprehending general principles, and then inferring the prima facie rightness of particular acts.\n\nC. by proving them philosophically.\n\nD. from the explicit moral instruction we receive as children.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Ross believed about how we come to know our moral duties. I remember that Ross was an intuitionist in ethics, which means he thought that some moral truths are self-evident and can be known directly through moral intuition.\n\nNow, prima facie duties are those which appear to be obligatory at first glance, before considering any conflicting duties. So, the question is about how we come to recognize these apparent obligations.\n\nOption A suggests that we first see the rightness of specific actions and then generalize from there to form principles. This sounds a bit like induction, where we start with particular instances and then derive general rules.\n\nOption B is the reverse: we start with general principles and then apply them to specific acts to determine their prima facie rightness. This seems more deductive, starting from general rules and applying them to particular cases.\n\nOption C mentions proving them philosophically. While philosophy certainly engages with moral questions, Ross's intuitionism suggests that moral truths are known intuitively, not necessarily through proof.\n\nOption D refers to moral instruction from childhood. While this can influence our moral views, Ross's theory places more emphasis on individual moral intuition rather than external instruction.\n\nGiven that Ross was an intuitionist, I think the process is more aligned with option A. He believed that we intuitively recognize the rightness or wrongness of particular actions, and then we might generalize from those intuitions to form principles. But the primary source is our moral intuitions about specific cases, not abstract principles or philosophical proofs.\n\nWait, but option B also seems plausible because Ross did propose a list of prima facie duties like fidelity, reparation, etc., which are general principles. However, I think the way he conceived of it, the recognition starts with particular instances.\n\nLet me think again. In Ross's book \"The Right and the Good,\" he discusses how we have intuitions about specific moral obligations in particular situations, and these intuitions help us form a list of general prima facie duties. So, it seems like he thought we first have intuitions about specific acts and then abstract general duties from those intuitions.\n\nSo, that would support option A: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.\n\nOption B seems to suggest a more top-down approach, where we have general moral principles and then apply them to specific cases. While this is a common way of thinking about ethics, Ross's intuitionism seems to prioritize particular intuitions over general principles.\n\nOption C, proving them philosophically, doesn't align with Ross's intuitionism, which holds that moral truths are self-evident and known through intuition rather than proof.\n\nOption D, learning from explicit moral instruction as children, is certainly a part of how we come to understand morality, but Ross's theory emphasizes individual moral intuition more than external teaching.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any evidence that Ross thought otherwise. For example, did he emphasize learning moral principles first and then applying them to particular cases?\n\nI don't think so. His approach was more about reflecting on particular moral situations and deriving general principles from those reflections, not the other way around.\n\nSo, I'm confident that A is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
