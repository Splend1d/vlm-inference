                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are four packages, each meant for four different houses. The packages are delivered randomly, and I need to find the probability that exactly two of them are delivered to the correct houses. The answer should be expressed as a common fraction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have four packages and four houses, and each package is supposed to go to a specific house. But they're being delivered randomly. I need to find the probability that exactly two out of these four packages end up at the correct houses.\n\nOkay, so probably the best way to approach this is to think about the total number of possible ways the packages can be delivered and then figure out how many of those ways result in exactly two correct deliveries.\n\nSince there are four packages and four houses, and each package goes to a different house, the total number of possible deliveries is the number of permutations of four packages, which is 4! (4 factorial), which is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of permutations where exactly two packages are in the correct places. That means two are correct, and the other two are not.\n\nWait, but if two are correct, and the other two are incorrect, those two incorrect ones can't just be any incorrect arrangement; they have to be such that neither of them is in the correct place. Because if one of them was in the correct place, then that would make three correct deliveries, which is not what we want.\n\nSo, I need to find the number of ways to have exactly two correct deliveries, with the other two packages not being in their correct places.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, choose which two packages are correctly delivered. There are C(4,2) ways to choose which two packages are correct. C(4,2) is equal to 6.\n\nThen, for the remaining two packages, neither should be in the correct place. So, these two packages must be swapped in such a way that each is in the other's place. Because if you swap two packages, they are each in each other's places, which are incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not quite accurate. If you have two packages and you swap them, then each is in the other's place, which is incorrect. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, for the two incorrectly delivered packages, there's only one way to arrange them incorrectly: swap them.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable permutations is C(4,2) times the number of ways to arrange the remaining two incorrectly, which seems to be 6 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nBut wait, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nActually, if you choose any two to be correct, and the other two are swapped, then yes, there's only one way to arrange the swapped pair.\n\nSo, total favorable arrangements are C(4,2) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the probability is favorable arrangements divided by total arrangements, which is 6 / 24 = 1/4.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct.\n\nIs there only one way to arrange the remaining two incorrectly? Yes, because swapping them is the only way to ensure neither is in the correct place.\n\nWait, but in general, derangements can be more complicated, but for two items, swapping them is indeed the only derangement.\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\nBut let me see the options provided:\n\nA. 1/4\n\nB. 27/128\n\nC. 1/2\n\nD. 1/9\n\nOption A is 1/4, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me consider another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the concept of derangements. A derangement is a permutation where none of the elements appear in their original positions.\n\nIn this problem, we want exactly two packages to be in their correct positions, and the other two to be deranged.\n\nThe number of derangements for two items is 1 (just swapping them).\n\nSo, total favorable permutations are C(4,2) * number of derangements of the remaining two, which is 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nTotal permutations are 24, so probability is 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of probabilities step by step.\n\nLet's consider the four packages labeled A, B, C, D, and houses A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nWe want exactly two to be correctly delivered.\n\nLet's fix two packages to be correct, say A and B, and then see the probability for this specific pair, and then multiply by the number of ways to choose the pair.\n\nSo, choose a pair of two correct deliveries: C(4,2) = 6 ways.\n\nFor each of these ways, the remaining two must be deranged, which, as we saw, is 1 way.\n\nSo, total favorable permutations are 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nThus, probability is 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the probability directly.\n\nThe probability that a specific package is correctly delivered is 1/4.\n\nBut I need exactly two correct.\n\nSo, number of ways to choose two correct packages: C(4,2) = 6.\n\nFor each such choice, the other two must not be correctly delivered, which is the derangement of two items: 1 way.\n\nSo, again, 6 * 1 = 6 favorable permutations.\n\nHence, probability is 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nWait, but is there any other way the remaining two could be arranged such that neither is in the correct place besides swapping them?\n\nNo, for two items, swapping is the only way to have neither in the correct place.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems solid.\n\nLet me consider a specific example to verify.\n\nSuppose packages are A, B, C, D, and houses A, B, C, D.\n\nPossible favorable permutations:\n\n1. A,B,C,D but that's all correct, which is more than two correct.\n\n2. A,B,D,C - here A and B are correct, C and D are swapped, so this is favorable.\n\n3. A,C,B,D - A and C are correct, B and D are swapped: favorable.\n\n4. A,C,D,B - A and D are correct, C and B are swapped: favorable.\n\n5. A,D,C,B - A and D are correct, C and B are swapped: favorable.\n\n6. B,A,D,C - B and D are correct, A and C are swapped: favorable.\n\n7. B,C,A,D - B and C are correct, A and D are swapped: favorable.\n\n8. B,D,A,C - B and A are correct, D and C are swapped: wait, but if B and A are correct, that's three correct, which is not what we want.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake.\n\nWait, no: if B and A are correct, and D and C are swapped, that would be B in its correct place, A in its correct place, D in house C, and C in house D. So, D and C are swapped, which is incorrect for both. So, that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but that would mean B and A are correct, and D and C are swapped: that's favorable.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought choosing two to be correct and the other two swapped seems to be the only way, which aligns with the earlier calculation of 6 favorable permutations.\n\nSo, total 6 favorable permutations.\n\nTotal permutations: 24.\n\nProbability: 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 1/4.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a different approach that might lead to a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the probability using inclusion-exclusion or another combinatorial method.\n\nTotal number of permutations: 4! = 24.\n\nNumber of permutations with exactly two correct deliveries: C(4,2) * D(2), where D(2) is the number of derangements of 2 items, which is 1.\n\nSo, 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, probability is 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of conditional probability.\n\nBut I think the initial approach is sufficient and straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the probability is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
