                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a school board wanting to sell a vacant public school building to a church at a price below market value, and there's a proposed new state law to allow this. The question is whether this would be constitutional, and there are four options to choose from. I need to think through this carefully.\n\nFirst off, the background is that there's a state law requiring vacant public school buildings to be sold at auction to the highest bidder. But now, the city's school board wants to sell one of these buildings to a specific church for its school, and they want to do it at a lower price than the market value. To make this happen, they're proposing a new state law that would authorize this kind of sale.\n\nOption A says that this wouldn't be constitutional because a special law authorizing the sale without competitive bidding would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hmm, equal protection clause generally means that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. So, if they're treating this church differently from other potential buyers, that might be an issue.\n\nBut wait, the church is a specific entity, and maybe there's a legitimate interest in selling to them at a lower price. Maybe the state sees value in the church using the building for educational purposes. Still, if they're not offering the same deal to others, it could be seen as unequal treatment.\n\nOption B says that this would be unconstitutional because it would amount to an establishment of religion, which is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The First Amendment says that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, and through the Fourteenth Amendment, this applies to the states as well.\n\nSo, if the state is selling a public asset to a church at below market value, is that supporting religion? Well, the church is getting a financial benefit because they're paying less than the market value. That could be seen as a subsidy or financial assistance to the church.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the church is using the building for its school. Schools can have both secular and religious aspects, especially if it's a religious school. So, is the primary purpose of the sale to support the church's religious activities, or is it to further some secular goal, like continuing the use of the building for educational purposes?\n\nOption C says that surplus government property isn't subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Just because it's surplus property doesn't mean that the state can do whatever it wants with it without considering constitutional constraints, especially those related to establishment of religion.\n\nI think this option is likely incorrect because the establishment clause does apply to state actions, including the disposal of public assets.\n\nOption D says that the law would be constitutional because it wouldn't primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church. So, this is getting into the specifics of whether the sale is directly aiding religion.\n\nThere are several tests courts use to determine if a law violates the establishment clause. One of the main ones is the Lemon test, which has three parts:\n\n1. The law must have a secular legislative purpose.\n\n2. Its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion.\n\n3. It must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\n\nIn this case, the secular purpose might be to continue the use of the building for educational purposes or to support the community by helping the church expand its school.\n\nBut, the primary effect could be seen as advancing religion because the church is a religious entity and the money saved from the below-market price could be used for religious activities.\n\nHowever, if the primary use of the building is for education, which has secular aspects, maybe the benefit to the church's religious activities is incidental.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the state could justify it by saying that selling to any buyer at a discount for continued educational use is acceptable, not just to the church.\n\nBut, if it's specifically to the church and at a below-market price, it might still be seen as favoring religion.\n\nLet me think about similar cases. There was a case called Locke v. Davey, where the Supreme Court upheld a state's decision not to fund students pursuing degrees in pastoral ministry under a scholarship program, based on the establishment clause. But that's about not funding religious training directly.\n\nAnother case is Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, where the Court held that a church could not be excluded from a grant program solely because it is a church, under the free exercise clause. But that's about equal access to public benefits, not about preferential treatment.\n\nIn our scenario, it's about selling a public asset to a church at a below-market price, which seems more like a subsidy or grant.\n\nI think the key here is whether this sale amounts to an improper establishment of religion.\n\nOption B seems to be saying that it would violate the establishment clause because it constitutes an establishment of religion.\n\nBut, option D is saying that it's okay because it doesn't primarily support religious activities.\n\nI need to decide which one is more accurate.\n\nGiven that the church is getting a financial benefit (the below-market price), which could be used for religious purposes, it might be seen as indirect support for religion.\n\nHowever, if the primary purpose is to have the building used for educational purposes, perhaps the state could argue that it's not primarily supporting religion.\n\nBut, the fact that it's specifically to the church and at a below-market price suggests that there is a religious element to the transaction.\n\nMaybe the state could require that the building be used only for educational purposes and not for religious activities, but that's not what's being proposed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state could sell the building at market value and then provide a grant to the church to make up the difference, but that might still run into establishment clause issues.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is that this proposed law would likely be unconstitutional because it would constitute an establishment of religion.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nOption A might also be a concern regarding equal protection, but the primary issue here seems to be the establishment clause.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B: No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
