It involves making new information meaningful by connecting it to existing knowledge or experiences. This process helps in deeper encoding of information, making it easier to recall later.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Making new information meaningful \u2013 This sounds very much like elaborative rehearsal. When you relate new information to what you already know, you're giving it meaning in the context of your existing knowledge.\n\nB. Consciously repeating new information \u2013 This seems more like rote rehearsal or maintenance rehearsal, where you repeat information to keep it in your short-term memory. Elaborative rehearsal goes beyond just repetition; it involves deeper processing by connecting new information to what you already know.\n\nC. Practicing a new skill past the point of mastery \u2013 This might relate to overlearning or deliberate practice, which involves continuing to practice even after you've reached a certain level of proficiency. While this can enhance performance, it's not directly related to elaborative rehearsal, which is about making connections to existing knowledge to improve memory.\n\nD. \u201cThinking aloud\u201d while studying \u2013 This could be a study strategy where you verbalize your thoughts to better understand or remember the material. While it might be a part of some learning strategies, it's not specifically elaborative rehearsal.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the best description of elaborative rehearsal. It accurately captures the essence of making new information meaningful by connecting it to existing knowledge or experiences.\n\nHowever, to ensure I'm not missing something, let me consider an example. Suppose you're trying to remember the definition of elaborative rehearsal itself. Instead of just repeating the definition over and over (maintenance rehearsal), you might think about how this concept relates to other memory techniques you've learned, perhaps comparing it to mnemonics or the method of loci. By doing so, you're engaging in elaborative rehearsal because you're integrating the new information with your existing knowledge, which should make it easier to recall in the future.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the difference between simply memorizing facts and understanding them. Elaborative rehearsal involves understanding and making connections, which leads to better long-term retention compared to just rote memorization.\n\nIn summary, elaborative rehearsal is about making new information meaningful through connections to existing knowledge or experiences. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
