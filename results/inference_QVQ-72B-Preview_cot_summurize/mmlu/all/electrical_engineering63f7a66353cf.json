                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about figuring out how many lamps I need to light up a room to a certain brightness level. The room is 4 meters by 3 meters, and I want an average illuminance of 50 lux. Each lamp provides 300 lumens. The options are 2, 4, 5, or 6 lamps. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what illuminance is. Lux is a unit of illuminance, which measures how much light falls on a surface. So, if I have a room and I want the light to be evenly distributed, I need to make sure that the total lumens provided by the lamps are enough to achieve that average lux level over the entire room.\n\nI think the formula for illuminance (E) is luminous flux (\u03c6) divided by the area (A), so E = \u03c6 / A. If I rearrange that, I can find the total luminous flux needed by multiplying the area by the desired illuminance.\n\nLet me calculate the area of the room first. It's 4 meters by 3 meters, so the area is 4 * 3 = 12 square meters.\n\nNow, I want an average illuminance of 50 lux. So, total lumens needed would be 50 * 12 = 600 lumens.\n\nEach lamp provides 300 lumens. So, to get 600 lumens, I would need 600 / 300 = 2 lamps.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is 2, and there are other higher numbers. Is there more to this?\n\nI recall that in reality, light distribution isn't perfectly uniform, so maybe I need more lamps to ensure the average is 50 lux. But the problem says \"average,\" so maybe just 2 lamps are enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a coefficient or something I'm missing here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to consider the efficiency of the lighting setup or some other factor, but the problem doesn't provide any additional information like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a utilization factor or maintenance factor that I should consider, but again, the problem doesn't specify.\n\nI think the simplest approach is correct here: calculate the total lumens needed based on the area and the desired illuminance, and then divide by the lumens per lamp.\n\nSo, area is 12 square meters, times 50 lux, equals 600 lumens. Each lamp provides 300 lumens, so 600 / 300 = 2 lamps.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs the room rectangular? Yes, 4m by 3m. Are there any windows or other light sources? No, the problem doesn't mention any.\n\nAre there any reflections or absorption factors to consider? Again, the problem doesn't specify, so I think we can assume ideal conditions.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, 2 lamps should be sufficient to achieve an average illuminance of 50 lux in the room.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"each having 300 lumens,\" and the options include 2, which seems straightforward. Maybe it's a trick question, or maybe there's a misunderstanding of terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the spacing of the lamps to ensure even lighting, but again, the problem is about the total number needed, not their arrangement.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The answer should be 2 lamps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
