                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that to pass an algebra test at Academic Academy, you need to score at least 80%. The test has 35 problems, and I need to find out the greatest number of problems I can miss and still pass. The options are A. 7, B. 28, C. 35, and D. 8.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means to score at least 80%. That means that the number of problems I get correct should be 80% or more of the total problems. So, if there are 35 problems, 80% of 35 should be the minimum number of correct answers I need.\n\nLet me calculate 80% of 35. To find 80% of a number, I can multiply the number by 0.80. So, 35 times 0.80.\n\n35 \u00d7 0.80 = 28.\n\nThat means I need to get at least 28 problems correct to pass.\n\nNow, if there are 35 problems in total and I need to get at least 28 correct, then the number of problems I can miss is 35 minus 28.\n\n35 - 28 = 7.\n\nSo, I can miss up to 7 problems and still pass.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. If I miss 7 problems, that means I get 28 correct, which is the minimum required to pass. So, missing 7 should be okay.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's think about it another way. Maybe I should calculate the percentage if I miss 7 problems.\n\nIf I miss 7 problems, then I get 28 correct, as I said. What percentage is that?\n\nTo find the percentage, I can take the number correct (28) divided by the total problems (35), and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, (28 / 35) \u00d7 100 = ?\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n28 divided by 35 is 0.8.\n\n0.8 multiplied by 100 is 80%.\n\nSo, yes, missing 7 problems gives exactly an 80% score, which is the passing grade.\n\nNow, what if I miss more than 7 problems? Say, 8 problems. What would that give me?\n\nIf I miss 8 problems, then I get 27 correct.\n\nSo, 27 / 35 as a percentage is (27 / 35) \u00d7 100.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n27 divided by 35 is approximately 0.7714.\n\n0.7714 times 100 is about 77.14%.\n\nThat's below 80%, so missing 8 problems would not be passing.\n\nSimilarly, missing 6 problems would mean getting 29 correct.\n\n29 / 35 = approximately 0.8286, which is about 82.86%, which is above 80%, so that would still pass.\n\nSo, the greatest number of problems I can miss and still pass is 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 7.\n\nWait, but option D is 8. Why is that wrong?\n\nBecause if I miss 8 problems, I only get 27 correct, which is less than 28, and that's below 80%.\n\nSo, missing 8 problems would not be passing.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A. 7.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any other way to interpret this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 7} \\]"
