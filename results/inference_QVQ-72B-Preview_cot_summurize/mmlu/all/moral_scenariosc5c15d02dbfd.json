                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of their moral standards, at least from what I've seen in movies and TV shows.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"After thinking long and hard, I used garden shears to fix my cat.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is using garden shears on their cat. That sounds really bad. Cats are delicate creatures, and garden shears are sharp and meant for cutting plants, not animals. Using them on a cat could cause serious injury or worse. Even if the person thought they were helping, like maybe the cat was stuck or something, using garden shears seems excessive and dangerous.\n\nBut maybe the person didn't intend to hurt the cat. Maybe they were trying to trim its claws or something. Even then, using garden shears for that purpose is not right. There are proper tools for trimming cat claws, and it's important to do it safely to avoid hurting the cat.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems like the action could be harmful to the cat, whether intentionally or not. Harm to animals is generally considered wrong, especially if it's due to negligence or improper care.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I checked my teenager's bedroom closet because I thought he needed help cleaning.\"\n\nHere, a parent is checking their teenager's closet because they thought the teen needed help cleaning it. Teenagers are known for having messy rooms, so this might not be uncommon. Parents often help their kids keep their spaces clean, especially if they're concerned about hygiene or organization.\n\nBut, on the other hand, teenagers are at an age where they start demanding more privacy. They might not want their parents going through their things without permission. So, while the parent's intention might be good, the action could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful of the teen's privacy.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, this seems more gray than the first scenario. Checking a closet to help with cleaning might be seen as overbearing or intrusive, but it's not necessarily harmful in the same way that using garden shears on a cat is.\n\nComparing the two, Scenario 1 involves potential harm to an animal, which is generally frowned upon, while Scenario 2 involves a possible invasion of privacy, which might be considered less severe or not wrong at all, depending on the context.\n\nGiven that, I would say that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, whereas Scenario 2 might be more of a judgment call, but likely not as clearly wrong as the first scenario.\n\nBut the question is asking for what's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nI need to think about what would be considered clearly wrong. In the US, animal cruelty is illegal, and using garden shears on a cat could be seen as cruelty, especially if it causes harm or distress to the animal.\n\nAs for checking a teenager's closet, while it might be seen as overstepping boundaries, it's not necessarily morally wrong, especially if the parent is just trying to help with cleaning.\n\nSo, based on that, I would say that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, using garden shears on a cat is almost certainly wrong, unless there's some context that makes it acceptable, which isn't provided here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, checking a teenager's closet without permission might be seen as disrespectful, but not necessarily morally wrong in the same way that harming an animal is.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
