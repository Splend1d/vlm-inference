                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 27-year-old man who's been brought to the emergency department by his sister because he's been acting confused for the past 10 hours and now he can't answer questions. His sister mentioned that he recently started seeing a psychiatrist because he's been hearing voices and was prescribed some medication, though she doesn't know which one. She also said he drinks a lot and might have tried some illegal drugs. He looks really sick\u2014temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), heart rate is 124 beats per minute, and blood pressure is 160/102 mm Hg. He's sweating a lot and his muscles are rigid. His neck is soft, abdomen is soft and not tender. Mentally, he's agitated sometimes and lethargic at others. His white blood cell count is 15,600/mm3 and serum creatine kinase is 943 U/L.\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out what's causing these symptoms. The options are amphetamine intoxication, bacterial meningitis, delirium tremens, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n\nFirst, let's consider amphetamine intoxication. Amphetamines can cause increased heart rate, high blood pressure, sweating, and agitation. They can also affect mental status, causing confusion or psychosis. But in this case, his sister mentioned he might have tried illicit drugs, but she wasn't specific. So, it's possible, but I need more information to confirm that.\n\nNext, bacterial meningitis. That's an infection of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, stiff neck, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. But in this case, the neck is supple, which suggests it's not stiff. That's a pretty key sign for meningitis, so maybe that's not it.\n\nThen there's delirium tremens. That's a severe withdrawal from alcohol, usually seen in people who have been drinking heavily for a long time and then stop or reduce their drinking abruptly. Symptoms can include confusion, agitation, tremors, hallucinations, and autonomic hyperactivity like tachycardia and hypertension. His sister said he drinks a lot, so that fits. But I need to see if he recently stopped drinking or reduced his intake.\n\nLastly, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). This is a serious side effect of neuroleptic medications, which are typically used to treat psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia. It's characterized by muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction like fever and tachycardia, altered mental status, and sometimes elevated creatine kinase levels. His sister mentioned he saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed medication for hearing voices, which could be antipsychotics, which are neuroleptics.\n\nSo, let's see which one fits best.\n\nHe has fever, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status. His creatine kinase is elevated at 943 U/L, which is about four times the upper limit of normal (usually up to around 250 U/L for males). His white blood cell count is also elevated at 15,600/mm3, which suggests some inflammatory process.\n\nLet me think about amphetamine intoxication again. While it can cause similar symptoms like fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and agitation, the muscle rigidity and elevated creatine kinase are less typical. Creatine kinase can be elevated in rhabdomyolysis, which can be caused by prolonged muscle activity or trauma, which might happen in severe intoxication with amphetamines if the person has been moving excessively. But it's not as classic a feature of amphetamine intoxication as it is in NMS.\n\nBacterial meningitis typically presents with a triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. But in this case, the neck is supple, which goes against the diagnosis of meningitis. So, that seems less likely.\n\nDelirium tremens can cause confusion, agitation, tremors, and autonomic hyperactivity, but again, muscle rigidity and elevated creatine kinase aren't typical features. Rhabdomyolysis can occur in severe alcohol withdrawal, especially if there's prolonged seizures or muscle activity, but it's not as common as in NMS.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome fits many of the symptoms: fever, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status. The elevated creatine kinase is also a common finding in NMS due to muscle breakdown from the rigidity.\n\nGiven that he recently started taking a neuroleptic medication prescribed by a psychiatrist for hearing voices, which is likely an antipsychotic drug, and considering the characteristic symptoms, NMS seems like the most plausible diagnosis.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there could be overlapping features or other possibilities.\n\nFor example, serotonin syndrome is another medication-induced condition that can cause similar symptoms, but it's typically associated with serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or other medications that increase serotonin levels. Since he was prescribed a neuroleptic, which primarily affect dopamine, serotonin syndrome seems less likely.\n\nAlso, heatstroke can cause fever, confusion, and muscle rigidity, but there's no indication that he was exposed to extreme heat or engaged in strenuous activity in hot conditions.\n\nAnother consideration is thyroid storm, which is an acute exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. It can cause fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and altered mental status. However, muscle rigidity and significantly elevated creatine kinase aren't typical features of thyroid storm.\n\nLet me also consider drug overdose or interaction. If he took an excessive amount of a neuroleptic medication, it could lead to similar symptoms, but that might be more accurately considered part of NMS.\n\nGiven all that, neuroleptic malignant syndrome still seems the most fitting diagnosis.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look at the diagnostic criteria for NMS. Typically, it includes:\n\n1. Recent initiation or increase in dose of a neuroleptic medication.\n\n2. Hyperthermia.\n\n3. Muscle rigidity.\n\n4. Altered mental status.\n\n5. Autonomic instability (like tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis).\n\n6. Laboratory abnormalities such as leukocytosis and elevated creatine kinase.\n\nThis patient meets all these criteria. He recently started a neuroleptic medication, has hyperthermia (39.1\u00b0C), muscle rigidity, altered mental status, autonomic instability, and laboratory abnormalities including leukocytosis and elevated creatine kinase.\n\nIn contrast, amphetamine intoxication might explain some symptoms but not all, particularly the muscle rigidity and elevated creatine kinase. Bacterial meningitis is less likely due to the lack of neck stiffness. Delirium tremens doesn't typically present with muscle rigidity and elevated creatine kinase.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
