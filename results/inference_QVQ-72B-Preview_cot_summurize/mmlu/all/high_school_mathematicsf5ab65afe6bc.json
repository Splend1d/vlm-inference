                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, when divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), equals 33. One of the integers is 45, and I need to find the smallest possible value of the other integer. The options are 165, 46, 45, and 9.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall the relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers. I think there's a formula that connects them. Oh, right! For two numbers a and b, it's known that LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b. That's a useful identity.\n\nSo, if I let the two numbers be a = 45 and b = x, where x is the other integer I'm trying to find, then I have LCM(45, x) * GCD(45, x) = 45 * x.\n\nBut the problem states that LCM(45, x) / GCD(45, x) = 33. So, combining these two equations, I can set up an equation like this:\n\nLCM(45, x) * GCD(45, x) = 45 * x\n\nAnd\n\nLCM(45, x) / GCD(45, x) = 33\n\nLet me denote GCD(45, x) as d. Then, LCM(45, x) would be 33 * d, from the second equation.\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n33d * d = 45 * x\n\nSo, 33d\u00b2 = 45x\n\nI can simplify this by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n11d\u00b2 = 15x\n\nNow, I need to solve for x in terms of d.\n\nSo, x = (11d\u00b2)/15\n\nSince x must be an integer, (11d\u00b2)/15 must be an integer. That means that 15 must divide 11d\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, 15 factors into 3 * 5. So, both 3 and 5 must divide into 11d\u00b2.\n\nBut 11 is prime, and 11 doesn't divide into 15, so 15 must divide d\u00b2.\n\nSince 15 = 3 * 5, both 3 and 5 must divide d.\n\nTherefore, d must be a multiple of both 3 and 5, so d must be a multiple of 15.\n\nLet me set d = 15k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation for x:\n\nx = (11*(15k)\u00b2)/15 = 11*15k*15k /15 = 11*15k\u00b2\n\nSo, x = 11*15k\u00b2 = 165k\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest possible integer x, which would correspond to the smallest possible k.\n\nSince k is a positive integer, the smallest k can be is 1.\n\nSo, x = 165*(1)\u00b2 = 165\n\nBut wait, 165 is one of the options, but there are other options smaller than that. So, is k necessarily 1, or could it be smaller?\n\nLet me check if k can be less than 1. Well, k is a positive integer, so k starts from 1 upwards.\n\nBut maybe there are smaller x values possible if I choose different k.\n\nWait, but according to this formula, x = 165k\u00b2, so for k=1, x=165; for k=2, x=660, which is larger, so 165 seems to be the smallest possible.\n\nBut looking at the options, there are smaller numbers like 46, 45, and 9. So, maybe k isn't necessarily 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my assumption that d = 15k is too restrictive.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nI had d = GCD(45, x), and d must be a multiple of 15 because 15 divides d.\n\nBut perhaps d can be a divisor of x that includes 15.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that d is a divisor of both 45 and x.\n\nGiven that 45 factors into 3\u00b2 * 5, and x must be such that d is a common divisor.\n\nFrom x = (11d\u00b2)/15, and d divides 45, since d is GCD(45, x).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that d is a divisor of 45.\n\nGiven that d must divide 45, and d must be a multiple of 15, as per earlier reasoning.\n\nSo, possible values of d are 15, 45.\n\nWait, why only 15 and 45? Are there others?\n\nWell, d must be a divisor of 45 and a multiple of 15.\n\nThe divisors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45.\n\nAmong these, multiples of 15 are 15 and 45.\n\nSo, possible d values are 15 and 45.\n\nLet me check both cases.\n\nFirst, d = 15.\n\nThen, x = (11*(15)^2)/15 = 11*15*15 /15 = 11*15 = 165\n\nNow, d = 45.\n\nThen, x = (11*(45)^2)/15 = 11*2025/15 = 11*135 = 1485\n\nBut 1485 is larger than 165, so the smallest x is 165.\n\nBut wait, the options include numbers smaller than 165, like 46, 45, and 9.\n\nIs there a possibility that d could be different?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet me double-check the relationship between LCM and GCD.\n\nWe have LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b, which is correct.\n\nGiven that LCM(45, x)/GCD(45, x) = 33, so LCM(45, x) = 33 * GCD(45, x).\n\nLet me denote GCD(45, x) as d, as before.\n\nThen, LCM(45, x) = 33d\n\nAnd since LCM(45, x) * GCD(45, x) = 45 * x, we have:\n\n33d * d = 45x \u21d2 33d\u00b2 = 45x \u21d2 x = (33d\u00b2)/45 = (11d\u00b2)/15\n\nSo, x must be an integer, so 15 must divide 11d\u00b2.\n\nSince 11 and 15 are coprime (their GCD is 1), and 15 divides 11d\u00b2, then 15 must divide d\u00b2.\n\nBut 15 = 3 * 5, both prime, so 3 and 5 must divide d\u00b2, hence 3 and 5 must divide d.\n\nTherefore, d must be a multiple of 15.\n\nSo, d can be 15, 30, 45, etc.\n\nBut d = GCD(45, x), and 45 = 3\u00b2 * 5, so d must be of the form 3^a * 5^b, where 0 \u2264 a \u2264 2 and 0 \u2264 b \u2264 1.\n\nSince d must be a multiple of 15, which is 3 * 5, b must be at least 1, and a at least 1.\n\nBut d must divide 45, so b can be at most 1, and a at most 2.\n\nTherefore, possible d values are 15 (3^1 * 5^1) and 45 (3^2 * 5^1).\n\nSo, d can only be 15 or 45.\n\nFor d = 15, x = (11*15^2)/15 = 11*15 = 165\n\nFor d = 45, x = (11*45^2)/15 = 11*135 = 1485\n\nSo, the smallest x is 165.\n\nBut the options include 46, 45, and 9, which are smaller than 165.\n\nIs there a mistake in my reasoning?\n\nLet me check if x = 45 is possible.\n\nIf x = 45, then GCD(45,45) = 45, and LCM(45,45) = 45.\n\nThen, LCM/GCD = 45/45 = 1, which is not equal to 33.\n\nSo, x = 45 is not a solution.\n\nSimilarly, x = 9: GCD(45,9) = 9, LCM(45,9) = 45, LCM/GCD = 45/9 = 5 \u2260 33.\n\nx = 46: GCD(45,46) = 1, LCM(45,46) = 45*46 = 2070, LCM/GCD = 2070/1 = 2070 \u2260 33.\n\nx = 165: GCD(45,165) = 15, LCM(45,165) = (45*165)/15 = 495, LCM/GCD = 495/15 = 33, which matches.\n\nSo, indeed, x = 165 is a valid solution, and the other options don't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer is 165.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]"
