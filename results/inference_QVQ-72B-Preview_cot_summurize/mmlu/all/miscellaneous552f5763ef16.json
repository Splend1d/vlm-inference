It says that people either love it or hate it, and those who love it read their favorite works and authors like chocolate addicts gulping down fudge truffles. The question is asking why the author compares certain readers to chocolate addicts. Let me see.\n\nOption A says it's to suggest that science fiction isn't a serious literary genre. Hmm, I don't think that's the case. Comparing readers to chocolate addicts seems more about describing their enthusiasm and passion for the genre, not about downplaying its seriousness. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B says it's to indicate the depth of certain readers' feelings about science fiction. That sounds plausible. The comparison to chocolate addicts who can't resist their craving suggests that these readers are really into it and can't get enough. It's like they're addicted to science fiction in the same way someone might be addicted to chocolate.\n\nOption C says it's to explain why some readers consider science fiction to be dangerous. Dangerous? That seems a bit of a stretch. Science fiction is generally seen as imaginative and speculative, not harmful. The comparison to chocolate addicts doesn't really suggest danger; it suggests enjoyment and perhaps overindulgence, but not something dangerous. So, probably not C.\n\nOption D says it's to contrast the characteristics of science fiction with those of other literary genres. Well, the passage does mention that some people avoid science fiction like poison, while others love it. But the comparison to chocolate addicts is specifically about the intensity of the readers' love for the genre, not about contrasting it with other genres. So, while there might be some contrast implied, I don't think that's the primary purpose of the comparison.\n\nBased on this, I think the best answer is B: indicate the depth of certain readers' feelings about science fiction. The comparison effectively conveys how strongly these readers feel about the genre, using the image of chocolate addicts who can't resist their favorite treat.\n\nLet me just double-check. Is there any other way to interpret this comparison? Maybe the idea that like chocolate, which can be addictive and sometimes unhealthy if overindulged, science fiction might also be something that can be overconsumed to the point of it being unhealthy. But the passage doesn't really suggest that. It just says that readers devour their favorite works like chocolate addicts, emphasizing their enthusiasm rather than any negative consequences.\n\nSo, I'm confident that B is the correct answer. The author uses the comparison to chocolate addicts primarily to indicate the depth of certain readers' feelings about science fiction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
