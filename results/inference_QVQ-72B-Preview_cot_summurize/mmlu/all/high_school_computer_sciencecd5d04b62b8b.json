What is x << 3 in Python 3?\" And the options are A. 1, B. 3, C. 8, D. 16.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what the << operator does in Python. I remember that << is a bitwise operator, specifically the left shift operator. It takes two numbers, shifts the bits of the first number to the left by the number of positions specified by the second number.\n\nSo, if x is 1, and I do x << 3, that means I'm shifting the bits of 1 to the left by 3 positions.\n\nNow, I need to represent 1 in binary. In binary, 1 is 0b1.\n\nWait, actually, in binary, 1 is just 0b1. But Python handles integers as binary behind the scenes, so 1 is 0b00000001 if we consider an 8-bit representation. But since Python integers can be of arbitrary precision, it's just the bit pattern representing the number.\n\nSo, shifting 0b1 to the left by 3 positions would mean adding three zeros to the right of 1, making it 0b1000, which is 8 in decimal.\n\nLet me verify that. 1 in binary is 0b1.\n\nShifting left by 1 position: 0b10, which is 2.\n\nShifting left by 2 positions: 0b100, which is 4.\n\nShifting left by 3 positions: 0b1000, which is 8.\n\nSo, according to this, x << 3 should be 8.\n\nBut let me check another way. I know that left shifting a number by n positions is equivalent to multiplying it by 2 to the power of n.\n\nSo, x << 3 = 1 << 3 = 1 * 2^3 = 1 * 8 = 8.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 8.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other context that might change this.\n\nIn Python 3, the << operator is indeed the left shift operator, and it works the same way as in other programming languages like C or Java, where it shifts bits to the left.\n\nAlso, Python's integer type can handle arbitrary precision, so there's no overflow or sign extension issue to worry about, unlike with fixed-size integers in some other languages.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
