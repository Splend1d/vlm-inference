                    "text": "So I have these two statements about groups of 2x2 matrices under multiplication, and I need to determine which ones are true. Let's start by understanding what a group is. A group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions are met: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.\n\nStatement 1 says that the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant forms a group under matrix multiplication. Let's see if this set satisfies all the group axioms.\n\nFirst, closure: if I take two 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinants and multiply them, will the result still have a nonzero determinant? Well, the determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of their determinants. So if both have nonzero determinants, their product will also have a nonzero determinant. So closure seems okay.\n\nAssociativity: matrix multiplication is associative, so that's fine.\n\nIdentity: the identity matrix is a 2x2 matrix with integer entries and determinant 1, which is nonzero. So it's in the set.\n\nInvertibility: for a matrix to be invertible, its determinant must be nonzero, which is already a condition in the set. So invertibility is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. The set consists of matrices with integer entries. When you multiply two matrices with integer entries, do you get another matrix with integer entries? Yes, because matrix multiplication involves only integer additions and multiplications, so the result will have integer entries. So far, so good.\n\nBut here's a potential problem: the set includes matrices with nonzero determinant, but determinants can be positive or negative. Now, in the context of groups, we need to ensure that the inverses are also in the set. Since determinants can be negative, let's consider the inverse of a matrix with a negative determinant. The inverse of a matrix A is (1/det(A))*adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A. If det(A) is negative, then (1/det(A)) is negative, which would scale the entries of adj(A), which are integers, by a negative integer, resulting in a matrix with integer entries. So, the inverse should still have integer entries.\n\nHowever, there's an issue with the determinant being nonzero but possibly equal to -1. If det(A) = -1, then det(A^{-1}) = 1/det(A) = -1, which is still nonzero, so the inverse is still in the set. Similarly, for any other nonzero determinant, as long as it's an integer, the inverse will have integer entries.\n\nBut wait, the determinant being nonzero and an integer means it's either 1, -1, or some other integer. However, in the set of all 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant, the determinant can be any nonzero integer.\n\nNow, the problem arises when the determinant is not \u00b11. For example, consider the matrix:\n\nA = [2 0]\n\n[0 1]\n\nIts determinant is 2, which is nonzero. Its inverse is (1/2)[1 0]\n\n[0 1] = [0.5 0]\n\n[0 1]\n\nThis inverse does not have integer entries, which violates the closure property because the inverse should be in the set if the set is to form a group.\n\nWait a minute, that's a problem. If I take a matrix with determinant 2, its inverse has non-integer entries, meaning that the inverse isn't in the set. Therefore, the set isn't closed under taking inverses, which violates one of the group axioms.\n\nLet me check another example to confirm. Take:\n\nB = [1 1]\n\n[0 2]\n\ndet(B) = 2.\n\nIts inverse is (1/2)[2 -1]\n\n[0 1] = [1 -0.5]\n\n[0 0.5]\n\nAgain, non-integer entries. So, this confirms that the set isn't closed under inverses unless the determinant is \u00b11.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false because the set doesn't satisfy the invertibility axiom.\n\nNow, moving on to statement 2: the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 forms a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nLet's check the group axioms for this set.\n\nClosure: if A and B are two matrices in this set, then det(AB) = det(A)det(B) = 1*1 = 1. So, the product has determinant 1, hence it's in the set.\n\nAssociativity: matrix multiplication is associative.\n\nIdentity: the identity matrix has determinant 1 and integer entries, so it's in the set.\n\nInvertibility: for a matrix A with det(A) = 1, its inverse A^{-1} has det(A^{-1}) = 1/det(A) = 1. Also, since A has integer entries and det(A) = 1, A^{-1} = adj(A), because adj(A) has integer entries (since A does), and det(A) = 1, so A^{-1} = adj(A). Since adj(A) has integer entries, A^{-1} has integer entries. Therefore, the inverse is in the set.\n\nSo, all group axioms are satisfied for statement 2, meaning it's true.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Let's test with an example.\n\nTake A = [1 2]\n\n[0 1]\n\ndet(A) = 1.\n\nIts inverse is [1  -2]\n\n[0    1]\n\nwhich has integer entries. So, it's in the set.\n\nAnother example: B = [0 1]\n\n[1 1]\n\ndet(B) = 0*1 - 1*1 = -1, which doesn't qualify for the set since we're considering determinant 1.\n\nWait, but the set specifies determinant 1, so B is not in the set.\n\nAnother example: C = [1 0]\n\n[1 1]\n\ndet(C) = 1*1 - 0*1 = 1.\n\nIts inverse is [1  0]\n\n[-1 1]\n\nwhich has integer entries, so it's in the set.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the inverses have integer entries and determinant 1.\n\nIs there any matrix with integer entries and determinant 1 where the inverse doesn't have integer entries? It seems not, because if det(A) = 1 and A has integer entries, then A^{-1} = adj(A), and adj(A) has integer entries since it's the transpose of the matrix of cofactors, each of which is an integer (since A has integer entries and det(A) = 1).\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. False, True.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nYes, D is False, True.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
