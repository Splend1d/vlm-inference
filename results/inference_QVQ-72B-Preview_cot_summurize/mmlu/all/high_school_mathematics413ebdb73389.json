                    "text": "So I have this quadratic expression: \\(3x^{2} + x - 4\\), and I need to express it in the form \\(a(x - h)^{2} + k\\). I'm supposed to find the value of \\(k\\). Let's see how to do this.\n\nFirst, I remember that expressing a quadratic in the form \\(a(x - h)^{2} + k\\) is called completing the square. This form is useful because it shows the vertex of the parabola, and \\(k\\) is the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\nBut before I start, I should note that the given quadratic is \\(3x^{2} + x - 4\\), and I need to factor out the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) to make the process easier. The coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) is 3, so I'll factor that out from the first two terms:\n\n\\[3x^{2} + x - 4 = 3(x^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}x) - 4\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me try again. Actually, to factor out the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\), I should write it as:\n\n\\[3x^{2} + x - 4 = 3(x^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}x) - 4\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses.\n\nI need to take the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), divide it by 2, and then square it. So:\n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\nNow, I need to add and subtract this value inside the parentheses to complete the square:\n\n\\[3\\left(x^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) - 4\\]\n\nWait, but I need to be careful here. Actually, since I'm factoring out a 3, I need to ensure that any addition or subtraction is done correctly inside the parentheses.\n\nLet me think again. When I have a factor outside like this, I need to add and subtract inside the parentheses, but because of the factor of 3, I have to account for that properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider completing the square without factoring out the coefficient initially. Let's try that.\n\nStarting over:\n\n\\[3x^{2} + x - 4\\]\n\nFirst, factor out the coefficient 3 from all terms:\n\n\\[3(x^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}x) - 4\\]\n\nNow, to complete the square inside the parentheses, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[x^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}x = \\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} = \\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{36}\\]\n\nTherefore, plugging back in:\n\n\\[3\\left(\\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{36}\\right) - 4\\]\n\nNow, distribute the 3:\n\n\\[3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - 3 \\times \\frac{1}{36} - 4\\]\n\nCalculate \\(3 \\times \\frac{1}{36}\\):\n\n\\[3 \\times \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}\\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{12} - 4\\]\n\nNow, subtract 4, which is \\(\\frac{48}{12}\\):\n\n\\[3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{48}{12} = 3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{49}{12}\\]\n\nSo, in the form \\(a(x - h)^{2} + k\\), this is:\n\n\\[a = 3, \\quad h = -\\frac{1}{6}, \\quad k = -\\frac{49}{12}\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(k\\) is \\(-\\frac{49}{12}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -\\frac{7}{12}\n\nB. -7\n\nC. 49\n\nD. -\\frac{49}{12}\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. -\\frac{49}{12}.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nStarting with \\(3x^{2} + x - 4\\):\n\n1. Factor out the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) from the first two terms: \\(3(x^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}x) - 4\\)\n\n2. Complete the square inside the parentheses: \\(x^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}x = \\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{36}\\)\n\n3. Distribute the 3: \\(3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{12}\\)\n\n4. Subtract 4: \\(3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{12} - 4 = 3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{49}{12}\\)\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, \\(k = -\\frac{49}{12}\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the value of \\(k\\) without considering the coefficient \\(a\\), but no, the standard form is \\(a(x - h)^{2} + k\\), so \\(k\\) should indeed be \\(-\\frac{49}{12}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. -\\frac{49}{12}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. -\\dfrac{49}{12}} \\]"
