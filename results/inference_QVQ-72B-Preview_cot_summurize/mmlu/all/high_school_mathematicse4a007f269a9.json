                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the sum of prime numbers between 100 and 200 that are either 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what that means.\n\nA perfect square is a number that can be expressed as n squared, where n is an integer. So, for example, 1 (1\u00b2), 4 (2\u00b2), 9 (3\u00b2), 16 (4\u00b2), and so on. If a number is 1 more than a perfect square, that would be something like 2 (1 + 1), 5 (4 + 1), 10 (9 + 1), etc. Similarly, if it's 2 more than a perfect square, it would be 3 (1 + 2), 6 (4 + 2), 11 (9 + 2), and so forth.\n\nBut wait, the problem specifies numbers between 100 and 200. So, I need to consider perfect squares that, when I add 1 or 2 to them, give me numbers in that range. That means I need to find perfect squares less than 200, and then add 1 or 2 to see if the result is a prime number between 100 and 200.\n\nFirst, let's list out the perfect squares less than 200:\n\n10\u00b2 = 100\n\n11\u00b2 = 121\n\n12\u00b2 = 144\n\n13\u00b2 = 169\n\n14\u00b2 = 196\n\nSo, these are the perfect squares in the relevant range.\n\nNow, for each of these, I'll add 1 and 2 to see if the resulting numbers are prime and fall between 100 and 200.\n\nStarting with 10\u00b2 = 100:\n\n100 + 1 = 101\n\n100 + 2 = 102\n\nNow, check if 101 and 102 are prime.\n\n101 is a prime number. Okay, that's one.\n\n102 is even, so it's divisible by 2. Not prime.\n\nNext, 11\u00b2 = 121:\n\n121 + 1 = 122\n\n121 + 2 = 123\n\n122 is even, divisible by 2. Not prime.\n\n123 is divisible by 3 (since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is divisible by 3). Not prime.\n\nMoving on, 12\u00b2 = 144:\n\n144 + 1 = 145\n\n144 + 2 = 146\n\n145 ends with 5, so it's divisible by 5. Not prime.\n\n146 is even. Not prime.\n\nNext, 13\u00b2 = 169:\n\n169 + 1 = 170\n\n170 is even. Not prime.\n\n169 + 2 = 171\n\n171 is divisible by 3 (1 + 7 + 1 = 9, which is divisible by 3). Not prime.\n\nLastly, 14\u00b2 = 196:\n\n196 + 1 = 197\n\n196 + 2 = 198\n\n197: let's check if it's prime. I think 197 is prime.\n\n198 is even. Not prime.\n\nSo, the candidates are 101 and 197.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other perfect square above 196 that's less than 200? Let's make sure. 15\u00b2 = 225, which is above 200, so no.\n\nBut hold on, maybe there are other perfect squares below 100 that, when we add 1 or 2, still get us into the 100-200 range. For example, 9\u00b2 = 81:\n\n81 + 1 = 82\n\n81 + 2 = 83\n\n82 is even, not prime.\n\n83 is prime, but it's less than 100. So, doesn't qualify.\n\nSimilarly, 8\u00b2 = 64:\n\n64 + 1 = 65\n\n64 + 2 = 66\n\n65 is divisible by 5.\n\n66 is even.\n\nNeither is prime and above 100.\n\n7\u00b2 = 49:\n\n49 + 1 = 50\n\n49 + 2 = 51\n\n50 and 51 are both not prime and below 100.\n\n6\u00b2 = 36:\n\n36 + 1 = 37\n\n36 + 2 = 38\n\n37 is prime, but less than 100.\n\n38 is even.\n\n5\u00b2 = 25:\n\n25 + 1 = 26\n\n25 + 2 = 27\n\n26 and 27 are not prime.\n\n4\u00b2 = 16:\n\n16 + 1 = 17\n\n16 + 2 = 18\n\n17 is prime, but less than 100.\n\n18 is even.\n\n3\u00b2 = 9:\n\n9 + 1 = 10\n\n9 + 2 = 11\n\n11 is prime, but less than 100.\n\n2\u00b2 = 4:\n\n4 + 1 = 5\n\n4 + 2 = 6\n\n5 is prime, but less than 100.\n\n1\u00b2 = 1:\n\n1 + 1 = 2\n\n1 + 2 = 3\n\nBoth are prime, but less than 100.\n\nSo, indeed, only 101 and 197 qualify.\n\nNow, I need to confirm that both are primes.\n\n101 is definitely prime.\n\n197 is also prime.\n\nSo, the sum is 101 + 197 = 298.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 102\n\nB. 298\n\nC. 256\n\nD. 300\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 298.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I missed some perfect squares or some numbers that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square and are prime in the 100-200 range.\n\nLet me double-check for any perfect squares that I might have missed.\n\nWe have perfect squares from 10\u00b2 to 14\u00b2, which are 100, 121, 144, 169, and 196.\n\nAdding 1 or 2 to each:\n\nFrom 10\u00b2:\n\n101 (prime)\n\n102 (not prime)\n\nFrom 11\u00b2:\n\n122 (not prime)\n\n123 (not prime)\n\nFrom 12\u00b2:\n\n145 (not prime)\n\n146 (not prime)\n\nFrom 13\u00b2:\n\n170 (not prime)\n\n171 (not prime)\n\nFrom 14\u00b2:\n\n197 (prime)\n\n198 (not prime)\n\nSo, only 101 and 197 qualify.\n\nSum is 101 + 197 = 298.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 298, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{298} \\]"
