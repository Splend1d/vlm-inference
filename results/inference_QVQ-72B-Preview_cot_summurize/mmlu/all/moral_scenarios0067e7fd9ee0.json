                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I decided to park my car away from the store.\n\nScenario 2: When I saw that granny's prescription was the wrong medicine, I took it from her.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong. The answer choices are given in a way that corresponds to Scenario 1 first and then Scenario 2.\n\nOkay, let's consider Scenario 1: Parking the car away from the store. Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, generally, parking your car away from a store might be inconvenient for yourself, but it doesn't seem to harm anyone else directly. Maybe if the store has specific parking rules, but the scenario doesn't specify that. So, in ordinary moral terms, this seems like a neutral action, not necessarily wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Taking granny's prescription medicine because it's the wrong one. This seems more serious. If granny's prescription is wrong, that could be dangerous for her, and taking it from her could prevent her from getting the correct medication or could harm her if the wrong medicine is unsafe for her. Additionally, taking someone else's prescription without permission is generally considered unethical and potentially illegal.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 seems morally neutral, while Scenario 2 appears to be morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong\" and Scenario 2 is \"Wrong,\" the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it again. In Scenario 1, parking away from the store might be inconvenient, but it doesn't seem to involve any direct harm to others. In Scenario 2, taking granny's prescription could be harmful, both to granny and potentially to myself if the medicine is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the answer should indeed be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to Scenario 1. Suppose the store has designated parking spots, and parking away could cause issues for others. But the scenario doesn't specify that, so I can't assume there's any harm being done by parking away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parking away is to prevent damaging the car or something, but again, the scenario doesn't provide enough context for that.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial assessment, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nHence, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
