                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to figure out how many three-digit positive integers there are. Let me start by understanding what a three-digit number is.\n\nFirst off, a three-digit number can't have any leading zeros because that would make it a two-digit or a one-digit number. So, the smallest three-digit number should be 100, and the largest should be 999. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to count how many whole numbers are there from 100 up to 999, inclusive. I remember that to find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and then add one. So, for example, from 100 to 999, it would be 999 minus 100, which is 899, and then adding one makes it 900. So, that would be 900 three-digit numbers.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I list out the first few numbers after 100, like 101, 102, up to 999, and count them, it should be 900. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be from 1 to 9 (since it can't be 0), and then the tens and units places can be from 0 to 9 each. So, the total number of three-digit numbers would be 9 options for the hundreds digit times 10 options for the tens digit times 10 options for the units digit. That also gives me 9 times 10 times 10, which is 900.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, I'm pretty confident that the correct number is 900.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 899\n\nB. 900\n\nC. 1000\n\nD. 999\n\nSo, option B. 900 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the question. The question is pretty clear: it's asking for the number of three-digit positive integers. No mention of even or odd numbers, or any other constraints, so I think I'm on the right track.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the total number of possible three-digit numbers. Since the first digit can't be zero, it has to be from 1 to 9, and the other two digits can be anything from 0 to 9. So, again, 9 times 10 times 10 equals 900.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it's a straightforward counting problem. So, I'm confident that the answer is 900, which is option B.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can visualize it. If I think about the number line, starting at 100 and ending at 999, and counting every integer in between, that's a range of 900 numbers. Yeah, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the number of three-digit numbers in each hundred. From 100 to 199, that's 100 numbers. Similarly, from 200 to 299, another 100, and so on, up to 900 to 999, which is also 100 numbers. So, 100 numbers per hundred, and there are nine hundreds (100s to 900s), plus the last 100 numbers from 900 to 999. Wait, no, actually, from 100 to 999, it's covering all nine hundreds from 100s to 900s, each with 100 numbers, totaling 900.\n\nWait, but in this way, it's still 900 numbers. So, everything points to 900 being the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each time, I end up with 900. So, I'm going to go with option B. 900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
