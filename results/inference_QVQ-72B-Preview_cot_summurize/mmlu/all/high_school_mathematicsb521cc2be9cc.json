                    "text": "Let's see. I need to find the greatest common factor of 252 and 96. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on finding the GCF, but I remember that I should list the factors of each number and then find the largest one that they share.\n\nFirst, let's list the factors of 252. Starting with 1 and the number itself:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 28, 36, 63, 84, 126, 252. I think that's all.\n\nNow, for 96:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96.\n\nOkay, now I need to find the common factors between these two lists. Let's list them again:\n\n252: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 28, 36, 63, 84, 126, 252.\n\n96: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96.\n\nCommon factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nSo, the greatest common factor is the largest number in this list, which is 12.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is 24, which is larger than 12. Did I miss something?\n\nLet me check again. Maybe I didn't list all the factors correctly.\n\nFactors of 252: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 28, 36, 63, 84, 126, 252.\n\nFactors of 96: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96.\n\nCommon factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nNo, 24 is not a factor of 252. So, 12 is correct.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to do this. I recall that the greatest common divisor (GCD) can be found using the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe that would be more accurate.\n\nLet's try the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 252 and 96.\n\nFirst, divide 252 by 96 and find the remainder.\n\n252 divided by 96 is 2 with a remainder of 60.\n\nSo, GCD(252, 96) = GCD(96, 60).\n\nNow, divide 96 by 60. 96 divided by 60 is 1 with a remainder of 36.\n\nSo, GCD(96, 60) = GCD(60, 36).\n\nNext, divide 60 by 36. 60 divided by 36 is 1 with a remainder of 24.\n\nSo, GCD(60, 36) = GCD(36, 24).\n\nNow, divide 36 by 24. 36 divided by 24 is 1 with a remainder of 12.\n\nSo, GCD(36, 24) = GCD(24, 12).\n\nDivide 24 by 12. 24 divided by 12 is 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the GCD is 12.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier using the list of factors. So, the greatest common factor is 12.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6\n\nB. 24\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 12\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 12.\n\nWait, but why is 24 not an option? Is there a possibility that 24 could be a factor of both numbers?\n\nFrom my earlier list, 24 is a factor of 96 but not of 252. Let me confirm:\n\n252 divided by 24 is 10.5, which is not an integer, so 24 is not a factor of 252.\n\nTherefore, 24 cannot be the greatest common factor because it's not a factor of 252.\n\nSo, the answer is indeed D. 12.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should check if 12 is indeed a factor of both numbers.\n\n252 divided by 12 is 21, which is an integer.\n\n96 divided by 12 is 8, which is also an integer.\n\nAnd since there's no larger number that divides both 252 and 96, 12 is the greatest common factor.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now that the answer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
