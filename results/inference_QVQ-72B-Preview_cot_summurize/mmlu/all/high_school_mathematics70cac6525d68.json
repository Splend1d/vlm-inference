                    "text": "So I've got this problem about purifying water in a tank. It says that the rate at which the purification process removes contaminants is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining. That sounds like a typical exponential decay situation, right? Because the removal rate depends on how much is left.\n\nLet me see. If 20% of the contaminant is removed in the first minute, that means that after one minute, 80% of the contaminant is still there. Wait, no. Actually, if 20% is removed, then 80% remains. So, the remaining contaminant is 80%.\n\nNow, the problem states that 98% of the contaminant must be removed to make the water safe. So, we need to find out how long it takes for the remaining contaminant to be 2% of the original amount.\n\nSince the removal rate is proportional to the amount remaining, this suggests that the process follows an exponential decay model. So, the remaining contaminant R after time t can be expressed as:\n\nR = R\u2080 * (k)^t\n\nWhere R\u2080 is the initial amount of contaminant, and k is the ratio of remaining contaminant each minute.\n\nFrom the first minute, we know that R = 0.8 * R\u2080. So, k = 0.8 for t = 1 minute.\n\nWait a second, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nIf the rate is proportional to the amount remaining, that implies a differential equation:\n\ndR/dt = -c * R\n\nWhere c is a constant of proportionality, and the negative sign indicates removal.\n\nSolving this differential equation, we get:\n\nR(t) = R\u2080 * e^(-c*t)\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of half-life or some other decay rate.\n\nGiven that after 1 minute, 80% remains, we can set up the equation:\n\nR(1) = R\u2080 * e^(-c*1) = 0.8 * R\u2080\n\nSo, e^(-c) = 0.8\n\nTherefore, -c = ln(0.8)\n\nC = -ln(0.8) \u2248 0.2231 per minute\n\nNow, we want to find t such that R(t) = 0.02 * R\u2080\n\nSo,\n\n0.02 * R\u2080 = R\u2080 * e^(-0.2231*t)\n\nDivide both sides by R\u2080 (assuming R\u2080 \u2260 0):\n\n0.02 = e^(-0.2231*t)\n\nTake natural log on both sides:\n\nln(0.02) = -0.2231*t\n\nT = ln(0.02) / (-0.2231) \u2248 (-3.912) / (-0.2231) \u2248 17.54 minutes\n\nSo, approximately 18 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is 18 min.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, confirm the value of c:\n\nC = -ln(0.8) \u2248 0.2231 per minute. That seems correct.\n\nThen, setting R(t) = 0.02 * R\u2080:\n\n0.02 = e^(-0.2231*t)\n\nTaking ln:\n\nLn(0.02) = -0.2231*t\n\nLn(0.02) \u2248 -3.912\n\nSo, t = -3.912 / -0.2231 \u2248 17.54 minutes.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, that's 18 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of half-life, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nWait, the half-life would be the time it takes for half the contaminant to remain, but in this case, the removal rate is proportional to the amount remaining, which is similar to exponential decay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nR(t) = R\u2080 * (1 - removal percentage)^t\n\nWhere t is time in minutes.\n\nGiven that 20% is removed in the first minute, so 80% remains, as I had before.\n\nThen, set R(t) = 0.02 * R\u2080\n\nSo,\n\n0.02 = 0.8^t\n\nTake natural log:\n\nLn(0.02) = t * ln(0.8)\n\nT = ln(0.02) / ln(0.8) \u2248 (-3.912)/(-0.2231) \u2248 17.54 minutes\n\nSame result as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 18 minutes, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if the removal is compounding continuously or discretely.\n\nIn the above calculation, I assumed continuous removal, modeled by the exponential decay equation.\n\nBut perhaps the process removes a constant percentage each minute, like discrete compounding.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nIf 20% is removed each minute, then the remaining contaminant after each minute is 80% of the previous amount.\n\nSo, R(t) = R\u2080 * (0.8)^t\n\nWhere t is in minutes.\n\nSet R(t) = 0.02 * R\u2080\n\nSo,\n\n0.02 = 0.8^t\n\nTake natural log:\n\nLn(0.02) = t * ln(0.8)\n\nT = ln(0.02) / ln(0.8) \u2248 (-3.912)/(-0.2231) \u2248 17.54 minutes\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the removal is not 20% each minute, but rather 20% is removed in the first minute.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"20% of the contaminant can be removed during the first minute of the process.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the removal rate is such that in the first minute, 20% is removed, meaning 80% remains.\n\nBut is the removal rate constant each minute, removing 20% each minute, or is it proportional to the amount remaining?\n\nThe problem says, \"the rate at which a purification process can remove contaminants from a tank of water is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining.\"\n\nSo, it's proportional to the amount remaining, which suggests an exponential decay model.\n\nTherefore, the remaining contaminant decreases by a factor of the remaining percentage each minute.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model it using differential equations.\n\nLet\u2019s set up the differential equation:\n\nDifferential equation: dR/dt = -k * R\n\nWhere R is the remaining contaminant, t is time in minutes, and k is a constant.\n\nSolving this equation:\n\nD[R, t] = -k*R\n\nSeparate variables:\n\nD[R]/R = -k dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\nLn|R| = -k*t + c\n\nAt t=0, R = R\u2080\n\nSo, Ln|R\u2080| = c\n\nThus,\n\nLn|R| = -k*t + Ln|R\u2080|\n\nExponentiate both sides:\n\n|R| = R\u2080 * e^(-k*t)\n\nGiven that at t=1, R = 0.8 * R\u2080\n\nSo,\n\n0.8 * R\u2080 = R\u2080 * e^(-k*1)\n\nThus,\n\n0.8 = e^(-k)\n\nTake natural log:\n\nLn(0.8) = -k\n\nTherefore,\n\nK = -Ln(0.8) \u2248 0.2231 per minute\n\nNow, we want R = 0.02 * R\u2080\n\nSo,\n\n0.02 * R\u2080 = R\u2080 * e^(-0.2231*t)\n\nDivide both sides by R\u2080:\n\n0.02 = e^(-0.2231*t)\n\nTake natural log:\n\nLn(0.02) = -0.2231*t\n\nT = Ln(0.02)/(-0.2231) \u2248 17.54 minutes\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, that's 18 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 18 min.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the process removes 20% each minute, meaning it removes 20% of the remaining contaminant each minute, then the remaining contaminant after each minute is 80% of the previous amount, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, R(t) = R\u2080 * (0.8)^t\n\nSet R(t) = 0.02 * R\u2080\n\nSo,\n\n0.02 = 0.8^t\n\nTake natural log:\n\nLn(0.02) = t * ln(0.8)\n\nT = ln(0.02)/ln(0.8) \u2248 17.54 minutes\n\nAgain, approximately 18 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 18 min.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{18 \\text{ min}}\\]"
