                    "text": "Let's tackle this division problem: 2,314 divided by 4. I need to find out what the quotient is, and there are options provided: A. 508, B. 508 r2, C. 578, D. 578 r2. I have to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should understand what division means. When we divide a number by another, we're essentially finding out how many times one number fits into another. Here, we're dividing 2,314 by 4, so I need to figure out how many times 4 fits into 2,314.\n\nI can start by performing the division step by step. Let's set up the division:\n\n```\n\n4 | 2,314\n\n```\n\nI'll begin from the leftmost digit. The first digit is 2, and 4 doesn't go into 2 because 4 is larger than 2. So, I'll look at the first two digits: 23.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many times 4 goes into 23. Let's see, 4 times 5 is 20, and 4 times 6 is 24. Since 24 is too big, 4 goes into 23 five times. I'll write down 5 as the first digit of the quotient.\n\nNext, I'll subtract 20 from 23, which leaves me with 3. Then, I bring down the next digit, which is 1, making it 31.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many times 4 goes into 31. 4 times 7 is 28, and 4 times 8 is 32. Since 32 is too big, 4 goes into 31 seven times. I'll write down 7 next to the 5 in the quotient.\n\nSubtract 28 from 31, which leaves me with 3. Then, I bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 34.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many times 4 goes into 34. 4 times 8 is 32, and 4 times 9 is 36. Since 36 is too big, 4 goes into 34 eight times. I'll write down 8 next to the 57 in the quotient.\n\nSubtract 32 from 34, which leaves me with 2. Since there are no more digits to bring down, this remainder of 2 is the final remainder.\n\nSo, the quotient is 578 with a remainder of 2. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 508\n\nB. 508 r2\n\nC. 578\n\nD. 578 r2\n\nBased on my calculations, the correct answer should be D. 578 r2.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should use another method to verify this. One way is to multiply the quotient by the divisor and add the remainder to see if I get the original number.\n\nSo, 578 times 4 is 2,312, and adding the remainder of 2 gives 2,314, which matches the original number. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use long division again but perhaps more carefully to ensure no mistakes.\n\nLet me try that again:\n\n```\n\n4 | 2,314\n\n- 0 | 2\n\nCan't divide, so look at 23.\n\n4 into 23 goes 5 times.\n\n5 * 4 = 20\n\n23 - 20 = 3\n\nBring down 1, making it 31.\n\n4 into 31 goes 7 times.\n\n7 * 4 = 28\n\n31 - 28 = 3\n\nBring down 4, making it 34.\n\n4 into 34 goes 8 times.\n\n8 * 4 = 32\n\n34 - 32 = 2\n\nNo more digits to bring down.\n\nSo, quotient is 578 r2.\n\nYes, consistent with the first attempt.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers a and b, with b \u2260 0, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 \u2264 r < |b|.\n\nIn this case, a = 2,314, b = 4.\n\nSo, 2,314 = 4 * q + r, with 0 \u2264 r < 4.\n\nFrom my earlier calculations, q = 578 and r = 2, which fits the condition.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's a possibility of a different quotient or remainder.\n\nSuppose I try q = 578 and r = 2: 4 * 578 = 2,312 + 2 = 2,314.\n\nAlternatively, if I try q = 579 and r = -2: 4 * 579 = 2,316, but then r = -2, which doesn't satisfy 0 \u2264 r < 4.\n\nThat's not acceptable, so q must be 578 with r = 2.\n\nAlternatively, q = 577 and r = 6: 4 * 577 = 2,308 + 6 = 2,314, but r = 6 is greater than 3, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, the only correct quotient and remainder are 578 and 2, respectively.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to confirm that the answer is D. 578 r2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 578\\ r2} \\]"
