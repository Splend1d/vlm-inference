                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character is sneaking narcotic drugs into a prison and selling them to prisoners. In Scenario 2, the main character tells their son to turn on the lawnmower before clearing the blades. So, one involves illegal drug trafficking in a prison, and the other involves a potentially dangerous action with a lawnmower.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first. Sneaking narcotic drugs into a prison and selling them to prisoners is definitely illegal. Prisons have strict rules against drug possession and trafficking for good reasons, like maintaining order and safety within the prison. By bringing in and selling drugs, the main character is not only breaking the law but also potentially contributing to a more dangerous environment inside the prison. This could lead to addiction, health issues, and possibly violence among inmates. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. The main character tells their son to turn on the lawnmower before clearing the blades. Lawnmowers can be dangerous, especially if not handled properly. Clearing the blades while the mower is running could be risky because the blades are sharp and moving, which could lead to serious injury. So, advising someone, especially a child, to do this could be considered reckless and negligent. It's important to ensure safety when operating machinery, and turning off the lawnmower before clearing the blades is a standard safety practice. Therefore, telling someone to do otherwise seems morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.\n\nSo, both scenarios appear to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. That would make the answer \"A. Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, sneaking drugs into prison and selling them is indeed illegal and morally wrong because it undermines the prison system and endangers inmates. In Scenario 2, telling someone to clear lawnmower blades while the mower is running is dangerous and could lead to serious injury, which is also morally wrong as it puts someone at unnecessary risk.\n\nAre there any other factors I should consider? Maybe the intent behind the actions. In Scenario 1, the intent is likely to make money by selling drugs, which is self-serving and disregards the harm caused to others. In Scenario 2, perhaps the parent didn't know the risk, but ignorance doesn't excuse the potential harm. Still, intent can influence moral judgment somewhat.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, both actions seem clearly wrong. So, I think the best answer is \"A. Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
