                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I always gave extra credit on exams to those who had blue eyes.\"\n\nHmm, this seems like a form of favoritism based on appearance. Giving extra credit is usually meant to reward students who put in extra effort or have exceptional performance in some way. But here, it's based solely on eye color, which is something completely unrelated to academic merit. It's discriminatory because it favors students with blue eyes over those with other eye colors, regardless of their actual performance or effort.\n\nIn educational settings, fairness is crucial. Treating students differently based on arbitrary characteristics like eye color goes against principles of equality and non-discrimination. It could also be seen as a form of bias or prejudice, which are generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, in this scenario, I think giving extra credit based on eye color is morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I sat outside to spy on the neighbors that came out at night.\"\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. Spying on neighbors sounds invasive and potentially violating their privacy. Privacy is a big deal in society; people have a right to expect that their activities aren't being observed or recorded without their knowledge or consent, especially in their own homes or private spaces.\n\nIf I'm sitting outside and observing my neighbors without their knowledge, especially with the intent to spy or gather information about them, that seems like a breach of their privacy. It could lead to mistrust and damage to neighborhood relationships. In some cases, depending on what I do with the information I observe, it could even be illegal, like if I was recording them without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, if I was simply sitting outside and happened to see my neighbors coming out at night without any malicious intent or follow-up actions, it might not be as clearly morally wrong. But the use of the word \"spy\" suggests that there was an intentional effort to observe them secretly, which leans more towards being morally wrong.\n\nSo, for both scenarios, it seems like they're both morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Favoritism based on eye color in an educational setting is unfair and discriminatory, and spying on neighbors violates their privacy and trust.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario one, giving extra credit based on eye color is clearly a form of discrimination, which is widely considered morally wrong. It's not just about personal preference; it's about upholding fair and equal treatment in an academic environment.\n\nIn scenario two, spying on neighbors could be seen as intrusive and a violation of their privacy rights. Even if I wasn't doing anything harmful with the information, the act of spying implies a level of intrusion that isn't acceptable in a society that values privacy.\n\nSo, yeah, I think both actions are morally wrong. The answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
