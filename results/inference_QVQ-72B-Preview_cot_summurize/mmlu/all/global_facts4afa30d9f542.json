Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact number, but I think that electricity access has been increasing over the years due to improvements in technology and infrastructure. Maybe I can recall some data or trends to help me make an educated guess.\n\nI remember that in 2010, the United Nations set the Sustainable Development Goal 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. That suggests that in 2010, not everyone had access to electricity, and they set a goal to achieve universal access by 2030. So, if the goal is to reach 100% by 2030, it implies that in 2017, which is seven years before the target date, the percentage should be closer to 90% rather than 60% or 70%.\n\nAlso, I recall that in 2015, the global electricity access rate was around 85%, according to some reports. So, if that's the case, then by 2017, it might have increased slightly, but probably not up to 90% yet. Maybe around 87% or so. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact figure.\n\nLet me think about the progress in electricity access. Historically, electricity access has been expanding steadily. In the early 2000s, the global electrification rate was around 70%, and by 2010, it had increased to about 80%. So, following that trend, by 2017, it would likely be higher than 80%, perhaps around 85% to 90%.\n\nI also know that many countries, especially developing nations, have made significant strides in improving electricity access through grid extensions and off-grid solutions like solar home systems. This would contribute to an increase in the percentage of people with electricity access.\n\nConsidering all this, I think that 80% is a plausible answer. It's in line with the trends I recall, and it's consistent with the progress made towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWait a minute, but I also remember hearing that in some regions, like sub-Saharan Africa, electricity access is still quite low, with many people lacking access. However, even with that in mind, the global average should still be higher due to higher access rates in other regions.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that population growth can affect electricity access rates. As populations grow, especially in areas without reliable electricity, it can be challenging to keep up with the demand for new connections. But technological advancements and renewable energy solutions have helped mitigate this issue in many places.\n\nI think I'll stick with 80% as my answer. It seems reasonable based on the trends and goals I'm aware of.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80\\%} \\]"
