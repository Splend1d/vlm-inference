                    "text": "Let's see. The water level in a bay changes like a sine wave, right? So, it's sinusoidal. There's a high tide at 8 A.M. today, 15 feet, and a low tide at 2 P.M., 3 feet. I need to find out how fast the water level was dropping at noon today. Okay, so first things first, I need to model this situation with a sinusoidal function and then find the derivative at noon to find the rate of change.\n\nAlright, so general sinusoidal function is something like y = a sin(b(x - c)) + d, where a is the amplitude, b affects the period, c is the phase shift, and d is the vertical shift.\n\nFirst, I need to find the amplitude. The high tide is 15 feet, and the low tide is 3 feet. So, the amplitude is (15 - 3)/2 = 6 feet.\n\nNext, the vertical shift. That should be the average of the high and low tides, which is (15 + 3)/2 = 9 feet.\n\nNow, the period. The tide goes from high to low in 6 hours, which is half a cycle. So, the full period is 12 hours.\n\nSo, the period is 12 hours. The general formula for period is 2\u03c0/b, so 2\u03c0/b = 12, which means b = 2\u03c0/12 = \u03c0/6.\n\nNow, I need to find the phase shift. The high tide is at 8 A.M., which is the maximum of the sine function. Normally, sine is at its maximum at \u03c0/2. So, if I let x be the time in hours since midnight, then at x = 8, the function should be at its maximum.\n\nWait, but the high tide is at 8 A.M., which is 8 hours after midnight. So, if I set x=0 at midnight, then at x=8, y should be at its maximum, which is 15 feet.\n\nSo, the phase shift c should be such that 8 - c = \u03c0/2. So, c = 8 - \u03c0/2.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nActually, in the general sine function y = a sin(b(x - c)) + d, the phase shift is c, which represents the horizontal shift from the standard sine function.\n\nSo, if the standard sine function has its maximum at \u03c0/2, and in our case, the maximum occurs at x=8, then the phase shift c should be such that b(x - c) = \u03c0/2 when x=8.\n\nGiven that b=\u03c0/6, then \u03c0/6*(8 - c) = \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, 8 - c = (\u03c0/2)/(\u03c0/6) = 3.\n\nTherefore, c = 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nSo, c = 5.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought c = 8 - \u03c0/2, but \u03c0/2 is approximately 1.57, so 8 - 1.57 = 6.43, which is not 5. Hmm, I must have messed up there.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The phase shift c is the horizontal shift of the sine function. If the standard sine function is at its maximum at \u03c0/2, and our function has its maximum at x=8, then the phase shift c should be such that b(x - c) = \u03c0/2 when x=8.\n\nSo, b(x - c) = \u03c0/2 at x=8.\n\nGiven b=\u03c0/6, then \u03c0/6*(8 - c) = \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, 8 - c = (\u03c0/2)/(\u03c0/6) = 3.\n\nTherefore, c = 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nOkay, so c=5.\n\nSo, the function is y = 6 sin(\u03c0/6 (x - 5)) + 9.\n\nNow, I need to find the rate of change at noon, which is x=12.\n\nFirst, find y' = dy/dx, which is the derivative of y with respect to x.\n\ny = 6 sin(\u03c0/6 (x - 5)) + 9\n\nSo, y' = 6 * cos(\u03c0/6 (x - 5)) * (\u03c0/6) = 6*(\u03c0/6)*cos(\u03c0/6 (x - 5)) = \u03c0 cos(\u03c0/6 (x - 5))\n\nNow, at x=12, y' = \u03c0 cos(\u03c0/6 (12 - 5)) = \u03c0 cos(\u03c0/6 * 7) = \u03c0 cos(7\u03c0/6)\n\nNow, cos(7\u03c0/6) = -\u221a3/2\n\nSo, y' = \u03c0*(-\u221a3/2) = -\u03c0\u221a3/2\n\nNow, the question is asking for the rate at which the water level is dropping at noon. Since it's dropping, the rate should be negative, meaning the water level is decreasing.\n\nSo, the magnitude is \u03c0\u221a3/2 feet per hour.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. \u03c0\u221a3/2\n\nC. 3\u221a3\n\nD. \u03c0\u221a3\n\nSo, option B matches my answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, amplitude is (15 - 3)/2 = 6, correct.\n\nVertical shift is (15 + 3)/2 = 9, correct.\n\nPeriod is 12 hours, so b = 2\u03c0/12 = \u03c0/6, correct.\n\nPhase shift: high tide at x=8, standard sine max at \u03c0/2, so 8 - c = \u03c0/2 \u21d2 c = 8 - \u03c0/2 \u2248 8 - 1.57 = 6.43, but earlier calculation gave c=5. There's inconsistency here.\n\nWait, perhaps I did miscalculate c.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nThe general sine function is y = a sin(b(x - c)) + d.\n\nThe high tide is at x=8, which corresponds to the maximum of the sine function.\n\nThe standard sine function has its maximum at \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, if x=8 corresponds to \u03c0/2 in the argument of sine, then b(x - c) = \u03c0/2 when x=8.\n\nGiven b=\u03c0/6, then \u03c0/6*(8 - c) = \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, 8 - c = (\u03c0/2)/(\u03c0/6) = 3.\n\nTherefore, c = 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nSo, c=5 is correct.\n\nNow, y' = \u03c0 cos(\u03c0/6 (x - 5))\n\nAt x=12, y' = \u03c0 cos(\u03c0/6 (12 - 5)) = \u03c0 cos(7\u03c0/6) = \u03c0*(-\u221a3/2) = -\u03c0\u221a3/2.\n\nSo, the rate is -\u03c0\u221a3/2 feet per hour, meaning the water level is dropping at that rate at noon.\n\nSince the question asks for the speed, which is the magnitude, it's \u03c0\u221a3/2 feet per hour.\n\nBut looking back, maybe the units are in feet per hour, and the options are given without direction, so perhaps they're considering only positive values.\n\nBut in any case, the rate is \u03c0\u221a3/2 feet per hour downward.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. \u03c0\u221a3/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{2}} \\]"
