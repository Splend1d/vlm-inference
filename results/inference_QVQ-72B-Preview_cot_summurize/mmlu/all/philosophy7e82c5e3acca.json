                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Augustine thought about lying. The options are:\n\nA. Often permissible if done for the right reasons.\n\nB. Not evil in itself, although it can have bad consequences.\n\nC. Permissible only in very rare circumstances.\n\nD. Never permissible.\n\nI know that Augustine was a big thinker in Christianity, and he had pretty strong views on morality. I remember that he emphasized the importance of truth and honesty, so maybe lying isn't something he would approve of.\n\nOption A says that lying is often permissible if done for the right reasons. That sounds a bit like the idea that the ends justify the means, which is a common ethical argument. But I think Augustine was more of a deontologist; he believed in doing what's right regardless of the outcomes.\n\nOption B says that lying isn't evil in itself but can have bad consequences. This seems similar to saying that lying might not be inherently wrong, but it's the results that make it bad. Again, that feels more consequentialist than what I think Augustine would believe.\n\nOption C says that lying is permissible only in very rare circumstances. This suggests that generally, lying is bad, but there might be exceptions. Maybe in extreme situations, like to save someone's life, lying could be allowed.\n\nOption D is straightforward: never permissible. This would mean that no matter what, lying is always wrong.\n\nI think Augustine was pretty strict about lying. He believed that truth is a fundamental value, and lying goes against that. So, he probably thought that lying is always wrong, without exceptions.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where lying could save someone's life? Like, if a murderer is chasing someone, and you lie to the murderer to protect the person, is that permissible? I think Augustine would say no, that you should still tell the truth, even if it risks someone's life.\n\nThat seems really harsh, but I think that's his position. He might argue that God will take care of the situation, and it's not our place to lie, even with good intentions.\n\nLet me check a quick source to confirm. I recall that in his Confessions, Augustine talks about lying and truth-telling. He writes that truth is a virtue and that lying is a sin, no matter the intention.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like he would choose option D: never permissible.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another perspective. Some people might argue that in certain situations, lying is acceptable. For example, to protect someone's feelings or to avoid harm. But I don't think Augustine would agree with that.\n\nHe might say that lying is always wrong because it goes against God's command to tell the truth. He believed that truth is an absolute value, and lying compromises that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think Augustine's view is that lying is never permissible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
