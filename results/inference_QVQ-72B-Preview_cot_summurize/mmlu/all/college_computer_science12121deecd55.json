                    "text": "So I need to figure out which of these undirected graphs must have an Euler circuit. I remember that an Euler circuit is a path that goes through every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. There are some rules about when a graph has an Euler circuit, right? Something about all vertices having even degree?\n\nLet me recall Euler's theorem for Eulerian circuits. Oh, yes: a connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree. And the graph has an Euler path (but not necessarily a circuit) if exactly two vertices have odd degrees.\n\nSo, first things first, the graph needs to be connected. All the options here are complete graphs or trees, which are connected, so that should be fine.\n\nOption I is a complete graph with 12 vertices. Let's think about complete graphs. In a complete graph with n vertices, each vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, the degree of each vertex is n-1.\n\nFor n=12, each vertex has degree 11. Wait, 11 is odd. So, in this case, each vertex has odd degree. According to Euler's theorem, this graph cannot have an Euler circuit because not all vertices have even degree. In fact, none of them do.\n\nOption II is a complete graph with 13 vertices. Similarly, each vertex has degree 12. 12 is even, so all vertices have even degree. According to Euler's theorem, this graph must have an Euler circuit.\n\nOption III is a tree with 13 vertices. Trees are connected graphs with no cycles. In trees, the number of edges is always one less than the number of vertices. So, a tree with 13 vertices has 12 edges.\n\nNow, in trees, the number of vertices with odd degree is either zero or two. I think it's a theorem that in any graph, the sum of degrees is twice the number of edges, and also, the number of vertices with odd degree is even. In trees, since there are no cycles, typically, there are at most two vertices with odd degree.\n\nBut in this case, since the tree has 13 vertices, which is odd, and it's a tree, I need to think about its degrees. Wait, in a tree, the number of vertices with degree greater than 1 is less than the total number of vertices. Actually, in a tree, there are always at least two leaves, i.e., vertices of degree 1.\n\nSo, in a tree with 13 vertices, there are at least two vertices with degree 1. Now, what about the others? The remaining 11 vertices could have degrees ranging from 1 to 12, but in a tree, the maximum degree is n-1, which is 12.\n\nBut to have an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degree. Since we already have at least two vertices with degree 1, which is odd, this tree cannot have an Euler circuit.\n\nWait, but maybe there are trees where all vertices have even degree except for two. No, because in any tree, the number of vertices with odd degree is either zero or two. But in this case, since there are at least two leaves, which have odd degree, there are at least two odd-degree vertices, and unless there are exactly two, which would be the case if all other vertices have even degree.\n\nBut in a tree with more than two vertices, it's impossible for all vertices except two to have even degree. Wait, no, in a star tree, for example, you have one central vertex connected to all others, which are leaves. So, in a star with, say, 13 vertices, one vertex has degree 12, and the other 12 have degree 1. So, in that case, there are 12 vertices with odd degree and one with even degree. Since there are more than two vertices with odd degree, it doesn't satisfy the condition for an Euler circuit.\n\nTherefore, a tree with 13 vertices cannot have an Euler circuit because it will have at least two vertices with odd degree, and usually more.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Option I: complete graph with 12 vertices \u2013 degrees are 11, which is odd. No Euler circuit.\n\n- Option II: complete graph with 13 vertices \u2013 degrees are 12, which is even. Euler circuit exists.\n\n- Option III: tree with 13 vertices \u2013 has at least two vertices with odd degree. No Euler circuit.\n\nTherefore, only option II must have an Euler circuit.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, it should be B. II only.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, B. II only is correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there a possibility that in a complete graph with 13 vertices, some edges are traversed more than once in a circuit? No, because an Euler circuit must use each edge exactly once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph isn't connected, but no, complete graphs are connected.\n\nOr maybe the tree could have all even degrees? Wait, in a tree, if it has all even degrees, that would imply that it's Eulerian, but as I thought earlier, in trees, having all even degrees is only possible if the tree is a single edge, which is a tree with two vertices and one edge. But here, we have 13 vertices, so that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion stands: only option II has an Euler circuit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
