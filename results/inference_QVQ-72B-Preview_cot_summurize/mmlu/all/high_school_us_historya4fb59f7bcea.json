During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Logan's Address from 1774, and it's asking how a sympathetic reader in the early years of the United States would most likely feel about Indian policies based on this speech. The options are:\n\nA. Exterminating all Indians\n\nB. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty\n\nC. Encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico\n\nD. Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways\n\nFirst, I need to understand Logan's Address to see what he's saying and what his perspective is. From the excerpt, Logan is talking about his relationship with white people and how he had been peaceful and helpful to them. He mentions providing food and clothing to whites in need and being known as a friend to them. But then something changed.\n\nLogan mentions that during a war, he stayed idle in his cabin advocating for peace. People knew him as someone who was friendly towards whites. However, he says that because of the actions of one man, Colonel Cresap, who murdered all of Logan's relations, including women and children, he sought revenge and has killed many in return. Now, he says he rejoices at the prospect of peace but isn't afraid anymore and won't turn away to save his life.\n\nSo, Logan is portraying himself as someone who wanted peace but was driven to violence by extreme tragedy and injustice. He's also asserting his bravery and lack of fear.\n\nNow, if someone is sympathetic to Logan's Address, they would probably understand his perspective and perhaps feel that his actions were justified given the horrific actions against his family.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the policy options:\n\nA. Exterminating all Indians \u2013 This seems extreme and unlikely to be supported by someone who sympathizes with Logan. Logan is presented as a reasonable and noble person who was pushed to revenge by extreme circumstances. Sympathetic readers wouldn't see all Indians as enemies but rather understand that there are good and bad people on both sides.\n\nB. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty \u2013 This seems aligns with respecting Logan's wishes and recognizing his right to live in peace without interference. If someone sympathizes with Logan, they might support policies that prevent future conflicts by respecting Indian lands and self-governance.\n\nC. Encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico \u2013 This seems like a policy of removal, which might not be sympathetic to Logan's desire to live on his ancestral lands. It could be seen as another form of displacement and injustice.\n\nD. Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways \u2013 This also sounds like a policy of forced assimilation and confinement, which might not align with respecting Logan's autonomy and wishes.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty seems to be the most consistent with sympathizing with Logan's Address. It honors his desire for peace and respect for his people's land and rights.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nCould a sympathetic reader also support D. Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways as a means to protect them and prevent future conflicts? Perhaps, but that seems condescending and paternalistic, implying that Indians need to be controlled and changed to fit into white society. That doesn't seem to align with respecting Logan's agency and autonomy.\n\nOption C. Encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico \u2013 This seems similar to the policies later in American history, like the Indian Removal Act, which forced tribes to relocate west of the Mississippi. That doesn't seem sympathetic in the context of Logan's Address, as it disregards his attachment to his homeland.\n\nOption A. Exterminating all Indians \u2013 This is clearly not sympathetic and is a policy of genocide, which would be at odds with any understanding or empathy towards Logan's perspective.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is B. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty. This choice aligns best with sympathizing with Logan's Address, recognizing his peaceful intentions and the injustices he suffered, and seeking to prevent such tragedies in the future by honoring Indian rights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
