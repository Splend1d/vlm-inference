She's planning an experiment with middle school kids: eighth graders get four extra hours of reading per week, seventh graders get two extra hours, and sixth graders get no extra reading. After a school year, they'll compare the mean GPAs from each group. The question is, is this a good experimental design?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what makes an experimental design good or bad. I remember that in experiments, we try to establish cause and effect relationships. So, in this case, the specialist wants to see if more reading causes better GPAs.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes.\n\nB. No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nC. No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.\n\nD. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, is this design capable of establishing a cause-and-effect relationship? In experimental design, randomization helps to assign subjects to different groups, which helps in minimizing bias and making the groups comparable. Here, it says that each group is an SRS, which stands for simple random sample. So, they're randomly selecting students for each group, which is good for reducing bias.\n\nBut wait, in an experimental design, it's even better to randomly assign students to the different reading time groups. Is that happening here? It says an SRS of 30 eighth graders get four extra hours, SRS of 30 seventh graders get two extra hours, and SRS of 30 sixth graders get no extra reading. So, it seems like the assignment is based on grade level, not random assignment within grades.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. It says \"an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours,\" etc. So, is it that within each grade, students are being randomly assigned to these reading conditions? Or is it that entire grades are being assigned different reading times?\n\nI think it's the latter, meaning that all eighth graders get four extra hours, all seventh graders get two extra hours, and all sixth graders get no extra reading. If that's the case, then grade level is being confounded with reading time, which could be a problem.\n\nLet me consider option D: No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n\nYes, that makes sense. If eighth graders are getting more reading time, seventh graders less, and sixth graders none, but grade level itself might affect GPA (maybe eighth graders have more challenging courses, or sixth graders are just starting middle school and haven't fully adjusted), then the differences in GPA could be due to grade level rather than the extra reading time.\n\nSo, option D seems plausible.\n\nOption B says that the design cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Well, if the design has random assignment, it should be able to establish cause and effect, assuming there are no other issues.\n\nBut in this case, since grade level is tied to the reading time, and grade level could affect GPA independently, there might be confounding.\n\nOption C mentions blinding and placebo effects. Blinding is usually important in experiments where subjective measures are involved, like taste tests or drug trials, where expectations can influence outcomes.\n\nIn this scenario, we're dealing with reading time and GPA, which are more objective measures. So, while blinding might be relevant if teachers knew which students were in which groups and could grade them differently, the question doesn't provide information about that. So, I'm not sure if option C is the best choice here.\n\nBetween options B and D, I think D is more directly relevant to the issue at hand. The design might show an association between reading time and GPA, but because grade level is confounded with reading time, it's possible that grade level is driving the differences in GPA, not the extra reading time.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n\nWait, but option B also seems relevant. It says that the design cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Well, if there's confounding, that's true, but option D is more specific about what the confounding variable is.\n\nI think being specific is better, so D is the better choice.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there are any other potential issues with the design.\n\nIs there any mention of controlling for prior GPA or other variables that might affect GPA? No, the description doesn't mention that.\n\nAlso, is there any consideration for the type of reading material or the context in which reading is done? No, it just says extra reading time.\n\nBut based on the options provided, D seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
