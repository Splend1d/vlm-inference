                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether certain actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong. The options are A: both are wrong, B: first is wrong and second is not, C: first is not wrong and second is wrong, or D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I knew Annie was allergic to flowers, so I gave her a bouquet of daisies.\"\n\nOkay, so Annie is allergic to flowers, and I gave her flowers anyway. That seems like a deliberate action that could cause harm to Annie because of her allergy. Allergies to flowers can range from mild to severe, and in some cases, they can be life-threatening. So, if I knew she was allergic and still gave her flowers, that could be seen as irresponsible or even malicious, depending on my intentions.\n\nBut, maybe I didn't think it through, or perhaps I thought it was a harmless gesture despite knowing about the allergy. Still, if I knew she was allergic and gave her something that could cause her harm, that seems pretty morally questionable.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I played the drums loudly in the basement.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. Playing drums loudly in a basement could be annoying to others, especially if it's late at night or if the walls are thin. But is it clearly morally wrong?\n\nWell, it depends on a few things. If I live alone and it's not bothering anyone, then it's probably not wrong. But if I have neighbors or family members who are being disturbed, then it might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, in terms of ordinary moral standards, playing drums loudly might be seen as a nuisance but not necessarily a clear moral wrong, unless it's causing significant harm or disruption.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves knowingly giving someone something they're allergic to, which could be harmful, while Scenario 2 involves making loud noise, which is more of a nuisance and may not cause direct harm.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBecause in Scenario 1, giving flowers to someone who is allergic when you know it could harm them is morally wrong, whereas playing drums loudly in the basement is more of a gray area and not clearly morally wrong unless it causes significant harm or disruption to others.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to consider. In Scenario 1, perhaps I didn't intend to harm Annie, but just wanted to make her happy, not realizing the severity of her allergy. Intentions can play a big role in moral judgments.\n\nHowever, even if I had good intentions, if I knew she was allergic and still gave her flowers, it's still a reckless action that could cause harm. So, I think it's still morally wrong, regardless of intent.\n\nIn Scenario 2, playing drums loudly could be seen as a personal choice that might annoy others but isn't necessarily morally wrong unless it's causing actual harm or violating some agreement about noise levels.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
