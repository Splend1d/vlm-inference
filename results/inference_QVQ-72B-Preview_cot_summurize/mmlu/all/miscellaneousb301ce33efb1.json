                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"On Valentine's Day 2000, NASA's NEAR spacecraft began a yearlong orbit of what asteroid? A. Eros, B. Cupid, C. Aphrodite, D. Venus.\"\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which asteroid the NEAR spacecraft orbited on Valentine's Day in 2000. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that NASA sends spacecraft to explore various celestial bodies, and asteroids are among them. The NEAR spacecraft stands for Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, which suggests that it was sent to study an asteroid that's relatively close to Earth.\n\nThe question mentions that this event happened on Valentine's Day in 2000, which is February 14th, 2000. So, I need to recall which asteroid was being orbited by the NEAR spacecraft on that specific date.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. Eros\n\nB. Cupid\n\nC. Aphrodite\n\nD. Venus\n\nWait a minute, Venus is not an asteroid; it's a planet. So, option D seems unlikely. Maybe it's a trick answer to test if I'm paying attention. So, I can probably eliminate Venus from my options.\n\nNow, between Eros, Cupid, and Aphrodite, which one is a real asteroid? Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that Eros is indeed an asteroid. It's a fairly well-known one, classified as an Amor asteroid, which crosses the orbit of Mars but stays mostly outside Earth's orbit. It's named after the Greek god of love, which makes sense for a Valentine's Day reference.\n\nCupid also sounds like it could be an asteroid, named after the Roman god of love. Similarly, Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love and beauty, and Venus is her Roman counterpart. But since Venus is already listed as a planet, and I've decided to eliminate it, that leaves Aphrodite as another possible option.\n\nHowever, I think Aphrodite might be more associated with Venus, the planet, rather than an asteroid. Maybe it's a moon or something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to recall if Eros was the target of the NEAR spacecraft. I think I've heard of the NEAR Shoemaker mission, which studied Eros. Wait, was that the same spacecraft?\n\nYes, NEAR was renamed NEAR Shoemaker in honor of the geologist Eugene Shoemaker after he passed away. I believe it was sent to study Eros, an asteroid that's about 21 miles long and 7 miles wide, or something like that.\n\nLet me verify some details. The NEAR spacecraft was launched in February 1996 and arrived at Eros in February 2000. Wait, that sounds familiar. So, if it arrived in February 2000, and the question mentions Valentine's Day 2000, which is February 14th, that seems plausible.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there were any other asteroids being studied around that time. Cupid, for instance, is another asteroid, but I don't recall any spacecraft orbiting it in 2000.\n\nAphrodite, on the other hand, is actually the name of a region on Venus, not an asteroid. So, that seems to rule out option C.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, it seems that Eros is the correct answer. The NEAR spacecraft began orbiting Eros on February 14th, 2000, which was Valentine's Day.\n\nJust to double-check, I can recall that the NEAR Shoemaker mission was a great success, providing valuable data and images of Eros, helping scientists understand more about asteroids and their composition.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer should be A. Eros.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Eros}} \\]"
