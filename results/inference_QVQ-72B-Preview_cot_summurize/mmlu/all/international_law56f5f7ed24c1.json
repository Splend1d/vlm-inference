                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out who can ask for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice, or ICJ. From what I understand, the ICJ can give advice on legal questions to certain parts of the United Nations. But I'm a bit confused about exactly who can request these opinions.\n\nOption A says that only the principal organs of the UN can request an advisory opinion. Those would be the Security Council, General Assembly, ECOSOC, Trusteeship Council, and the Secretariat. But I think there might be more to it than that.\n\nOption B says that all international organizations can request an advisory opinion. That seems pretty broad. I doubt that any international organization can just ask the ICJ for an opinion. There must be some limits or specific criteria.\n\nOption C seems more detailed. It says that the General Assembly and the Security Council can request advisory opinions on any legal question. Additionally, it mentions that \"other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies, which may at any time be so authorized by the General Assembly, may also request advisory opinions of the Court on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities.\" This sounds like there's a process where certain organizations can be authorized by the General Assembly to request opinions, but only on legal questions related to their work.\n\nOption D is interesting. It says that the principal organs of the UN can request an advisory opinion, as well as states that have been authorized by the General Assembly. Wait, but states are not typically part of the UN's organs. States are members of the UN, but they're not organs like the Security Council or General Assembly. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nLet me think again. The ICJ is part of the UN system, so it makes sense that the UN's main organs would have the right to request advisory opinions. The Security Council and General Assembly are definitely key players here. ECOSOC, the Economic and Social Council, also deals with a lot of legal issues in their\u9886\u57df, so it's possible they can request opinions too.\n\nBut what about other organs like the Trusteeship Council? I think the Trusteeship Council isn't very active anymore; it was more relevant during the decolonization period. I'm not sure if it still has the right to request advisory opinions.\n\nThe Secretariat, which is basically the administrative arm of the UN, might also need legal advice from time to time, so perhaps they can request opinions as well.\n\nOption B suggests that all international organizations can request an advisory opinion. That seems too inclusive. There are many international organizations that aren't part of the UN system, like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, which are separate entities. I don't think they can directly request advisory opinions from the ICJ.\n\nOption C seems to strike a better balance. It specifies that the General Assembly and the Security Council can request advisory opinions on any legal question. Moreover, it says that other UN organs and specialized agencies can request advisory opinions, but only on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities, and only if they're authorized by the General Assembly.\n\nThis makes sense because the General Assembly is the main legislative body of the UN and should have the authority to decide which organizations can request advisory opinions.\n\nOption D mentions that states can request advisory opinions if authorized by the General Assembly. But I thought that normally, only UN organs and specialized agencies can request advisory opinions. States can bring cases before the ICJ in disputes between states, but that's different from requesting an advisory opinion.\n\nWait, maybe there's an exception where states can request advisory opinions under certain circumstances, but I'm not sure. I think generally, only UN organs and specialized agencies can request advisory opinions, and even then, with authorization from the General Assembly.\n\nLet me check the Statute of the ICJ to be sure. According to Article 96 of the ICJ Statute, \"The General Assembly and the Security Council may request the Court to give advisory opinions on legal questions which may be referred to it by the General Assembly or the Security Council.\"\n\nFurthermore, Article 65 of the ICJ Statute states that \"The General Assembly and the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give advisory opinions on legal questions.\"\n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict itself. Article 96 mentions that the General Assembly and the Security Council may request advisory opinions, while Article 65 mentions the General Assembly and the Security Council specifically.\n\nActually, I think Article 96 is part of the UN Charter, not the ICJ Statute. Let me verify that.\n\nYes, Article 96 of the UN Charter provides that \"The General Assembly and the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give advisory opinions on legal questions.\"\n\nAdditionally, Article 65 of the ICJ Statute says, \"The General Assembly and the Security Council may request the International Court of Justice to give advisory opinions on legal questions.\"\n\nSo, clearly, the General Assembly and the Security Council have the right to request advisory opinions.\n\nBut what about other organs and specialized agencies? Option C mentions that they can request advisory opinions if authorized by the General Assembly.\n\nLooking back at the ICJ Statute, Article 66 states, \"Other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies, which may at any time be so authorized by the General Assembly, may also request advisory opinions of the Court on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities.\"\n\nSo, this confirms that only the General Assembly and the Security Council can request advisory opinions directly, but other UN organs and specialized agencies can do so if authorized by the General Assembly.\n\nThis means that ECOSOC, the Trusteeship Council, or the Secretariat, for example, could request advisory opinions, but only if the General Assembly gives them permission to do so.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most accurate.\n\nOption A is incomplete because it only mentions the principal organs of the UN, without specifying that other organs and specialized agencies can also request advisory opinions with authorization from the General Assembly.\n\nOption B is incorrect because not all international organizations can request advisory opinions; only those that are part of the UN system and authorized by the General Assembly.\n\nOption D is misleading because it suggests that states can request advisory opinions if authorized by the General Assembly, but according to the ICJ Statute, only UN organs and specialized agencies can request advisory opinions, with authorization from the General Assembly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nTo summarize, the General Assembly and the Security Council can request advisory opinions on any legal question, and other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies can request advisory opinions on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities, provided they are authorized by the General Assembly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
