                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Keiko is bird watching, and she counted a total of 76 birds in a day. The tricky part is that she counted 34 more birds in the morning than she did in the afternoon. I need to figure out how many birds she counted in the afternoon. The options are 21, 40, 42, or 84 birds.\n\nFirst, I should define what I'm dealing with. Let's say the number of birds she counted in the afternoon is \\(x\\). Since she counted 34 more birds in the morning, that means the morning count would be \\(x + 34\\). So, the total number of birds she counted in both the morning and the afternoon would be the sum of these two, which is \\(x + (x + 34) = 76\\).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[x + (x + 34) = 76\\]\n\nSimplifying that equation:\n\n\\[2x + 34 = 76\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(x\\). I'll subtract 34 from both sides:\n\n\\[2x = 76 - 34\\]\n\n\\[2x = 42\\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[x = 21\\]\n\nSo, the afternoon count is 21 birds. Let me just check if that makes sense.\n\nIf she counted 21 birds in the afternoon, then in the morning she counted \\(21 + 34 = 55\\) birds. Adding them up: \\(21 + 55 = 76\\), which matches the total number of birds she counted. Perfect!\n\nWait a minute, let's see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can set up the equations differently or use some other method to confirm my answer.\n\nLet\u2019s try using the options provided. Since the question asks for the number of birds counted in the afternoon, and I have \\(x = 21\\), I can check which option corresponds to this.\n\nOption A is 21 birds, which matches my calculation. But let's verify with the other options to ensure there's no better alternative.\n\nOption B is 40 birds. If afternoon count is 40, then morning count would be \\(40 + 34 = 74\\). Total birds would be \\(40 + 74 = 114\\), which doesn't match the total of 76. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption C is 42 birds. If afternoon count is 42, then morning count is \\(42 + 34 = 76\\). Total birds would be \\(42 + 76 = 118\\), which again doesn't match the total of 76. Not correct.\n\nOption D is 84 birds. If afternoon count is 84, then morning count is \\(84 + 34 = 118\\). Total birds would be \\(84 + 118 = 202\\), which is way more than 76. Definitely not correct.\n\nSo, based on this, option A, 21 birds, seems to be the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach that might lead to a different conclusion.\n\nPerhaps thinking in terms of averages might help. The total number of birds is 76, and she counted 34 more in the morning than in the afternoon. So, the difference between morning and afternoon counts is 34 birds, and their sum is 76 birds.\n\nI can set up the system of equations:\n\n1. \\( \\text{morning} = \\text{afternoon} + 34 \\)\n\n2. \\( \\text{morning} + \\text{afternoon} = 76 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1, substitute \\( \\text{morning} \\) in equation 2:\n\n\\( (\\text{afternoon} + 34) + \\text{afternoon} = 76 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 2 \\times \\text{afternoon} + 34 = 76 \\)\n\nSubtract 34 from both sides:\n\n\\( 2 \\times \\text{afternoon} = 42 \\)\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\( \\text{afternoon} = 21 \\)\n\nAgain, this confirms that the afternoon count is 21 birds.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the excess of 34 birds in the morning needs to be distributed somehow. Since the total is 76, and there's an extra of 34 in one direction, the afternoon count should be lower by half of that difference to balance out.\n\nWait, maybe using the concept of averages. The total is 76, and the difference is 34. If I think of the afternoon count as the lower number and morning as the higher, the difference is 34. So, the afternoon count is (total - difference)/2.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nAfternoon count = (76 - 34)/2 = 42/2 = 21 birds\n\nMorning count = (76 + 34)/2 = 110/2 = 55 birds\n\nAgain, this matches my previous results. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the afternoon count is x, and morning is x + 34, then:\n\nx + (x + 34) = 76\n\n2x + 34 = 76\n\n2x = 76 - 34\n\n2x = 42\n\nx = 21\n\nSame answer, 21 birds in the afternoon.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option A, 21 birds.\n\nJust to make sure, let's summarize:\n\n- Total birds: 76\n\n- Difference between morning and afternoon counts: 34\n\n- Afternoon count: 21 birds\n\n- Morning count: 55 birds\n\n- Sum: 21 + 55 = 76, which matches the total.\n\nEverything checks out. No discrepancies here.\n\nSo, the final answer is 21 birds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 21 \\text{ birds}} \\]"
