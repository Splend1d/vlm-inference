So, we have a state where the constitution gives the people of each municipality the power of referendum for all questions that the municipality can control through legislation. That sounds like the people can vote directly on certain decisions made by the city council or planning commission.\n\nNow, a real estate developer wants to change the zoning of some land to build a convalescent home. While his application is being considered, the city charter is amended by a popular vote to require that any changes in land use approved by the city council must also be approved by 55% of voters in a referendum. So, basically, the people get to have a say in zoning changes now.\n\nThe planning commission and the city council both say yes to the zoning change, but then the developer's application for the home is rejected because they didn't go through this new referendum process. The developer is upset and sues, asking the court to say that this charter amendment is invalid.\n\nThe question is, what will the court likely decide? Is the amendment unconstitutional or constitutional, and why?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Unconstitutional because it violates the real estate developer's due process rights.\n\nHmm, due process is about fair treatment through the normal judicial system, especially in regard to legal rights. Did the developer not get a fair hearing or something? Well, the developer's application was considered by the planning commission and the city council, so it went through the standard processes. But then there's this new referendum requirement. Maybe the developer argues that this new requirement was applied retroactively, affecting his property rights without proper notice or opportunity to be heard. That could be a due process issue.\n\nBut wait, the charter was amended by popular vote, which seems legitimate. And the requirement was put in place while the application was pending, but before the final approval. So, perhaps the developer should have known that changes could happen during the process. I'm not sure if due process is the right angle here.\n\nB. Unconstitutional because it's an unlawful delegation of legislative power to a regulatory body.\n\nThis one suggests that the city is passing off its legislative responsibilities to some other entity. But in this case, the charter amendment requires a referendum for land use changes approved by the city council. That means the final decision is being made by the voters directly, not by some regulatory body. So, it's actually giving more power to the people rather than delegating legislative power away. This option doesn't seem to fit.\n\nC. Constitutional as a valid exercise of the city's police power.\n\nPolice power is the government's authority to regulate for the health, safety, welfare, and morals of the public. Zoning regulations are typically seen as exercises of police power. So, requiring a referendum for zoning changes could be seen as a way to ensure that the community supports such changes, which aligns with looking out for the public's welfare.\n\nHowever, the state constitution specifically reserves the power of referendum to the people for legislative control questions. So, maybe there's a limit to how the city can use referendums. But generally, zoning is within the city's legislative purview, so allowing referendums on zoning changes could be seen as a valid exercise of police power.\n\nD. Constitutional as a valid exercise of a power reserved by the people to themselves.\n\nThis ties back to the state constitution, which reserves the power of referendum to the people for questions the municipality can control by legislation. Zoning changes are certainly within the municipality's legislative control. So, allowing the people to have a direct say via referendum on these changes seems consistent with the constitution's provision.\n\nMoreover, the city charter was amended by popular vote to include this requirement, which suggests that the people themselves decided to exercise their referendum power in this way.\n\nSo, between these options, D seems the most fitting. The court is likely to declare the amendment constitutional because it's an exercise of a power that the state constitution reserves to the people.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any reason why the amendment might be unconstitutional?\n\nWell, if the state constitution or other higher law prohibits such direct democracy measures, or if there are specific procedures that weren't followed in amending the city charter, that could be an issue. But from what's given, it seems that the people have the power to amend the city charter and to use referendums for legislative questions, which zoning changes are.\n\nAlso, the fact that the amendment was passed by popular vote adds weight to its legitimacy.\n\nSo, my best answer is D: constitutional, as a valid exercise of a power reserved by the people to themselves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
