                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand when to use chi-square tests. The question says that non-parametric tests are used for nominal or ordinal data or when assumptions of parametric tests are severely violated. And then there are four options about when chi-square tests are used. Let me see.\n\nOption A says it's used if research includes nominal (categorical) data. I know that chi-square is often used for categorical data, like comparing proportions in different categories. So, that sounds right.\n\nOption B says it's used for rank-ordered data with 2 IVs. Hmm, chi-square is typically for categorical data, not necessarily for ranked data. Maybe this is confusing. Perhaps it's referring to something like a chi-square test for independence with two categorical variables, but rank-ordered data might suggest ordinal variables. I need to think about that.\n\nOption C says when 2 correlated groups are being compared using rank-ordered data. This sounds more like a scenario for a test like the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which is for paired ordinal data, not chi-square. So, probably not chi-square here.\n\nOption D says used for an analysis of variance for rank-ordered data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is usually for parametric data, but there is a non-parametric equivalent called Kruskal-Wallis test for ordinal data with more than two groups. Chi-square isn't typically used for that purpose.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option A is correct, as chi-square is indeed used for nominal data. But I'm a bit unsure about option B because chi-square can be used for ordinal data in some cases, but it's not primarily designed for ranked data. Maybe in certain situations, like trend tests, but that's not the standard chi-square test.\n\nLet me double-check. The chi-square test of independence can be used with ordinal data, but it treats the categories as unordered. If the data are ordered, there are other tests that can account for that, like the Cochran-Armitage trend test. So, perhaps option B is a bit misleading because chi-square doesn't fully utilize the ordering in the data.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option A: used if research includes nominal (categorical) data.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
