The educational psychologist is giving the same basic skills exam to second-graders from two different schools, Antrim and Barton, on the same day but at different times\u2014morning and afternoon. The question is asking which option best identifies a confounding variable in this research.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a confounding variable is. From what I remember in statistics and research methods, a confounding variable is something that influences both the independent and dependent variables in a way that affects the outcome of the study. It's basically an extraneous factor that can make it seem like there's a relationship between the variables being studied when there might not be one, or it could mask a real relationship.\n\nIn this case, the psychologist is comparing the performance of students from two different schools. The independent variable is probably the school (Antrim vs. Barton), and the dependent variable is the students' performance on the exam.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. The psychologist is comparing two different schools.\n\nWell, that's the whole point of the study\u2014to compare the two schools. So, comparing two different schools isn't a confounding variable; it's the independent variable.\n\nB. The psychologist is comparing the same grade in each school.\n\nAgain, this seems like a control variable. By choosing the same grade, the psychologist is trying to ensure that differences in performance are not due to differences in grade level. So, this shouldn't be a confounding variable; rather, it's a way to make the comparison fairer.\n\nC. The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools at two different times.\n\nHmm, this is interesting. The exams are given at different times: morning for Antrim and afternoon for Barton. Maybe there's something about the time of day that could affect students' performance. For example, some students might perform better in the morning, while others might perform better in the afternoon. So, the time of day could be a factor that affects performance independently of the school they're in.\n\nWait a minute, but is time of day a confounding variable? Let's think about it. The school is the independent variable, and time of day is another variable that's not being controlled and could affect the dependent variable (students' performance). So, perhaps time of day is a confounding variable because it's related to when the test is administered and could influence the results.\n\nD. The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools on the same day.\n\nThis seems like a good thing because it controls for day-to-day variations. If the tests were given on different days, other factors like what was taught in school that day or the weather could affect performance. So, testing on the same day helps control for those variables.\n\nBut, the issue is that even though it's the same day, it's different times of the day, which brings us back to option C.\n\nSo, between options, it seems like C could be a confounding variable because the time of day might affect students' performance, and it's different for the two schools.\n\nLet me think of another angle. Suppose that in the morning, students are fresher and more alert, so they perform better on tests. Then, if Antrim is tested in the morning and Barton in the afternoon, any difference in performance might be due to the time of day rather than the school itself. This would mean that time of day is a confounding variable because it's influencing both the independent variable (school) and the dependent variable (performance).\n\nAlternatively, maybe some external factor related to the time of day affects both schools similarly, but since they're being tested at different times, it could introduce bias.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. The confounding variable should be something that varies between the groups and could explain differences in the dependent variable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider what variables could be affecting both the school and the performance. Since the schools are being tested at different times, and time could affect performance, time of day is a potential confounding variable.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other variables that could be confounding here. For example, the order in which the schools are tested. But that seems less likely unless there's something specific about the order that could affect performance.\n\nWhat about the fact that it's the same exam administered on the same day? Does that control for anything else?\n\nWell, using the same exam controls for differences in test difficulty, and administering it on the same day controls for variations in teaching methods or student preparation based on the day.\n\nBut again, the different times of day could introduce variability.\n\nI think the answer is C. The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools at two different times.\n\nThis is because the time of day could affect students' performance, and since it's different for the two schools, it could be a confounding variable that influences the results.\n\nTo put it another way, if the psychologist wants to compare the performance of students from different schools, she should control for factors like the time of day to ensure that any differences observed are due to school differences and not to when the test was taken.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the best identifier of a confounding variable in this research design.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
