                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I would tell someone if they had something in their teeth so they could feel embarrassed.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the person is planning to tell someone about something in their teeth with the intention of making them feel embarrassed. Normally, if someone has something in their teeth, you might tell them so they can remove it, because it's considerate to help someone avoid embarrassment unknowingly. But here, the intention is specifically to make them feel embarrassed. That seems a bit off. Intentions matter in morality, right? If you're doing something to harm someone emotionally, that's generally seen as wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person telling them is trying to prevent them from being embarrassed in front of others without realizing it. Like, maybe they're about to go on a date or give a presentation, and having something in their teeth could be embarrassing in that context. In that case, telling them could be seen as helpful, even if the thought of feeling embarrassed crosses your mind.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased is that you would tell them \"so they could feel embarrassed.\" That suggests that the primary reason for telling them is to induce embarrassment, not to help them avoid it. That feels different. Intentionally trying to make someone feel bad isn't usually considered morally acceptable.\n\nLet me consider this from different angles. Suppose I see a colleague with spinach in their teeth, and I tell them, \"Hey, you have something in your teeth,\" knowing that they might feel embarrassed once they realize it's been there for a while. Is that wrong? Well, if my main goal is to help them out before they see clients or give a presentation, it seems more like I'm trying to prevent a bigger embarrassment. But if I'm telling them just to watch them squirm or feel uncomfortable, that seems more malicious.\n\nSo, maybe it's the motive that matters here. If I'm telling someone to help them, it's good. If I'm telling them to make them feel bad, it's bad. In the scenario, it says \"so they could feel embarrassed,\" which leans towards the latter motive.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second scenario: I ran a comb through Martha's hair.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Martha presumably has hair that needs combing, maybe it's tangled or needs styling. Combing hair is generally a neutral or positive action, especially if it's consensual and helps with appearance or comfort.\n\nBut wait, who is Martha? Is she a friend, a family member, or perhaps someone who needs assistance? The context matters here. If Martha is a child, combing her hair might be part of parental care. If she's an adult, it could be a gesture of care or assistance, perhaps if she's unwell or needs help with grooming.\n\nAssuming that combing her hair is done with good intentions and is consensual, it's hard to see how this action is morally wrong. It seems like a helpful or caring act.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Telling someone about something in their teeth with the intention of making them feel embarrassed.\n\n- Scenario 2: Combing Martha's hair, which seems like a caring act.\n\nGiven that, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, intentionally causing someone embarrassment would be considered wrong, while combing someone's hair with good intentions is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario 1, if telling someone about something in their teeth is done to help them, it's generally seen as a kind act. However, the scenario specifies that it's done \"so they could feel embarrassed,\" which suggests a malicious intent. Morally, actions with malicious intent are typically considered wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, combing Martha's hair is an act of care, assuming it's done with her consent and for her benefit. There doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here, so it shouldn't be considered wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
