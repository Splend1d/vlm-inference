                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Lisa's small business. It talks about profits and losses over a few days, and I need to find out the total profit or loss. Let's see, on Monday there was a loss of $14, then a profit of $18 on Tuesday, a loss of $6 on Wednesday, and a profit of $7 on Thursday. I need to add up all these amounts and see if the total is positive (profit) or negative (loss).\n\nFirst, I should probably list out the daily results:\n\n- Monday: - $14 (loss)\n\n- Tuesday: + $18 (profit)\n\n- Wednesday: - $6 (loss)\n\n- Thursday: + $7 (profit)\n\nNow, to find the total profit or loss, I need to sum up these values. Profits are positive, and losses are negative. So, total profit or loss = sum of daily results.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nTotal = -14 + 18 - 6 + 7\n\nI can add the positives together and subtract the negatives.\n\nFirst, add the profits: 18 + 7 = 25\n\nThen, add the losses: 14 + 6 = 20\n\nNow, subtract the total losses from the total profits: 25 - 20 = 5\n\nSo, the total is $5 profit.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nA. $15 profit\n\nB. $45 loss\n\nC. $5 profit\n\nD. $10 profit\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it should be C. $5 profit.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nStart with -14.\n\nThen add 18: -14 + 18 = 4 (profit so far).\n\nThen subtract 6: 4 - 6 = -2 (loss).\n\nThen add 7: -2 + 7 = 5 (profit).\n\nYes, that confirms the total is $5 profit.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as adding positive profits and subtracting negative losses.\n\nProfits: 18 + 7 = 25\n\nLosses: 14 + 6 = 20\n\nTotal profit = 25 - 20 = 5\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think the answer is C. $5 profit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
