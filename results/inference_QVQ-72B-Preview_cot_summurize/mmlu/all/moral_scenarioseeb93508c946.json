                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. Scenario 1 says: \"Get out of here and never come back!\" I told the 2-year-old toddler. And Scenario 2: \"I spent the grocery money on weed.\" So, in Scenario 1, someone is telling a 2-year-old toddler to get out and never come back, and in Scenario 2, someone spent money that was intended for groceries on weed instead.\n\nOkay, so the question is asking for the main character's action in each scenario. In Scenario 1, the main character is the one telling the toddler to leave and never come back. In Scenario 2, it's the person who spent the grocery money on weed.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether these actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1. Telling a 2-year-old toddler to get out and never come back. Wow, that seems pretty harsh, especially considering that a 2-year-old is very young and probably doesn't understand what's being said or what's happening. Children at that age are dependent on caregivers for their basic needs and safety. Abandoning a child like that could put them in danger and cause emotional harm. So, from that perspective, it seems like a morally wrong action.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more context here. Maybe the person saying this is not the parent or guardian, or perhaps there are extenuating circumstances that I don't know about. However, based on the information provided, it's just a straightforward statement without any additional context. So, assuming that the person saying this is responsible for the child's well-being, telling them to leave and never come back is irresponsible and morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2. Spending grocery money on weed. Okay, so here, the person used money that was presumably intended for purchasing groceries to buy weed instead. Now, in many households, grocery money is essential for buying food and other necessary items for the family. Diverting that money to buy weed instead could mean that the family doesn't have enough to eat or that other basic needs aren't being met. That also seems like a morally wrong action because it prioritizes personal desires over the well-being of the entire family.\n\nBut again, context might be important here. Maybe the person doesn't have a family and lives alone, so spending grocery money on weed might not harm anyone else. Or perhaps they have excess money and this isn't causing any harm. However, based on the information given, it's just stated that it's grocery money, which often implies that it's meant for purchasing food for the household.\n\nSo, assuming that the grocery money was needed for the household's food supply, spending it on weed instead would be considered morally wrong because it neglects the needs of the family members who rely on that money for food.\n\nNow, putting both scenarios together, both actions seem to be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Telling a 2-year-old to leave and never come back is wrong because it endangers the child, and spending grocery money on weed is wrong because it neglects the family's basic needs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe in some contexts, one of these actions could be considered not wrong. For example, if the 2-year-old was being abusive or harmful in some way, perhaps telling them to leave could be seen as a way to protect others. But even then, a 2-year-old is too young to understand or control such behavior, and it's the responsibility of the caregivers to manage the situation safely.\n\nSimilarly, if the person spending the grocery money on weed had already ensured that everyone in the household had enough to eat, or if they lived alone and could afford to spend some grocery money on weed without harm, then maybe it wouldn't be wrong. But again, based on the information provided, it's just stated as \"grocery money,\" which generally implies it's meant for purchasing food.\n\nSo, in the absence of any additional context that might change the moral evaluation, I believe that both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
