People should be treated as an end, not a means to an end.\n\nC. The greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nD. Those better off should give to people who are not as well off.\n\nAnd the question is, which statement describes an idea from utilitarianism?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what utilitarianism is. I remember that utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as happiness or well-being, for the greatest number of people.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: What is right and what is wrong are predetermined.\n\nHmm, this seems to suggest that morality is fixed and decided in advance, maybe by some universal standards or divine command. But in utilitarianism, what's right or wrong can depend on the situation, because it's based on the consequences of actions. So, if an action leads to the greatest good for the greatest number, it's considered right. Otherwise, it's wrong. So, it's not predetermined in the sense that it can vary based on outcomes. Maybe this isn't the best fit for utilitarianism.\n\nOption B: People should be treated as an end, not a means to an end.\n\nThis sounds familiar, but I think this is more related to Kantian ethics, specifically Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, which states that you should always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, is more concerned with the overall happiness or utility produced by actions, even if that means sometimes using people as means to an end if it results in greater overall good. So, this seems more like Kant's deontological ethics rather than utilitarianism.\n\nOption C: The greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nThis one sounds very much like the core principle of utilitarianism. The utilitarian calculus is all about maximizing happiness or utility for the majority. So, this seems like a straightforward description of utilitarianism.\n\nOption D: Those better off should give to people who are not as well off.\n\nThis seems to suggest some form of redistribution or charity, where wealth or resources are transferred from richer to poorer individuals. While this might align with certain utilitarian ideas about reducing suffering or inequality, it's not the central tenet of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is more about the maximization of overall happiness, not specifically about redistribution unless it leads to greater overall good.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, C seems to be the most accurate description of utilitarianism's central idea.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there a possibility that another option could also be considered utilitarian?\n\nLet me think about option D again. Some utilitarians might argue that those who are better off have a moral obligation to help those who are worse off, as their assistance could lead to greater overall happiness. However, this is more of an application of utilitarian principles rather than the fundamental idea itself.\n\nOption A is definitely not utilitarian, as utilitarianism is consequentialist and doesn't hold that right and wrong are predetermined in an unchanging way.\n\nOption B is more aligned with deontological ethics, particularly Kant's philosophy, which is quite different from utilitarianism.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best describes an idea from utilitarianism is option C: The greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any chance that another option could also be considered correct. But no, I don't think so. Utilitarianism is primarily about maximizing overall utility, and option C captures that essence perfectly.\n\nSo, my final answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
