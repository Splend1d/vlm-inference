                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"Find the characteristic of the ring Z x Z.\" And the options are A. 0, B. 3, C. 12, D. 30. Okay, let's see. I need to recall what the characteristic of a ring is. It's the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) for all elements \\(a\\) in the ring, right? If no such \\(n\\) exists, then the characteristic is 0.\n\nSo, the ring here is \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is the direct product of the integers with themselves. That means elements look like pairs \\((a, b)\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers.\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\cdot (a, b) = (0, 0)\\) for all \\((a, b)\\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nFirst, let's think about how scalar multiplication works in this ring. In the direct product of rings, scalar multiplication is performed component-wise. So, \\(n \\cdot (a, b) = (n \\cdot a, n \\cdot b)\\).\n\nI need this to be equal to \\((0, 0)\\). That means both components must be zero. So, \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) and \\(n \\cdot b = 0\\) for all integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait a minute, if this has to hold for all integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then \\(n\\) has to be a number that, when multiplied by any integer, gives zero. But that seems impossible unless \\(n = 0\\). Because if \\(n\\) is any positive integer greater than zero, there exists some integer \\(a\\) such that \\(n \\cdot a \\neq 0\\).\n\nFor example, take \\(n = 1\\), then \\(1 \\cdot a = a\\), which is not zero unless \\(a = 0\\). Similarly, for any \\(n\\), unless \\(n = 0\\), there will be some \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for which \\(n \\cdot a \\neq 0\\) or \\(n \\cdot b \\neq 0\\).\n\nSo, it seems like the characteristic should be 0, meaning there is no positive integer \\(n\\) that annihilates all elements of the ring.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI recall that in the ring of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), the characteristic is 0 because no positive integer multiple of any integer will always give zero.\n\nSince \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\) is a direct product, operations are component-wise. So, if I take \\(n \\cdot (a, b) = (n \\cdot a, n \\cdot b)\\), and I want this to be \\((0, 0)\\), then both \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) and \\(n \\cdot b = 0\\) for all \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nBut in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), the only \\(n\\) that satisfies \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) for all \\(a\\) is \\(n = 0\\). So, in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\), it's the same: only \\(n = 0\\) will make \\(n \\cdot (a, b) = (0, 0)\\) for all \\((a, b)\\).\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\) is 0.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. 0 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe I should think about the additive order of elements.\n\nIn a ring, the characteristic is essentially the additive order of the multiplicative identity. So, in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\), what's the multiplicative identity?\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\), the multiplicative identity is \\((1, 1)\\), since \\((a, b) \\cdot (1, 1) = (a \\cdot 1, b \\cdot 1) = (a, b)\\).\n\nNow, the additive order of \\((1, 1)\\) would be the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\cdot (1, 1) = (0, 0)\\).\n\nAgain, \\(n \\cdot (1, 1) = (n \\cdot 1, n \\cdot 1) = (n, n)\\). For this to be \\((0, 0)\\), we need \\(n = 0\\). So, again, it points to the characteristic being 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the characteristic in terms of the ring's structure.\n\nI know that for a direct product of rings, the characteristic is the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of the individual rings, provided they are coprime.\n\nBut in this case, both components are \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), which has characteristic 0. So, LCM(0, 0) is still 0.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is A. 0.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that a positive integer \\(n\\) could satisfy \\(n \\cdot (a, b) = (0, 0)\\) for all \\((a, b)\\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nSuppose such an \\(n\\) exists. Then, for any \\((a, b)\\), \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) and \\(n \\cdot b = 0\\). But in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), the only \\(n\\) that satisfies \\(n \\cdot a = 0\\) for all \\(a\\) is \\(n = 0\\). So, again, confirming that the characteristic is 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0} \\]"
