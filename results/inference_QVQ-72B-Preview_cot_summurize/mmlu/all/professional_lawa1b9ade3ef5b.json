                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which legal principle or exception will determine the outcome of the case involving the daughter and the son's claims to the farm. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a 73-year-old widower who owns a 40-acre farm. He has two children: a son and a daughter. The daughter and her husband live on the farm in a small cottage and have been helping the widower with farming and maintaining the property from 1985 to 1989. The widower's health is declining, and he relies heavily on their assistance to stay on the farm.\n\nIn December 1989, the daughter tells her father that she and her husband plan to move out of state. The widower, fearing he can't manage without them, pleads with them not to leave. He says, \"Please don't ever leave. I'm totally dependent on you and your husband. If you stay and continue to care for me and help with the farming, the farm will be yours when I die.\"\n\nThe daughter decides to stay, turns down a job offer in a neighboring state, and for the next nine years, she cares for her father while her husband handles most of the farming operations. The widower dies intestate in 1998, meaning he didn't leave a will, and his surviving heirs are the daughter and the son.\n\nNow, the period required to acquire title by adverse possession in this jurisdiction is seven years. So, the daughter and her husband have been living and working on the farm for more than seven years before the widower's death.\n\nAn action is being brought to determine the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son in the farm. The question is, which legal principle or exception will be applied to decide this case: the statute of frauds, the parol evidence rule, the law for adverse possession, or the doctrine of resulting trusts?\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\n**A. Statute of frauds:**\n\nThe statute of frauds generally requires that certain agreements, particularly those involving the transfer of real property, must be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the widower made a verbal promise to his daughter that the farm would be hers when he died if she stayed and helped him. This sounds like an oral agreement for the transfer of real property, which would typically need to be in writing under the statute of frauds.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the statute of frauds, such as when one party has relied on the promise to their detriment. The daughter turned down a job offer and continued to care for her father and work on the farm based on his promise. This might constitute detrimental reliance, which could make the oral promise enforceable despite the statute of frauds.\n\nSo, the statute of frauds is relevant here, but it's possible that an exception applies due to the daughter's reliance on the father's promise.\n\n**B. Parol evidence rule:**\n\nThe parol evidence rule generally states that when there is a written contract, oral statements made before or during the formation of the contract cannot be used to contradict the written terms. However, in this scenario, there doesn't seem to be a written contract regarding the transfer of the farm. The promise was entirely oral, and there's no mention of any written agreement.\n\nTherefore, the parol evidence rule might not be directly applicable here because there's no written contract to which it can be applied.\n\n**C. Law for adverse possession:**\n\nAdverse possession is a doctrine where someone can acquire legal title to property by possessing it openly, continuously, and exclusively for a certain period, which in this jurisdiction is seven years.\n\nIn this case, the daughter and her husband have been living and working on the farm for more than seven years before the widower's death. However, the widower was still alive during this period, and they were presumably occupying the property with his permission.\n\nGenerally, adverse possession requires possession without the owner's permission. Since the widower allowed them to live and work on the farm, it might not qualify as adverse possession.\n\nBut, there might be exceptions or specific circumstances where, even with permission, adverse possession can occur under certain conditions, perhaps if the permission was given in lieu of rent or in exchange for services.\n\nGiven that the daughter and her husband were providing care and farming assistance to the widower, it's possible that their possession wasn't truly adverse because they had the widower's consent and were providing valuable services in exchange.\n\n**D. Doctrine of resulting trusts:**\n\nA resulting trust is a type of implied trust where, based on the parties' conduct or intentions, it's inferred that one party holds property for the benefit of another.\n\nIn this scenario, the widower promised that the farm would be the daughter's when he died if she stayed and helped him. The daughter relied on this promise by staying and providing care and labor on the farm.\n\nIf the court were to recognize a resulting trust, it might hold that the widower held the farm in trust for the daughter, given his promise and her reliance on it.\n\nHowever, resulting trusts are typically associated with situations where there's a contribution to the purchase price of property or where there's an intention to hold the property for another's benefit.\n\nIt's unclear whether this scenario fits neatly into the doctrine of resulting trusts, but it's certainly a possibility.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Promissory estoppel:**\n\nThis doctrine may also be relevant. It allows enforcement of a promise when one party reasonably relies on that promise to their detriment. The daughter turned down a job and continued to care for her father and work on the farm based on his promise. This could be seen as detrimental reliance, making the promise enforceable even if it's oral.\n\n- **Equitable principles:**\n\nGiven that the widower died intestate and the daughter and son are the only heirs, equity might come into play to determine how the farm should be divided. The daughter has provided significant care and labor on the farm based on her father's promise, which might justify an unequal division in her favor.\n\n- **Intestate succession laws:**\n\nIn the absence of a will, state intestate succession laws will determine how the estate is divided. Typically, it would be split equally between the surviving children unless there are reasons to deviate from that.\n\n**Possible Outcome:**\n\nGiven the facts presented, it seems that the daughter has a strong claim to the farm based on her father's promise and her reliance on that promise. The statute of frauds might normally prevent enforcement of the oral promise, but the daughter's detrimental reliance could be an exception.\n\nAdverse possession might not apply directly because their possession wasn't truly adverse; they had the owner's permission and were providing valuable services in exchange.\n\nThe doctrine of resulting trusts could be a possible avenue, but it might not be the most straightforward fit.\n\nTherefore, the most likely legal principle that will be applied is the exception to the statute of frauds based on detrimental reliance, possibly through the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the application of principles and exceptions to specific legal doctrines listed, and considering that promissory estoppel is closely tied to the statute of frauds as an exception, option A (statute of frauds) seems the most relevant.\n\nAlternatively, if the court were to consider the daughter's long-term occupation and care of the farm as constituting adverse possession, option C (adverse possession) could also be a consideration, especially since the required period is seven years and they've been there for over nine.\n\nBut given that their possession was with the owner's consent and in exchange for care and labor, it's less likely that adverse possession would apply.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is likely A. statute of frauds, with the understanding that an exception applies due to the daughter's detrimental reliance on the father's promise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
