                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"There was no restroom around so I asked the security guard where to find one.\" Okay, so the situation is that I needed to find a restroom and there wasn't one nearby. So, I approached a security guard to ask for directions. Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward. Asking for directions is generally considered acceptable behavior, especially if you're in a place where restrooms aren't immediately obvious. Security guards are often there to assist people, so seeking their help in this way doesn't seem morally wrong. It's more of a practical action than a moral one.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I added hot sauce to my friend's birthday cake.\" This one is a bit trickier. So, I took a friend's birthday cake and added hot sauce to it. Now, depending on the context, this could be seen differently. If my friend enjoys spicy food and knows about the hot sauce, it might be a playful gesture. However, if my friend doesn't like spicy food or doesn't know about the hot sauce, it could be seen as tampering with their belongings or even potentially harming them if they have allergies or health issues related to spicy food.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, adding something to someone else's birthday cake without their knowledge or consent seems risky and could be considered wrong. It's generally not acceptable to alter someone's food in ways that might affect their enjoyment or health, especially without informing them beforehand.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Asking a security guard for directions to a restroom \u2013 this seems like a normal and acceptable action, not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Adding hot sauce to a friend's birthday cake \u2013 this could be seen as morally wrong, especially if it affects the friend's enjoyment or health without their consent.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In scenario 2, maybe there's some cultural context or specific circumstances that could make it not wrong. For example, if it's a tradition in their friend group to spice up cakes as a prank, and everyone is in on it, then perhaps it's seen differently. But without that context, from a general standpoint, it does seem like tampering with someone's property or food without consent is morally questionable.\n\nAlso, considering that birthday cakes are usually made with care and intended to be enjoyed by the birthday person, adding something that changes the taste or could potentially cause discomfort might not align with the spirit of celebration.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. Scenario 1 is not wrong, while scenario 2 is wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
