                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about rotational inertia. It says, \"The rotational inertia of an object is greater when most of the mass is located...\" and then there are options: near the rotational axis, away from the axis, on the rotational axis, or off center. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nI remember that rotational inertia, or moment of inertia, is kind of like rotational mass. It measures how much something resists changing its rotational motion. So, similar to how mass resists changes in linear motion, moment of inertia resists changes in rotational motion.\n\nNow, the formula for moment of inertia is I = mr\u00b2, right? Where m is the mass and r is the distance from the axis of rotation. From this, it seems like the farther away the mass is from the axis, the greater the moment of inertia. Because r is squared, so increasing the distance has a big impact.\n\nLet me think about that. If I have two objects with the same mass, but one has its mass closer to the axis and the other has its mass farther away, the one with mass farther away should have a larger moment of inertia. Right?\n\nFor example, think about a spinning top. If most of the mass is near the axis, it's easier to spin, whereas if the mass is spread out farther from the axis, it's harder to spin, meaning it has more rotational inertia.\n\nSo, based on that, option B: away from the axis seems correct. But let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: near the rotational axis. From what I just thought, if most of the mass is near the axis, the moment of inertia should be smaller, not greater. So this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C: on the rotational axis. Well, if the mass is on the axis, that means r is zero, so I = m(0)\u00b2 = 0. That would be the minimum moment of inertia, not the maximum. So this can't be right.\n\nOption D: off center. This seems a bit vague. Off center could mean anywhere not on the axis, but it doesn't specify the distance from the axis. So, it might include both near and far from the axis. But since the formula depends on r\u00b2, it's really the distance that matters.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the parallel axis theorem. That's about shifting the axis of rotation away from the center of mass and adjusting the moment of inertia accordingly. The parallel axis theorem states that I = I_cm + md\u00b2, where I_cm is the moment of inertia about the center of mass, m is the total mass, and d is the distance between the two axes.\n\nFrom this, it seems that moving the axis away from the center of mass increases the moment of inertia by the term md\u00b2. So, again, having mass farther from the axis increases the moment of inertia.\n\nLet me consider a simple example. Take a solid sphere. Its moment of inertia about its center is (2/5)mr\u00b2. If I take an axis off-center, say at a distance d from the center, the moment of inertia would be (2/5)mr\u00b2 + md\u00b2, which is larger than (2/5)mr\u00b2. So, yes, moving the axis away from the center increases the moment of inertia.\n\nBut in this question, it's about the location of the mass relative to the axis, not about moving the axis itself. So, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the distribution of mass. If most of the mass is concentrated far from the axis, then the moment of inertia should be larger. Conversely, if most of the mass is close to the axis, the moment of inertia should be smaller.\n\nLet's take the example of a hollow sphere and a solid sphere of the same mass and radius. The hollow sphere has most of its mass far from the axis, and its moment of inertia is larger than that of the solid sphere, which has mass distributed closer to the axis.\n\nSo, again, this points to option B: away from the axis.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider option D: off center. If an object has its mass off-center, does that necessarily mean it has higher rotational inertia? Not necessarily, because off-center could mean that the center of mass is not aligned with the axis, but the distribution of mass could still be such that most of the mass is close to the axis or far from it.\n\nFor example, consider a spinning disk that's not centered on the axis. The moment of inertia would be increased compared to when it's spinning about its center, but this is due to the axis being offset from the center of mass, not necessarily because the mass is farther from the axis.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing myself. The question is about the location of the mass relative to the rotational axis, not about the position of the axis relative to the center of mass.\n\nSo, to rephrase: for a given axis of rotation, if most of the mass is located far from that axis, the moment of inertia will be greater.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: away from the axis.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a simple system. Suppose I have two point masses, each of mass m, one at a distance r from the axis and the other at a distance 2r from the axis. Their moments of inertia would be mr\u00b2 and m(2r)\u00b2 = 4mr\u00b2, respectively. So, the one farther from the axis has a larger moment of inertia.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the definition of moment of inertia: I = \u222b r\u00b2 dm, where r is the perpendicular distance from the axis to the mass element dm. So, the farther away dm is from the axis, the more it contributes to the total moment of inertia.\n\nTherefore, in any object, if most of the mass is located farther from the axis, the overall moment of inertia will be larger.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. So, the answer is B. away from the axis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
