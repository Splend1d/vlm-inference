                    "text": "So I've got this question about energy expenditure during exercise. It says that an athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 liters per minute for 5 minutes of exercise, and it asks for approximately how many kilojoules (kJ) of energy are expended. The options are 60 kJ, 150 kJ, 300 kJ, and 500 kJ.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how oxygen uptake relates to energy expenditure. I remember that when we exercise, our bodies use oxygen to break down fuel (like glucose and fatty acids) to release energy, and the amount of oxygen we consume can be used to calculate the energy we expend.\n\nI think there's a standard conversion factor that links oxygen consumption to energy production. I believe it's around 20.1 kilojoules per liter of oxygen consumed. But let me double-check that because I don't want to use the wrong conversion factor.\n\nA quick search in my notes shows that the energy equivalent for oxygen consumption is approximately 20.1 kJ per liter of oxygen. That sounds familiar.\n\nSo, if the athlete is consuming 3.0 liters of oxygen per minute, and the exercise lasts for 5 minutes, the total oxygen consumed would be 3.0 l/min multiplied by 5 minutes, which should be 15 liters of oxygen in total.\n\nNow, multiplying the total oxygen consumed by the energy equivalent should give me the total energy expended. So, 15 liters times 20.1 kJ per liter should be 301.5 kJ, which rounds to approximately 300 kJ.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 300 kJ seems to be the closest answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Starting from the oxygen uptake: 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes is indeed 15 liters total.\n\nAnd using the conversion factor of 20.1 kJ per liter, 15 times 20.1 is 301.5 kJ, which is effectively 300 kJ when considering significant figures.\n\nSo, based on this calculation, the answer should be approximately 300 kJ.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, sometimes energy expenditure calculations consider the type of fuel being used or the efficiency of exercise, but in this case, the problem seems to provide enough information with the oxygen uptake.\n\nAlso, I should confirm whether the conversion factor includes the efficiency of ATP production or if there are other metabolic considerations, but I think the standard 20.1 kJ per liter is a generally accepted value for such calculations.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 300 kJ, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300\\ \\text{kJ}} \\]"
