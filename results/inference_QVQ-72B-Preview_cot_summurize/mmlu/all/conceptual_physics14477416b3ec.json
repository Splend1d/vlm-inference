                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about motion and forces. It says that if an object is already moving and the sum of all the vector forces on a mass is zero, then the object will...\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. move at a constant speed in a straight line\n\nB. accelerate at a constant rate in a straight line\n\nC. come to rest\n\nD. increase its amount of inertia\n\nHmm, okay. First off, I know that when the sum of all forces on an object is zero, that means the net force is zero. And from Newton's first law of motion, which is also called the law of inertia, it says that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\n\nSo, if the net force is zero, that means there are no unbalanced forces acting on the object. Therefore, the object should keep moving at the same constant speed in a straight line.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Newton's first law can be stated mathematically as:\n\n\\[\\sum \\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a}\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\sum \\mathbf{F}\\) is the sum of all forces, \\(m\\) is the mass, and \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is the acceleration vector. If \\(\\sum \\mathbf{F} = 0\\), then \\(\\mathbf{a} = 0\\). That means the acceleration is zero.\n\nNow, acceleration is a vector that describes both the rate of change of speed and the change of direction. So, if acceleration is zero, there is no change in speed or direction.\n\nTherefore, if an object is already moving and the net force is zero, it should continue to move at the same speed in the same direction.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. move at a constant speed in a straight line\n\nThis seems to match what I just thought. But let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nB. accelerate at a constant rate in a straight line\n\nIf the net force is zero, acceleration should be zero. So, this can't be right because it suggests there is acceleration.\n\nC. come to rest\n\nUnless there's a force opposing motion, like friction or air resistance, the object shouldn't slow down or stop. Since the net force is zero, there's no force to make it come to rest.\n\nD. increase its amount of inertia\n\nInertia is a property of mass, and it doesn't change unless the mass changes. In this scenario, the mass of the object is constant, so inertia shouldn't change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. move at a constant speed in a straight line.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the object is moving in a circle with constant speed? In that case, the net force is directed towards the center, and it's not zero. So, in that scenario, the net force isn't zero, which aligns with the condition given in the question.\n\nAnother thing to consider is relativity, but since this is a basic physics question, I think Newton's laws should suffice.\n\nAlso, thinking about frictionless surfaces or space, where there are no forces to slow down the object.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
