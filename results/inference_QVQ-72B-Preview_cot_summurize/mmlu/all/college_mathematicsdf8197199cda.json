                    "text": "So I have this question here about vectors in R^k, and it's asking which of the given options isn't always true for vectors x, y, z in R^k. The options are:\n\nA. |x| \u2265 0\n\nB. |x \u00b7 y| \u2264 |x||y|\n\nC. |x| = 0 if and only if x = 0\n\nD. |x + y| = |x| + |y|\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to understand what each of these statements means and see if there are any cases where they might not hold.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the notation. |x| typically refers to the magnitude or length of the vector x in R^k. The dot product x \u00b7 y is the standard inner product between vectors x and y.\n\nOption A says that the magnitude of any vector x is greater than or equal to zero. That makes sense because magnitude is a distance, and distances are non-negative. So, I don't think this one is the issue.\n\nOption B is |x \u00b7 y| \u2264 |x||y|. This looks like the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that the absolute value of the dot product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes. So, this should always hold true.\n\nOption C says that the magnitude of x is zero if and only if x is the zero vector. That also makes sense because only the zero vector has zero length. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D is |x + y| = |x| + |y|. Hmm, this is the one that might not always be true. I know that in Euclidean space, the triangle inequality states that |x + y| \u2264 |x| + |y|, but equality holds only when x and y are scalar multiples of each other, specifically when they point in the same direction. So, generally, |x + y| is not equal to |x| + |y| unless the vectors are colinear and point in the same direction.\n\nLet me test this with some examples. Suppose x = (1, 0, ..., 0) and y = (0, 1, ..., 0). Then, |x| = 1, |y| = 1, and |x + y| = |(1, 1, 0, ..., 0)| = sqrt(2), which is not equal to 1 + 1 = 2. So, in this case, |x + y| \u2260 |x| + |y|.\n\nAnother example: if x = (1, 0, ..., 0) and y = (1, 0, ..., 0), then |x| = 1, |y| = 1, and |x + y| = |(2, 0, ..., 0)| = 2, which does equal |x| + |y|. So, in this case, it holds.\n\nBut since the statement says \"always true,\" and I've found a counterexample where it doesn't hold, then option D must be the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the general case. In vector spaces, the triangle inequality guarantees that |x + y| \u2264 |x| + |y|, but equality occurs only under specific conditions, like when x and y are linearly dependent and point in the same direction.\n\nTherefore, it's not always true that |x + y| = |x| + |y| for arbitrary vectors x and y in R^k. So, the answer should be D.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- A: |x| \u2265 0 \u2013 always true\n\n- B: |x \u00b7 y| \u2264 |x||y| \u2013 Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, always true\n\n- C: |x| = 0 iff x = 0 \u2013 always true\n\n- D: |x + y| = |x| + |y| \u2013 not always true, as shown by counterexamples\n\nHence, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
