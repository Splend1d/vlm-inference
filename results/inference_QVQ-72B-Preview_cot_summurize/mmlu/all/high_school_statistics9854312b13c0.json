                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It gives me P(E) = 0.32, P(F) = 0.15, and P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048. And I need to figure out which statement about the events E and F is correct. The options are:\n\nA. The events E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nB. The events E and F are neither independent nor mutually exclusive.\n\nC. The events E and F are mutually exclusive but not independent.\n\nD. The events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what independence and mutual exclusivity mean in probability.\n\nIndependence means that the occurrence of one event doesn't affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, for independent events E and F, P(E \u2229 F) = P(E) * P(F).\n\nMutual exclusivity means that both events cannot happen at the same time. Mathematically, for mutually exclusive events, P(E \u2229 F) = 0.\n\nSo, given P(E) = 0.32, P(F) = 0.15, and P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048, I need to check whether these events are independent, mutually exclusive, or neither.\n\nLet me first check for independence. If E and F are independent, then P(E \u2229 F) should equal P(E) * P(F).\n\nSo, let's calculate P(E) * P(F): 0.32 * 0.15.\n\nHmm, 0.32 times 0.15. Well, 0.32 times 0.1 is 0.032, and 0.32 times 0.05 is 0.016. So total, 0.032 + 0.016 = 0.048.\n\nWait a minute, P(E) * P(F) equals 0.048, and P(E \u2229 F) is also 0.048. So, P(E \u2229 F) = P(E) * P(F). That means the events are independent.\n\nNow, for mutual exclusivity, if events are mutually exclusive, then P(E \u2229 F) should be 0. But here, P(E \u2229 F) is 0.048, which is greater than 0. So, they are not mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, the events are independent but not mutually exclusive.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The events E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nB. The events E and F are neither independent nor mutually exclusive.\n\nC. The events E and F are mutually exclusive but not independent.\n\nD. The events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIs it possible for events to be both independent and mutually exclusive? Let's see. If events are mutually exclusive, P(E \u2229 F) = 0, but for independence, P(E \u2229 F) should be P(E) * P(F). Unless P(E) or P(F) is 0, which isn't the case here, they can't be both mutually exclusive and independent. So, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says neither, but we've established that they are independent. So, B is incorrect.\n\nOption C says mutually exclusive but not independent. But we've already determined they're not mutually exclusive. So, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says independent but not mutually exclusive, which matches our conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe I should check if P(E|F) equals P(E), which is another way to define independence. P(E|F) = P(E \u2229 F) / P(F) = 0.048 / 0.15.\n\nWhat's 0.048 divided by 0.15? Well, 0.15 times 0.32 is 0.048, because 0.15 * 0.32 = 0.048. So, P(E|F) = 0.32, which equals P(E). So yes, this confirms that E and F are independent.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is D: The events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
