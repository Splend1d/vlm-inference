                    "text": "So I have this problem here about balancing a half-reaction involving bromate ions forming bromine in an acid solution. The reaction is BrO3- turning into Br2. I need to balance this half-reaction, and the options are about where the electrons go\u2014specifically, how many electrons are on which side.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a half-reaction is. A half-reaction is a part of a redox reaction that focuses on either the oxidation or the reduction process. In this case, bromate ions are being reduced to bromine.\n\nSo, BrO3- is being reduced to Br2. Wait, is that right? Bromate to bromine\u2014bromine is Br2, which is elemental bromine. So, BrO3- is being reduced to Br2.\n\nNow, to balance this half-reaction, I need to balance the atoms and charge on both sides. I'm working in an acid solution, so I can use H+ ions and H2O to balance hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nLet me write down the unbalanced half-reaction:\n\nBrO3- \u2192 Br2\n\nFirst, I need to balance the bromine atoms. There's one Br in BrO3- and two Br's in Br2. So, I need to multiply BrO3- by 2 to have two Br's on the left:\n\n2 BrO3- \u2192 Br2\n\nNow, balance the oxygen atoms. There are 6 O's on the left and 0 on the right. I can use H2O to balance oxygen:\n\n2 BrO3- \u2192 Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nNow, balance the hydrogen atoms. There are 12 H's on the right from 6 H2O molecules. To balance these, I can use H+ ions on the left:\n\n2 BrO3- + 12 H+ \u2192 Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nNow, check the charge balance. Each BrO3- has a -1 charge, and each H+ has a +1 charge. So, on the left, total charge is 2(-1) + 12(+1) = -2 + 12 = +10. On the right, Br2 is neutral, and H2O is neutral, so total charge is 0. That means I need to add electrons to balance the charge.\n\nSo, to balance the charge, I need to add 10 electrons to the left side:\n\n2 BrO3- + 12 H+ + 10 e- \u2192 Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nNow, let's check if everything is balanced.\n\nBromine atoms: 2 Br in 2 BrO3- and 2 Br in Br2 \u2014 balanced.\n\nOxygen atoms: 6 O in 2 BrO3- and 6 O in 6 H2O \u2014 balanced.\n\nHydrogen atoms: 12 H in 12 H+ and 12 H in 6 H2O \u2014 balanced.\n\nCharge: -2 (from 2 BrO3-) + 12 (from 12 H+) + 10 (from 10 e-) = +10 on the left; 0 on the right \u2014 balanced.\n\nSo, the balanced half-reaction is:\n\n2 BrO3- + 12 H+ + 10 e- \u2192 Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 6 electrons on the left\n\nB. 6 electrons on the right\n\nC. 3 electrons on the left\n\nD. 10 electrons on the left\n\nFrom my balancing, I have 10 electrons on the left side. So, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with BrO3- to Br2:\n\nBrO3- \u2192 Br2\n\nBalance Br: 2 BrO3- \u2192 Br2\n\nBalance O: 2 BrO3- \u2192 Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nBalance H: 2 BrO3- + 12 H+ \u2192 Br2 + 6 H2O\n\nBalance charge: 2(-1) + 12(+1) = +10 on left; 0 on right \u2192 add 10 e- to left.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the oxidation states.\n\nBr in BrO3- has an oxidation state of +5 (since O is -2, and there are 3 O's: +5 + 3(-2) = -1, the charge of BrO3-).\n\nIn Br2, Br has an oxidation state of 0.\n\nSo, each Br is being reduced from +5 to 0, which is a reduction of 5 units. Since there are 2 Br's, that's a total reduction of 10 electrons.\n\nSo, yes, 10 electrons are being gained on the left side.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 10 electrons on the left.\n\nWait, but option A says \"6 electrons on the left.\" Why might that be incorrect?\n\nMaybe someone might think of balancing it differently, but according to the balancing I did, it's 10 electrons on the left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they balanced it with a different stoichiometry, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nNo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
