                    "text": "So Kerri ran four races, all the same distance, and I have her times for each race: 18.04 seconds, 21.39 seconds, 12.99 seconds, and 14.14 seconds. The problem says to round each of these times to the nearest one-tenth of a second first, and then add them up to get the total time. I need to find which of the given options\u201466.6 seconds, 66.5 seconds, 66 seconds, or 65.5 seconds\u2014is the correct estimate.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what \"rounding to the nearest one-tenth of a second\" means. So, one-tenth of a second is 0.1 seconds. So, for any time, if the hundredths place is 5 or above, I round up; if it's below 5, I round down.\n\nLet's take the first time: 18.04 seconds. The tenths digit is 0, and the hundredths digit is 4, which is less than 5. So, it rounds down to 18.0 seconds.\n\nNext, 21.39 seconds. The tenths digit is 3, and the hundredths digit is 9, which is greater than 5. So, it rounds up to 21.4 seconds.\n\nThen, 12.99 seconds. The tenths digit is 9, and the hundredths digit is 9, which is greater than 5. So, it rounds up to 13.0 seconds.\n\nLastly, 14.14 seconds. The tenths digit is 1, and the hundredths digit is 4, which is less than 5. So, it rounds down to 14.1 seconds.\n\nNow, I need to add these rounded times together: 18.0 + 21.4 + 13.0 + 14.1.\n\nLet's add 18.0 and 21.4 first. 18 plus 21 is 39, and 0.0 plus 0.4 is 0.4, so that's 39.4 seconds.\n\nThen, add 13.0 to that. 39.4 plus 13.0 is 52.4 seconds.\n\nFinally, add 14.1. 52.4 plus 14.1 is 66.5 seconds.\n\nSo, the total time, after rounding each individual time to the nearest one-tenth of a second and then adding them up, is 66.5 seconds.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 66.6 seconds\n\nB. 66.5 seconds\n\nC. 66 seconds\n\nD. 65.5 seconds\n\nIt seems like B. 66.5 seconds is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe I should double-check my rounding to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 18.04 seconds: hundredths digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it rounds down to 18.0 seconds. That seems correct.\n\nNext, 21.39 seconds: hundredths digit is 9, which is greater than 5, so it rounds up to 21.4 seconds. Correct.\n\nThen, 12.99 seconds: hundredths digit is 9, which is greater than 5, so it rounds up from 13.0 to 13.0 seconds. Wait, actually, 12.99 rounds to 13.0 seconds, which is correct.\n\nLastly, 14.14 seconds: hundredths digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it rounds down to 14.1 seconds. Correct.\n\nNow, adding them up again: 18.0 + 21.4 is 39.4; 39.4 + 13.0 is 52.4; 52.4 + 14.1 is 66.5. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nI think the answer is B. 66.5 seconds.\n\nWait, but let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe I should calculate the exact total time first and then see how rounding affects it.\n\nSo, the exact times are 18.04, 21.39, 12.99, and 14.14 seconds.\n\nAdding them up: 18.04 + 21.39 = 39.43 seconds\n\n39.43 + 12.99 = 52.42 seconds\n\n52.42 + 14.14 = 66.56 seconds\n\nSo, the exact total time is 66.56 seconds.\n\nNow, if I round that to the nearest one-tenth, the hundredths digit is 5, so I would round up to 66.6 seconds.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to round each time first and then add them up, not to add them up and then round the total.\n\nSo, the two methods are different.\n\nIn the first method, I rounded each time individually and then added them up, getting 66.5 seconds.\n\nIn this alternative method, I added the exact times and then rounded the total, getting 66.6 seconds.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWell, the problem specifically says to round each time to the nearest one-tenth of a second first and then add them up. So, I think the first method is more accurate for what the problem is asking.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 66.5 seconds.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way to interpret \"rounding to the nearest one-tenth.\"\n\nNo, I don't think so. It's straightforward: round each time individually to the nearest tenth and then sum them up.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is B. 66.5 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 66.5 \\ \\text{seconds}} \\]"
