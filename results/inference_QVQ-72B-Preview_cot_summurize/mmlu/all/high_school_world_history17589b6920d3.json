                    "text": "So I've got this excerpt from \"The Book of Routes and Realms\" by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, who was a Muslim historian and geographer in the eleventh century. He's describing the city of Ghana, which consists of two towns. One of them is inhabited by Muslims and has mosques, imams, muezzins, and jurists. There are also wells with sweet water nearby, which they use for drinking and growing vegetables.\n\nThe king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury, and most of his ministers are Muslims. That's interesting because it shows that Muslims held positions of power and influence in the king's court. But then it says that only royalty may wear sewn clothes, and everyone else wears robes made of cotton, silk, or brocade, depending on their means. So, there's a clear distinction in dress based on social status.\n\nThe king himself dresses like a woman, wearing necklaces and bracelets. That's unusual by modern standards, but it was probably a sign of wealth and status in that culture.\n\nWhen people approach the king, those who share his religion fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads as a greeting. Muslims, on the other hand, greet him by clapping their hands. This suggests that there are different customs for different religious groups in the court.\n\nThe religion of the majority is described as paganism and idol worship, even though some elites, like the king's officials, are Muslims. So, there's a mix of religions in the society.\n\nThere's also mention of trade regulations, like taxes on salt, copper, and other goods. The king reserves all nuggets found in the mines for himself, allowing only gold dust for the people. It's noted that if the people could accumulate more gold, it might lose its value, which is an early form of economic understanding.\n\nAdditionally, there's a reference to another country called Malal, where the king was sincerely attached to Islam, but the common people remained polytheists. Later rulers of Malal were given the title \"al-musulmani,\" which suggests some level of Islamic influence or affiliation.\n\nNow, based on this excerpt, I need to choose which statement correctly describes Islam's influence in Africa during this time period.\n\nOption A says: Imams and muezzins ensured that all Africans adhered to Islamic law.\n\nBut according to the excerpt, only one of the towns in Ghana was inhabited by Muslims, and even in that town, it seems that not everyone was Muslim, since the king himself is not described as Muslim. Also, the common people in Malal are said to remain polytheists, even though the king converted to Islam. So, it doesn't seem that imams and muezzins ensured that all Africans adhered to Islamic law. Therefore, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B says: Some elites converted to Islam, but lower classes kept their traditional beliefs.\n\nThis seems to align with the information provided. The king's interpreters, treasury officials, and most ministers are Muslims, which suggests that elites were converting to Islam. However, the common people in Malal remained polytheists, and in Ghana, the majority religion is described as paganism and idol worship. So, this option seems plausible.\n\nOption C says: Muslim merchants refused to do business with anyone who was not Muslim.\n\nThere's no information in the excerpt to support this claim. In fact, it mentions that Muslims greet the king by clapping their hands, implying that they interact with the king and possibly do business in the kingdom. So, this option is likely incorrect.\n\nOption D says: African kings required Muslims to conform to pagan customs at court.\n\nAgain, the excerpt doesn't provide any information to support this. It does mention that Muslims greet the king by clapping their hands, which is different from the pagan greeting of falling on knees and sprinkling dust, but it doesn't say that Muslims were required to follow pagan customs beyond that. So, this option is probably incorrect as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the excerpt, option B seems to be the correct description of Islam's influence in Africa during this time period: some elites converted to Islam, but lower classes kept their traditional beliefs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
