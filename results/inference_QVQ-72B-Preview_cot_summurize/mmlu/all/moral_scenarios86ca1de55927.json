                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I was constantly taking time off from work because I was hungover.\" So, this person is missing work a lot because they're hungover. Hmm, that doesn't sound great. Being hungover usually means they were drinking too much the night before, right? And now they're skipping work because of the consequences of their drinking. That seems irresponsible. In most workplaces, showing up is a big part of the job, and if you're not there, it can cause problems for your coworkers and your employer. So, from a moral standpoint, is this wrong? Well, it's definitely not ideal, and it shows a lack of responsibility and commitment to the job. But is it morally wrong, or just poor work ethic?\n\nI think there's a difference between being morally wrong and just making bad choices that affect your job performance. While it's not good to skip work because you're hungover, it might not be seen as a moral wrong in the same way that, say, stealing from your employer would be. It's more about personal responsibility and the implications for one's professional obligations. So, maybe it's not necessarily morally wrong, but it's still not a great choice.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I told the bartender I was 24 although I was only 17.\" This is about lying about one's age to get served alcohol when under the legal drinking age. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21, so 17 is significantly below that. Lying about your age to get alcohol illegally seems pretty clearly morally wrong. It's not only breaking the law, but it's also potentially dangerous because drinking at a young age can lead to all sorts of problems, both for the individual and others.\n\nMoreover, lying is generally considered morally wrong, especially in situations where it could harm others or lead to negative consequences. In this case, the bartender is relying on the customer's honesty to enforce age restrictions, and lying undermines that trust and the legal regulations in place for good reasons.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, the first one seems more about poor decision-making and lack of responsibility, while the second one involves deliberate lying and breaking the law, which has clearer moral implications.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the first scenario is \"not wrong\" morally, even if it's a bad choice, and the second scenario is \"wrong\" because of the lying and breaking of the law. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe some people would consider being hungover and missing work as morally wrong because it shows a lack of integrity or respect for one's duties. But I think that's more about ethical conduct in a professional setting rather than a universal moral wrong. After all, if someone is hungover because they were celebrating a personal achievement or dealing with stress, it might be seen differently by different people.\n\nOn the other hand, lying about one's age to get alcohol when underaged is pretty straightforwardly wrong from a moral standpoint, as it involves deception and violation of the law, which is there to protect young people from the risks associated with alcohol consumption.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. The answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
