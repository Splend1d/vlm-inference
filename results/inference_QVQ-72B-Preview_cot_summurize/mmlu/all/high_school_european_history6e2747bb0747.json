His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe radical movement known as anarchism, alluded to in the first paragraph, had been related to all of the following EXCEPT\n\nA. the International Workingman's Association\nB.

                    "text": "So I'm reading this excerpt from \u00c9mile Zola's \"Germinal,\" and it's about this character, Souvarine, who seems pretty disillusioned with the state of things in Russia and with the Nihilists. He talks about how these famous Nihilists, who come from various backgrounds like village priests, lower middle class, and tradesmen, are fixated on the idea of national liberation and think that killing their despot will solve everything. But Souvarine dismisses this as \"foolery\" and says they'll never get out of their situation with such actions.\n\nThen he shifts to talking about his own experiences and dreams. He mentions renouncing his rank and fortune to live among workers, hoping to see the foundation of a new society based on labor in common. He's been generous with his money, helping urchins and being friendly with colliers, but he feels that the fusion or unity he hoped for hasn't happened.\n\nHe directly addresses someone named \u00c9tienne and criticizes the French workers, particularly the hatworkers in Marseilles who won a lottery and instead of using the money for a greater cause, invested it to live without working. He accuses French workers of wanting to find treasure to hoard it and live lazily, showing a selfish desire to be bourgeois themselves. He concludes that as long as workers own anything, they won't be worthy of happiness, and their hatred for the bourgeoisie is just envy because they want to be in the bourgeoisie's place.\n\nNow, the question is about anarchism, which Souvarine seems to be alluding to in his talk about fraternity and a new society based on labor in common. The question asks which of the following is NOT related to anarchism: the International Workingman's Association, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the Congress of Vienna, or the Paris Commune.\n\nFirst, let's recall what anarchism is. Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for a society without centralized authority or government, often emphasizing voluntary cooperation, mutual aid, and the abolition of hierarchy.\n\nOption A is the International Workingman's Association, which I believe was a group that brought together various socialist and anarchist groups to fight for workers' rights. It was also known as the First International and was active in the latter part of the 19th century. Anarchists like Mikhail Bakunin were involved in it, so it's related to anarchism.\n\nOption B is Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who was a French philosopher and economist. He is often considered one of the founders of modern anarchism, particularly mutualism. He famously said, \"Property is theft,\" which critiqued capitalist ownership. So, he's definitely related to anarchism.\n\nOption C is the Congress of Vienna, which was a meeting of European powers in 1814-1815 after Napoleon's defeat to reorganize the map of Europe and restore stability. This seems quite different from anarchism, which is about dismantling centralized authority. The Congress of Vienna was more about strengthening and maintaining the existing order through a balance of power.\n\nOption D is the Paris Commune, which was a revolutionary government that briefly ruled Paris in 1871. It was suppressed by the French government, but it's seen as an important event in the history of socialist and anarchist thought because it attempted to establish a more democratic and egalitarian society.\n\nGiven these backgrounds, it seems that the Congress of Vienna is the one that's not related to anarchism. The other options are directly connected to anarchist movements or thinkers.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. the Congress of Vienna.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
