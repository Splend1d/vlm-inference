                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about giraffes and an environmental change that favors the tallest individuals. More of these taller giraffes are surviving and passing on their genes. I need to figure out which type of selection this is from the options given: directional, stabilizing, sexual, or disruptive selection.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each type of selection is.\n\nStarting with directional selection: from what I remember, directional selection is when there's a change in the population over time in one direction. Like, if a trait is becoming more extreme in one direction because of environmental pressures, that sounds familiar. In this case, if taller giraffes are being favored, maybe the average height of the population is increasing over generations. So, the trait (height) is moving in one direction, towards taller heights. That seems like directional selection.\n\nStabilizing selection, on the other hand, is when the intermediate traits are favored, and extremes are selected against. So, if both very tall and very short giraffes had lower survival rates, and medium-height giraffes did better, that would be stabilizing selection. But in this scenario, it's specifically the tallest giraffes that are being favored, so this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nSexual selection is a bit different. It's about traits that give an individual an advantage in mating, not necessarily survival. So, if taller giraffes were more attractive to mates and had more offspring for that reason, apart from survival advantages, that would be sexual selection. But in this case, it seems like the taller giraffes are surviving better because they can reach food better or something like that, not because they're more attractive to mates. So, maybe not sexual selection.\n\nDisruptive selection is when extreme traits are favored over the intermediate ones. So, if both very tall and very short giraffes had higher survival rates than medium-height ones, that would be disruptive selection. But again, in this scenario, it's only the tallest giraffes that are being favored, not the shortest. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nLet me double-check. If only one extreme is being favored, that's directional selection. If both extremes are favored, that's disruptive selection. So, in this case, only one extreme (tallest) is being favored, so it should be directional selection.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the environment is selecting for a particular trait that provides an advantage in the new conditions. Here, the environmental change favors taller giraffes, probably because they can access food or resources that shorter giraffes can't. So, over time, the population would shift towards being taller on average, as the tallest giraffes survive and reproduce more.\n\nI think the answer is A. directional selection.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nLet me consider the definition again. Directional selection is when a trait changes in one direction in response to environmental pressures. Stabilizing selection maintains the status quo by favoring the average. Sexual selection is about mating advantages not directly related to survival. Disruptive selection favors multiple distinct traits over the average.\n\nIn this scenario, it's clear that taller giraffes have a survival advantage due to the environmental change. So, it's not sexual selection, because the advantage is about survival, not mating. It's not stabilizing selection, because only one extreme is being favored, not the average. And it's not disruptive selection, because only one extreme is being favored, not multiple extremes.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. directional selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
