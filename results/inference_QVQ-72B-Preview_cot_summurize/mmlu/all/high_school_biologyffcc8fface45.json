                    "text": "So I have this question about natural selection, and I need to pick which statement is an inference of natural selection. Let me see what the options are.\n\nOption A says that subsequent generations of a population should have greater proportions of individuals that possess traits better suited for success. Hmm, that sounds like something related to natural selection. I think natural selection is about how organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits to their offspring. So, over time, more individuals in the population would have those beneficial traits. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nOption B says that an individual organism undergoes evolution over the course of its lifetime. Wait, I thought evolution was about changes in populations over generations, not about individual organisms evolving during their own lifetimes. Like, individual organisms might adapt to some extent during their lives, especially if they can learn or modify their behavior, but the core idea of evolution is about changes in the gene pool of a population from one generation to the next. So, this seems a bit off.\n\nOption C says that habitats do not generally have unlimited resources. That sounds familiar. I know that in any environment, there are finite resources like food, water, space, and so on. This is often a driving force behind competition among organisms. But is this directly an inference of natural selection? Maybe not directly. It's more of a condition that can lead to natural selection, but not the direct result of it.\n\nOption D says that natural populations tend to reproduce to their full biological potential. This also sounds related to the idea that organisms can produce many more offspring than can survive. It's kind of like overproduction. This is another concept that's important in understanding natural selection, but again, is it directly an inference of natural selection?\n\nLet me think about this. Natural selection is the process where individuals that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on their advantageous traits to future generations. So, an inference of natural selection would be a conclusion that follows from this process.\n\nOption A directly reflects this idea: over time, more individuals in the population will have traits that are better suited for success because those traits are being selected for by the environment.\n\nOptions C and D are more about the environmental pressures and the reproductive capabilities of organisms, which are prerequisites for natural selection to occur, but they aren't direct inferences of the process itself.\n\nOption B seems misleading because evolution is typically considered a population-level phenomenon, not something that happens to an individual over its lifetime in the same way.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, Option A seems to be the most accurate statement as an inference of natural selection.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check. Is there any chance that Option D could also be considered an inference? Natural populations tending to reproduce to their full biological potential\u2014that sounds like the idea of overproduction, which is a key component of natural selection. But is it an inference, or is it more of a premise?\n\nI think it's more of a premise. The inference would be what follows from the process of natural selection, which is the change in the frequency of traits over generations, favoring those that are more advantageous. So, Option A is more directly an outcome of natural selection.\n\nAlright, I'm pretty confident that Option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
