                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about boxes of shirts. So, there are 3 boxes, and each box has 4 packages. And each package contains 7 shirts. So, the expression given is 3 times (4 times 7) to find the total number of shirts. That makes sense because you have 3 boxes, each with 4 packages, and each package has 7 shirts, so multiplying them together should give the total number of shirts.\n\nNow, the question is asking which other expression can also be used to find the total number of shirts. So, I need to look at the options and see which one gives the same result as 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7).\n\nFirst, let me calculate what 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7) equals. First, 4 \u00d7 7 is 28. Then, 3 \u00d7 28 is 84. So, the total number of shirts is 84.\n\nNow, I need to check which of the given options also equals 84.\n\nOption A is 12 \u00d7 3. Let's see, 12 times 3 is 36. That's not 84, so that can't be right.\n\nOption B is 12 \u00d7 7. 12 times 7 is 84. Hmm, that matches our total.\n\nOption C is 28 \u00d7 4. 28 times 4 is 112. That's more than 84, so not correct.\n\nOption D is 28 \u00d7 7, which is 196. That's way more than 84.\n\nSo, based on this, option B, 12 \u00d7 7, equals 84, which matches our total number of shirts.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check if there's another way to look at this because the problem is about finding equivalent expressions, not just calculating the total and seeing which option gives the same number.\n\nLet me think about the associative property of multiplication. The associative property says that when multiplying three numbers, the way you group them doesn't change the product. So, for example, 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7) is the same as (3 \u00d7 4) \u00d7 7.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, instead of calculating it step by step, maybe there's a different way to group the numbers that would correspond to one of the options.\n\nLet me try that. If I take (3 \u00d7 4) first, that's 12, and then multiply by 7, that gives me 12 \u00d7 7, which is option B.\n\nSo, according to the associative property, 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7) equals (3 \u00d7 4) \u00d7 7, which is 12 \u00d7 7.\n\nThat confirms that option B is correct.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to interpret this. Maybe by rearranging the numbers differently.\n\nAnother way could be to think about the total number of packages first and then multiply by the number of shirts per package.\n\nSo, total packages are 3 boxes times 4 packages per box, which is 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 packages.\n\nThen, each package has 7 shirts, so total shirts are 12 \u00d7 7 = 84.\n\nAgain, that points to option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe thinking about the number of shirts per box and then multiplying by the number of boxes.\n\nEach box has 4 packages, each package has 7 shirts, so per box, there are 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 shirts.\n\nThen, with 3 boxes, total shirts are 3 \u00d7 28 = 84.\n\nBut looking at the options, 28 \u00d7 4 is option C, which is 112, which is not 84, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, why is that? Because if I do 28 \u00d7 4, that would be like taking the number of shirts per box and multiplying by the number of boxes, but in this case, it's not matching.\n\nOh, no, wait. The problem is that in the initial setup, there are 3 boxes, each with 4 packages, each package has 7 shirts, so total shirts are 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7 = 84.\n\nIf I do 28 \u00d7 4, that would be like taking the number of shirts per box (28) and multiplying by the number of boxes, but in this case, there are 3 boxes, not 4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nLet me rephrase: there are 3 boxes, each box has 4 packages, each package has 7 shirts.\n\nSo, total shirts = 3 boxes \u00d7 4 packages/box \u00d7 7 shirts/package = 84 shirts.\n\nIf I do 28 \u00d7 4, that would be like having 28 shirts \u00d7 4 boxes, but that would imply there are 4 boxes, not 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the total number of packages first and then the shirts per package.\n\nTotal packages = 3 boxes \u00d7 4 packages/box = 12 packages.\n\nThen, total shirts = 12 packages \u00d7 7 shirts/package = 84 shirts.\n\nAgain, that's 12 \u00d7 7.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nOption C, 28 \u00d7 4, would be like taking the number of shirts per box (28) and multiplying by 4 boxes, but there are only 3 boxes, so that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption D, 28 \u00d7 7, would be like taking the number of shirts per box (28) and multiplying by 7 boxes, which is even more boxes, so that's not correct.\n\nOption A, 12 \u00d7 3, would be like having 12 packages per box and 3 boxes, but each box has 4 packages, not 12.\n\nWait, no, each box has 4 packages, and each package has 7 shirts, so per box, it's 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 shirts.\n\nSo, total shirts are 3 boxes \u00d7 28 shirts/box = 84 shirts.\n\nBut in option C, it's 28 \u00d7 4, which would be like 4 boxes of 28 shirts each, giving 112 shirts, which is not matching our total.\n\nSo, that can't be right.\n\nOption B, 12 \u00d7 7, corresponds to the total number of packages (12) times the number of shirts per package (7), which equals 84 shirts.\n\nYes, that matches our initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there another expression that could represent the total number of shirts besides 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7) and (3 \u00d7 4) \u00d7 7?\n\nWell, perhaps using different groupings or different operations, but based on the given options, option B seems to be the only one that matches the total of 84 shirts.\n\nSo, I conclude that the answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
