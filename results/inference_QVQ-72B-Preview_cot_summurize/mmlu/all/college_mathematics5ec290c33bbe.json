                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a counterfeit die. It's a six-sided die, and the probabilities are messed up. Even numbers are more likely than odd ones. Specifically, the probability of rolling any even number is twice that of rolling any odd number. I need to find the probability that if I throw this die twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second will be a 6.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to figure out the probabilities of rolling each number on this die. Normally, with a fair die, each number has a 1/6 chance of coming up. But here, it's not fair. Even numbers are twice as likely as odd numbers.\n\nSo, let's denote the probability of rolling an odd number as P(odd), and the probability of rolling an even number as P(even). According to the problem, P(even) = 2 * P(odd).\n\nNow, there are three odd numbers on a die: 1, 3, and 5. There are three even numbers: 2, 4, and 6.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling an odd number is P(odd) = P(1) + P(3) + P(5), and P(even) = P(2) + P(4) + P(6).\n\nBut since all even numbers have the same probability and all odd numbers have the same probability, I can say P(odd) = 3 * P(odd_single), and P(even) = 3 * P(even_single), where P(even_single) = 2 * P(odd_single).\n\nWait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each odd number has the same probability, let\u2019s call it p. Then each even number has probability 2p.\n\nSince there are three odd numbers and three even numbers, the total probability is 3p + 3*(2p) = 3p + 6p = 9p.\n\nWe know that the total probability must be 1, so 9p = 1, which means p = 1/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling an odd number is p = 1/9, and the probability of rolling an even number is 2p = 2/9.\n\nSo, specifically:\n\n- P(1) = 1/9\n\n- P(3) = 1/9\n\n- P(5) = 1/9\n\n- P(2) = 2/9\n\n- P(4) = 2/9\n\n- P(6) = 2/9\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability that the first roll is a 5 and the second roll is a 6.\n\nSince the rolls are independent (assuming the die doesn\u2019t have memory or anything), the probability of two independent events both happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, P(first roll is 5 and second roll is 6) = P(first roll is 5) * P(second roll is 6).\n\nWe already found that P(5) = 1/9 and P(6) = 2/9.\n\nSo, P(total) = (1/9) * (2/9) = 2/81.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there\u2019s any trick here.\n\nThe problem says \"the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6.\" It\u2019s asking for both events to happen in sequence. Since the die is being thrown twice, and each throw is independent, multiplying the probabilities should be correct.\n\nAlso, the options provided are:\n\nA. 2/81\n\nB. 1/18\n\nC. 2/27\n\nD. 1/9\n\nSo, my answer matches option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm the probabilities again.\n\nWe have P(odd) = p = 1/9, and P(even) = 2p = 2/9.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- P(1) = 1/9\n\n- P(3) = 1/9\n\n- P(5) = 1/9\n\n- P(2) = 2/9\n\n- P(4) = 2/9\n\n- P(6) = 2/9\n\nThen, P(first roll is 5) = 1/9\n\nP(second roll is 6) = 2/9\n\nSo, P(first and then second) = (1/9)*(2/9) = 2/81\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as two independent trials, each with their own probability distribution, so the combined probability is indeed the product of the two probabilities.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other way to interpret this problem. It seems straightforward once I figure out the individual probabilities of each outcome.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2/81.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{81}} \\]"
