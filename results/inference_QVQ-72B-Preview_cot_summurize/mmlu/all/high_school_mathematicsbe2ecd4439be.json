                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: two numbers added together give me 19, and their product is 70. I need to find out what those two numbers are. The options are 5 and 14, 7 and 10, 4 and 15, or 3 and 16.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out what I know:\n\n- The sum of the two numbers is 19.\n\n- The product of the two numbers is 70.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to set up equations based on this information and then solve for the numbers.\n\nLet me let the two numbers be x and y.\n\nSo, I have:\n\nx + y = 19\n\nand\n\nx * y = 70\n\nI need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations.\n\nOne way to solve this is to express one variable in terms of the other using one equation and then substitute into the second equation.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = 19 - x\n\nNow, I can substitute this into the second equation:\n\nx * (19 - x) = 70\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n19x - x\u00b2 = 70\n\nI can rearrange this to form a quadratic equation:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 19x - 70 = 0\n\nOr, multiplying both sides by -1:\n\nx\u00b2 - 19x + 70 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for x.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula, where x = [19 \u00b1 \u221a(19\u00b2 - 4*1*70)] / (2*1)\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant:\n\nD = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-19)\u00b2 - 4*(1)*(70) = 361 - 280 = 81\n\nSo, x = [19 \u00b1 \u221a81] / 2 = [19 \u00b1 9] / 2\n\nTherefore, the two possible solutions are:\n\nx = (19 + 9)/2 = 28/2 = 14\n\nand\n\nx = (19 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5\n\nSo, one pair of numbers is 14 and 5. But let's check if this matches the options given.\n\nOption A is 5 and 14, which matches this solution.\n\nBut wait, quadratic equations can sometimes have two valid solutions. Let me check if there's another pair that could also satisfy the original equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in solving the equation.\n\nLet me verify the sum and product with x = 5 and y = 14:\n\nSum: 5 + 14 = 19\n\nProduct: 5 * 14 = 70\n\nYes, that works.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other possible pairs.\n\nSuppose I consider another option, say 7 and 10.\n\nSum: 7 + 10 = 17, which is not 19.\n\nProduct: 7 * 10 = 70\n\nDoesn't satisfy the sum condition.\n\nNext, 4 and 15:\n\nSum: 4 + 15 = 19\n\nProduct: 4 * 15 = 60, which is not 70.\n\nDoesn't satisfy the product condition.\n\nLastly, 3 and 16:\n\nSum: 3 + 16 = 19\n\nProduct: 3 * 16 = 48, which is not 70.\n\nAlso doesn't satisfy the product condition.\n\nSo, only 5 and 14 satisfy both conditions.\n\nAlternatively, if I look back at the quadratic equation, x\u00b2 - 19x + 70 = 0, the solutions are x = 5 and x = 14.\n\nTherefore, the pair is 5 and 14.\n\nBut wait, the options include 7 and 10, which give a sum of 17 and a product of 70.\n\nWhy didn't that pair work?\n\nWell, because the sum condition is not met.\n\nSimilarly, 4 and 15 give a sum of 19 but a product of 60, which doesn't match the product requirement.\n\nSame with 3 and 16: sum is 19 but product is 48.\n\nSo, only 5 and 14 satisfy both conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 5, 14.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about factoring the quadratic equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 19x + 70 = 0\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to 70 and add up to -19.\n\nThe pairs that multiply to 70 are:\n\n1 and 70: sum is 71\n\n2 and 35: sum is 37\n\n5 and 14: sum is 19\n\n7 and 10: sum is 17\n\nNone of these add up to -19, except if I consider negative numbers, but since we're dealing with positive numbers here (as per the options), 5 and 14 are the correct pair.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider negative numbers, but that's beyond the scope here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the two numbers are 5 and 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 5, \\ 14} \\]"
