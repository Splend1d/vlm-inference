                    "text": "So I have this problem here about Mercury's orbit around the Sun. It says that Mercury orbits the Sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year, and I need to find the approximate distance between Mercury and the Sun in astronomical units (AU). An AU is defined as the distance from the Earth to the Sun. The options provided are (1/25) AU, (1/9) AU, (1/5) AU, and (1/3) AU.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic relationships in celestial mechanics. I know that the time it takes for a planet to orbit the Sun is related to its distance from the Sun. Specifically, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. In mathematical terms, \\(T^2 \\propto a^3\\), where \\(T\\) is the orbital period and \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis.\n\nSince the Earth's distance from the Sun is defined as 1 AU, and its orbital period is 1 Earth year, I can use this as a reference. If Mercury's orbital period is one-fifth of an Earth year, I can set up a proportion to find its orbital distance in AU.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\(T_{\\text{Earth}} = 1\\) year\n\n- \\(a_{\\text{Earth}} = 1\\) AU\n\n- \\(T_{\\text{Mercury}} = \\frac{1}{5}\\) year\n\n- \\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = x\\) AU\n\nAccording to Kepler's third law:\n\n\\(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}^2}{a_{\\text{Mercury}}^3} = \\frac{T_{\\text{Earth}}^2}{a_{\\text{Earth}}^3}\\)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\(\\frac{(\\frac{1}{5})^2}{x^3} = \\frac{1^2}{1^3}\\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\(\\frac{1/25}{x^3} = 1\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{25x^3} = 1\\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(25x^3 = 1\\)\n\nNow, solving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\(x^3 = \\frac{1}{25}\\)\n\n\\(x = \\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\)\n\nNow, I need to simplify this cube root. Let's see:\n\n\\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1^{\\frac{1}{3}}}{25^{\\frac{1}{3}}}\\)\n\nSince \\(1^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 1\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{25^{\\frac{1}{3}}}\\)\n\nNow, I need to find the cube root of 25. Let's calculate that:\n\n\\(25^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{25}\\)\n\nI know that \\(2^3 = 8\\) and \\(3^3 = 27\\), so \\(\\sqrt[3]{25}\\) is a bit less than 3.\n\nTo get a more precise value, I can use a calculator, but since this is a multiple-choice question, I might be able to estimate.\n\nBut first, let's see what the options are:\n\nA. (1/25) AU\n\nB. (1/9) AU\n\nC. (1/5) AU\n\nD. (1/3) AU\n\nSo, I have \\(x = \\frac{1}{25^{\\frac{1}{3}}}\\), which is approximately \\(\\frac{1}{2.924}\\) because \\(\\sqrt[3]{25} \\approx 2.924\\).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this without a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in celestial mechanics, the relationship between orbital period and distance can also be expressed using the formula:\n\n\\(T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{GM}}\\)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(T\\) is the orbital period\n\n- \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis\n\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant\n\n- \\(M\\) is the mass of the Sun\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with ratios, the constants might cancel out.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that for circular orbits, \\(v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\), but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nLet me go back to Kepler's third law.\n\nGiven that \\(T^2 \\propto a^3\\), and for Earth, \\(T = 1\\) year for \\(a = 1\\) AU, and for Mercury, \\(T = \\frac{1}{5}\\) year, then:\n\n\\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = a_{\\text{Earth}} \\times \\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}}{T_{\\text{Earth}}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\)\n\nWait, no. Actually, from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\(\\frac{T^2}{a^3} = \\text{constant}\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}^2}{a_{\\text{Mercury}}^3} = \\frac{T_{\\text{Earth}}^2}{a_{\\text{Earth}}^3}\\)\n\nThus:\n\n\\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = a_{\\text{Earth}} \\times \\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}}{T_{\\text{Earth}}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\)\n\nWait, no. Let's be careful with the exponents.\n\nFrom:\n\n\\(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}^2}{a_{\\text{Mercury}}^3} = \\frac{T_{\\text{Earth}}^2}{a_{\\text{Earth}}^3}\\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\(a_{\\text{Mercury}}^3 = a_{\\text{Earth}}^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}}{T_{\\text{Earth}}}\\right)^2\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = a_{\\text{Earth}} \\times \\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}}{T_{\\text{Earth}}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\)\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the correct relationship from Kepler's third law is:\n\n\\(a = k \\times T^{2/3}\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven that for Earth, \\(a = 1\\) AU when \\(T = 1\\) year, then:\n\n\\(1 = k \\times 1^{2/3}\\), so \\(k = 1\\)\n\nTherefore, for Mercury:\n\n\\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^{2/3}\\) AU\n\nSo, \\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{1/3}\\) AU\n\nWhich is the same as \\(\\frac{1}{25^{1/3}}\\) AU\n\nNow, I need to evaluate \\(25^{1/3}\\)\n\nI know that \\(25 = 5^2\\), so:\n\n\\(25^{1/3} = (5^2)^{1/3} = 5^{2/3}\\)\n\nSo, \\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = \\frac{1}{5^{2/3}}\\) AU\n\nNow, \\(5^{2/3}\\) is the same as \\(\\sqrt[3]{5^2} = \\sqrt[3]{25}\\)\n\nI need to find the cube root of 25. Let's approximate this.\n\nI know that \\(2^3 = 8\\) and \\(3^3 = 27\\), so \\(\\sqrt[3]{25}\\) is between 2 and 3.\n\nTo get a better estimate, I can note that \\(2.9^3 = 2.9 \\times 2.9 \\times 2.9\\)\n\nFirst, \\(2.9 \\times 2.9 = 8.41\\)\n\nThen, \\(8.41 \\times 2.9 = 24.389\\), which is less than 25.\n\nSo, \\(\\sqrt[3]{25}\\) is a bit more than 2.9.\n\nSimilarly, \\(2.95^3 = 2.95 \\times 2.95 \\times 2.95\\)\n\nFirst, \\(2.95 \\times 2.95 = 8.7025\\)\n\nThen, \\(8.7025 \\times 2.95 = 25.641\\), which is slightly more than 25.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\sqrt[3]{25}\\) is approximately 2.924, since \\(2.924^3 \\approx 25\\).\n\nSo, \\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = \\frac{1}{2.924}\\) AU\n\nNow, let's calculate this fraction:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2.924} \\approx \\frac{1}{2.924} \\times \\frac{1000}{1000} = \\frac{1000}{2924} \\approx 0.342\\) AU\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. (1/25) AU = 0.04 AU\n\nB. (1/9) AU \u2248 0.111 AU\n\nC. (1/5) AU = 0.2 AU\n\nD. (1/3) AU \u2248 0.333 AU\n\nSo, my calculation gives approximately 0.342 AU, which is closest to option D: (1/3) AU.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the approximate distance,\" and (1/3) AU is approximately 0.333 AU, which is close to my calculation of 0.342 AU.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's a more precise way to estimate this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that Mercury's actual average distance from the Sun is about 0.387 AU, but since it's an approximation, (1/3) AU is the closest among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula more precisely.\n\nLet me recall that in Kepler's third law, for circular orbits, \\(T^2 = a^3\\), assuming units where the constant of proportionality is 1.\n\nGiven that, for Mercury:\n\n\\(T = \\frac{1}{5}\\) year\n\nSo, \\(a^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(a = \\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{1/3}\\) AU\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{1}{25^{1/3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{25}}\\)\n\nAs before, \\(\\sqrt[3]{25}\\) is approximately 2.924, so \\(a \\approx \\frac{1}{2.924} \\approx 0.342\\) AU\n\nAgain, this is closest to (1/3) AU, which is approximately 0.333 AU.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if there's a better approximation among the options.\n\nOption A: (1/25) AU = 0.04 AU \u2014 too small.\n\nOption B: (1/9) AU \u2248 0.111 AU \u2014 still too small.\n\nOption C: (1/5) AU = 0.2 AU \u2014 smaller than our calculation.\n\nOption D: (1/3) AU \u2248 0.333 AU \u2014 closest to our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D: (1/3) AU.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should use the formula \\(a = k \\times T^{2/3}\\), where \\(k\\) is determined from Earth's orbit.\n\nGiven that for Earth, \\(a = 1\\) AU when \\(T = 1\\) year, then:\n\n\\(1 = k \\times 1^{2/3}\\), so \\(k = 1\\)\n\nTherefore, for Mercury:\n\n\\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = 1 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^{2/3}\\) AU\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that \\(T^2 \\propto a^3\\), and set up the proportion:\n\n\\(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}}{T_{\\text{Earth}}} = \\frac{1/5}{1} = \\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\nThen, \\(\\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}}{T_{\\text{Earth}}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}\\)\n\nAnd \\(\\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{Mercury}}}{T_{\\text{Earth}}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_{\\text{Mercury}}}{a_{\\text{Earth}}}\\right)^3\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a_{\\text{Mercury}}}{1}\\right)^3\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(a_{\\text{Mercury}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{1/3}\\) AU\n\nWhich brings me back to the same expression.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is in approximating \\(\\sqrt[3]{25}\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express 25 as \\(27 - 2\\), and use the binomial approximation for cube roots.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet \\(25 = 27 - 2\\), and let \\(x = \\sqrt[3]{25}\\)\n\nThen, \\(x = \\sqrt[3]{27 - 2}\\)\n\nI can write this as \\(x = 3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{1 - \\frac{2}{27}}\\)\n\nBut perhaps that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that \\(\\sqrt[3]{25}\\) is close to 3, but slightly less, since \\(3^3 = 27\\), which is larger than 25.\n\nSo, \\(x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{25}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2.924} \\approx 0.342\\) AU\n\nAgain, closest to (1/3) AU.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator to find the exact value.\n\nBut since this is a problem without a calculator, I need to rely on estimation.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, (1/3) AU is the closest approximation to the actual distance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: (1/3) AU.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
