The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?\n\nA. It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.\nB. It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.\nC. It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.\nD. It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a state statute that requires voters who want to write in a candidate to print the candidate's full name and specify the office in ink on the ballot. There's a write-in candidate who's German-American and his campaign manager is concerned that many German voters might not be proficient in English, so they're trying to use tear-off stickers with the candidate's name and office to make it easier for these voters. But then an election official says that these stickers don't comply with the state law because the law requires the name to be written in ink.\n\nNow, the candidate has filed a lawsuit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U.S. Constitution. The question is asking which of the given options presents the strongest constitutional argument against the state officials' interpretation.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that it unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack proficiency in the English language. Hmm, that makes sense. If the law effectively prevents voters who can't write in English from voting for a write-in candidate, that could be seen as discriminatory based on language proficiency. And discrimination based on language could be a form of national origin discrimination, which is protected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOption B says it unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office. So, here the argument is that the statute is unfair to write-in candidates compared to candidates who are on the ballot. Maybe it creates an additional burden for write-in candidates to get votes. But is that the strongest argument? Well, there are probably many rules that make it harder for write-in candidates, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're unconstitutional. The Equal Protection Clause might still apply, but I need to think about whether this particular requirement is discriminatory in a way that violates the Constitution.\n\nOption C mentions that it unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment. The Fifteenth Amendment states that the right to vote cannot be denied based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It also says that Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. But in this case, the issue seems to be about language proficiency, not race or color. Unless there's a connection between language proficiency and race, which might be a stretch, I'm not sure if this is the strongest argument here.\n\nOption D says it unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests. The Voting Rights Act was passed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote. It outlawed literacy tests and other discriminatory practices that were used to disenfranchise voters. Again, this seems to be more directly related to race and discrimination based on literacy tests, which were historically used to disenfranchise minority voters. In this scenario, the issue is about language proficiency, specifically English, which might not directly fall under the Voting Rights Act's prohibitions on literacy tests.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Option A seems to be the strongest argument. It directly addresses the discrimination against voters based on their language proficiency, which could be seen as a form of national origin discrimination, protected under the Equal Protection Clause. The other options either relate to write-in candidates generally or try to stretch the connection to federal election laws and civil rights acts that are more focused on race and literacy tests.\n\nI think the candidate's strongest constitutional argument is that the state's interpretation of the statute unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack proficiency in the English language, thereby violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
