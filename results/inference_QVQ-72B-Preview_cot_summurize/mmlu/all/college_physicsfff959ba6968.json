                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how much work needs to be done on a particle to accelerate it from rest to 0.6 times the speed of light. The particle has a mass m, and I need to choose from several options: 0.25mc\u00b2, 0.60mc\u00b2, 0.67mc\u00b2, or 1.25mc\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I remember that in classical mechanics, work is equal to the change in kinetic energy of an object. The formula for kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. But I know that at speeds comparable to the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't hold up anymore, and I need to use relativistic equations instead.\n\nSo, in relativity, the total energy of a particle is E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). The rest energy is E\u2080 = mc\u00b2, and the kinetic energy is E - E\u2080 = \u03b3mc\u00b2 - mc\u00b2 = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2.\n\nGiven that the particle starts from rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero. So, the work done should be equal to the final kinetic energy, which is (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2.\n\nGiven that the final speed is 0.6c, I need to calculate \u03b3 first.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/\u221a(1 - (0.6c)\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/\u221a(1 - 0.36) = 1/\u221a0.64 = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nThen, the kinetic energy is (1.25 - 1)mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, that's one of the options: 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nI also recall that the work-energy theorem in relativity states that the work done on a particle is equal to the change in its relativistic kinetic energy, which is what I just calculated.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider, like potential energy or something? No, because we're dealing with a single particle in motion, and no height or other forces are mentioned that would contribute to potential energy.\n\nLet me see if I can derive the same result using the momentum approach. In relativity, momentum is p = \u03b3mv. The force is dp/dt, and work is the integral of force over distance. But that seems more complicated, and I'm not sure if it's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy in terms of velocity.\n\nI know that kinetic energy can also be expressed as KE = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2, which is what I used earlier.\n\nLet me verify the value of \u03b3 again.\n\n\u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/\u221a(1 - (0.6)\u00b2) = 1/\u221a(1 - 0.36) = 1/\u221a0.64.\n\n\u221a0.64 is 0.8, so \u03b3 = 1.25.\n\nThen, KE = (1.25 - 1)mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nBut let me check if maybe I should consider the total energy required, including the rest energy. No, that doesn't make sense because the rest energy is already accounted for in the kinetic energy formula.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the work done in terms of the particle's momentum change or something else, but I think I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for relativistic kinetic energy in terms of velocity.\n\nI recall that KE = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2, which is what I used, and I arrived at 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nLet me see if there's another formula that might give a different result, but I don't think so.\n\nMaybe I should consider the limit as v approaches c, but v = 0.6c is already a significant fraction, so relativistic effects are important.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for relativistic kinetic energy in terms of velocity squared.\n\nWait, in classical mechanics, KE = (1/2)mv\u00b2, but in relativity, it's different.\n\nI think I'm confident with the (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2 formula.\n\nSo, the answer should be 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the total energy at the final speed.\n\nTotal energy E = \u03b3mc\u00b2 = 1.25mc\u00b2.\n\nInitial energy E\u2080 = mc\u00b2.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy is E - E\u2080 = 1.25mc\u00b2 - mc\u00b2 = 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 0.25mc\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.25mc^{2}} \\]"
