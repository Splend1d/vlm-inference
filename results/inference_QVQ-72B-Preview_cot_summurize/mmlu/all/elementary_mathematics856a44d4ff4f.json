                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: there are 72 students on the dance team, and 4 over 9 take tap lessons. How many students take tap lessons? Okay, let's see. It says \"4 over 9,\" which I think means that 4 out of every 9 students take tap lessons. So, I need to find out how many students that is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"4 over 9\" means in this context. It's probably a fraction, like 4/9, meaning that four ninths of the students take tap lessons. So, if there are 72 students in total, I need to find one ninth of 72, and then multiply that by 4.\n\nWait, but 72 isn't divisible by 9, is it? Let me check. 9 times 8 is 72, right? Yes, 9 times 8 is 72, so one ninth of 72 is 8. So, if 4/9 take tap lessons, that would be 4 times 8, which is 32.\n\nLet me double-check that. 4 multiplied by 8 is indeed 32. So, the answer should be 32 students take tap lessons.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 32\n\nB. 49\n\nC. 63\n\nD. 68\n\nSo, option A is 32, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can think about proportions. If 4 out of 9 students take tap lessons, then the number of students taking tap lessons is 4/9 times the total number of students.\n\nSo, 4/9 * 72 = 4 * (72/9) = 4 * 8 = 32. Yeah, that's the same as what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of percentages. 4/9 is approximately 0.444..., which is 44.44... percent. So, 44.44% of 72 students should take tap lessons.\n\nTo find 44.44% of 72, I can calculate 44.44% * 72. But that seems more complicated than just using fractions, and I might mess up with the decimals.\n\nPlus, since the problem gives the information in fractions, it's probably best to use fractions to solve it.\n\nAnother way: maybe I can set up a proportion. If 4 out of 9 students take tap lessons, then the ratio is 4:9. So, if 9 students correspond to 72, then 4 students correspond to X.\n\nSo, 9/72 = 4/X. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, maybe I should set it up as 4/9 = X/72.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, 4/9 = X/72. To solve for X, I can cross-multiply: 4 * 72 = 9 * X.\n\nSo, 288 = 9X. Then, X = 288 / 9 = 32. Again, that gives me 32.\n\nSo, all these methods point to 32 being the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe the \"4 over 9\" isn't a fraction, but something else. But no, in mathematical terms, \"4 over 9\" is almost certainly 4/9.\n\nAlso, the problem states that 4 over 9 take tap lessons, which implies that it's a fraction of the total students.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 32 students.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think about the other options. If it were 49, that would be more than half of 72, but 4/9 is less than half (since 4/9 is approximately 0.444 and half is 0.5), so 49 doesn't make sense.\n\nSimilarly, 63 is almost 72, which would be more than 4/9.\n\nAnd 68 is even higher, which doesn't fit.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that 32 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 32} \\]"
