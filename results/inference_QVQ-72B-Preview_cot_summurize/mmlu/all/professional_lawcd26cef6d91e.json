                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the Girl Scouts of America can successfully evict the tenant from the apartment building. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in 1985, there's a landowner who leases her apartment building to a tenant for seven years. The rent is supposed to be paid monthly, on the first day of each month. So, the lease term should end in 1992, right? Seven years from 1985 is 1992.\n\nThen, in 1986, the landowner dies. She leaves her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America in her will. But, the apartment building isn't specifically mentioned in the will. So, does that mean the apartment building is included in the estate and thus goes to the Girl Scouts? I think so, because she left her entire estate to them.\n\nOne month after the landowner died, the tenant finds out about her death and decides to stay on the property but stops paying rent. Hmm, that seems problematic. The tenant was supposed to be paying rent to the landowner, but now the landowner is dead, and the tenant stops paying. But the tenant didn't make any arrangements to pay rent to the Girl Scouts or anyone else, it seems.\n\nThe Girl Scouts of America didn't know about this gift until 2009, when their attorneys did an inventory of testamentary gifts and found out about the apartment building. So, from 1986 to 2009, the Girl Scouts weren't aware that they owned this property.\n\nNow, the statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. Adverse possession usually means that if someone occupies someone else's property openly, continuously, and without permission for a certain period, they can claim ownership. But in this case, the tenant had a lease, so was it adverse possession?\n\nWait, the tenant had a lease until 1992. So, up to 1992, the tenant was supposed to be paying rent. But after the landowner died in 1986, the tenant stopped paying rent. So, from 1986 to 1992, the tenant was occupying the property without paying rent. And after 1992, when the lease ended, the tenant continued to occupy the property without any lease or rental agreement.\n\nSo, from 1992 onwards, the tenant was occupying the property without any legal basis, since the lease had expired.\n\nNow, the Girl Scouts of America only found out about this in 2009, which is 23 years after the landowner's death. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. So, if the tenant has been occupying the property adversely for more than 20 years, could that mean the tenant has a claim to ownership?\n\nBut, the tenant had a lease until 1992, which was only seven years after the lease started in 1985. So, from 1992 to 2009 is 17 years. So, that's less than the 20-year statutory period. So, the tenant hasn't occupied the property adversely for the full 20 years required by law.\n\nWait, but the tenant started occupying the property in 1985 and continued until 2009, which is 24 years. But the lease was only for seven years, until 1992. So, from 1992 to 2009 is 17 years of adverse possession. Still less than the 20-year period.\n\nSo, since the tenant hasn't met the 20-year requirement for adverse possession, the Girl Scouts of America should still be the rightful owners of the apartment building.\n\nNow, in 2009, the Girl Scouts discover they own this property and decide to bring an ejection action against the tenant to regain possession.\n\nThe question is asking whether the Girl Scouts will prevail in this ejection action, and if so, why.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\n\nB. If the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.\n\nC. If the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\n\nD. Because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\n\nWell, the tenant stopped paying rent after the landowner died, but the lease was still in effect until 1992. So, the tenant was in breach of the lease agreement by not paying rent. But does that directly help the Girl Scouts in an ejection action?\n\nI think it does, because the tenant was in default of the lease terms. So, the Girl Scouts, as the new owners, could argue that the tenant is in breach of the lease and seek to evict them based on that.\n\nBut, I need to see if that's the best reason.\n\nOption B: If the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.\n\nHmm, this seems like a different scenario. If the tenant was called into military service and subleased the property to a teacher for three years, that might complicate things.\n\nIf the tenant had a valid sublease, then the subtenant (the teacher) would have rights under that lease. But the question is about the tenant, who is the original lessee.\n\nIf the tenant subleased the property, then the tenant is still the primary lessee, and the subtenant is occupying under the tenant's authority.\n\nBut, in this scenario, the tenant has been occupying the property himself, and then subleased it to a teacher for three years while being called into military service.\n\nWait, the lease was for seven years, from 1985 to 1992. If the tenant was called into military service during that time and subleased the property for three years, that would be within the original lease term.\n\nBut, the lease would still be between the tenant and the landowner/Girl Scouts. So, even if the tenant subleased, the primary lease would still be in place.\n\nBut, the tenant stopped paying rent after the landowner died in 1986. So, if the tenant subleased to a teacher, perhaps the teacher was paying rent to the tenant, but the tenant wasn't passing it on to the Girl Scouts.\n\nThis seems like it might introduce some complications, but I don't think it changes the fact that the Girl Scouts are the rightful owners and can evict the tenant for non-payment of rent.\n\nOption C: If the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\n\nWell, leases typically pass to the heirs or successors of the landlord upon their death. So, when the landowner died, her estate, including the apartment building, passed to the Girl Scouts.\n\nTherefore, the lease would have continued with the Girl Scouts as the new landlords.\n\nSo, if the tenant believed that the lease was still in effect, they should have been paying rent to the Girl Scouts or to the estate of the landowner.\n\nBut, the tenant stopped paying rent after the landowner died, assuming that the lease was still in effect but not knowing who to pay.\n\nHowever, that doesn't absolve the tenant of their obligation to pay rent. They should have made efforts to find out who the new owner was and continue paying rent to them.\n\nSo, the fact that the tenant believed the lease was still in effect doesn't necessarily help them in an ejection action, because they still had an obligation to pay rent to the rightful owner.\n\nOption D: Because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n\nWell, paying property taxes is typically the responsibility of the owner, not the tenant.\n\nSo, if the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building, that wouldn't directly affect the Girl Scouts' ability to evict the tenant.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the tenant was claiming some sort of ownership by paying taxes, but in this case, the tenant didn't pay taxes, so that doesn't seem relevant.\n\nWait, maybe if the tenant was occupying the property and paying taxes, that could be evidence of adverse possession, but in this scenario, the tenant didn't pay taxes, so that argument falls apart.\n\nSo, option D doesn't seem like a strong reason for the Girl Scouts to prevail.\n\nNow, considering all this, I think the best answer is option A: because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\n\nThe tenant was in breach of the lease agreement by not paying rent, and the Girl Scouts, as the new owners, can use that as a basis to evict the tenant.\n\nOptions B, C, and D seem less relevant or don't directly support the Girl Scouts' claim to evict the tenant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
