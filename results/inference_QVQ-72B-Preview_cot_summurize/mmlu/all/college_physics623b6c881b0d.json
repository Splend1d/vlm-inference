                    "text": "So I have this problem about a resistor in a circuit. It says that the resistor is dissipating energy at a rate of 1 watt when there's a certain voltage across it. Then, if we double that voltage, what's the new rate of energy dissipation? The options are 0.25 watts, 0.5 watts, 1 watt, or 4 watts.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how power in a resistor relates to the voltage across it. I remember that power (P) in a resistor can be calculated using the formula P = V\u00b2 / R, where V is the voltage and R is the resistance. So, power is proportional to the square of the voltage for a given resistance.\n\nSo, if the voltage is doubled, what happens to the power? Well, since power is proportional to V\u00b2, doubling the voltage should quadruple the power, right? Because (2V)\u00b2 = 4V\u00b2, and so P_new = (2V)\u00b2 / R = 4*(V\u00b2 / R) = 4*P_old.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is the resistance constant in this scenario? I think so, because resistance is a property of the resistor itself and doesn't change with voltage, at least in ohmic materials.\n\nSo, if resistance remains constant and voltage doubles, power should become four times the original power. If the original power is 1 watt, then the new power should be 4 watts.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe I should consider another formula for power. There's also P = I*V, where I is the current. If voltage doubles, does current double as well, since I = V / R? Assuming resistance is constant.\n\nSo, if V doubles to 2V, and R stays the same, then I becomes 2I. Therefore, P = 2I * 2V = 4*I*V = 4*original P.\n\nYeah, that confirms the same result. So, both approaches suggest that the power becomes four times when the voltage is doubled.\n\nWait a minute, is there any scenario where this might not hold true? For example, if the resistor's resistance changes with temperature, which could happen, but I think in this problem, we're assuming that the resistor is ideal and its resistance doesn't change.\n\nAlso, in real-world scenarios, if the power dissipation increases significantly, the temperature might go up, changing the resistance, but I don't think that's what they're testing here.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer should be 4 watts.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the units. Power is in watts, voltage in volts, and resistance in ohms. The formula P = V\u00b2 / R has units of watts, which matches the unit of power. So, no issues there.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the power formula in terms of current: P = I\u00b2 * R. But if I go that route, I'd need to express current in terms of voltage and resistance.\n\nGiven that I = V / R, then P = (V / R)\u00b2 * R = V\u00b2 / R, which brings me back to the original formula.\n\nSo, all signs point to the power being quadrupled when the voltage is doubled, assuming resistance remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the new rate of energy dissipation is 4 watts.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.25 W\n\nB. 0.5 W\n\nC. 1 W\n\nD. 4 W\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 4 W.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
