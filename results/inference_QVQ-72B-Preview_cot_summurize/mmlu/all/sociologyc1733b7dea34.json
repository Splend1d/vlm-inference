                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Durkheim's concept of 'collective representations.' I have this question here with four options, and I need to pick the one that best describes what he meant by this term. Let me think through each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that collective representations are effervescent ceremonies that create a feeling of belonging. Hmm, Durkheim did talk about effervescent states in society, especially during religious ceremonies, where people come together and feel a sense of unity and belonging. So, this seems relevant, but is it the best way to describe collective representations?\n\nOption B mentions images of gods or totems that are widely recognized. While Durkheim did study totemism and saw totems as symbols of social solidarity, I think this might be too narrow. Collective representations seem broader than just images of gods or totems.\n\nOption C says that they are shared ideas and moral values, often symbolized by an object or figurehead. This sounds quite comprehensive. Durkheim believed that society is based on shared beliefs and values, and that these can be embodied in symbols like flags, religious icons, or even abstract concepts. This seems very much in line with his thinking.\n\nOption D refers to ideological tools used to obscure class divisions. This sounds more like something Karl Marx might say. Marx believed that religion and other ideologies serve to mask the underlying class struggles in society. But Durkheim's view was different; he saw religion as a way to reinforce social bonds and collective consciousness.\n\nSo, comparing these options, I think Option C is the most accurate description of Durkheim's 'collective representations.' He was interested in how societies create shared meanings and values that are often expressed through symbols, which help to bind people together and define their social reality.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recall some of Durkheim's key ideas. In his work \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life,\" he analyzed totemism among Aboriginal tribes in Australia. He argued that totems, which are animals or natural phenomena, represent the clan and symbolize the collective consciousness of the group. So, this aligns with Option C, where shared ideas and moral values are symbolized by an object or figurehead.\n\nAlso, in his famous book \"Suicide,\" Durkheim discussed how social integration and moral regulation affect individual behavior. Collective representations would be part of the social facts that influence individuals' sense of belonging and purpose.\n\nOption A, while related, seems more about the experience of collective effervescence during ceremonies, which is a state of heightened emotion and unity, but not exactly the same as collective representations.\n\nOption B is too limited, as Durkheim's concept is broader than just images of gods or totems.\n\nAnd Option D doesn't fit because that's more aligned with Marxist theory rather than Durkheim's perspective.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is Option C: shared ideas and moral values, often symbolized by an object or figurehead.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
