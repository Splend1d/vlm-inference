                    "text": "So I have this problem here about Henry's law. It says that the Henry's law constant for CO2 dissolved in water at 25\u00b0C is 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9. And I need to find the concentration of dissolved CO2 in a vessel that's pressurized with 2.0 atm of CO2. The options are A. 1.5 M, B. 0.15 M, C. 0.067 M, and D. 0.015 M.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what Henry's law is. I remember that Henry's law relates the concentration of a gas in a liquid to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid. The formula is usually written as:\n\nc = k_p * p\n\nWhere:\n\n- c is the concentration of the gas in the liquid (usually in moles per liter or M, which is mol/L)\n\n- k_p is the Henry's law constant (given in atm M\u207b\u00b9 in this problem)\n\n- p is the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid (in atm)\n\nSo, in this problem, I'm given k_p as 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9 and p as 2.0 atm. I need to find c.\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\nc = k_p * p\n\nc = 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9 * 2.0 atm\n\nWait a minute, the units seem off here. k_p is in atm M\u207b\u00b9, and p is in atm. So multiplying them should give:\n\n(atm M\u207b\u00b9) * atm = atm\u00b2 / M\n\nBut concentration is in M, so I need to make sure about the units.\n\nLet me double-check the units of k_p. The problem says the Henry's law constant is 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9. That means it's atm per M, or equivalently, atm divided by M.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing it with another unit. Let me think.\n\nActually, Henry's law constant is often expressed in different units depending on the system. In SI units, it's sometimes given as Pa\u00b7m\u00b3/mol, but in solutions, especially in aqueous systems, it's common to see it in atm\u00b7L/mol or atm/M.\n\nIn the problem, it's given as 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9, which is equivalent to 30.0 atm/(mol/L), or 30.0 atm\u00b7L/mol.\n\nSo, the units should work out as:\n\nc = k_p * p\n\nc = (30.0 atm\u00b7L/mol) * (2.0 atm)\n\nWait, atm\u00b7L/mol * atm = atm\u00b2\u00b7L/mol\n\nBut concentration is in mol/L, so this doesn't make sense. Maybe I have the units wrong.\n\nLet me look this up. Hmm, perhaps I need to recall the exact form of Henry's law.\n\nUpon checking, Henry's law can be expressed as:\n\nc = p / k_h\n\nWhere k_h is the Henry's law constant.\n\nBut in some texts, k_h is defined as p / c, leading to c = p / k_h.\n\nGiven that, maybe the units are being misinterpreted.\n\nGiven that k_p is 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9, if k_p is defined as p / c, then k_p = p / c, so c = p / k_p.\n\nSo, c = 2.0 atm / 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9 = 2.0 / 30.0 M = 0.0666... M, which is approximately 0.067 M.\n\nLooking at the options, C. 0.067 M seems to match.\n\nBut wait, the problem says k_p is 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9, which seems to suggest that k_p is defined as p / c, so c = p / k_p.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes Henry's law is written as c = k_p * p, with k_p in M/atm.\n\nI think there might be confusion in the units here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn chemistry, Henry's law is often expressed as:\n\nc = k_p * p\n\nWhere k_p is the Henry's law constant, with units that depend on the concentration units.\n\nIf c is in mol/L (M), then k_p should have units of M/atm, not atm/M\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut in some physics texts, Henry's law is written as p = k_h * c, where k_h has units of atm/M.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is using k_p = k_h, leading to confusion in units.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct expression should be c = p / k_p, where k_p is in atm/M.\n\nWait, but atm/M is the same as atm\u00b7L/mol, which is a different unit from M/atm.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider the definition of Henry's law in terms of solubility.\n\nHenry's law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid.\n\nMathematically, c = k_p * p, where k_p is the Henry's law constant.\n\nThe units of k_p should be such that when multiplied by pressure, it gives concentration.\n\nIf p is in atm and c is in M (mol/L), then k_p should have units of M/atm.\n\nBut in the problem, k_p is given as 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9, which is atm/(mol/L), or atm\u00b7L/mol.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps k_p is being defined differently here.\n\nMaybe k_p is defined as p / c, which would make it have units of atm/M.\n\nIn that case, the correct expression would be c = p / k_p.\n\nGiven that, c = 2.0 atm / 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9 = 2.0 / 30.0 M = 0.0666... M \u2248 0.067 M.\n\nSo, option C. 0.067 M would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if k_p is indeed 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9, and c = k_p * p, then:\n\nc = 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9 * 2.0 atm = 60.0 atm\u00b2 M\u207b\u00b9\n\nWhich doesn't make sense in terms of concentration units.\n\nTherefore, it's more plausible that the correct expression is c = p / k_p, leading to c = 2.0 / 30.0 M = 0.0666... M \u2248 0.067 M.\n\nHence, the answer should be C. 0.067 M.\n\nI think the initial confusion was due to the units of k_p being given as atm M\u207b\u00b9, which suggests it's p / c, not k_p * p.\n\nSo, to avoid such confusion in the future, it's important to confirm the definition of the constant being used.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
