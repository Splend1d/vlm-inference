Let's break down each one to understand what they're saying.\n\nOption A says \"Acting subjects: who or what is acting to produce security or insecurity.\" This seems to refer to the entities that are responsible for creating secure or insecure conditions. In security studies, it's common to discuss actors like states, non-state actors, international organizations, etc., that can influence security. So, this definition makes sense.\n\nOption B is \"Substantive content: what being secure looks like and what conditions must exist for us to be able to say we are secure.\" This appears to be about the actual meaning and components of security. It's about defining what security entails and the criteria for achieving it. This is aligns with how substantive content is often discussed in security theory.\n\nOption C states \"Referent object: whom or what we act to make secure.\" In security studies, the referent object is indeed the entity that is being secured. Traditionally, this was the state, but over time, it has expanded to include individuals, groups, and even the environment. So, this definition is accurate.\n\nOption D reads \"Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation.\" This suggests that some security issues are absolute and can be determined without subjective interpretation. However, in reality, security is often a construct that varies based on context and perspective. What constitutes a security threat can differ significantly across cultures, societies, and time periods. Therefore, the idea of objective security, devoid of interpretation, seems problematic.\n\nGiven this, it appears that Option D is not a correct definition because it implies a universal, interpretation-free understanding of security issues, which isn't consistent with how security is viewed in academic and practical terms. Security is largely a socially constructed concept, meaning that it's shaped by social, political, and cultural factors, and thus interpretations play a crucial role in defining what is or isn't a security issue.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Option D is the one that doesn't fit as a correct definition in the field of security studies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
