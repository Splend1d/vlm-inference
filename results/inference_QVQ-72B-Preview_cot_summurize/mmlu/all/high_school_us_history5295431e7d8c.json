                    "text": "So I've got this question here about desegregation of schools, and it's referring to Brown v. Board of Education from 1954. The question is asking which initiative, among The Great Society, The Square Deal, The New Deal, or Reconstruction, was partially responsible for desegregation due to unfulfilled promises. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let me think this through step by step.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the context of Brown v. Board of Education. This was a landmark Supreme Court case that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. It overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 and was a major victory for the civil rights movement.\n\nNow, the question is saying that desegregation of schools was, in part, a response to unfulfilled promises from one of these initiatives. So, I need to recall what each of these initiatives was about and see which one had promises or goals related to civil rights or equality that weren't fully realized, leading to the need for desegregation efforts.\n\nLet's start with Reconstruction. Reconstruction was the period after the American Civil War, from about 1865 to 1877, when the federal government tried to rebuild the southern states and integrate newly freed slaves into society. It involved a lot of efforts to reconstruct the economy, politics, and social structure of the South. One of the key aspects was the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to former slaves, and gave them voting rights, respectively.\n\nHowever, after Reconstruction ended, many of these gains were rolled back. Southern states passed Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation and disenfranchised black voters. These laws remained in place for nearly a century, until the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s successfully challenged them.\n\nSo, in terms of unfulfilled promises, Reconstruction certainly fits the bill. The promises of equality and civil rights for African Americans were not fully realized, and segregation became the norm in many parts of the country, especially the South. Brown v. Board of Education was a direct challenge to this segregation in public education, which was a key aspect of the Jim Crow system.\n\nNow, let's consider The New Deal. The New Deal was a series of programs and policies implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1930s to help the country recover from the Great Depression. It included things like the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Works Progress Administration (WPA), and Social Security.\n\nWhile The New Deal did help millions of Americans, it also had its limitations regarding civil rights. Some New Deal programs were segregated, and African Americans often received less support or were excluded from certain benefits. For example, the National Recovery Administration (NRA) sometimes allowed employers to pay lower wages to black workers. Additionally, the Social Security Act initially excluded agricultural and domestic workers, which disproportionately affected African Americans.\n\nSo, while The New Deal did provide some assistance to African Americans, it also perpetuated inequalities and didn't address the issue of segregation head-on. However, compared to Reconstruction, which directly addressed slavery and citizenship, The New Deal's connection to desegregation seems less direct.\n\nMoving on to The Square Deal. This was a set of policies promoted by President Theodore Roosevelt at the turn of the 20th century. It focused on three main areas: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection. While The Square Deal had some progressive elements, it didn't directly address issues of race or segregation. Roosevelt did appoint some African Americans to federal positions and was known for having lunch with African American leader Booker T. Washington, which was controversial at the time. However, overall, The Square Deal wasn't primarily concerned with civil rights issues.\n\nLastly, there's The Great Society, which was a set of social reform programs initiated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the mid-1960s. These programs aimed to eliminate poverty and racial injustice. Notable achievements of The Great Society include the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Medicare and Medicaid. These initiatives made significant strides in advancing civil rights and addressing social inequalities.\n\nGiven that The Great Society was focused on civil rights and social justice, it might seem like a likely candidate for having unfulfilled promises that led to desegregation efforts. However, it's important to note that The Great Society came after Brown v. Board of Education, which was in 1954. The Civil Rights Act was in 1964, and the Voting Rights Act was in 1965, both following Brown by over a decade.\n\nWait a minute, if The Great Society came after Brown v. Board of Education, then it couldn't have been an initiative whose unfulfilled promises led directly to desegregation efforts in the 1950s. Instead, it was more of a response to the civil rights movement that had been gaining momentum since the Brown decision.\n\nSo, putting all this together, it seems that Reconstruction is the most fitting answer. The promises made during Reconstruction regarding equality and civil rights for African Americans were not fully realized, and segregation became entrenched in American society. This set the stage for the civil rights movement and legal challenges like Brown v. Board of Education, which sought to dismantle segregation in public education.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the timeline:\n\n- Reconstruction: 1865-1877\n\n- Plessy v. Ferguson: 1896 (upholding \"separate but equal\")\n\n- Brown v. Board of Education: 1954 (overturning \"separate but equal\")\n\n- The New Deal: 1930s\n\n- The Square Deal: Early 1900s\n\n- The Great Society: 1960s\n\nFrom this timeline, it's clear that Reconstruction was the earliest period, followed by the establishment of segregation, and then the civil rights movement and legal challenges in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nTherefore, the desegregation of schools in the 1950s was, in part, a response to unfulfilled promises from Reconstruction, which had failed to ensure true equality and civil rights for African Americans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D.
