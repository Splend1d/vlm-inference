                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Me and three friends went to a concert, and the total cost for four tickets is $112. I need to write and solve an equation to find the cost of one ticket, which is called t.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are four tickets in total, and they cost $112 altogether. So, if all tickets cost the same, I need to find the cost per ticket.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up. If four tickets cost $112, then to find the cost of one ticket, I should divide the total cost by the number of tickets. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if I let t be the cost of one ticket, then:\n\n4 * t = 112\n\nBecause four tickets equal $112.\n\nNow, I need to solve for t. To do that, I should divide both sides of the equation by 4.\n\nSo, t = 112 / 4\n\nLet me calculate that. 112 divided by 4 is 28.\n\nSo, t = $28\n\nThat seems straightforward. Now, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 4t = 112; $448\n\nB. 4t = 112; $28\n\nC. t over 4 = 112; $448\n\nD. t over 4 = 112; $28\n\nOption B matches what I just did: 4t = 112, and t = $28.\n\nOption A also has 4t = 112 but then says $448, which doesn't make sense because 4t = 112 implies t = 28, not 448.\n\nOption C says t over 4 = 112, which would be t/4 = 112. To solve for t, I'd multiply both sides by 4, so t = 112 * 4 = 448. But that doesn't align with the correct approach.\n\nOption D has t over 4 = 112 and then lists $28, which doesn't match because, as I just calculated, t = 448 if t/4 = 112.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct answer: 4t = 112; $28.\n\nWait a minute, but option C is t over 4 = 112, which would give t = 448. That doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because if four tickets cost $112, then each ticket can't cost $448. That would make the total for four tickets $1792, which is way more than $112.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option C is incorrect.\n\nOption A has the correct equation, 4t = 112, but then lists $448, which is incorrect, as t should be $28.\n\nOption D has t over 4 = 112, which is incorrect for the given problem, and lists $28, which doesn't follow from that equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: 4t = 112; $28.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the total cost divided by the number of tickets should give the cost per ticket.\n\nSo, total cost = number of tickets * cost per ticket.\n\nGiven total cost is $112, and number of tickets is 4, so:\n\n112 = 4 * t\n\nAgain, solving for t gives t = 112 / 4 = 28.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of shares, each person pays the same amount, so dividing the total cost by the number of tickets gives the cost per ticket.\n\nAgain, 112 divided by 4 is 28.\n\nSo, t = $28.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
