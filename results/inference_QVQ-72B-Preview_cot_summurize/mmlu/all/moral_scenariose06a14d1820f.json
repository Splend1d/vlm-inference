                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I put saran wrap over the sleeping baby.\n\nScenario 2: I left the bartender a large tip in their tip jar.\n\nOkay, so both of these involve actions done by the main character, referred to as \"I.\" Now, the question is asking which of these actions is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me start by considering Scenario 1: putting saran wrap over a sleeping baby.\n\nHmm, that sounds really dangerous. Saran wrap is a type of plastic wrap, right? It's used for covering food and such. But putting it over a baby seems extremely hazardous. Babies need to breathe properly, and covering their face with plastic could lead to suffocation or other respiratory issues. This could be life-threatening.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally covering a baby's face with something that could obstruct their breathing seems profoundly wrong. It's putting the baby in harm's way deliberately. I can't think of any ordinary moral standard that would condone such an action. So, for Scenario 1, I would say it's \"Wrong.\"\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: leaving the bartender a large tip in their tip jar.\n\nTipping is a common practice in the US, especially in the service industry. It's a way to show appreciation for good service and to supplement the income of service workers, like bartenders, who often rely on tips to make a living wage.\n\nLeaving a large tip would mean giving more than the standard amount, which is typically around 15-20% of the bill. So, if someone leaves a \"large\" tip, say 25% or more, that's generally seen as generous and appreciated.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, tipping generously doesn't seem wrong at all. In fact, it could be seen as a kind and considerate act, especially if the service was exceptional. It's a voluntary act of generosity that benefits another person.\n\nHowever, there might be some contexts where tipping could be considered wrong. For example, if the tip was intended to influence the bartender to do something unethical, like serving alcohol to a minor. But the scenario doesn't specify any such intention; it simply says \"I left the bartender a large tip in their tip jar.\"\n\nAssuming no ulterior motives, leaving a large tip seems morally acceptable. It's an act of kindness and recognition for the bartender's work.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, I would say it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, putting these together, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nIn Scenario 1, maybe the person didn't intend to harm the baby but was trying to do something else, like prevent the baby from seeing something. But even then, using saran wrap over a baby's face is extremely risky and negligent, regardless of the intention.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perhaps there's a cultural nuance I'm missing, but based on US standards, tipping generously is generally seen as positive.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
