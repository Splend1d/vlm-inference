                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out what the earliest form of writing is and where it developed. The options are:\n\nA. cuneiform, in Mesopotamia\n\nB. hieroglyphics, in Egypt\n\nC. clay-tablets, at Knossos\n\nD. runes, at Stonehenge\n\nHmm, I think I remember that cuneiform is one of the earliest forms of writing, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact origins or timelines of these writing systems.\n\nLet me start by recalling what I know about cuneiform. Cuneiform is a type of writing that was used in ancient Mesopotamia, which is often considered the cradle of civilization. It was developed by the Sumerians around 3500-3000 BCE. The writing was done on clay tablets using a stylus, and the symbols were wedge-shaped, hence the name \"cuneiform\" which means \"wedge-shaped.\"\n\nNext, there's hieroglyphics from ancient Egypt. I know that hieroglyphics are pictorial symbols that represent words or sounds. They were used extensively in Egyptian writing and are famously found on the Rosetta Stone. But when did hieroglyphics first appear? I think it was around 3100 BCE, which is slightly later than cuneiform.\n\nThen there are clay-tablets from Knossos. Knossos is an archaeological site on the island of Crete, Greece, and it was the center of the Minoan civilization. The Minoans used a writing system called Linear A, which is still undeciphered. These clay-tablets were primarily used for record-keeping. However, I believe that this writing system developed much later than cuneiform or hieroglyphics, probably around 1700-1450 BCE.\n\nLastly, there are runes at Stonehenge. Runes are a series of symbols used by Germanic peoples in Europe from about the 1st to the 11th century CE. Stonehenge, on the other hand, is a prehistoric monument in England, and while it's an important cultural site, I don't recall any runic inscriptions being found there. In fact, the earliest form of writing in Britain was likely Ogham, which dates from the 4th century CE, still much later than the other writing systems mentioned here.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that cuneiform from Mesopotamia is the earliest among the options provided. But just to be thorough, I should double-check the timelines.\n\nCuneiform dates back to around 3500-3000 BCE, hieroglyphics around 3100 BCE, Linear A from Knossos around 1700-1450 BCE, and runes from around the 1st century CE. So, yes, cuneiform is the earliest form of writing among these options.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that hieroglyphics could be older than cuneiform? I think cuneiform predates hieroglyphics by a few centuries, but I might be wrong. Let me verify this.\n\nUpon checking, cuneiform indeed developed earlier than hieroglyphics. The earliest cuneiform tablets date back to around 3500-3000 BCE, while hieroglyphics began to emerge around 3100 BCE. So, cuneiform is older by a couple of centuries.\n\nWhat about other writing systems that might be even older than cuneiform? For example, I've heard of proto-writing systems in other parts of the world, but I don't think any of them predate cuneiform.\n\nOne notable example is the Jiahu symbols from China, which date back to around 6600-6200 BCE. However, these symbols are more of a proto-writing system and their status as a true writing system is debated. Similarly, there are other early symbol systems, like those from the Indus Valley Civilization, but again, these are later than cuneiform.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the historical records, cuneiform from Mesopotamia is considered the earliest form of writing in the world.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be:\n\nA. cuneiform, in Mesopotamia\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
