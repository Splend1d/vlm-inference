                    "text": "So I have this question about images formed by lenses and mirrors. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nOption A says that images produced by concave lenses are always real. Hmm, I think I remember that concave lenses always produce virtual images. Let me confirm that. Concave lenses are thinner in the middle and thicker at the edges, and they diverge light rays. So, when parallel rays enter a concave lens, they emerge as if they're coming from a point behind the lens. That's a virtual image, right? So, actually, concave lenses produce virtual images, not real ones. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says that images produced by concave mirrors are always real. Concave mirrors are curved inward like a spoon and can focus light rays to a point. I recall that concave mirrors can produce both real and virtual images, depending on the object distance. If the object is beyond the center of curvature, it should produce a real image. If the object is between the focus and the mirror, it produces a virtual image. So, saying \"always real\" is not accurate. Therefore, option B is false.\n\nOption C states that images produced by convex lenses can be both real and virtual. Convex lenses are thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges, and they converge light rays. I know that convex lenses can produce real images when the object is beyond the focal point, and virtual images when the object is within the focal length. So, yes, they can produce both types of images. That seems correct.\n\nOption D says that images produced by convex mirrors can be both real and virtual. Convex mirrors are curved outward and diverge light rays. I think convex mirrors always produce virtual images. Let me think about that. When parallel rays hit a convex mirror, they reflect in such a way that they seem to come from a point behind the mirror. That's a virtual image. I don't think convex mirrors can produce real images. So, option D is incorrect because they only produce virtual images.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option C: images produced by convex lenses can be both real and virtual.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
