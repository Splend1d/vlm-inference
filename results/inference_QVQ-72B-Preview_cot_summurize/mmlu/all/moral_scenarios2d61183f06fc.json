                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" So, I need to evaluate each scenario separately and determine if they're morally wrong or not.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: \"She wanted to decorate the apartment in a Halloween theme, so I poured plastic spiders throughout the apartment so that we would have spider decorations.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone wanted to decorate their apartment for Halloween, and the other person helped by pouring plastic spiders around to create spider decorations. Hmm, Halloween is a time when people often decorate their homes with spooky themes, and spiders are a common decoration for that holiday. Using plastic spiders seems pretty standard for Halloween decor.\n\nBut, I need to think about whether this action is morally wrong. Morality usually involves harm to others, intention behind actions, and societal norms. In this case, the intention was to decorate for a holiday, which is generally a harmless and fun activity. The action itself\u2014placing plastic spiders around the apartment\u2014doesn't seem to cause any harm, especially since they're just decorations.\n\nUnless there's some context I'm missing, like if the person is extremely afraid of spiders or something, but the scenario doesn't provide that information. It just says they wanted to decorate for Halloween, and the other person helped by providing spider decorations.\n\nSo, based on the information given, I don't think Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action. It seems like a benign, perhaps even delightful, way to decorate for the occasion.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I took a photo of my cousin washing in the bath.\"\n\nThis one feels more sensitive. Taking a photo of someone without their knowledge, especially in a private setting like a bathroom, raises serious privacy concerns. Bathing is typically considered a private activity, and most people expect privacy while bathing.\n\nIn the US, there are laws protecting individuals' privacy, particularly in their own homes and in situations where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Taking a photo of someone bathing without their consent would likely be considered a violation of their privacy rights.\n\nMoreover, from a moral standpoint, respecting others' privacy is an important ethical consideration. Taking a photo of someone in such a private moment without their knowledge or consent is generally seen as invasive and disrespectful.\n\nAdditionally, if the person is a minor, which the term \"cousin\" might imply, there are even more stringent protections in place to prevent such intrusions.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the action of taking a photo of a cousin bathing without their knowledge or consent is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 1, I don't think it's morally wrong, but for Scenario 2, it is morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the right answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that Scenario 1 could be morally wrong based on some other perspective.\n\nFor example, maybe the person didn't clean up the decorations afterward, causing a mess or damage to the apartment. But the scenario doesn't mention any negative consequences or lack of cleanup. It just says they decorated with plastic spiders.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the person who wanted the decorations didn't actually agree to having plastic spiders everywhere, but again, the scenario says \"she wanted to decorate the apartment in a Halloween theme,\" so it seems like they were on board with the idea.\n\nUnless there's some implicit harm or negative consequence that I'm not seeing, I think it's safe to say that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong due to the invasion of privacy and potential harm caused by such an action.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
