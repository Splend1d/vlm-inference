                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the universe's temperature and the distances between galaxies. It says that right now, the universe's temperature is about 3 Kelvin (K), and it's asking what things were like when the temperature was 12 K. The options are about how distant typical objects, like galaxies, were compared to today.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the universe's temperature and the distances between galaxies. I remember that the universe is expanding, and as it expands, the temperature decreases. So, if the temperature was higher in the past, like 12 K, that means the universe was smaller back then, and galaxies were closer together.\n\nBut how exactly are temperature and distance related? I think there's a connection through the redshift of light. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is a remnant from the early universe, and its temperature is related to the scale factor of the universe's expansion.\n\nLet me recall: the temperature of the CMB is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe. That means T \u221d 1/a, where T is the temperature and a is the scale factor.\n\nIf the current temperature is 3 K, and the temperature in the past was 12 K, I can set up a ratio based on the scale factor.\n\nSo, if T_now = 3 K corresponds to a_now (current scale factor), and T_past = 12 K corresponds to a_past, then:\n\nT_now / T_past = a_past / a_now\n\nPlugging in the values: 3 K / 12 K = a_past / a_now\n\nThat simplifies to 1/4 = a_past / a_now\n\nSo, a_past = a_now / 4\n\nThat means the scale factor was one-fourth of what it is today. Since the scale factor relates to the distances between galaxies, this suggests that galaxies were one-fourth as distant from each other in the past when the temperature was 12 K.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. one-quarter as distant as they are today\n\nB. one-half as distant as they are today\n\nC. separated by about the same distances as they are today\n\nD. two times as distant as they are today\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the answer should be A. one-quarter as distant as they are today.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this reasoning. The relationship T \u221d 1/a is based on the conservation of photon number density as the universe expands. As the universe expands, the wavelength of light increases, and thus its energy decreases, leading to a lower temperature. So, if the temperature is inversely proportional to the scale factor, then yes, a_past = a_now / 4 when T_past = 12 K and T_now = 3 K.\n\nBut I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect the distance between galaxies besides the scale factor. For example, dark energy or other components of the universe that might influence the expansion rate.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of this problem, and given the information provided, it seems reasonable to use the simple proportionality between temperature and the inverse of the scale factor.\n\nAnother way to think about it is through the redshift. The redshift z is related to the scale factor by z + 1 = a_now / a_past. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here, since the question is directly about the distances.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the distance formula in an expanding universe, such as the comoving distance, which remains constant over time, or the proper distance, which evolves with the scale factor.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question seems to be testing the understanding of the relationship between the universe's temperature and its size or scale factor.\n\nSo, sticking with the initial approach, the answer should be A. one-quarter as distant as they are today.\n\nWait a minute, but I have a doubt. If the scale factor is one-fourth, does that directly translate to distances being one-fourth as far? In cosmology, distances scale directly with the scale factor, so yes, proper distances between galaxies would be proportional to the scale factor.\n\nTherefore, if a_past = a_now / 4, then distances were one-fourth of what they are today.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
