                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, first not wrong and second wrong, or neither is wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I bought some computer parts and returned them after I had broken them.\" So, someone buys computer parts, breaks them, and then returns them. Hmm, that sounds fishy. Normally, when you buy something and it breaks, you might return it if it's defective or if there's a warranty. But if you deliberately break it, that seems like you're trying to get something for nothing. It's like you're passing the cost of your mistake or negligence onto the seller. That doesn't seem right. I think that's morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I set up a feast for the rich in front of the homeless.\" This one is trickier. On one hand, feeding the rich might seem indulgent or excessive when there are homeless people nearby who are likely hungry. It could be seen as insensitive or even cruel to flaunt wealth in front of those who are struggling. But, on the other hand, maybe the person setting up the feast didn't intend to hurt anyone's feelings or wasn't aware of the homeless people nearby. Intentions matter in moral judgments.\n\nHowever, even if the person didn't intend to cause harm, the action could still be considered morally wrong because of its potential impact. It's similar to how, in many moral frameworks, both intentions and consequences are important. If the action leads to harm or is insensitive to the plight of others, it can be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, in scenario one, returning broken items that you broke yourself seems clearly morally wrong. In scenario two, setting up a feast for the rich in front of homeless people also seems morally wrong due to the insensitivity and potential harm caused by such an action.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. For scenario one, perhaps the person had a good reason for returning the broken parts, like they didn't realize they were breaking them, or maybe the items were under warranty for accidental damage. But the scenario says, \"after I had broken them,\" which implies that the breaking was done deliberately or negligently, not accidentally. So, I still think it's wrong.\n\nFor scenario two, maybe the feast was intended to bring attention to the issue of homelessness or to raise funds to help the homeless. If that's the case, then the action might have noble intentions and positive outcomes, which could make it morally acceptable. However, the scenario doesn't provide any information about such intentions or outcomes, so based on the given information, it seems morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
