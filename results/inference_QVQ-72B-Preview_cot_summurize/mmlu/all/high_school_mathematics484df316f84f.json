                    "text": "So I have this problem: \"How many distinct diagonals of a convex hexagon can be drawn?\" And the options are A. 6, B. 8, C. 9, D. 36. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on geometry, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst off, I know that a hexagon has 6 sides. And in a convex hexagon, all the diagonals are straight lines connecting non-adjacent vertices. So, to find the number of distinct diagonals, I need to find how many such connections are possible.\n\nI recall that in any polygon, a diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices. So, in a hexagon, which has 6 vertices, how many such connections can I make?\n\nLet me try to list them out. Let's label the hexagon's vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F, say in order around the hexagon.\n\nFrom vertex A, I can draw diagonals to vertices C, D, E, and F. Wait, but F is adjacent to A in a hexagon, right? No, actually, in a hexagon, each vertex has exactly one neighbor on each side, so from A, I can draw diagonals to C, D, and E. F is adjacent to A, so not a diagonal.\n\nFrom vertex B, I can draw diagonals to D, E, and F. Wait, but F is adjacent to B, so maybe not F. Let me check: in a hexagon, B is connected to A and C, so from B, diagonals go to D, E, and F would be adjacent. Wait, no, F is adjacent to B, so diagonal to F would not be allowed. So, from B, diagonals to D and E only.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nI remember that in a polygon with n sides, the number of diagonals can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of diagonals} = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\n\\]\n\nLet me verify that. For a triangle, n=3, and \\(\\frac{3(3-3)}{2} = 0\\), which makes sense because a triangle has no diagonals. For a square, n=4, \\(\\frac{4(4-3)}{2} = 2\\), which is correct. For a pentagon, n=5, \\(\\frac{5(5-3)}{2} = 5\\), also correct.\n\nSo, for a hexagon, n=6, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of diagonals} = \\frac{6(6-3)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 3}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\nOkay, so according to this formula, the number of distinct diagonals in a convex hexagon is 9. But let me make sure I understand why this formula works.\n\nThe formula \\(\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\) comes from the fact that from each vertex, you can draw a diagonal to \\(n - 3\\) other vertices (since you can't draw a diagonal to itself or to its two adjacent vertices). Since there are n vertices, this gives \\(n(n-3)\\), but each diagonal is counted twice (once from each endpoint), so we divide by 2 to get the correct count.\n\nLet me apply this reasoning to the hexagon to confirm.\n\nWith 6 vertices, from each vertex, I can draw diagonals to \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) other vertices. So, from each of the 6 vertices, 3 diagonals can be drawn, giving a total of \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\), but since each diagonal is counted twice, dividing by 2 gives 9 diagonals.\n\nThat seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let's try listing all the diagonals in a hexagon.\n\nLabel the vertices A, B, C, D, E, F in order.\n\nThe possible diagonals are:\n\n- A to C\n\n- A to D\n\n- A to E\n\n- B to D\n\n- B to E\n\n- B to F\n\n- C to E\n\n- C to F\n\n- D to F\n\nWait, but in a hexagon, F is adjacent to A and B, E is adjacent to A and C, D is adjacent to B and C, and so on.\n\nLooking back at my list:\n\n- A to C\n\n- A to D\n\n- A to E\n\n- B to D\n\n- B to E\n\n- B to F\n\n- C to E\n\n- C to F\n\n- D to F\n\nThat's 9 diagonals, which matches the formula's result.\n\nBut earlier, I was getting confused about whether F is adjacent to B or not. In a hexagon, yes, F is adjacent to B, so no diagonal from B to F. Wait, but in my list, I have B to F. That might be incorrect.\n\nLet me re-examine the connections:\n\n- From A: to C, D, E (F is adjacent)\n\n- From B: to D, E (F is adjacent)\n\n- From C: to E, F (D is adjacent)\n\n- From D: to F (E is adjacent)\n\n- From E: no new diagonals since F is adjacent\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me try to list them again more carefully.\n\nVertices: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nDiagonals:\n\n1. A to C\n\n2. A to D\n\n3. A to E\n\n4. B to D\n\n5. B to E\n\n6. C to E\n\n7. C to F\n\n8. D to F\n\n9. E to F\n\nWait a minute, is E to F a diagonal? In a hexagon, E and F are adjacent vertices, so E to F is a side, not a diagonal. Similarly, C to F is a diagonal only if F is not adjacent to C, but in a hexagon, F is adjacent to C and D.\n\nWait, no, in a hexagon, each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices. So, F is connected to E and to D. Therefore, C to F is not a diagonal because F is adjacent to C via D.\n\nSimilarly, D to F is a diagonal only if F is not adjacent to D, but in reality, F is adjacent to D in a hexagon.\n\nI think I'm getting tangled up here. Maybe drawing a hexagon would help, but since I can't do that right now, I need another way to confirm.\n\nLet me consider the general formula again: \\(\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\). For n=6, it gives 9 diagonals. My earlier listing had 9, but I'm now doubting whether all those are indeed diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the combinations of vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 6 is \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\), which is 15. Out of these 15, some are sides and the rest are diagonals.\n\nIn a hexagon, there are 6 sides. So, total diagonals would be \\(\\binom{6}{2} - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9\\). This matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct diagonals is 9.\n\nBut wait, one of the options is 36, which seems way off. That must be incorrect, probably a distractor.\n\nAnother option is 8, which is close to 9. Maybe someone would mistakenly count one less or one more.\n\nBut based on the formula and the combinatorial approach, 9 seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
