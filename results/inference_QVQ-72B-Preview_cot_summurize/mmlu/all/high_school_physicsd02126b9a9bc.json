                    "text": "So I have this problem about a soccer ball that's kicked with an initial velocity of 10 m/s at a launch angle of 30 degrees. I need to find its total flight time, assuming no air resistance. The options are 0.5 s, 1 s, 2 s, and 4 s.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equations of motion for projectile motion without air resistance. I know that the motion can be split into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal component is constant because there's no acceleration in the horizontal direction (neglecting air resistance), while the vertical component is affected by gravity.\n\nLet me start by finding the initial velocities in the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nThe initial velocity is 10 m/s at an angle of 30 degrees.\n\nSo, the horizontal component, Vx, is 10 * cos(30\u00b0), and the vertical component, Vy, is 10 * sin(30\u00b0).\n\nI know that cos(30\u00b0) is \u221a3/2 and sin(30\u00b0) is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, Vx = 10 * (\u221a3/2) = 5\u221a3 m/s, and Vy = 10 * (1/2) = 5 m/s.\n\nNow, the total flight time is determined by the time it takes for the ball to return to the ground, which means the vertical displacement is zero.\n\nThe time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height is Vy / g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2).\n\nSo, time to reach maximum height = Vy / g = 5 / 9.8 \u2248 0.51 seconds.\n\nBut this is only half the total flight time because the ball goes up and then comes back down.\n\nTherefore, total flight time should be approximately 2 * 0.51 \u2248 1.02 seconds.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest one is 1 second, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.\n\nLet me use the equation for vertical displacement:\n\ny = Vy * t - (1/2) * g * t\u00b2\n\nSince the ball starts and ends at y = 0, we have:\n\n0 = Vy * t - (1/2) * g * t\u00b2\n\nPlugging in Vy = 5 m/s and g = 9.8 m/s\u00b2:\n\n0 = 5t - 4.9t\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by t (assuming t \u2260 0):\n\n0 = 5 - 4.9t\n\nSo, t = 5 / 4.9 \u2248 1.0204 seconds.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation of approximately 1 second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 1 s.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the range of a projectile, but since I don't know the horizontal displacement, that might not help directly.\n\nWait, actually, for the total flight time, I think the formula is t = 2 * Vy / g.\n\nLet me verify that.\n\nYes, for projectile motion with no air resistance, the total time of flight is t = 2 * Vy / g.\n\nSo, t = 2 * 5 / 9.8 = 10 / 9.8 \u2248 1.0204 seconds.\n\nAgain, this points to option B. 1 s.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider the horizontal component.\n\nSince there's no acceleration horizontally, the horizontal velocity remains constant.\n\nThe horizontal displacement would be Vx * t, but since I don't have information about the horizontal displacement, this doesn't help me find t.\n\nTherefore, I don't need to consider the horizontal component further for this problem.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the total flight time is approximately 1 second, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1 \\text{ s}} \\]"
