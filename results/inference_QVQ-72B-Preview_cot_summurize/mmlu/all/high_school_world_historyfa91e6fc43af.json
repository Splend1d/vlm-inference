But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Western imperialism, and it's referring to two passages. One is from William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India in 1829, talking about the practice of sati, which I believe is the Hindu practice of widows immolating themselves on their husband's funeral pyre. The other passage is from George Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826, discussing how to deal with Indigenous peoples in trade.\n\nThe question is saying that the first passage undermines a commonly held assumption about Western imperialism. So, I need to understand what Bentinck is saying and see which option it contradicts.\n\nFirst, let's break down Bentinck's statement. He's talking about whether to continue or discontinue the practice of sati. He says that allowing it to continue, knowing that they could prevent it, is a horrible thought because it leads to the death of innocent women. But, on the other hand, trying to stop it could endanger the British Empire in India because it might cause unrest or resistance from the local population.\n\nHe mentions that in the past, when there were powerful neighbors and more uncertainty about British security, it might have been wiser to proceed cautiously. But now that the British are supreme in India, he thinks there should be an open and general prohibition of sati.\n\nSo, Bentinck is weighing the moral imperative to stop a practice he considers cruel against the political risk of doing so, which could threaten British rule in India. Ultimately, he comes down in favor of prohibition because of the British dominance at the time.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices.\n\nWell, Bentinck is discussing whether to interfere with the practice of sati, which is a religious practice. He's considering prohibiting it. So, this seems to be confirming that colonizers did interfere with native religious practices, not undermining it. Therefore, it probably doesn't fit.\n\nB. That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits.\n\nThis seems more related to economic interests and profitability. The passage from Bentinck is more about moral and political considerations regarding a cultural practice. It doesn't directly address profit-making. So, maybe not this one.\n\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.\n\nThis suggests that all European colonizers were eager to impose their culture on the locals. Now, Bentinck is considering prohibiting sati, which could be seen as imposing British moral standards on Indian society. However, he's also acknowledging the potential risks to British rule in doing so and suggests that in the past, when British power was less secure, they might have been more cautious about interfering.\n\nSo, while he does advocate for prohibition based on moral grounds, he's also recognizing that this is a sensitive issue that could have political repercussions. This seems to suggest that while he is willing to interfere based on his moral convictions, he's not doing so lightly and is considering the potential consequences.\n\nTherefore, this passage might undermine the idea that all European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on natives, because Bentinck is showing some hesitation and consideration of the political context.\n\nD. That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects.\n\nThis is about the use of military force to enforce colonial policies. Bentinck's passage doesn't mention armed force; it's more about the moral and political dilemma of prohibiting a practice like sati.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the one that the first passage undermines. By showing that Bentinck is cautious and considers the political implications of interfering with local practices, it suggests that not all colonizers were eager to impose their culture without consideration of the consequences.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?\" and it's specifically about the first passage, which is Bentinck's.\n\nBut I should also consider the second passage by George Simpson, even though the question specifies the first passage. Maybe the second passage reinforces one of the other options, but the question is specifically about the first passage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the contrast between the two passages is meant to highlight something about Western imperialism.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the first passage actually supports some of these assumptions, but the question is asking which assumption it undermines.\n\nSo, perhaps none of them are undermined by the first passage alone. But the question says that it undermines one of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first passage does undermine the idea that all European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations, because Bentinck is showing restraint and consideration of the political impact of his actions.\n\nWhereas, in option C, it says \"uniformly eager,\" and Bentinck's cautious approach might suggest that he's not uniformly eager to impose his cultural norms without considering the consequences.\n\nWhereas, in the second passage by George Simpson, he's talking about ruling Indigenous peoples with a rod of iron and making them dependent on trade goods, which could be seen as a different approach to colonization, more focused on control through economic means.\n\nSo, perhaps the first passage undermines the idea that all colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms, because Bentinck is showing a more nuanced and cautious approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
