                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Wellman's response to the objection that he's denying the right to freedom of movement in his criticism of the libertarian case for open borders. The question is asking which of the provided options is part of his response. Let's see what each option says.\n\nOption A says that he would claim that the objection begs the question because the immigration question is identical to the freedom-of-movement question. Hmm, begging the question means assuming the conclusion in the premise. So, if Wellman thinks that the objection assumes that freedom of movement is the same as immigration, which is what's being debated, then yes, that might be seen as begging the question. But I need to see if this aligns with Wellman's actual response.\n\nOption B suggests that he would present an argument to show there's no right to freedom of movement at all. That seems pretty strong. Is Wellman denying the existence of a right to freedom of movement entirely? I thought his position was more nuanced, perhaps accepting some restrictions on freedom of movement for certain reasons. Maybe not entirely denying the right.\n\nOption C mentions that he would argue some rights aren't absolute, using marriage as an example. So, just because you have a right to marry doesn't mean you can marry anyone you want, like someone who doesn't consent. Applying this to freedom of movement, maybe he's saying that while there is a right to move freely, it's not absolute and can be restricted under certain circumstances, like immigration controls. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D talks about using deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable. Deontological ethics are based on duties and rules, so Wellman might be appealing to certain moral duties or principles to argue against open borders or to support immigration restrictions. But is this directly related to the right to freedom of movement?\n\nI need to recall what Wellman specifically says about the right to freedom of movement in his objection to the libertarian case for open borders. Let me think back to what I've read or heard about his arguments.\n\nWellman is known for his work on immigration ethics, particularly in defending states' rights to control their borders. He engages with libertarians who argue that open borders are a necessity based on individual liberty and freedom of movement. In responding to this, he likely challenges the notion that unrestricted freedom of movement is a categorical right that cannot be infringed upon.\n\nGiven that, option C seems particularly relevant because it suggests that some rights are not absolute and can be limited under certain conditions. Wellman might be arguing that while individuals have a right to freedom of movement, states also have a right to regulate who enters their territory based on various considerations, such as national security, economic impacts, or cultural cohesion.\n\nMoreover, using the example of marriage, where one cannot marry someone without their consent, Wellman might be drawing an analogy to suggest that just as you can't force someone to marry you, you can't force a state to allow you to enter if they don't consent to your entry.\n\nOption A, about begging the question, might also be relevant because Wellman could be pointing out that equating immigration with freedom of movement assumes that there is an unrestricted right to move across borders, which is precisely what is being debated. So, the objection is circular in that sense.\n\nOption B seems too extreme because Wellman doesn't appear to be denying the existence of a right to freedom of movement altogether. Instead, he seems to be arguing that this right can be balanced against other rights and interests, such as a state's right to self-determination.\n\nOption D involves deontological premises, which are about duties and rules. Wellman might be using deontological arguments to support his position, but this option seems more about critiquiquing unjust policies in general rather than specifically addressing the right to freedom of movement.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option C is the most accurate representation of Wellman's response. He is likely arguing that the right to freedom of movement, while important, is not absolute and can be subject to restrictions imposed by states for legitimate reasons.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider that Wellman has written extensively on immigration ethics, and in his work, he does argue that states have a moral right to control their borders and set immigration policies based on their own interests.
