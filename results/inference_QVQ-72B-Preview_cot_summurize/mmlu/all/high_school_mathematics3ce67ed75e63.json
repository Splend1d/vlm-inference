                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that when three standard dice are tossed, the numbers \\(a, b, c\\) are obtained, and I need to find the probability that the product \\(a \\times b \\times c = 180\\). The options are a bunch of fractions, but I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that a standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. So each die can show any number from 1 to 6, and the tosses are independent, meaning the outcome of one die doesn't affect the others.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when tossing three dice is \\(6^3 = 216\\), since each die has 6 possibilities and there are three dice.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of outcomes where the product of the three numbers is 180. So, I need to find all the ordered triples \\((a, b, c)\\) where each \\(a, b, c\\) is between 1 and 6, and their product is 180.\n\nTo find these triples, it might help to factorize 180 into three factors, each of which is between 1 and 6.\n\nLet's factorize 180:\n\n\\(180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\)\n\nSo, 180 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\nNow, I need to distribute these prime factors among \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\), with each of them being between 1 and 6.\n\nThat means each die can only take values that are products of a subset of these prime factors, and the final product should be 180.\n\nLet me list out all the possible combinations of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) that multiply to 180.\n\nFirst, let's list all the possible triplets where each number is between 1 and 6.\n\nBut that would be time-consuming, so maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since 180 is a specific product, I can look for triplets where the product is 180.\n\nLet me consider possible combinations:\n\nStart by considering the largest possible value on a die, which is 6.\n\nSo, one of the numbers could be 6.\n\nLet's assume \\(c = 6\\), then \\(a \\times b = 180 / 6 = 30\\).\n\nNow, find pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a \\times b = 30\\), and both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are between 1 and 6.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 6\\) (since \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\))\n\n- \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 5\\)\n\n- \\(a = 10\\), but 10 is not on a die.\n\n- \\(a = 15\\), but 15 is not on a die.\n\nSo, only two possible pairs: (5,6) and (6,5).\n\nTherefore, for \\(c = 6\\), there are two possible triples: (5,6,6) and (6,5,6).\n\nWait, but actually, since the dice are identical, the order matters in permutations.\n\nSo, (a,b,c) = (5,6,6), (6,5,6), and (6,6,5) are distinct outcomes.\n\nWait, but in permutations of dice throws, the order does matter, so each distinct ordering is a separate outcome.\n\nSo, for \\(c = 6\\), and \\(a \\times b = 30\\), the possible triples are:\n\n- (5,6,6)\n\n- (6,5,6)\n\n- (6,6,5)\n\nThat's three possible triples.\n\nNow, let's consider \\(b = 6\\), then \\(a \\times c = 30\\).\n\nSimilarly, possible pairs for \\(a \\times c = 30\\):\n\n- \\(a = 5\\), \\(c = 6\\)\n\n- \\(a = 6\\), \\(c = 5\\)\n\nSo, the triples would be:\n\n- (5,6,6)\n\n- (6,6,5)\n\n- (6,5,6)\n\nWait, these are the same as before.\n\nSo, no new triples here.\n\nSimilarly, if \\(a = 6\\), then \\(b \\times c = 30\\).\n\nPossible pairs for \\(b \\times c = 30\\):\n\n- \\(b = 5\\), \\(c = 6\\)\n\n- \\(b = 6\\), \\(c = 5\\)\n\nAgain, the same triples as before.\n\nSo, only three distinct triples where \\(c = 6\\) and \\(a \\times b = 30\\).\n\nNow, let's consider \\(c = 5\\), then \\(a \\times b = 180 / 5 = 36\\).\n\nFind pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a \\times b = 36\\), and both are between 1 and 6.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 9\\) (but 9 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 6\\) (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\))\n\n- \\(a = 9\\), but 9 is not on a die\n\nSo, only one possible pair: (6,6)\n\nTherefore, for \\(c = 5\\), \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 6\\), so the triple is (6,6,5)\n\nSimilarly, (6,6,5) is the same as before.\n\nWait, but in permutations, (6,6,5) is the same as (6,6,5), but since we already have it from \\(c = 6\\), no new triples here.\n\nWait, but earlier I had (6,6,5) under \\(c = 6\\), but actually, when \\(c = 6\\), we had (5,6,6), (6,5,6), and (6,6,5).\n\nSo, no new triples here.\n\nNow, let's consider \\(c = 4\\), then \\(a \\times b = 180 / 4 = 45\\).\n\nFind pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a \\times b = 45\\), and both are between 1 and 6.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 9\\) (9 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = 5\\) (9 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 15\\), but 15 is not on a die\n\nSo, no possible pairs here.\n\nTherefore, no triples where \\(c = 4\\).\n\nNext, \\(c = 3\\), then \\(a \\times b = 180 / 3 = 60\\).\n\nFind pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a \\times b = 60\\), and both are between 1 and 6.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 12\\) (12 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 10\\) (10 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 10\\), \\(b = 6\\) (10 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 12\\), \\(b = 5\\) (12 is not on a die)\n\nSo, no possible pairs here.\n\nTherefore, no triples where \\(c = 3\\).\n\nNext, \\(c = 2\\), then \\(a \\times b = 180 / 2 = 90\\).\n\nFind pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a \\times b = 90\\), and both are between 1 and 6.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 18\\) (18 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 15\\) (15 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = 10\\) (9 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 10\\), \\(b = 9\\) (10 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 15\\), \\(b = 6\\) (15 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 18\\), \\(b = 5\\) (18 is not on a die)\n\nSo, no possible pairs here.\n\nTherefore, no triples where \\(c = 2\\).\n\nFinally, \\(c = 1\\), then \\(a \\times b = 180 / 1 = 180\\).\n\nBut 180 is not on a die, so no possible pairs here.\n\nTherefore, no triples where \\(c = 1\\).\n\nSo, the only possible triples are those where \\(c = 6\\), which gives us three distinct triples:\n\n- (5,6,6)\n\n- (6,5,6)\n\n- (6,6,5)\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for \\(c = 6\\), \\(a \\times b = 30\\), and the only possible pair is (5,6) and (6,5), leading to the three triples above.\n\nBut actually, in permutations, (6,6,5) is distinct from (6,5,6) and (5,6,6), so these are three distinct outcomes.\n\nNow, are there any other triples where \\(c = 5\\), \\(a \\times b = 36\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are between 1 and 6?\n\nEarlier, I saw that the only possible pair is (6,6), leading to (6,6,5).\n\nBut wait, (6,6,5) was already counted under \\(c = 6\\), as (6,6,5).\n\nSo, no new triples here.\n\nTherefore, only three distinct triples where \\(a \\times b \\times c = 180\\).\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 216.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{3}{216} = \\frac{1}{72}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{1}{30}\\)\n\nB. \\(\\frac{1}{72}\\)\n\nC. \\(\\frac{1}{71}\\)\n\nD. \\(\\frac{1}{70}\\)\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are indeed only three favorable triples.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n1. (5,6,6): \\(5 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 180\\)\n\n2. (6,5,6): \\(6 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 180\\)\n\n3. (6,6,5): \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 180\\)\n\nAre there any others?\n\nWait, is (6,6,5) already counted in the previous cases?\n\nActually, in permutations, these are distinct outcomes.\n\nBut let me see if there are any other combinations.\n\nFor example, could there be a triple where two dice show 6 and one die shows 5, but arranged differently?\n\nWell, I already have all three possible arrangements of two 6's and one 5.\n\nAlternatively, is there a triple where one die shows 10, but that's not possible since 10 is not on a die.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a triple where one die shows 9, but again, 9 is not on a die.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a triple where one die shows 12, but again, not on a die.\n\nSo, indeed, only three possible triples.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{3}{216} = \\frac{1}{72}\\), which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me see if there are any other possible combinations that I might have missed.\n\nFor example, is there a combination where one die shows 15, but again, 15 is not on a die.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a combination where two dice show 5 and one die shows 6?\n\nWait, I already have that in (5,6,6), (6,5,6), and (6,6,5).\n\nAlternatively, could there be a combination where two dice show 6 and one die shows 5, which is what I already have.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a combination where one die shows 10 and the others show something else, but 10 is not on a die.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a combination where one die shows 12 and the others show something else, but again, 12 is not on a die.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there are any other possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{72}\\), which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if perhaps there is a different approach to this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the prime factorization approach.\n\nWe have \\(a \\times b \\times c = 180\\), with \\(a, b, c \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\).\n\nSo, 180 factors into primes as \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n\nEach die can contribute to these prime factors, but each die can only show numbers that are products of a subset of these primes.\n\nSo, perhaps I can think in terms of distributing the prime factors among the three dice.\n\nEach die can show numbers that are products of some subset of the prime factors of 180, but constrained to the numbers 1 through 6.\n\nSo, for each die, the possible numbers are:\n\n- 1: no prime factors\n\n- 2: prime factor 2\n\n- 3: prime factor 3\n\n- 4: \\(2^2\\)\n\n- 5: prime factor 5\n\n- 6: \\(2 \\times 3\\)\n\nSo, each die can contribute certain prime factors.\n\nNow, overall, we need the product to be \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n\nSo, among the three dice, we need to distribute the prime factors such that:\n\n- The total exponent of 2 is 2\n\n- The total exponent of 3 is 2\n\n- The total exponent of 5 is 1\n\nNow, let's see how we can distribute these exponents among the three dice.\n\nFirst, consider the exponent of 2.\n\nEach die can contribute 0, 1, or 2 to the exponent of 2, depending on the number it shows:\n\n- 1: 0\n\n- 2: 1\n\n- 3: 0\n\n- 4: 2\n\n- 5: 0\n\n- 6: 1\n\nSo, the possible contributions for 2 are 0, 1, or 2 per die.\n\nSimilarly for 3:\n\n- 1: 0\n\n- 2: 0\n\n- 3: 1\n\n- 4: 0\n\n- 5: 0\n\n- 6: 1\n\nAnd for 5:\n\n- 1: 0\n\n- 2: 0\n\n- 3: 0\n\n- 4: 0\n\n- 5: 1\n\n- 6: 0\n\nSo, we need to find all triples \\((a,b,c)\\) where:\n\n- \\(a \\times b \\times c\\) contributes exactly 2 to the exponent of 2\n\n- \\(a \\times b \\times c\\) contributes exactly 2 to the exponent of 3\n\n- \\(a \\times b \\times c\\) contributes exactly 1 to the exponent of 5\n\nThis seems a bit more complicated, but maybe it can help confirm the earlier result.\n\nLet's try to find all possible triples that satisfy these conditions.\n\nFirst, for the exponent of 5: exactly 1.\n\nLooking at the contributions:\n\n- Only \\(c = 5\\) contributes 1 to the exponent of 5.\n\n- All other numbers contribute 0.\n\nTherefore, exactly one die must show 5.\n\nSo, one of the dice must show 5, and the other two cannot show 5.\n\nTherefore, without loss of generality, let's assume \\(c = 5\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not 5.\n\nNow, with \\(c = 5\\), we have \\(a \\times b = 180 / 5 = 36\\).\n\nSo, we need to find pairs \\((a,b)\\) where \\(a \\times b = 36\\), and both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are between 1 and 6, excluding 5.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 6\\) (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\))\n\n- \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 9\\) (but 9 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = 4\\) (but 9 is not on a die)\n\n- \\(a = 12\\), but that's not on a die\n\nSo, only one possible pair: (6,6)\n\nTherefore, the triple is (6,6,5), which is one of the triples I already have.\n\nSimilarly, if I assume \\(b = 5\\), then \\(a \\times c = 36\\), leading to the same pair (6,6), so the triple is (6,6,5), which is the same as above.\n\nIf I assume \\(a = 5\\), then \\(b \\times c = 36\\), leading again to (6,6), so the triple is (5,6,6), which is another one of the triples I have.\n\nTherefore, only these three distinct triples satisfy the condition.\n\nHence, the number of favorable outcomes is 3, and the total number of possible outcomes is 216.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{3}{216} = \\frac{1}{72}\\), which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, let me check again if there are any other possible combinations.\n\nSuppose that two dice show 6 and one die shows 5, which is what I have.\n\nAlternatively, is there a combination where one die shows 10 and the others adjust, but 10 is not on a die.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a combination where one die shows 9 and the others adjust, but 9 is not on a die.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a combination where one"
