None of the above\"\n\nAlright, I need to figure out who wrote \"The Concept of Law.\" I'm a bit rusty on legal theory, but I think I remember some names from my political science class.\n\nFirst, there's Hart. That rings a bell. Wasn't he a legal philosopher? I think he wrote about the concept of law and had some ideas about legal positivism. Let me see if I can recall more details.\n\nThen there's Austin. I've heard of John Austin; he was also a legal philosopher, right? I think he had some theories about the command theory of law or something like that.\n\nBentham\u2014that's Jeremy Bentham, the father of utilitarianism. He was big on maximizing happiness and minimizing pain. Did he write about the concept of law?\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider their contributions.\n\nLet me try to recall: \"The Concept of Law\" sounds familiar, and I think it was written by Hart. But I should make sure.\n\nI remember that Hart was an English legal philosopher who critiqued Austin's command theory of law and developed his own view on what constitutes law. His book, \"The Concept of Law,\" is often cited as a foundational text in legal positivism.\n\nAustin, on the other hand, is known for his definition of law as commands issued by a sovereign backed by threats of punishment. But I don't recall him writing a book specifically titled \"The Concept of Law.\"\n\nBentham was more focused on ethics and the principle of utility. He did write about legal reform and was involved in the codification of laws, but again, I don't think he wrote \"The Concept of Law.\"\n\nMaybe I should consider the publication dates. Hart's \"The Concept of Law\" was first published in 1961, I believe. Austin's major work was \"The Province of Jurisprudence Determined,\" which was published earlier. Bentham wrote \"An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,\" which is more about ethics and less about the concept of law per se.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Hart is the author of \"The Concept of Law.\" But just to be thorough, I should check if there's any possibility that another author might have written a similar book.\n\nWait a minute, could there be another book with the same title written by someone else? Maybe, but I think Hart's is the most well-known. I don't recall any other major legal theorists with a book by that exact title.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that sometimes different editions or translations might have slightly different titles, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge about different legal philosophers and their main works, and \"The Concept of Law\" is indeed Hart's book.\n\nLet me try to recall a famous quote or a key idea from \"The Concept of Law\" to confirm. Oh, right, Hart discussed the rule of recognition, which is a fundamental concept in his theory. That doesn't ring true for Austin or Bentham.\n\nAustin's command theory is more about laws being commands from a sovereign, and Bentham was more involved in utilitarian ethics and less with the conceptual framework of law.\n\nTherefore, based on my recollection and reasoning, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. Hart.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me quickly search my memory for any possible confusion.\n\nIs there any chance that \"The Concept of Law\" is attributed to someone else in different academic circles? I don't think so. Hart's work is pretty standard in legal theory textbooks.\n\nMoreover, Austin and Bentham had different focuses in their writings, and neither is primarily associated with a book titled \"The Concept of Law.\"\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the answer is A. Hart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ Hart} \\]"
