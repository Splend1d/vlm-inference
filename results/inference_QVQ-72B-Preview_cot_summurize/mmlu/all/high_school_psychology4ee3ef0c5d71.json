                    "text": "Let's see here. So, Al doesn't really care about doing well in school, but he does care about having enough money to pay for a car. His mom is smart about this; she's giving him money for every \"A\" or \"B\" he gets on his school tests and projects. I need to figure out which psychological theory this behavior of his mom's is an example of.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Cannon-Bard\n\nB. Instinct\n\nC. Drive reduction\n\nD. Incentive\n\nOkay, let's recall what each of these theories is about.\n\nFirst, Cannon-Bard theory is about emotion. It suggests that emotions and physiological arousal occur simultaneously and independently. So, when you experience an emotion, your body reacts at the same time, not because of the emotion. Hmm, doesn't seem directly related to Al getting money for good grades.\n\nNext, instinct theory. This theory proposes that behavior is innate and driven by instincts. Like, certain behaviors are hardwired into us from birth. But in this case, Al's mom is rewarding him for good grades, which seems more learned than instinctual.\n\nDrive reduction theory is about motivations that push us to satisfy needs or desires. It's about reducing internal tensions caused by unsatisfied needs. For example, if you're hungry, you eat to reduce that drive. But here, Al doesn't seem to have a drive to do well in school; he has a desire for money to buy a car. So, his mom is using money as a motivator to encourage him to do better in school.\n\nThat sounds a bit like drive reduction, but I think there's a better fit.\n\nIncentive theory suggests that behavior is motivated by external rewards or incentives. So, in this case, the incentive is the money Al gets for good grades, which is motivating him to perform better in school.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both drive reduction and incentive theory could apply here. Al has a drive to have a car, and the incentive is the money he gets for good grades, which helps him achieve that drive.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Drive reduction theory is more about reducing internal tensions caused by unsatisfied needs, like hunger or thirst. In this scenario, Al's desire for a car might be seen as a drive, and getting money for good grades is the incentive to reduce that drive.\n\nHowever, incentive theory seems more directly applicable here because it specifically mentions external rewards motivating behavior. The money is an external incentive that's motivating Al to study harder and get better grades.\n\nLet me consider another angle. In drive reduction theory, the motivation comes from within, as the organism seeks to maintain homeostasis by reducing internal tensions. In contrast, incentive theory suggests that motivations can also come from external sources, like rewards or punishments.\n\nIn this scenario, Al's primary drive is to have a car, but he's not particularly motivated by schoolwork. His mom is providing an external incentive (money) to motivate him to do better in school, which is indirectly helping him achieve his drive of getting a car.\n\nSo, it seems like both theories are at play, but the core of the situation is that Al is being motivated by an external reward (money) to perform a task he wouldn't otherwise be inclined to do well in (schoolwork).\n\nGiven that, incentive theory seems to be the most directly applicable here. The mother's behavior of offering money for good grades is an exemplary application of incentive theory, where external rewards are used to motivate behavior.\n\nI think the answer is D. Incentive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
