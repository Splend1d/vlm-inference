                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about the distance between Miriam's house and Debbie's house, and it's 444.44 meters. I need to figure out which statement about the values of the digits in this distance is true. I'm a bit rusty on place values, but I think I can work it out.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down the number and label each digit's place value to make it clearer. The number is 444.44.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n- The first 4 from the left is in the hundreds place.\n\n- The second 4 is in the tens place.\n\n- The third 4 is in the ones place.\n\n- The fourth 4 is in the tenths place.\n\n- The fifth 4 is in the hundredths place.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4\n\n- Tens place: 4\n\n- Ones place: 4\n\n- Tenths place: 4\n\n- Hundredths place: 4\n\nNow, I need to look at each option and see which one is correct based on these place values.\n\nOption A: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\n\nLet's calculate the value of each:\n\n- The 4 in the tenths place: 4 * 0.1 = 0.4\n\n- The 4 in the tens place: 4 * 10 = 40\n\nNow, is 0.4 equal to 1/10 of 40? Let's check:\n\n1/10 * 40 = 4\n\nSo, 0.4 is not equal to 4. Therefore, option A is false.\n\nOption B: The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n\nAgain, let's find the values:\n\n- The 4 in the hundredths place: 4 * 0.01 = 0.04\n\n- The 4 in the ones place: 4 * 1 = 4\n\nNow, is 0.04 equal to 1/10 of 4? Let's calculate:\n\n1/10 * 4 = 0.4\n\nBut 0.04 is not equal to 0.4, so option B is also false.\n\nOption C: The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n\nLet's find the values:\n\n- The 4 in the hundreds place: 4 * 100 = 400\n\n- The 4 in the ones place: 4 * 1 = 4\n\nNow, is 400 equal to 10 times 4? Yes, because 10 * 4 = 40, but wait, 400 is actually 100 times 4, not 10 times. So, option C is false.\n\nOption D: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\n\nLet's find the values:\n\n- The 4 in the tenths place: 4 * 0.1 = 0.4\n\n- The 4 in the hundredths place: 4 * 0.01 = 0.04\n\nNow, is 0.4 equal to 10 times 0.04? Let's check:\n\n10 * 0.04 = 0.4\n\nYes, that's correct. So, option D is true.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLooking back at option D: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Value in tenths place: 0.4\n\n- Value in hundredths place: 0.04\n\nIndeed, 0.4 is equal to 10 times 0.04, because 10 * 0.04 = 0.4.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct statement.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm why the other options are incorrect:\n\nOption A: As we saw, 0.4 is not 1/10 of 40; it's 1/100 of 400, which is 4, but that's not relevant here.\n\nOption B: 0.04 is not 1/10 of 4; it should be 1/10 of 4, which is 0.4, but 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, not 4.\n\nOption C: 400 is not 10 times 4; it's 100 times 4.\n\nSo, yes, option D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
