                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about CSR, which stands for Corporate Social Responsibility. The question is asking about the three outcomes of CSR according to someone named Wood in 1991. The options are:\n\nA. Social policies, Social programmes and Social impacts\n\nB. Social evaluations, Social programmes and Social impacts\n\nC. Social policies, Social evidencing and Social impacts\n\nD. Social policies, Social programmes and Social analysis\n\nFirst, I need to recall what CSR is all about. CSR is about how companies manage their operations to have a positive impact on society and the environment, beyond just making a profit. It's about being responsible to stakeholders like employees, customers, and the community.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about the three outcomes of CSR as per Wood in 1991. I need to find the correct combination from the given options.\n\nI remember that in CSR frameworks, policies are like the guidelines or principles that a company follows to ensure responsible behavior. Programmes are the actual initiatives or actions taken based on those policies. Impacts are the results or effects of those programmes on society and the environment.\n\nLooking at option A: Social policies, Social programmes and Social impacts. This seems logical because policies guide programmes, which then produce impacts.\n\nOption B: Social evaluations, Social programmes and Social impacts. Evaluations sound like assessments, which might be part of measuring impacts, but I'm not sure if they're a primary outcome.\n\nOption C: Social policies, Social evidencing and Social impacts. Evidencing might relate to proving or demonstrating the impacts, but again, not sure if it's a core outcome.\n\nOption D: Social policies, Social programmes and Social analysis. Analysis could be part of evaluating impacts, but similar to option B, I don't think it's a primary outcome.\n\nGiven this, option A seems the most straightforward and logical choice. Policies guide programmes, which in turn create impacts.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any specific framework by Wood in 1991 that might define these outcomes differently.\n\nAfter a quick search in my notes, I find that Wood (1991) discussed a framework for understanding CSR that includes dimensions like economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities. However, I don't recall him specifically listing outcomes as policies, programmes, and impacts.\n\nMaybe I need to look deeper. Perhaps Wood discussed these as components or manifestations of CSR rather than outcomes.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the question is referring to the inputs, processes, and outputs of CSR. Policies could be seen as inputs, programmes as processes, and impacts as outputs.\n\nThat makes sense in a general framework. But again, I need to confirm if this is accurate to Wood's original work.\n\nUpon further reflection, I recall that Wood's (1991) article, \"Corporate Social Performance Revisited,\" proposed a conceptual model of corporate social performance that included multiple dimensions and relationships.\n\nIn that model, corporate social performance is influenced by various factors, including social policies and practices, which can lead to social impacts.\n\nHowever, I don't recall Wood using the exact terminology of policies, programmes, and impacts as the three outcomes.\n\nPerhaps the question is interpreting Wood's framework through a more contemporary lens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing understanding of how CSR is generally structured, regardless of Wood's specific framework.\n\nGiven that, option A still seems the most plausible answer.\n\nBut to be sure, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Social policies, Social programmes and Social impacts.\n\n- Social policies: These are the guiding principles or rules that a company adopts to govern its social responsibilities.\n\n- Social programmes: These are the specific initiatives or actions implemented based on those policies.\n\n- Social impacts: These are the effects or outcomes of those programmes on society.\n\nThis seems like a coherent progression: policies guide programmes, which then lead to impacts.\n\nOption B: Social evaluations, Social programmes and Social impacts.\n\n- Social evaluations: This seems more like assessing or measuring the impacts rather than a direct outcome of CSR.\n\n- Social programmes: Actions taken.\n\n- Social impacts: Results of those actions.\n\nHere, evaluations seem out of place as a primary outcome; they are more of a monitoring or measurement tool.\n\nOption C: Social policies, Social evidencing and Social impacts.\n\n- Social policies: Guiding principles.\n\n- Social evidencing: Providing proof or evidence of social responsibility.\n\n- Social impacts: Results.\n\nEvidencing seems more related to demonstrating compliance or impact rather than a direct outcome of CSR implementation.\n\nOption D: Social policies, Social programmes and Social analysis.\n\n- Social policies: Guiding principles.\n\n- Social programmes: Actions taken.\n\n- Social analysis: Analyzing the social context or impacts.\n\nAgain, analysis seems more like a tool for understanding impacts rather than a direct outcome.\n\nGiven this analysis, option A appears to be the most accurate representation of the three outcomes of CSR according to Wood (1991).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Social policies, Social programmes and Social impacts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
