                    "text": "So I've got this problem: find the remainder when \\(25^{1059}\\) is divided by 23. The options are 11, 13, 8, and 5. Hmm, that's a pretty big exponent, so I don't think I can calculate it directly. There has to be a smarter way to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember something about modular arithmetic that might help here. Like, if I can find a pattern or a cycle in the powers of 25 modulo 23, that might make this easier. Let me recall what modular arithmetic is: it's basically finding the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, \\(a \\equiv b \\mod m\\) means that a and b have the same remainder when divided by m.\n\nBut dealing with such a large exponent seems daunting. Maybe I can simplify \\(25^{1059}\\) modulo 23 by finding a smaller exponent that repeats. Or perhaps there's a theorem that can help me here. Oh, right! Fermat's Little Theorem! That says that if p is a prime and a is not divisible by p, then \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p\\). Since 23 is a prime, maybe I can apply that.\n\nSo, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, \\(25^{22} \\equiv 1 \\mod 23\\), because 23 is prime and 25 is not a multiple of 23. That could be really useful. If \\(25^{22} \\equiv 1\\), then I can break down the exponent 1059 into multiples of 22.\n\nLet me see: 1059 divided by 22. Let's do the division. 22 times 48 is 1056, which is less than 1059, and 22 times 48 is 1056, so the remainder is 1059 minus 1056, which is 3. So, \\(25^{1059} = 25^{22 \\times 48 + 3} = (25^{22})^{48} \\times 25^3\\).\n\nSince \\(25^{22} \\equiv 1 \\mod 23\\), then \\((25^{22})^{48} \\equiv 1^{48} \\equiv 1 \\mod 23\\). So, \\(25^{1059} \\equiv 25^3 \\mod 23\\). That's a lot simpler!\n\nNow, I just need to compute \\(25^3\\) modulo 23. Let's calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, find 25 modulo 23. 25 divided by 23 is 1 with a remainder of 2, so \\(25 \\equiv 2 \\mod 23\\).\n\nThen, \\(25^3 \\equiv 2^3 \\mod 23\\). That's 8. So, \\(25^3 \\equiv 8 \\mod 23\\).\n\nWait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. 23 times 1 is 23, and 25 minus 23 is 2, so yes, 25 \u2261 2 mod 23. Then, 2^3 is 8, and 8 is less than 23, so it should be correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Fermat's Little Theorem applies because 23 is prime and 25 is not a multiple of 23. The exponent 1059 divided by 22 gives 48 with a remainder of 3, which I calculated correctly. And the simplification to \\(25^3\\) modulo 23 is straightforward.\n\nSo, the remainder when \\(25^{1059}\\) is divided by 23 is 8.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 11\n\nB. 13\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 5\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 8.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
