                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about sickle-cell disease and genetics. So, there's this healthy man and woman who are both carriers of sickle-cell disease, and they're worried about having children because of that. The question is, what's the chance that their child will inherit sickle-cell disease. The options are 100%, 75%, 50%, or 25%.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what it means to be a carrier of sickle-cell disease. I remember that sickle-cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin in red blood cells. It's an autosomal recessive condition, which means that someone needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene\u2014one from each parent\u2014to actually have the disease.\n\nSo, if both parents are carriers, that means each of them has one normal gene and one mutated gene for hemoglobin. In genetic terms, they're heterozygous for the sickle-cell trait.\n\nI think I can use a Punnett square to figure out the possible combinations of genes that their child could inherit.\n\nLet's denote the normal gene as \"A\" and the mutated gene as \"a\". Since both parents are carriers, their genotypes are Aa.\n\nSo, each parent can pass on either A or a to their child.\n\nIf I make a Punnett square:\n\nParent 1: Aa\n\nPossible sperm eggs:\n\n- A\n\n- a\n\nParent 2: Aa\n\nPossible ova:\n\n- A\n\n- a\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. A from parent 1 and A from parent 2: AA (normal)\n\n2. A from parent 1 and a from parent 2: Aa (carrier)\n\n3. a from parent 1 and A from parent 2: Aa (carrier)\n\n4. a from parent 1 and a from parent 2: aa (sickle-cell disease)\n\nSo, there are four possible combinations:\n\n- AA (normal): 25%\n\n- Aa (carrier): 50%\n\n- Aa (carrier): another 50%, but since it's the same genotype, it's still 50%\n\n- aa (disease): 25%\n\nWait, no. Actually, since there are two Aa possibilities, it's 50% combined.\n\nSo, the chances are:\n\n- 25% to have a child with no sickle-cell trait (AA)\n\n- 50% to have a child who is a carrier (Aa)\n\n- 25% to have a child with sickle-cell disease (aa)\n\nBut the question is asking for the chance that the child will inherit sickle-cell disease, which is the aa genotype.\n\nSo, that would be 25%.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nI think there might be a confusion here. The options include 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. According to the Punnett square, it should be 25%.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it.\n\nWait, sometimes people might think that carriers can pass on the disease, but actually, carriers don't have the disease; they just carry one copy of the mutated gene.\n\nSo, only if the child inherits two mutated genes (one from each parent) will the child have sickle-cell disease.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 25%.\n\nAlternatively, if we think in terms of alleles, each parent passes one allele to the child.\n\nThe child will have sickle-cell disease only if both alleles are \"a\".\n\nSince each parent has Aa, the probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, which is 25%.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 25%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\nIs there any chance of incomplete dominance or something like that? No, because sickle-cell is an example of incomplete dominance, but in terms of the disease manifestation, it's recessive.\n\nAlso, assuming that the parents are both heterozygous, which they are, as carriers.\n\nSo, yeah, the probability should be 25%.\n\nI think the other options are there to test understanding of dominant and recessive inheritance, but in this case, since it's recessive, it's 25%.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 25\\%} \\]"
