                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Epicurus thought about justice in laws. The question is asking when a law is unjust according to him. The options are:\n\nA. It's not in accordance with natural law.\n\nB. It's not in accordance with the traditions of society.\n\nC. It's offensive to the gods.\n\nD. It's not beneficial to those it affects.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Epicurus was and what his views on justice were. I know that Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who founded a school of philosophy called Epicureanism. His philosophy emphasized living a life of pleasure, but not in the sense of indulgence or excess. Rather, it was about achieving a state of tranquility and freedom from fear and pain.\n\nNow, regarding laws and justice, I recall that Epicurus believed in living a virtuous life and that laws should promote happiness and well-being. He thought that justice was based on mutual advantage and that laws should serve the common good.\n\nLooking at option A: not in accordance with natural law. I'm not sure about Epicurus's stance on natural law. Natural law is a concept that suggests there are universal principles of right and wrong that are derived from human nature and reason, rather than from the laws made by humans. Epicurus was more focused on atomic theory and the material world, so I'm not certain if he placed a lot of emphasis on natural law. Maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B: not in accordance with the traditions of society. Epicurus was known for valuing friendship and community, but he also emphasized rational thinking and personal happiness. He might not necessarily align laws strictly with traditional societal norms if those traditions didn't contribute to overall happiness and well-being. So, perhaps this isn't the primary criterion for justice in his view.\n\nOption C: offensive to the gods. Epicurus was known for his skeptical views about the gods. He believed that the gods existed but were uninvolved in human affairs. Therefore, whether a law offends the gods or not probably wasn't a significant concern for him in determining justice. This seems unlikely to be his main criterion for judicial laws.\n\nOption D: not beneficial to those it affects. This seems plausible. Epicurus placed a strong emphasis on pleasure and the avoidance of pain as the primary goals of life. He believed that a just society would be one that maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain for its members. Therefore, if a law isn't beneficial to the people it affects, it would be considered unjust.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. In Epicurean ethics, the principle of utility is important\u2014the idea that actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce unhappiness. This aligns closely with utilitarianism, which suggests that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as happiness or pleasure.\n\nSo, if a law doesn't contribute to the overall happiness or benefit of the people, it would be against Epicurus's principles of justice. Additionally, Epicurus believed in the idea of \"reciprocal advantage,\" meaning that just actions are those that are mutually beneficial to all parties involved.\n\nGiven that, a law that doesn't benefit those it affects would be seen as not providing mutual advantage and therefore be unjust.\n\nTo summarize, based on Epicurus's emphasis on pleasure, happiness, and mutual advantage, it seems that a law is unjust when it's not beneficial to those it affects. So, the answer should be D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might suggest otherwise.\n\nFor instance, maybe there's a argument that Epicurus would consider a law unjust if it goes against natural law. However, given that his philosophy was more grounded in empirical evidence and atomic theory, rather than abstract or divine laws, I think it's safer to lean towards his utilitarian approach to justice.\n\nSimilarly, while traditions and societal norms might influence his views, Epicurus was known for prioritizing reason and personal happiness over blind adherence to custom. So, again, option B seems less likely to be his primary criterion for justice.\n\nAs for option C, given his skepticism about divine intervention, it's hard to imagine that offending the gods would be a significant factor in his judgment of justice.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is D: it is not beneficial to those it affects.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
