The profit-maximizing quantity\n\nB. The minimum of marginal cost\n\nC. The maximum of average variable cost\n\nD. The minimum of average variable cost\n\nHmm, I need to recall some basic cost curves from microeconomics.\n\nFirst, I know that in the short run, the relationship between MC and AVC is important. The MC curve typically has a U-shape, meaning it decreases at first and then increases after a certain point. The AVC curve also has a similar U-shape, but it might be lower or higher depending on the costs.\n\nI remember that MC intersects AVC at the minimum point of AVC. So, does that mean it's at the minimum of AVC, which would be option D?\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. In microeconomics, there's a relationship between marginal and average costs:\n\n- When MC is below AVC, AVC is decreasing.\n\n- When MC is above AVC, AVC is increasing.\n\n- When MC equals AVC, AVC is at its minimum.\n\nSo, according to this, MC intersects AVC when MC equals AVC, which is at the minimum point of AVC.\n\nBut let me double-check this concept. Suppose MC is decreasing initially; as it decreases, it pulls down AVC. Then, MC starts increasing, and when MC is above AVC, AVC starts increasing too. So, the point where MC equals AVC is indeed the lowest point of AVC.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. The minimum of average variable cost.\n\nWait a minute, what about option A, the profit-maximizing quantity? I know that profit maximization occurs where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC), but that's a different concept. So, MC intersects AVC at the minimum of AVC, not necessarily at the profit-maximizing quantity.\n\nOption B says the minimum of marginal cost. I recall that MC has a U-shape, and it intersects the average total cost (ATC) and AVC at their respective minimum points. So, MC intersects AVC at AVC's minimum, not at MC's minimum.\n\nOption C says the maximum of average variable cost. That doesn't sound right because AVC has a minimum, not a maximum, in standard cost curves.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the correct answer is D. The minimum of average variable cost.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider a graph. Suppose I plot AVC and MC. MC starts high, decreases to a point where it equals AVC (the minimum of AVC), and then increases again, pulling AVC up with it. So, the intersection happens exactly at the minimum point of AVC.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The minimum of average variable cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
