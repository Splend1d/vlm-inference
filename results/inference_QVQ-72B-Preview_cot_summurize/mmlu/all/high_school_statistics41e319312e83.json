                    "text": "Let's see here. So, I've got this problem about a manufacturer who wants to test the effects of a new additive on the lifespan of engines. They've selected 25 different engine types and are testing each one with and without the additive. And they want to know what type of analysis will give the most useful information. The options are:\n\nA. Matched pairs comparison of population proportions\n\nB. Matched pairs comparison of population means\n\nC. Independent samples comparison of population proportions\n\nD. Independent samples comparison of population means\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's being compared here. It's the lifespan of engines, right? So, lifespan is likely a continuous variable, like number of hours or miles before failure, something like that. So, we're dealing with means, not proportions. That makes me think that options A and C, which involve proportions, might not be the best fit.\n\nBut let me double-check. Proportions would be more about percentages or ratios, whereas means are about average values. Since lifespan is probably measured in some unit of time or usage, it's more of a mean value.\n\nSo, between A and B, B seems more appropriate because it's about population means.\n\nNow, between B and D, the difference is matched pairs versus independent samples.\n\nMatched pairs usually involve comparing two related groups, like before and after measurements on the same subjects, or paired observations that have some dependency.\n\nIn this case, for each of the 25 engine types, they're testing both with and without the additive. So, for each engine type, there are two measurements: one with additive and one without.\n\nThis sounds like a paired design because each pair is composed of the same engine type under two different conditions.\n\nTherefore, a matched pairs comparison would be more suitable here because of this dependency in the data.\n\nAn independent samples test would assume that the two groups are unrelated, which isn't the case here since the same engine types are being tested with and without the additive.\n\nWait a minute, but there are 25 different engine types, and each is tested with and without the additive. So, it's like each engine type is its own pair.\n\nIn that case, a matched pairs t-test would be appropriate to compare the mean lifespans with and without the additive for each engine type.\n\nAlternatively, since there are multiple engine types, maybe they want to look at the difference in means across all engine types.\n\nBut still, the paired design suggests that we should account for the variability between different engine types and focus on the differences within each pair.\n\nSo, option B seems the most fitting.\n\nOption D, independent samples comparison of population means, would be more appropriate if they had two separate groups of engines, one using the additive and the other not, with no pairing.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the same engine types are being tested with and without the additive, it's a paired design.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct choice is B: matched pairs comparison of population means.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nMaybe considering that they're interested in the effect of the additive on different engine types, and perhaps they want to see if the additive consistently increases lifespan across different engine types.\n\nA matched pairs comparison would allow them to see the difference in lifespan for each engine type and then analyze those differences, which makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if they were looking at proportions, like the proportion of engines where the additive led to longer lifespan, then maybe a proportions test would be relevant, but that's not what's being measured here.\n\nNo, it's clearly about the actual lifespan values, which are likely continuous variables, so means are more appropriate.\n\nAlright, I think I've convinced myself that B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
