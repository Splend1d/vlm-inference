                    "text": "So I've got this problem about seating sections in a baseball park. There are three sections: red, blue, and green. Each section has a different number of seats, and I need to find out the total number of people who can sit in the whole park. Let me read the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the red section seats 200 people. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the blue section seats 20 fewer people than the red section. So, since the red section seats 200 people, the blue section seats 200 minus 20. Let me calculate that: 200 - 20 = 180. So, the blue section seats 180 people.\n\nThen, the green section seats 2 times as many people as the blue section. Since the blue section seats 180 people, the green section seats 2 times 180. Let me compute that: 2 * 180 = 360. So, the green section seats 360 people.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people who can sit in the baseball park, I need to add up the seating capacities of all three sections. That is, red plus blue plus green.\n\nLet me write that down: 200 (red) + 180 (blue) + 360 (green). Let me add those numbers together.\n\nFirst, 200 + 180. 200 plus 100 is 300, and then adding the remaining 80 gives 380.\n\nThen, adding 360 to that. 380 plus 360. 380 plus 300 is 680, and then adding the remaining 60 gives 740.\n\nSo, the total seating capacity of the baseball park is 740 people.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the red section at 200, blue is 20 fewer than red, which is 180, and green is twice the blue section, which is 360. Adding them up: 200 + 180 is indeed 380, and 380 + 360 is 740.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 260\n\nB. 380\n\nC. 640\n\nD. 740\n\nMy answer matches option D. 740.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 740.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 740} \\]"
