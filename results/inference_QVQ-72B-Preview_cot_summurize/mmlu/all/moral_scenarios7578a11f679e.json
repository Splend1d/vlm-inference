                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here that's asking me to judge which of these two scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are labeled as Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, and then there are choices A through D that combine whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I threw a flat stone deftly toward the window.\" So, someone is throwing a stone towards a window. In Scenario 2, it says, \"I tossed a raft into the swimming pool.\" So, someone is throwing a raft into a swimming pool.\n\nOkay, so both involve some sort of action where an object is being thrown or tossed, but the contexts might be different. I need to determine, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which of these actions would be considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nLet me start by considering Scenario 1: throwing a flat stone deftly toward the window.\n\nFirst off, throwing stones at windows generally is associated with breaking windows, which is vandalism and considered morally wrong. It's damaging property that doesn't belong to you, and that's against the law and against moral standards in the US.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says \"threw a flat stone deftly toward the window.\" It doesn't specify if the window is broken or not, or what the intention was. Maybe the person was trying to hit something else and the window was in the way, or maybe they were aiming for the window to break it.\n\nI think, in general, throwing stones at windows is considered wrong because it can lead to damage to property, and it's an aggressive act. Even if the window isn't broken, the intention might be to cause damage, or it could be seen as a reckless action that could potentially cause harm.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: tossing a raft into the swimming pool.\n\nThis seems different. A raft is typically something that's used in swimming pools for floating or sitting on while in the water. So, tossing a raft into the pool might just be a way of placing it there for use.\n\nBut, I need to consider if there's any context that might change this. For example, if someone was tossing the raft into the pool in a way that could harm someone who's swimming, that might be considered wrong. However, without that context, it seems like a harmless action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pool doesn't belong to the person tossing the raft, and they're doing it without permission, which could be trespassing or some form of property violation. But again, the scenario doesn't specify that.\n\nAssuming that the pool is the person's own property or they have permission to use it, tossing a raft into the pool seems like a normal, everyday action that isn't morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Scenario 1 involves throwing a stone towards a window, which is generally considered morally wrong due to the potential for property damage and harm, while Scenario 2 involves tossing a raft into a swimming pool, which seems like a harmless action.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing a stone towards a window could be seen as an act of vandalism or potential harm, even if the window isn't broken, because the intention might be to cause damage. However, without knowing the intention, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe the person was trying to get someone's attention or something else.\n\nBut in general, throwing stones at windows is considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, tossing a raft into a swimming pool seems innocuous unless there's some specific context that makes it wrong, which isn't provided here.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the stone was thrown deftly, meaning skillfully or adroitly, towards the window. Maybe the person intended to hit the window or something near it.\n\nRegardless of the skill, the act of throwing a stone towards a window is still generally considered wrong due to the potential consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, tossing a raft into a pool seems perfectly acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
