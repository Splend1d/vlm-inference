                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There are 400 employees in a company, and their mean income is $20,500 with a standard deviation of $3,750. The incomes are normally distributed. I need to find out how many employees are expected to have an income between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nFirst, I know that in a normal distribution, data is symmetrically distributed with the mean at the center. The standard deviation tells me how spread out the data is from the mean. So, with a mean of $20,500 and a standard deviation of $3,750, I can figure out how $13,000 and $28,000 relate to the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n\nLet me calculate the z-scores for $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(x - \\text{mean})}{\\text{sd}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( x \\) is the value\n\n- \\(\\text{mean}\\) is the mean of the distribution\n\n- \\(\\text{sd}\\) is the standard deviation\n\nSo, for $13,000:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{(13000 - 20500)}{3750} = \\frac{(-7500)}{3750} = -2 \\]\n\nAnd for $28,000:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{(28000 - 20500)}{3750} = \\frac{7500}{3750} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the range is from \\( z = -2 \\) to \\( z = 2 \\).\n\nI need to find the proportion of the normal distribution that falls between \\( z = -2 \\) and \\( z = 2 \\). Then, I can find out how many employees fall into that range by multiplying that proportion by the total number of employees, which is 400.\n\nI remember that in a standard normal distribution, about 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean (from \\( z = -2 \\) to \\( z = 2 \\)). But I should be more precise.\n\nActually, the exact proportion for \\( z = 2 \\) is about 95.45%, but that's for \\( z = -2 \\) to \\( z = 2 \\), right? Wait, I think the exact value for the area between \\( z = -2 \\) and \\( z = 2 \\) is approximately 95.45%, but I should check a standard normal table or use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for more accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the error function or look up the values in a z-table. For \\( z = 2 \\), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.9772, and for \\( z = -2 \\), it's approximately 0.0228.\n\nSo, the probability that an employee's income is between $13,000 and $28,000 is:\n\n\\[ p = \\text{cdf}(2) - \\text{cdf}(-2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544 \\]\n\nSo, about 95.44% of the employees are expected to have incomes within this range.\n\nNow, to find the expected number of employees in this range, I multiply this probability by the total number of employees:\n\n\\[ \\text{expected number} = 400 \\times 0.9544 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ 400 \\times 0.9544 = 381.76 \\]\n\nSince the number of employees has to be a whole number, I can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 382. But looking at the options provided, 390 is closest to 382 among the choices.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, z-scores:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{13000 - 20500}{3750} = \\frac{-7500}{3750} = -2 \\]\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{28000 - 20500}{3750} = \\frac{7500}{3750} = 2 \\]\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThe area between \\( z = -2 \\) and \\( z = 2 \\) is approximately 0.9544, as per the standard normal table.\n\nSo, expected number is \\( 400 \\times 0.9544 = 381.76 \\), which rounds to 382. But the closest option is 390.\n\nMaybe I need to consider more decimal places. Let me look up the exact z-table values.\n\nFor \\( z = 2.00 \\), cdf is 0.9772\n\nFor \\( z = -2.00 \\), cdf is 0.0228\n\nDifference is 0.9544, which is 95.44%.\n\nSo, \\( 400 \\times 0.9544 = 381.76 \\), which rounds to 382, but 390 is the closest option provided.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a miscalculation in the z-scores or the mean.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the mean is $20,500 and standard deviation is $3,750, but maybe the units are in thousands of dollars.\n\nWait, no, the problem specifies incomes in dollars, not thousands.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the z-score formula.\n\nLet me recalculate z-scores.\n\nFor $13,000:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{13000 - 20500}{3750} = \\frac{-7500}{3750} = -2 \\]\n\nFor $28,000:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{28000 - 20500}{3750} = \\frac{7500}{3750} = 2 \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the area between \\( z = -2 \\) and \\( z = 2 \\) should indeed be approximately 95.44%.\n\nPerhaps the options have a typo, or maybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the empirical rule more precisely.\n\nThe empirical rule states that for a normal distribution:\n\n- About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\n- About 95% falls within two standard deviations.\n\n- About 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nBut for precise values, I should use z-tables or the cumulative distribution function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the formula for the normal distribution to find the exact probability.\n\nThe probability density function for a normal distribution is:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\]\n\nBut since I'm dealing with cumulative probabilities, I should use the cumulative distribution function (CDF).\n\nIn any case, using z-tables, the area between \\( z = -2 \\) and \\( z = 2 \\) is approximately 0.9544.\n\nSo, expected number is \\( 400 \\times 0.9544 = 381.76 \\), which rounds to 382.\n\nBut since 382 is not an option, and the closest is 390, perhaps the answer is 390.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the distribution might not be perfectly normal, but the problem states it's normally distributed, so I should assume it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the standard deviation is given, and I need to use it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to standardize the values and find the exact z-scores.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nFor $13,000:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{13000 - 20500}{3750} = -2 \\]\n\nFor $28,000:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{28000 - 20500}{3750} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\text{cdf}(2) - \\text{cdf}(-2) \\).\n\nLooking up standard normal table:\n\n\\[ \\text{cdf}(2) = 0.97725 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{cdf}(-2) = 0.02275 \\]\n\nSo, \\( p = 0.97725 - 0.02275 = 0.9545 \\)\n\nThus, expected number is \\( 400 \\times 0.9545 = 381.8 \\), which rounds to 382, but since 390 is the closest option, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider continuity correction or something, but that seems unlikely for this context.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 390.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{390} \\]"
