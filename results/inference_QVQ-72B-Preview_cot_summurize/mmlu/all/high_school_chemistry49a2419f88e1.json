                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about entropy and helium gas. Let's see what it's asking. There's a 2.0-liter flask with 0.40 grams of helium gas. Then, the helium is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant. The question is, what happens to the entropy of the helium?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what entropy is. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. So, if the gas is spread out more, entropy increases because there are more possible arrangements of the molecules.\n\nOption A says entropy will remain constant because the number of helium molecules doesn't change. But I think that's not necessarily true because entropy isn't just about the number of molecules; it's about how they're arranged in space.\n\nOption B says entropy will decrease because the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. If the flask is larger, wouldn't the gas spread out more, leading to increased disorder?\n\nOption C also says entropy will decrease, but for a different reason: fewer collisions with the sides of the flask. Wait, if the flask is larger and the gas is less dense, maybe there are fewer collisions, but does that directly imply decreased entropy? I'm not sure.\n\nOption D says entropy will increase because the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask. This seems to align with my understanding of entropy and expansion.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. When a gas expands into a larger volume at constant temperature, what happens to its entropy? I remember there's a formula for entropy change in an ideal gas: \u0394S = nR ln(Vf/Vi), where n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and Vf and Vi are the final and initial volumes.\n\nGiven that, if the volume increases (Vf > Vi), then ln(Vf/Vi) is positive, which means \u0394S is positive. So, entropy increases.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something else going on here. The mass of helium is 0.40 grams, and helium has an atomic mass of approximately 4 grams per mole. So, the number of moles n = mass / molar mass = 0.40 g / 4 g/mol = 0.10 moles.\n\nIf the gas is evacuated into a larger container, assuming an isothermal process (temperature constant), the entropy change should indeed be positive, as per the formula.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the Boltzmann entropy formula, S = k ln(W), where W is the number of microstates. If the gas expands into a larger volume, there are more possible positions for the molecules, so W increases, and thus entropy increases.\n\nWait a minute, is there any scenario where entropy would decrease in this situation? The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy of an isolated system never decreases. But here, the system is not isolated because the gas is being evacuated into a larger container, which might involve some external influences.\n\nHowever, in the context of the problem, it's likely that we're supposed to consider only the helium gas and its change in entropy due to the expansion.\n\nLet me consider the process in more detail. Evacuating the gas into a larger container at constant temperature sounds like a free expansion. In a free expansion, the gas expands against a vacuum, and no work is done. In such a process, the internal energy of the gas remains constant because no work is done, and if the temperature is held constant, then the entropy should increase due to the increase in volume.\n\nBut I should make sure about the temperature condition. The problem states that the temperature is held constant, which suggests that the expansion is isothermal. In an isothermal free expansion, the entropy change is indeed positive.\n\nAlternatively, if the temperature were allowed to change, that could affect the entropy change, but the problem specifies that the temperature is held constant.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems correct: entropy will increase because the gas molecules are more dispersed in the larger flask.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A says entropy remains constant because the number of molecules doesn't change. But as I thought earlier, entropy isn't only about the number of molecules; it's about their arrangement in space. So, even if the number of molecules stays the same, spreading them out into a larger volume increases the number of possible arrangements, thus increasing entropy.\n\nOption B says entropy decreases because the gas is more ordered in the larger flask. This seems contradictory because spreading out into a larger volume typically increases disorder, not decreases it.\n\nOption C says entropy decreases because molecules collide less often with the sides of the flask. Fewer collisions might imply lower pressure or something, but that doesn't directly translate to decreased entropy. In fact, with more space, molecules have more freedom to move around, which should increase entropy.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I believe option D is the correct answer: entropy will increase as the gas molecules become more dispersed in the larger flask.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
