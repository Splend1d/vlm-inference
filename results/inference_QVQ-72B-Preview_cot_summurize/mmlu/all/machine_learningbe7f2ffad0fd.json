                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about conditional probability with Boolean random variables. So, we have A and B, both Boolean. We're given P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/3, and P(A | \u00acB) = 1/4, and we need to find P(A | B).\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic probability rules for conditional probability. I know that P(A | B) is the probability of A given that B has occurred, and it's calculated as P(A and B) divided by P(B), right? So, P(A | B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B).\n\nSimilarly, P(A | \u00acB) = P(A \u2229 \u00acB) / P(\u00acB).\n\nWe're given P(A | \u00acB) = 1/4, and we know P(B) = 1/3, so P(\u00acB) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nSo, using the formula for P(A | \u00acB), we have:\n\nP(A | \u00acB) = P(A \u2229 \u00acB) / P(\u00acB) \u21d2 1/4 = P(A \u2229 \u00acB) / (2/3).\n\nTo find P(A \u2229 \u00acB), I can rearrange this:\n\nP(A \u2229 \u00acB) = (1/4) * (2/3) = 2/12 = 1/6.\n\nNow, I also know P(A), which is 1/2. Since A can happen in two mutually exclusive ways: either A and B, or A and \u00acB, I can write:\n\nP(A) = P(A \u2229 B) + P(A \u2229 \u00acB).\n\nWe already have P(A \u2229 \u00acB) = 1/6, so:\n\n1/2 = P(A \u2229 B) + 1/6 \u21d2 P(A \u2229 B) = 1/2 - 1/6 = 3/6 - 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nNow, P(A | B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B) = (1/3) / (1/3) = 1.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if there's any trick here.\n\nIs P(A | B) really 1? That would mean that whenever B occurs, A always occurs. But is that necessarily true based on the given probabilities?\n\nLet me see. We have P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/3, and P(A | \u00acB) = 1/4.\n\nFrom P(A | \u00acB) = 1/4 and P(\u00acB) = 2/3, P(A \u2229 \u00acB) = (1/4)*(2/3) = 1/6.\n\nTotal P(A) = P(A \u2229 B) + P(A \u2229 \u00acB) \u21d2 1/2 = P(A \u2229 B) + 1/6 \u21d2 P(A \u2229 B) = 1/3.\n\nNow, P(A | B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B) = (1/3)/(1/3) = 1.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, P(A | B) = 1.\n\nBut let me think about it in terms of possible outcomes to make sure there's no mistake.\n\nLet's consider the sample space with the least common multiple of the denominators involved, which are 2, 3, and 4. The LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12. So, let's assume a sample space of 12 equally likely outcomes.\n\nGiven P(A) = 1/2, so 6 outcomes have A.\n\nP(B) = 1/3, so 4 outcomes have B.\n\nP(A | \u00acB) = 1/4, and P(\u00acB) = 2/3, so P(A \u2229 \u00acB) = (1/4)*(2/3) = 1/6, which is 2 out of 12 outcomes.\n\nSo, out of the 8 outcomes where \u00acB occurs (since P(\u00acB) = 2/3 = 8/12), 2 have A.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 4 outcomes where B occurs, we have P(A \u2229 B).\n\nSince total P(A) is 6/12, and P(A \u2229 \u00acB) is 2/12, then P(A \u2229 B) must be 4/12 = 1/3.\n\nThus, P(A | B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B) = (1/3)/(1/3) = 1.\n\nSo, it seems P(A | B) = 1.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf P(A | B) = 1, that means that whenever B occurs, A must also occur. So, in all the cases where B is true, A is also true.\n\nGiven that P(B) = 1/3 and P(A) = 1/2, and we've calculated P(A \u2229 B) = 1/3, which is consistent with P(A | B) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, if P(A | B) were less than 1, say 1/2, then P(A \u2229 B) would be P(B)*P(A | B) = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6, but in our earlier calculation, P(A \u2229 B) = 1/3, which doesn't match this assumption.\n\nTherefore, P(A | B) must be 1 to have P(A \u2229 B) = 1/3.\n\nHence, the answer should be D. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 1} \\]"
