                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. A team of volunteers collected a total of $5,144 by selling T-shirts at a charity concert. Each T-shirt was sold for $8. I need to find out the total number of T-shirts they sold. The options are A. 632, B. 643, C. 655, and D. 668.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. They collected $5,144 from selling T-shirts, and each T-shirt was sold for $8. So, to find out how many T-shirts they sold, I need to divide the total amount collected by the price per T-shirt. That makes sense.\n\nSo, number of T-shirts = total money / price per T-shirt.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, that's 5,144 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do that division. 5,144 \u00f7 8.\n\nFirst, I'll see how many times 8 goes into 5. Well, 8 times 6 is 48, but that's less than 51. Wait, no, 8 times 6 is 48, and 8 times 7 is 56. But 56 is more than 51, so it can't be. Wait, no, I think I need to do it properly.\n\nActually, it's better to use long division for this.\n\nSo, 5,144 \u00f7 8.\n\nLet's set it up:\n\n8 goes into 5 how many times? 8 is larger than 5, so it can't go into it. So, I'll look at 51 now.\n\n8 goes into 51 how many times? 8 times 6 is 48, which is less than 51. 8 times 7 is 56, which is more than 51. So, 6 times.\n\nMultiply 8 by 6 to get 48, subtract that from 51, and the remainder is 3.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 34.\n\nNow, 8 goes into 34 how many times? 8 times 4 is 32, which is less than 34. 8 times 5 is 40, which is more than 34. So, 4 times.\n\nMultiply 8 by 4 to get 32, subtract that from 34, and the remainder is 2.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 24.\n\nNow, 8 goes into 24 exactly 3 times.\n\nMultiply 8 by 3 to get 24, subtract that from 24, and the remainder is 0.\n\nSo, the division comes out exactly, which is nice.\n\nNow, reading the quotient, it's 643.\n\nTherefore, the number of T-shirts sold is 643.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 643 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nI should just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal money collected: $5,144.\n\nPrice per T-shirt: $8.\n\nNumber of T-shirts sold: 5,144 \u00f7 8 = 643.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to verify, I can multiply 643 by 8.\n\n643 \u00d7 8:\n\nLet's do that.\n\n600 \u00d7 8 = 4,800.\n\n40 \u00d7 8 = 320.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24.\n\nNow, add them up: 4,800 + 320 = 5,120 + 24 = 5,144.\n\nYes, that matches the total money collected.\n\nSo, the answer is indeed 643.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 643.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 643} \\]"
