                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the investor has a right to use the right-of-way across the farm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a farm that's 10 acres, bought by a farmer in 2006. To the north of the farm is an orchard, which is 20 acres, owned by a rancher. Both properties are adjacent and located in a county.\n\nNow, way back, a remote predecessor of the farmer granted a way for egress and ingress across the farm to a shepherd. This was done under terms that created an easement appurtenant to the orchard. The easement was properly recorded, but the shepherd never actually used it.\n\nIn 2010, the rancher sells the orchard to the farmer. Then, in 2011, the farmer sells the orchard to an investor for $250,000. Neither of these deeds mentions the easement for the right-of-way.\n\nThe investor now claims she has a right-of-way across the farm, but the farmer says no such easement exists. Both properties border a public highway, so the investor already has access via that highway.\n\nNow, in an action to determine the investor's right to use the right-of-way across the farm, I need to decide which option is correct:\n\nA. Lose, because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher.\n\nB. Lose, because the right-of-way was abandoned inasmuch as there never was any actual use made.\n\nC. Win, because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.\n\nD. Win, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.\n\nAlright, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: extinguished by merger.\n\nI recall that merger can extinguish an easement when the dominant and servient tenements come under single ownership. In this case, when the farmer bought the orchard from the rancher in 2010, both the farm and the orchard were owned by the same person, the farmer.\n\nBut wait, the farm is the servient tenement (since it's burdened by the easement), and the orchard is the dominant tenement (since it has the benefit of the easement). When the farmer owns both, the easement could be extinguished by merger.\n\nHowever, I need to check if this is applicable here. The farmer already owned the farm and then bought the orchard. So, both properties were under single ownership after 2010.\n\nBut, the farmer then sold the orchard to the investor in 2011. So, the unity of title was temporary, from 2010 to 2011.\n\nI need to check if the easement was extinguished during that period of unified ownership.\n\nAssuming that the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both properties, then when the farmer sold the orchard to the investor, the easement wouldn't be revived because the investor didn't own the farm as well.\n\nWait, but the investor doesn't own the farm; she only owns the orchard. So, if the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both, then selling the orchard to someone else wouldn't revive the easement.\n\nTherefore, option A suggests that the investor should lose because the easement was extinguished by merger.\n\nBut, I need to confirm if merger applies here and if the easement was indeed extinguished.\n\nI think merger is a possible way to extinguish an easement, but I need to see if there are any exceptions or if other principles apply.\n\nMoving on to option B: abandoned because there was never any actual use made.\n\nAbandonment of an easement requires clear and decisive acts showing an intention to abandon it. Just because there was no use doesn't necessarily mean there was an intention to abandon.\n\nThe shepherd never used the easement, but that alone might not be enough to establish abandonment, especially since the easement was properly recorded.\n\nMoreover, abandonment typically requires some affirmative act or declaration of intent to abandon the easement.\n\nSince there's no mention of any such act or declaration, I'm not sure if abandonment is a valid ground to extinguish the easement here.\n\nSo, option B seems less likely.\n\nOption C: win, because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.\n\nConstructive notice is a concept where, because something is properly recorded, subsequent purchasers are deemed to have knowledge of it, even if they didn't actually know.\n\nIn this case, the easement was properly recorded, so when the farmer bought the orchard from the rancher in 2010, he should have been aware of the easement through a title search.\n\nSimilarly, when the farmer sold the orchard to the investor in 2011, the investor would have constructive notice of the easement.\n\nBut, neither deed mentioned the easement, which might be relevant.\n\nWait, if the easement was recorded, it should be part of the chain of title, and thus the investor should have constructive notice of it.\n\nHowever, the fact that the easement wasn't mentioned in the deeds might be significant, but generally, recorded easements are binding on subsequent purchasers.\n\nSo, if the investor has constructive notice of the easement, does that mean she can enforce it?\n\nWait, but the farmer is claiming that no such easement exists. So, perhaps the farmer is arguing that the easement was extinguished by some means, like merger or abandonment.\n\nBut, if the easement still exists, then the investor, as the current owner of the orchard, should be able to enforce it as an appurtenant easement.\n\nSo, option C suggests that the investor should win because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.\n\nBut, I'm a bit confused here. If the farmer had constructive notice when he bought the orchard, and then sold it to the investor, the investor would also have constructive notice.\n\nBut, does that mean the investor can enforce the easement against the farmer?\n\nI think so, because the easement is appurtenant to the orchard, and passes with it.\n\nSo, even if the farmer claims the easement doesn't exist, if it was properly recorded and is still valid, the investor should be able to enforce it.\n\nBut, earlier, option A suggested that the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both properties.\n\nSo, which one prevails?\n\nI need to think about this more carefully.\n\nOption D: win, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.\n\nEasement by implication arises when there's a pre-existing use that's necessary for the enjoyment of the dominant tenement, and it was apparent at the time of severance.\n\nIn this case, the orchard and the farm were separate properties to begin with, and the easement was created by a remote predecessor.\n\nSo, it's not a case of severance creating the easement; it was already created via deed.\n\nTherefore, easement by implication doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nSo, option D is probably not applicable.\n\nNow, between options A and C, I need to decide which one is correct.\n\nOption A says the investor should lose because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both properties.\n\nOption C says the investor should win because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.\n\nI need to determine which argument is stronger.\n\nFirst, regarding merger: when the dominant and servient tenements unite under single ownership, the easement can be extinguished.\n\nIn this scenario, the farmer owned both the farm (servient tenement) and the orchard (dominant tenement) from 2010 to 2011.\n\nDuring that period, the easement could have been extinguished by merger.\n\nHowever, when the farmer sold the orchard to the investor, the unity of title ended.\n\nGenerally, when the unity of title ends, the easement is not revived unless there's an express agreement to that effect.\n\nSo, if the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both, selling the orchard to the investor wouldn't revive the easement.\n\nTherefore, the investor wouldn't have the easement.\n\nBut, perhaps there's an argument that the easement wasn't actually extinguished by merger.\n\nI need to consider if merger applies in this situation.\n\nSome jurisdictions require that the easement be expressly mentioned in the deed when the properties are reunited under single ownership, and if not, it's not extinguished.\n\nAlternatively, some say that the easement is only suspended during the period of unity and revives when the properties are separated again.\n\nThis can be tricky.\n\nLet me look up the general rule for easement extinguishment by merger.\n\nGenerally, when the dominant and servient tenements are owned by the same person, the easement is said to be extinguished because there's no one to enforce it.\n\nHowever, when the properties are later sold to different owners, the easement doesn't automatically revive unless there's an express agreement or unless the easement was only suspended during the period of unity.\n\nIn this case, the farmer owned both properties from 2010 to 2011, and then sold the orchard to the investor in 2011.\n\nIf the easement was extinguished by merger during that period, then the investor wouldn't have the easement.\n\nBut, perhaps the easement was only suspended and revived when the farmer sold the orchard to the investor.\n\nI need to check the law on this point.\n\nAssuming that the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both properties, then the investor wouldn't have the easement.\n\nHowever, if the easement was only suspended and revived when the properties were separated again, then the investor would have the easement.\n\nThis seems confusing. I need to find out the general rule in property law regarding easement extinguishment by merger.\n\nUpon checking, I find that generally, when the dominant and servient tenements unite under one owner, the easement is extinguished because there's no one to enforce it.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions consider that the easement is only suspended during the period of unity and can revive when the properties are separated again.\n\nThis can depend on the jurisdiction and the specific terms of the easement.\n\nAssuming that the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both properties, then selling the orchard to the investor wouldn't revive the easement.\n\nTherefore, the investor wouldn't have the easement, and option A would be correct.\n\nBut, perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nOption C suggests that the investor should win because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.\n\nConstructive notice means that the farmer should have known about the easement because it was properly recorded.\n\nBut, knowing about the easement doesn't necessarily mean that the easement still exists or that it wasn't extinguished by some means.\n\nIf the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both properties, then the farmer's constructive notice of the easement wouldn't matter because the easement no longer exists.\n\nTherefore, option C seems less plausible than option A.\n\nOption B, abandonment, doesn't seem to apply because lack of use alone isn't sufficient to establish abandonment.\n\nOption D, easement by implication, doesn't seem relevant because the easement was created by deed, not by implication.\n\nSo, between options A and C, I think option A is more accurate.\n\nTherefore, the investor should lose because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
