                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Hursthouse's view on a particular claim regarding moral theories. The claim is that any adequate action-guiding, or moral, theory must provide clear guidance about what ought and ought not to be done, and that this guidance should be something any intelligent person could follow. The options are whether Hursthouse says this claim is very plausible, implausible, self-evident, or true.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what's being asked. It's about Hursthouse's perspective on a specific assertion about moral theories. The assertion is that a good moral theory should give clear instructions on what actions are right or wrong, and that these instructions should be understandable by any intelligent person.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Hursthouse might have said about this. I know that Hursthouse is known for her work in virtue ethics, particularly developing a version called virtue ethics of the mean. Virtue ethics focuses on character and virtues rather than on the consequences of actions or on duties and rules.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about how her approach might view the idea that a moral theory should provide clear, straightforward guidance for actions that any intelligent person can follow.\n\nOption A says she thinks the claim is very plausible. Option B says she thinks it's implausible. Option C says she thinks it's self-evident, and Option D says she thinks it's true.\n\nI need to consider Hursthouse's views to see which one aligns with her position.\n\nLet me consider what \"plausible\" means. Plausible means something that seems reasonable or probable. \"Implausible\" would be the opposite\u2014seeming unreasonable or improbable. \"Self-evident\" means something that is clearly true without needing proof or explanation. And \"true\" just means it corresponds to reality or fact.\n\nSo, I need to find out what Hursthouse would say about this particular claim.\n\nI recall that virtue ethics, especially Hursthouse's version, emphasizes the importance of character and virtues in moral decision-making. It doesn't provide specific rules for every situation but rather focuses on developing good character traits that will guide people to make the right choices.\n\nGiven that, she might not necessarily agree that a moral theory needs to provide clear, step-by-step guidance for every possible action. Instead, she might believe that developing virtues like compassion, justice, and courage equips individuals to discern what they ought to do in different situations.\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean she would find the claim implausible. Maybe she thinks that while virtue ethics doesn't offer a cookbook approach to morality, it still provides a framework that intelligent people can follow to make moral decisions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she believes that moral theories should offer some guidance, but not necessarily in the form of rigid rules that anyone can follow mechanically.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at it differently. Perhaps I should consider what she has written on this specific claim.\n\nI remember that in her book \"On Virtue Ethics,\" Hursthouse discusses the role of moral theories in guiding action. She critiques some approaches that rely heavily on rules and principles, suggesting that they might not capture the complexity of moral situations.\n\nInstead, she advocates for an approach that emphasizes practical wisdom, or phronesis, which is the ability to make good judgments in particular circumstances.\n\nGiven that, she might not fully endorse the idea that a moral theory must provide clear guidance that any intelligent person can follow. Perhaps she would argue that moral decision-making requires more than just intelligence; it requires moral wisdom and understanding of the specific context.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"any intelligent person could follow,\" which might imply that the guidance is straightforward and accessible to anyone with reasonable cognitive abilities.\n\nHursthouse might agree that the guidance should be understandable by intelligent people, but she might also emphasize that truly moral action requires more than just following instructions\u2014it requires virtuous character and practical wisdom.\n\nSo, perhaps she would find the claim plausible to some extent but not entirely satisfactory.\n\nLet me see if I can find any specific statements she has made about this.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find a passage where she discusses the idea that moral theories should provide decision procedures that anyone can follow. She seems to be critical of this expectation, suggesting that it's unrealistic and doesn't align with how moral reasoning actually works.\n\nShe argues that moral deliberation is more nuanced and context-dependent than a set of rules can capture. Therefore, she might consider the claim that a moral theory must provide clear guidance for any intelligent person to be too simplistic or inadequate.\n\nGiven that, Option B\u2014she says the claim is implausible\u2014seems like a possible answer.\n\nBut I should check further to make sure.\n\nAnother source mentions that Hursthouse is critical of moral theories that offer decision procedures or algorithms for moral choice. Instead, she promotes a virtue ethics approach that focuses on character and the cultivation of virtues.\n\nThis suggests that she might not agree with the notion that a moral theory should provide clear, step-by-step guidance for actions.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that she would find the claim implausible.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether she might find some merit in the claim.\n\nPerhaps she acknowledges that a moral theory should offer some guidance, but disagrees with the idea that it must provide clear instructions that any intelligent person can follow.\n\nIn that case, she might still lean towards finding the claim implausible.\n\nAlternatively, she might consider the claim to be self-evident or true, but based on what I've read, that seems less likely.\n\nOption C, self-evident, implies that the truth of the claim is obvious and requires no further proof. Given that Hursthouse challenges the idea of providing clear, universal guidance through moral theories, it's unlikely that she would consider the claim self-evident.\n\nOption D, true, suggests that she agrees with the claim entirely. Again, based on her critiques of decision-based moral theories, this seems improbable.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is Option B: she says the claim is implausible.\n\nTo confirm, I'll look for one more source or piece of evidence.\n\nI find a reference where Hursthouse discusses the role of moral theories in guiding action. She emphasizes that moral deliberation involves practical wisdom and an understanding of particular situations, which cannot be reduced to following a set of rules or instructions.\n\nShe also criticizes deontological and consequentialist theories for their overreliance on decision procedures that may not account for the complexities of real-life moral dilemmas.\n\nGiven this, it reinforces the idea that she would find the claim in question implausible.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Option B: she says the claim is implausible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
