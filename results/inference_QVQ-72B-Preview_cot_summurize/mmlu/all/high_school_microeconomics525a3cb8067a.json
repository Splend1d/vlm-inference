                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements is true about a pure public good. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that the marginal cost of providing an additional unit of the good to additional citizens is greater than zero. Hmm, I thought that for public goods, once they're provided, the marginal cost of providing an additional unit to another person is zero. Like, if it's a lighthouse beacon, shining it for one more ship doesn't cost anything extra. So, this option seems to suggest that there's some cost involved, which might not be the case for pure public goods.\n\nOption B says that consumers can be excluded from its benefits by not paying for it. I remember that one of the key features of public goods is non-excludability, meaning that it's hard or impossible to prevent someone from using it even if they don't pay. Like, you can't really stop someone from benefiting from national defense or streetlights just because they didn't contribute. So, this option seems incorrect because public goods are non-excludable.\n\nOption C says that one more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less unit for other consumers. This sounds a lot like rivalry in consumption, which is a characteristic of private goods, not public goods. Public goods are non-rivalrous, meaning that one person's use doesn't diminish another's ability to use it. So, if it's a public park, one more person enjoying it doesn't take away from others' enjoyment, assuming it's not overcrowded. So, this option doesn't seem to align with the nature of public goods.\n\nOption D says that the good cannot be divided into discrete units. Now, this seems plausible. Public goods are often provided in a way that they benefit everyone collectively, and it's not easy to divide them into individual portions. For example, clean air is something that everyone shares; you can't allocate a specific amount to each person. Similarly, national defense protects all citizens, not just specific individuals who pay more taxes. So, this seems like a characteristic of public goods.\n\nLet me double-check. Pure public goods are defined by two main properties: non-excludability and non-rivalry. Non-excludability means that it's difficult to prevent non-payers from consuming the good, and non-rivalry means that one person's consumption doesn't reduce the availability for others. Based on this, option D seems to be in line with these definitions, as not being divisible into discrete units would make it hard to assign specific units to individual consumers.\n\nOption A contradicts the non-rivalry principle because if the marginal cost were greater than zero, that would imply some rivalry in consumption, which isn't the case for pure public goods.\n\nOption B contradicts the non-excludability principle, as public goods are supposed to be available to all, regardless of payment.\n\nOption C directly refers to rivalry, which is not a characteristic of public goods.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: the good cannot be divided into discrete units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
