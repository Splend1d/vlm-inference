Recognition is a function as opposed to a power\n\nB. Recognition is reciprocal between two States\n\nC. Recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts not to the entity's declared statehood\n\nD. Recognition is only afforded to the government, not the State\n\nHmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"functional recognition\" means in the context of international law or relations. Recognition typically refers to a process where one state acknowledges another state's existence and sovereignty, often leading to the establishment of diplomatic relations.\n\nOption A says recognition is a function as opposed to a power. I'm not entirely sure what this means. Maybe it's suggesting that recognition is something states do as part of their regular operations (a function) rather than something they have the authority to do (a power). But that seems a bit confusing.\n\nOption B says recognition is reciprocal between two states. Reciprocal means mutual or given in return. So, if State A recognizes State B, then State B also recognizes State A. That makes sense in many cases, but I don't think it's always required. Sometimes, states might recognize others without immediate reciprocity, especially if there are political tensions.\n\nOption C says recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts, not to the entity's declared statehood. This sounds interesting. It might mean that a state can recognize certain actions or decisions made by another entity without fully recognizing that entity as a sovereign state. For example, maybe recognizing a treaty or an agreement made by a rebel group without recognizing the group as a state.\n\nOption D says recognition is only afforded to the government, not the state. This seems to suggest that when a state recognizes another's government, it's specifically the government that's being recognized, not the state as a whole. But I thought recognition was about acknowledging the state's sovereignty, which includes both the government and the people.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nIn international law, recognition is indeed about acknowledging the existence and sovereignty of another state. It's a way for states to indicate their willingness to interact with another state on a diplomatic level.\n\nNow, functional recognition might refer to a more limited form of recognition, where one state acknowledges specific functions or actions of another entity without fully recognizing it as a sovereign state.\n\nLooking back at option C, it says recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts, not to the entity's declared statehood. That seems to align with the idea of functional recognition. It's recognizing and accepting specific actions or decisions made by an entity, perhaps for practical purposes, without fully embracing its claim to statehood.\n\nOption D seems similar but phrased differently. It says recognition is only afforded to the government, not the state. If I understand correctly, recognizing a government typically implies recognizing the state itself, because the government is part of the state apparatus.\n\nWait a minute. There's a concept called de facto recognition and de jure recognition. De facto recognition acknowledges the practical reality of a government's control over a territory and its population, while de jure recognition acknowledges the legal right of that government to govern.\n\nBut that's a bit different from functional recognition.\n\nMaybe functional recognition is about recognizing specific functions or capacities of an entity without extending full diplomatic relations or acknowledging its statehood.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most fitting. It specifies that recognition is only for particular administrative acts, not for the entity's declared statehood.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose there's a rebel group that controls a significant portion of a country and declares independence. Other states might not want to recognize this group as a sovereign state but might still want to engage with it in certain areas, like humanitarian aid or ceasefires.\n\nIn such a case, functional recognition could allow those states to recognize and work with the rebel group's administrative decisions or acts without fully recognizing its statehood.\n\nOption A, \"recognition is a function as opposed to a power,\" still seems unclear. I'm not sure what differentiates a function from a power in this context. Maybe a function is an action a state performs, while a power is an authority it holds. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nOption B, \"recognition is reciprocal between two states,\" doesn't seem directly related to functional recognition. Reciprocity might be a general principle in some recognitions, but it's not specific to the idea of recognizing only certain functions.\n\nOption D, \"recognition is only afforded to the government, not the state,\" doesn't align well with the concept of functional recognition either. Recognizing a government typically involves recognizing the state it represents.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer: recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts, not to the entity's declared statehood.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could be partially correct or related in some way.\n\nOption A: if recognition is considered a function, meaning it's something states do routinely as part of their operations, that could imply that recognition is more of a practical step than a bestowal of sovereignty. However, in international law, recognition is seen as an act that acknowledges the existence and sovereignty of another state, which is more than just a routine function.\n\nOption B: reciprocity in recognition is a common practice, as states often recognize each other mutually. However, this doesn't capture the essence of functional recognition, which seems to be about limited acknowledgment of specific acts rather than full statehood.\n\nOption D: recognizing a government without recognizing the state could be a way to acknowledge the authority of a particular regime without fully endorsing the state's claims to sovereignty. However, in practice, recognizing a government typically implies recognizing the state it represents.\n\nTherefore, after considering all options, option C remains the most accurate description of functional recognition: recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts, not to the entity's declared statehood.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
