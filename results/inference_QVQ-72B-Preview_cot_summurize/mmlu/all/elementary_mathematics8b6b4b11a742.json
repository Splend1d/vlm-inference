The options are 20, 21, 22, or 25 words per minute.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many words he needs to type per minute to finish 550 words in 25 minutes. I think I should divide the total words by the time available.\n\nSo, 550 words divided by 25 minutes equals how many words per minute. Let me calculate that.\n\n550 \u00f7 25 = 22.\n\nSo, 22 words per minute.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. Maybe I can multiply 22 by 25 to see if I get 550.\n\n22 \u00d7 25: 20 \u00d7 25 is 500, and 2 \u00d7 25 is 50, so 500 + 50 is indeed 550. So, yes, 22 words per minute is correct.\n\nBut wait, the options include 22 words per minute, but there's also 21 and 20, which are slower, and 25, which is faster. So, is 22 the minimum he needs to type to finish on time?\n\nWell, at 22 words per minute, he would finish exactly at 25 minutes because 22 \u00d7 25 = 550. So, if he types exactly 22 words per minute, he'll finish just in time.\n\nBut what if he types faster? Would that be better? Maybe, because if he types faster, he'll finish earlier, which could give him some buffer time before class starts.\n\nBut the question is asking for the least speed he needs to type to finish on time, which would be the minimum required speed. So, in that case, 22 words per minute is the answer.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Perhaps considering that he might not type at a constant speed, but the question seems to assume a constant typing speed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a margin of error or something, but I don't think that's relevant here since the question provides exact numbers.\n\nSo, based on the calculation, 22 words per minute is the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, what if he types at 21 words per minute? How much would he type in 25 minutes?\n\n21 \u00d7 25 = 525 words.\n\nHe has 550 words to type, so 525 is less than 550, meaning he wouldn't finish in time if he types at 21 words per minute.\n\nSimilarly, at 20 words per minute, 20 \u00d7 25 = 500 words, which is still less than 550.\n\nAt 22 words per minute, it's exactly 550, as calculated earlier.\n\nAnd at 25 words per minute, 25 \u00d7 25 = 625 words, which is more than 550, so he would finish earlier.\n\nBut the question is asking for the least speed to finish on time, so 22 words per minute is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the possibilities here. Marshall needs to type at least 22 words per minute to finish his paper on time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
