                    "text": "So I have this question here about harmonics and frequencies. It says, \"Compared with a fundamental tone, the frequency of its second harmonic is...\" and then there are options: A. half as much, B. twice as much, C. the same, D. four times as much.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what a fundamental tone and a harmonic are. When you have a vibrating string or a column of air, like in a musical instrument, it produces a sound with a certain frequency, which is the fundamental frequency. This is the lowest frequency and it defines the pitch of the note.\n\nNow, harmonics are additional frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. So, the second harmonic would be twice the fundamental frequency, the third harmonic is three times, and so on.\n\nWait a minute, let's make sure I get this. If the fundamental frequency is, say, 100 Hz, then the second harmonic would be 200 Hz, right? So, that would make it twice as much, which is option B.\n\nBut let's think deeper to make sure there aren't any tricks here. In music theory, the overtones or harmonics can sometimes be referred to differently, but in terms of frequency, it's consistently multiples of the fundamental.\n\nLet me consider a string fixed at both ends. The possible frequencies it can vibrate at are given by the formula f_n = n * (v)/(2L), where n is a positive integer representing the harmonic number, v is the speed of the wave on the string, and L is the length of the string.\n\nSo, for the fundamental mode, n=1, f_1 = (v)/(2L). For the second harmonic, n=2, f_2 = 2*(v)/(2L) = (v)/(L). So, f_2 = 2 * f_1.\n\nTherefore, the second harmonic is indeed twice the fundamental frequency.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or if this changes in different contexts. For example, in real musical instruments, especially wind instruments, the relationship might not be exactly integer multiples due to the physical properties of the instrument, but theoretically, in an ideal scenario, the second harmonic should be twice the fundamental frequency.\n\nAlso, in some cases, the fundamental frequency might not be present, like in some wind instruments where the pipe is open at both ends, and the fundamental might be missing, but the question seems to be referring to the mathematical relationship between the fundamental and the second harmonic.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems clear that the second harmonic is twice the fundamental frequency.\n\nLet me look up a quick reference to confirm this. Oh, but since I'm writing this as if I'm taking an exam, I shouldn't assume I have access to external resources. Let's proceed with what I know.\n\nIn summary, the second harmonic is twice the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the correct answer is B. twice as much.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
