                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about moral advice. So, Baier says that when we ask for moral advice, we're essentially asking someone to do something specific. The options are:\n\nA. Issue commands.\n\nB. Inform us of their preferences.\n\nC. Deliberate with us.\n\nD. Empathize with us.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what does it mean to ask for moral advice? Well, moral advice is usually about what's right or wrong, ethical or unethical, in a particular situation. So, when I ask someone for moral advice, I'm seeking guidance on how to act or think about a moral issue.\n\nNow, what is Baier suggesting about this process? He seems to be saying that by asking for moral advice, we're implicitly requesting that the advisor performs a certain action. I need to understand which of these options aligns best with that idea.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Issue commands: If someone is issuing commands, they're telling me what to do, perhaps in an authoritative way. Is that what I'm asking for when I seek moral advice? Maybe in some cases, but often, I think people want more than just orders. They want reasoning and discussion.\n\nB. Inform us of their preferences: This suggests that when I ask for moral advice, I just want to know what the other person likes or dislikes about the situation. But moral advice seems deeper than personal preference. It's more about principles or ethical considerations, not just individual tastes.\n\nC. Deliberate with us: Deliberation involves thoughtful discussion and consideration of different viewpoints. When I ask for moral advice, I might be seeking someone to talk through the issue with, considering various angles and possible consequences. This seems plausible.\n\nD. Empathize with us: Empathy involves understanding and sharing the feelings of others. While empathy can be a part of moral advice, it feels more like a component of the advisory process rather than the primary thing being requested.\n\nSo, comparing these options, C. deliberate with us seems like a good choice. Asking for moral advice often involves seeking a thoughtful discussion about the ethical dimensions of a situation, rather than just being told what to do (command), being informed of someone's likes and dislikes (preferences), or having someone share our emotions (empathize).\n\nBut let me think about this differently. Maybe Baier is suggesting that when we ask for moral advice, we're inviting someone to engage in a process of reasoning together, weighing different moral principles, and considering the implications of our actions. That sounds a lot like deliberation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's arguing that by asking for advice, we're acknowledging the advisor's authority or expertise in moral matters, which might imply that we expect them to issue commands or dictates.\n\nHowever, that seems less likely in most contemporary contexts. Typically, when people ask for advice, they're looking for guidance, not for someone to tell them what to do in an authoritarian way.\n\nOption B, informing us of their preferences, also doesn't seem sufficient. Knowing someone's preferences might help inform our decision, but moral advice is generally expected to be more principled and less subjective.\n\nOption D, empathizing with us, is about emotional connection and understanding, which, while important in moral discussions, isn't the primary purpose of seeking advice. Empathy can aid in deliberation, but it's not the same as giving advice.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, C. deliberate with us seems to be the most accurate answer. It captures the essence of what happens when we seek moral advice: we engage in a process of joint reflection and discussion to reach a morally acceptable conclusion.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider an example. Suppose I'm facing a dilemma about whether to tell a white lie to protect someone's feelings or to tell the truth, which might hurt them. If I ask a friend for moral advice, I'm probably looking for them to help me think through the consequences, consider relevant moral principles (like honesty versus compassion), and perhaps offer their perspective on how to balance these considerations. This is deliberation in action.\n\nIn contrast, if they just tell me to lie because they prefer that outcome, or command me to tell the truth without explanation, that feels less helpful and less in line with what I'm seeking.\n\nSo, I think Baier is suggesting that when we ask for moral advice, we're essentially inviting others to deliberate with us, to engage in a process of joint moral reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
