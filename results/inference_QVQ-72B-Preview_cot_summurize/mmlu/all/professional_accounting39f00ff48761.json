                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Felton Farm Supplies, Inc., with an 8% return on total assets (ROA), a net profit margin of 5%, and total assets of $300,000. We need to find their sales. The options are pretty varied, so I want to make sure I calculate this correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what return on assets (ROA) is. ROA is a measure of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The formula for ROA is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nWe know the ROA is 8% and the total assets are $300,000. So, I can plug in these values to find the net income.\n\n\\[\n0.08 = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{300,000}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for net income, I'll multiply both sides by 300,000.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Income} = 0.08 \\times 300,000 = 24,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the net income is $24,000.\n\nNext, I need to use the net profit margin to find the sales. The net profit margin is the percentage of sales that remain as net income after all expenses are paid. The formula for net profit margin is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Sales}}\n\\]\n\nWe know the net profit margin is 5% and the net income is $24,000. Plugging these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n0.05 = \\frac{24,000}{\\text{Sales}}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for sales, I'll multiply both sides by sales and then divide both sides by 0.05.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sales} = \\frac{24,000}{0.05} = 480,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the sales are $480,000, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could use the DuPont analysis, which breaks down ROA into net profit margin and asset turnover.\n\nThe formula for ROA in DuPont analysis is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{ROA} = \\text{Net Profit Margin} \\times \\text{Asset Turnover}\n\\]\n\nWhere asset turnover is sales divided by total assets.\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n0.08 = 0.05 \\times \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{300,000}\n\\]\n\nSolving for sales:\n\n\\[\n0.08 = 0.05 \\times \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{300,000}\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 0.05:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.08}{0.05} = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{300,000}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1.6 = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{300,000}\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 300,000:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sales} = 1.6 \\times 300,000 = 480,000\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier result that sales are $480,000.\n\nI think that's solid. Just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other information or potential pitfalls. The question mentions \"sales,\" which is typically considered as total revenue from sales, and that's what the net profit margin is applied to. There doesn't seem to be any trickery here, like including or excluding taxes, etc. So, I'm confident that $480,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 480,000} \\]"
