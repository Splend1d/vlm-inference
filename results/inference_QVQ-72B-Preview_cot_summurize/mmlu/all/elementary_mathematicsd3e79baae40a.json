                    "text": "I need to find which ratio can form a proportion with 3 over 8. So, I have to look for a ratio that is equal to 3/8. The options are:\n\nA. 18 over 40\n\nB. 18 over 56\n\nC. 24 over 64\n\nD. 15 over 48\n\nFirst, I should simplify each of these ratios to see if they equal 3/8.\n\nLet's start with option A: 18 over 40.\n\nTo simplify 18/40, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 40. The GCD of 18 and 40 is 2. So, dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\n40 \u00f7 2 = 20\n\nSo, 18/40 simplifies to 9/20.\n\nIs 9/20 equal to 3/8? Let's see.\n\nCross-multiplying: 9*8 = 72 and 3*20 = 60. Since 72 \u2260 60, they are not equal.\n\nSo, option A is not equal to 3/8.\n\nNext, option B: 18 over 56.\n\nAgain, simplify 18/56.\n\nFind the GCD of 18 and 56. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, and the factors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. The greatest common factor is 2.\n\nDivide both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\n56 \u00f7 2 = 28\n\nSo, 18/56 simplifies to 9/28.\n\nNow, is 9/28 equal to 3/8?\n\nCross-multiplying: 9*8 = 72 and 3*28 = 84. Since 72 \u2260 84, they are not equal.\n\nOption B is not equal to 3/8.\n\nMoving on to option C: 24 over 64.\n\nSimplify 24/64.\n\nFind the GCD of 24 and 64. Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Factors of 64: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The GCD is 8.\n\nDivide both numerator and denominator by 8:\n\n24 \u00f7 8 = 3\n\n64 \u00f7 8 = 8\n\nSo, 24/64 simplifies to 3/8.\n\nTherefore, option C is equal to 3/8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check option D as well.\n\nOption D: 15 over 48.\n\nSimplify 15/48.\n\nFind the GCD of 15 and 48. Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15. Factors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48. The GCD is 3.\n\nDivide both numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n48 \u00f7 3 = 16\n\nSo, 15/48 simplifies to 5/16.\n\nIs 5/16 equal to 3/8?\n\nCross-multiplying: 5*8 = 40 and 3*16 = 48. Since 40 \u2260 48, they are not equal.\n\nTherefore, the only option that forms a proportion with 3/8 is option C: 24 over 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
