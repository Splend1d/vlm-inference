So, the question is asking which color bends more than green. Okay, so first, I need to recall how light behaves when it passes through a prism.\n\nI think the prism causes refraction of light, and different colors bend by different amounts because they have different wavelengths. So, violet light has a shorter wavelength and bends the most, and red has the longest wavelength and bends the least. Green is somewhere in the middle.\n\nSo, if green is in the middle, then the colors that bend more than green would be the ones that have shorter wavelengths than green, which should be blue and violet.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. red\n\nB. yellow\n\nC. blue\n\nD. none of these\n\nRed has a longer wavelength and bends less than green, so it's not more than green. Yellow is also less than green, I think. Blue has a shorter wavelength and bends more than green, so that seems like a possible answer. Violet bends even more, but since it's not listed, blue is the correct choice among these.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the light that bends more than green is...\" and the options are A. red, B. yellow, C. blue, D. none of these. So, based on what I know, blue bends more than green, so the answer should be C. blue.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Prism dispersion causes different colors to bend at different angles, with violet being the most refracted and red the least. Green is in between. So, blue is more refracted than green, yes.\n\nI don't think it's red or yellow because they bend less than green. None of these seems incorrect because blue is an option and it does bend more than green.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
