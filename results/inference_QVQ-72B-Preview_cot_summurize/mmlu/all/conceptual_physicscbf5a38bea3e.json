                    "text": "So I have this question about the lowest possible temperature. It says that the lowest possible temperature is absolute zero, and it gives two options: 0 Kelvin and -273\u00b0C. Then it asks which one of these is correct, or if both are the same, or neither is correct. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I know that absolute zero is the theoretical temperature at which all thermal motion ceases. It's considered the coldest possible temperature that anything can reach. Now, I remember that the Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale, meaning it starts at absolute zero. So, 0 Kelvin should be absolute zero.\n\nBut what about -273\u00b0C? Let me think about the relationship between Celsius and Kelvin. I recall that the freezing point of water is 0\u00b0C in Celsius, and that corresponds to 273.15 Kelvin in Kelvin scale. So, to convert from Celsius to Kelvin, I usually add 273.15 to the Celsius temperature. For example, 0\u00b0C plus 273.15 is 273.15 K, and -273.15\u00b0C plus 273.15 would be 0 K, which is absolute zero.\n\nWait a minute, the question says -273\u00b0C, but I'm thinking it might be -273.15\u00b0C. Maybe it's a rounding approximation. Let me check online or in a physics book to confirm the exact value for absolute zero in Celsius.\n\nOkay, according to my reference, absolute zero is indeed -273.15\u00b0C. So, the question probably rounded it to -273\u00b0C. In that case, both 0 Kelvin and -273\u00b0C are referring to the same temperature, which is absolute zero.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA. 0 Kelvin\n\nB. -273\u00b0C\n\nC. Both are the same\n\nD. None of these\n\nSince both A and B are essentially the same temperature, just expressed differently, I think the answer should be C. Both are the same.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the question is trying to see if I understand that they are the same thing. Or perhaps there's something else I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other context. Is there a possibility that absolute zero could be expressed differently in other scales, like Fahrenheit, but the question specifies Kelvin and Celsius. So, probably not relevant here.\n\nAlso, I should consider if absolute zero can actually be reached in practice. I think not, according to the third law of thermodynamics. But the question is about the theoretical lowest possible temperature, not what's achievable in reality.\n\nSo, in theory, absolute zero is 0 Kelvin or -273\u00b0C. Therefore, both options A and B are correct, and C says both are the same, which seems to be the right choice.\n\nI think the answer is C. Both are the same.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
