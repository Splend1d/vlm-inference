                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out the best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nA plaintiff sued the defendant in federal court for injuries from an accident. At trial, the plaintiff presented evidence that her injuries had permanently paralyzed her legs. The jury bought it and awarded her $5 million in damages. But two months after the judgment was entered, the defendant gets a videotape showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor on the day the videotape was made.\n\nOkay, so this videotape seems pretty significant. It suggests that the plaintiff's injuries aren't as severe as she claimed, or maybe even that she's fully recovered. The question is, how can the defendant use this new information to challenge the judgment?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Move for a new trial or, in the alternative, for remittitur to reduce the award in light of the shortened duration of the plaintiff's injuries.\n\nSo, a motion for a new trial is usually based on some error that occurred during the trial that might have affected the outcome. Remittitur is when the court reduces the amount of damages awarded because it's excessive.\n\nIn this case, the defendant has new evidence that the plaintiff's injuries aren't permanent, as she claimed. If the injuries are shorter in duration, maybe the damages should be reduced. But is this new evidence enough to warrant a new trial or a reduction in damages?\n\nB. Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the judgment was based on the jury's mistaken belief that the plaintiff's injuries would be permanent.\n\nThis seems similar to option A but phrased differently. It's focusing on the jury's belief rather than the duration of the injuries.\n\nC. Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff committed a fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries.\n\nFraud is a serious allegation. It involves intentional misrepresentation or concealment of material facts. If the plaintiff knowingly presented false evidence about her injuries being permanent when they weren't, that could be fraud.\n\nBut, the videotape shows her jogging on the day it was made, which is after the judgment was entered. Does that necessarily mean she was lying about her injuries during the trial? Maybe her condition improved after the accident, but she didn't know that at the time of the trial.\n\nD. Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that there is newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent.\n\nThis seems straightforward. There's new evidence (the videotape) that suggests the plaintiff's injuries aren't permanent, which contradicts her earlier claims and the jury's finding.\n\nBut, I need to think about whether this new evidence is relevant to the jury's decision. The jury awarded damages based on the plaintiff's claim of permanent paralysis. If the videotape shows that she can walk now, does that mean her injuries weren't permanent?\n\nWait a minute, maybe her injuries were permanent, but she recovered later. Or maybe her condition changed after the trial. Does that affect the validity of the original judgment?\n\nI think the key here is that the plaintiff claimed permanent paralysis, and the jury awarded damages based on that claim. If the plaintiff has since recovered, that doesn't necessarily mean she was lying during the trial. Things can change over time.\n\nBut, if the plaintiff was lying during the trial, that's a different story. Fraud would be a more serious issue.\n\nLet me consider the rules for motions for new trials and motions for relief from judgment.\n\nIn federal court, under Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party can move for a new trial within 28 days after the entry of judgment. But in this case, two months have passed, so the time for a motion for new trial has likely expired.\n\nWait, the judgment was entered two months ago, and now the defendant has this new evidence. Is there a way to extend the time for a new trial motion because of newly discovered evidence?\n\nI think there's a exception for newly discovered evidence, but I'm not sure about the time limits.\n\nAlternatively, under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party can seek relief from a final judgment for several reasons, including (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence that by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misconduct, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; or (6) any other reason justifying relief.\n\nSo, Rule 60(b) provides a broader range of grounds for relief, including newly discovered evidence and fraud.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant has new evidence (the videotape) that was not available at the time of the trial. The videotape shows the plaintiff jogging, which contradicts her claim of permanent paralysis.\n\nBut, is this new evidence enough to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)?\n\nI need to consider whether this new evidence could have been discovered with due diligence before the trial. If it could have been, then the defendant might not be able to use it as a basis for relief now.\n\nBut, suppose the plaintiff's recovery was unexpected or unknown until after the trial. Then, it might qualify as newly discovered evidence.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff's current condition might not necessarily negate the fact that she was permanently injured at the time of the trial. Maybe her injuries improved after the trial due to treatment or natural healing.\n\nIf that's the case, then the original judgment might still be valid because it was based on the information available at the time of the trial.\n\nBut, if the plaintiff lied about her injuries during the trial, knowing that she was not permanently paralyzed, that would be fraud.\n\nSo, perhaps the defendant should consider moving for relief on the ground of fraud, alleging that the plaintiff misrepresented her injuries.\n\nAlternatively, if the plaintiff's recovery was unforeseeable and occurred after the trial, maybe the defendant can argue that the judgment should be set aside because it was based on a mistaken belief about the permanency of the injuries.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose the plaintiff genuinely believed she was permanently paralyzed at the time of the trial, but then she recovered unexpectedly afterward. In that case, she didn't commit fraud, and the original judgment might still stand.\n\nOn the other hand, if she knew she was not permanently injured but claimed she was to get a larger damage award, that's fraud.\n\nThe videotape alone doesn't prove that she was lying during the trial. It only shows that she can walk now.\n\nMaybe the defendant needs to investigate further to see if the plaintiff's recovery was known or knowable at the time of the trial.\n\nBut, based on the information provided, it seems that the plaintiff claimed permanent paralysis, the jury believed her, and now there's evidence that she can walk.\n\nIf the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent, as she claimed, then the damage award might be excessive, and the defendant could seek a reduction in damages through remittitur.\n\nBut, again, if her injuries were permanent at the time of the trial and she recovered afterward, that doesn't change the validity of the original judgment.\n\nI think the defendant needs to show that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent at the time of the trial or that she committed fraud by misrepresenting her injuries.\n\nGiven that, option C suggests moving for relief on the ground of fraud, while option D suggests moving for relief on the ground of newly discovered evidence.\n\nBetween these two, I need to decide which one is more appropriate.\n\nIf the defendant can prove that the plaintiff knew her injuries were not permanent at the time of the trial but claimed they were, that would be fraud.\n\nHowever, proving fraud can be difficult because it requires showing intent to deceive.\n\nAlternatively, if the defendant can show that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent, based on the new evidence, that might be sufficient to seek relief under the newly discovered evidence ground.\n\nBut, I need to consider whether the new evidence relates to a fact that was in dispute at the trial.\n\nIn this case, the permanency of the plaintiff's injuries was a key issue at trial. If the new evidence (the videotape) shows that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent, as she claimed, that could be a valid ground for relief.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the plaintiff's current ability to walk necessarily means her injuries weren't permanent at the time of the trial.\n\nMaybe her injuries were permanent, but she recovered afterward due to medical treatment or natural healing.\n\nIf that's the case, then the original judgment might still be valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plaintiff's injuries were only temporary, and she always knew she would recover.\n\nIf that's true, then her claim of permanent paralysis would be fraudulent.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe the best approach is for the defendant to move for relief under Rule 60(b)(2) for newly discovered evidence.\n\nThe defendant would need to show that:\n\n1. The evidence has been discovered since the trial.\n\n2. The evidence could not have been discovered before the trial by the exercise of due diligence.\n\n3. The evidence is material and not merely cumulative or impeaching.\n\n4. The evidence is such that it would probably produce a different result if a new trial were granted.\n\nIn this scenario, the videotape was made after the trial and judgment, so it qualifies as newly discovered evidence.\n\nThe defendant could argue that this evidence shows that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent, which contradicts her claim and the jury's finding.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff might counter that her injuries were permanent at the time of the trial but that she has since recovered.\n\nIf that's the case, then the original judgment might still be valid, and the new evidence doesn't negate the permanency at the time of the trial.\n\nAlternatively, if the plaintiff's recovery was foreseeable or if she knew she was not permanently injured at the time of the trial, that could be fraud.\n\nBut, without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps the defendant should consider both options: moving for relief based on newly discovered evidence and also alleging fraud if there's evidence to support it.\n\nBut, in the question, we have to choose the best way to seek relief.\n\nOption A suggests moving for a new trial or, alternatively, for remittitur to reduce the award.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, the time for a new trial motion may have expired, and remittitur would only be appropriate if the damages are excessive.\n\nOption B mentions moving for relief on the ground that the judgment was based on the jury's mistaken belief about the permanency of the injuries.\n\nThis seems similar to option D but phrased differently.\n\nOption C focuses on fraud, alleging that the plaintiff obtained damages for permanent injuries through fraudulent means.\n\nOption D focuses on newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is the most straightforward and appropriate choice.\n\nThe defendant has new evidence that directly contradicts the plaintiff's claim of permanent injuries, which was a key factor in the jury's damage award.\n\nTherefore, moving for relief from the judgment on the ground of newly discovered evidence is the best course of action.\n\nOf course, the defendant would need to present evidence to support their claim, possibly including expert testimony on the nature of the plaintiff's injuries and whether her current ability to walk negates the permanency at the time of the trial.\n\nBut, based on the information provided, option D seems the most fitting.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
