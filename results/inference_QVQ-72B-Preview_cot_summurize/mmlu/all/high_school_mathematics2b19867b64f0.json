                    "text": "So I've got this problem here that's asking me to find which point isn't a solution to both inequalities y > 9x \u2013 8 and y < \u2013x + 8. The options are A. (\u20132, 15), B. (\u20131, 5), C. (0, 0), and D. (1, 5). I need to check each point against both inequalities and see which one doesn't satisfy both.\n\nFirst, I should understand what these inequalities represent. Both are linear inequalities; the first one is y > 9x \u2013 8, which is above the line y = 9x \u2013 8, and the second is y < \u2013x + 8, which is below the line y = \u2013x + 8.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to plug each point into both inequalities and see if they hold true. If a point satisfies both inequalities, I'll set it aside, and the one that doesn't satisfy at least one of them is the answer.\n\nLet's start with point A: (\u20132, 15).\n\nFirst inequality: y > 9x \u2013 8.\n\nPlug in x = \u20132 and y = 15.\n\n15 > 9*(-2) \u2013 8 \u2192 15 > \u201318 \u2013 8 \u2192 15 > \u201326.\n\nThis is true because 15 is greater than \u201326.\n\nNow the second inequality: y < \u2013x + 8.\n\nPlug in x = \u20132 and y = 15.\n\n15 < \u2013(\u20132) + 8 \u2192 15 < 2 + 8 \u2192 15 < 10.\n\nThis is false because 15 is not less than 10.\n\nSo, point A doesn't satisfy both inequalities. Maybe this is the answer, but I should check the others to be sure.\n\nNext, point B: (\u20131, 5).\n\nFirst inequality: 5 > 9*(-1) \u2013 8 \u2192 5 > \u20139 \u2013 8 \u2192 5 > \u201317. True.\n\nSecond inequality: 5 < \u2013(\u20131) + 8 \u2192 5 < 1 + 8 \u2192 5 < 9. True.\n\nSo, point B satisfies both inequalities.\n\nPoint C: (0, 0).\n\nFirst inequality: 0 > 9*0 \u2013 8 \u2192 0 > \u20138. True.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 < \u20130 + 8 \u2192 0 < 8. True.\n\nPoint C also satisfies both.\n\nPoint D: (1, 5).\n\nFirst inequality: 5 > 9*1 \u2013 8 \u2192 5 > 9 \u2013 8 \u2192 5 > 1. True.\n\nSecond inequality: 5 < \u20131 + 8 \u2192 5 < 7. True.\n\nSo, point D satisfies both inequalities.\n\nFrom this, it seems like point A is the only one that doesn't satisfy both inequalities. Therefore, the answer should be A. (\u20132, 15).\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"which of the following points is NOT a solution to both of the inequalities.\" So, if a point satisfies at least one of the inequalities, it's still considered a solution as long as it doesn't satisfy both? No, it needs to not satisfy both.\n\nSo, in point A, it satisfies the first inequality but not the second, meaning it doesn't satisfy both, which is what the question is asking for.\n\nBut looking back, the question says \"which of the following points is NOT a solution to both of the inequalities.\" So, it should be the one that doesn't satisfy both inequalities simultaneously.\n\nIn this case, point A doesn't satisfy both at the same time because it satisfies the first but not the second. So, yes, that's the correct answer.\n\nI think I might have misread initially, but upon checking all points, point A is indeed the one that doesn't satisfy both inequalities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ (-2, \\ 15)} \\]"
