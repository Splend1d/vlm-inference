They surveyed 50 boys and 40 girls, asking them to report how many contacts they have. And now, I need to figure out which statement is true regarding whether to use a two-sample t-test or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a two-sample t-test is. From what I remember, a two-sample t-test is used to determine if there's a significant difference between the means of two independent groups. In this case, the groups are boys and girls, and the variable is the number of contacts in their phones.\n\nSo, the student has two independent samples: 50 boys and 40 girls. They want to compare the average number of contacts between these two groups.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, the student should use a two-sample t-test.\n\nB. Because the sample sizes are different, the student should not use a two-sample t-test.\n\nC. Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the student should not use a two-sample t-test.\n\nD. Because the shape of the population distribution is not known, the student should not use a two-sample t-test.\n\nAlright, let's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: It says that since population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, a two-sample t-test should be used. Okay, so in statistics, when we don't know the population standard deviations, which is often the case, we use t-tests instead of z-tests, which require known population standard deviations. So, this seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about the conditions for using a two-sample t-test. The conditions typically include:\n\n1. Independence: The two samples are independent of each other.\n\n2. Randomization: The samples are randomly selected.\n\n3. Normality: The data should be normally distributed within each group.\n\n4. Equal variance (optional): Sometimes, we assume equal variances, but modern software can handle unequal variances as well.\n\nIn this problem, it says the students were randomly sampled, so independence and randomization seem to be satisfied.\n\nHowever, option D mentions the shape of the population distribution not being known. Since normality is one of the assumptions, if the population distributions are not normal, that could be a issue for the t-test.\n\nBut, I recall that t-tests are fairly robust to deviations from normality, especially when sample sizes are large. In this case, the sample sizes are 50 boys and 40 girls, which are reasonably large. So, even if the populations aren't normally distributed, the t-test should still be okay.\n\nOption B says that because the sample sizes are different, a two-sample t-test shouldn't be used. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. T-tests can be used with different sample sizes; in fact, it's quite common. So, I think this is a misconception.\n\nOption C says that because both sample sizes are greater than 30, a two-sample t-test shouldn't be used. Wait, I thought that t-tests are appropriate for sample sizes larger than 30 as well. In fact, larger sample sizes can make the t-test more reliable due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches normality as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nSo, having sample sizes larger than 30 would actually support the use of a t-test, not discourage it.\n\nTherefore, option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says that because the shape of the population distribution is not known, a two-sample t-test shouldn't be used. As I thought earlier, while normality is an assumption of the t-test, the test is robust to non-normality, especially with larger sample sizes. So, unless the populations are extremely non-normal or have outliers, the t-test should still be valid.\n\nGiven that both sample sizes are over 30, I think the t-test is still a reasonable choice here.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems that option A is the correct choice. The student should use a two-sample t-test because the population standard deviations are unknown, and the conditions for the t-test are met.\n\nBut, just to double-check, let me think about it again. The main concerns with using a two-sample t-test would be:\n\n- Non-normal populations, but with large sample sizes, the t-test is robust.\n\n- Different sample sizes, but as I said, that's not a problem.\n\n- Unknown population standard deviations, which is fine for a t-test.\n\n- Independence and random sampling, which are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, I believe option A is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could influence the choice of test. For example, is there any reason to think that the variances are unequal, which might require a different version of the t-test?\n\nWell, the two-sample t-test can be performed assuming equal variances or not. If variances are unequal, some statistical software will adjust the degrees of freedom accordingly. But in this problem, there's no information about the variances, so it's probably safe to proceed with the standard two-sample t-test.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the student should consider a non-parametric test, like the Mann-Whitney U test, which doesn't assume normality. However, non-parametric tests can be less powerful than parametric ones, especially with large sample sizes where the t-test is robust to non-normality.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the problem is about choosing which statement is true, I still think option A is the correct one.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. I'm confident that option A is the true statement about this situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
