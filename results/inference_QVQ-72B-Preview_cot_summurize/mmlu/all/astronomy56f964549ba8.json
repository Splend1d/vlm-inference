                    "text": "So I have this question about the star Betelgeuse. It's supposed to be one of the brightest stars in the night sky with a remarkable red color, and I need to figure out in which constellation it's located. The options are Cassiopeia, Cygnus, Ursa Major, and Orion. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the constellations, but I think I know where Betelgeuse is.\n\nFirst off, I remember that Betelgeuse is a star in the Orion constellation. Orion is a really prominent constellation, especially in the winter sky in the Northern Hemisphere. It's known for its bright stars and distinctive shape, kind of like a hunter with a belt and sword. Betelgeuse, I believe, is one of the stars in Orion's shoulder or something like that.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I recall correctly, Betelgeuse is actually one of the two stars that make up Orion's shoulders. The other one is called Bellatrix, I think. So, Betelgeuse is in Orion's right shoulder, and Bellatrix is in the left shoulder. That seems right.\n\nNow, why would I confuse that with the other options? Let's see. Cassiopeia is another well-known constellation, often seen in the northern sky near the North Star. It's shaped like a W or an M, depending on how you look at it. But that's not where Betelgeuse is.\n\nCygnus is the Swan constellation, and it's up there in the summer sky. It's near the Milky Way, and it has the famous Cygnus Loop nebula. But again, that's not where Betelgeuse is located.\n\nUrsa Major is the Big Dipper, which is probably one of the most recognized constellations. It's part of the larger constellation of the Great Bear. The Big Dipper is great for finding the North Star, Polaris, by following the two stars at the front of the dipper. But Betelgeuse isn't in Ursa Major.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Betelgeuse should definitely be in Orion. Let me see if there's any chance I could be wrong here. Maybe I should think about the properties of Betelgeuse to make sure.\n\nBetelgeuse is a supergiant star, one of the largest known stars, and it's a red giant. It's located at a distance of about 642.5 light-years from Earth. Its brightness can vary, making it a variable star, but it's generally one of the brightest stars in the sky.\n\nIn Orion, Betelgeuse is part of the constellation's winter appearance, and it's known for its reddish hue, which is characteristic of cool giant stars. So, all of this points to Orion being the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that Betelgeuse could be associated with another constellation. Maybe historically or culturally, but no, I don't think so. The constellation boundaries are pretty well-defined these days, thanks to international astronomical organizations.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be Orion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Orion}} \\]"
