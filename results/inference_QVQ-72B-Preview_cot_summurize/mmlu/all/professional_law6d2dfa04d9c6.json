                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out who's likely to prevail in this lawsuit. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a woman who acquired some land via a deed. In the grantee section of that deed, it says: \"to [the woman], her heirs and assigns, provided, however, that said grantee may not transfer any interest in the land for 10 years from the date of this instrument.\" So, basically, the deed transfers the land to her, but there's a condition that she can't sell or transfer the land for 10 years from when the deed was signed.\n\nTwo years later, she contracts to sell the land to an investor. The price is based on a recent appraisal. But when the investor does a title search, they find that restriction in the deed and refuse to go through with the purchase. Now, the woman is suing the investor for specific performance, which means she wants the court to force the investor to go through with the contract and buy the land.\n\nThe question is, who is likely to win this case? There are four options:\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\n\nB. The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\n\nC. The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\n\nD. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n\nAlright, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: The investor wins because the woman can't sell the land during the 10-year period. But wait, the deed says she may not transfer any interest in the land for 10 years. So, does that mean she can't sell it at all during that time? That seems pretty straightforward. But maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption B says the investor wins because the woman's heirs didn't join in the contract. Hmm, that seems a bit off. The deed includes \"her heirs and assigns,\" which typically means that her heirs would have some interest in the property after she passes away. But she's still alive and trying to sell the land. So, why would her heirs need to be involved in this contract? Maybe this isn't the strongest argument.\n\nOption C: The woman wins because the contract didn't obligate her to provide marketable title. Marketable title usually refers to a clear title that doesn't have any significant defects or encumbrances that would prevent the buyer from using or selling the property in the future. If the contract doesn't specifically require her to provide marketable title, maybe she can still force the investor to buy the land despite the restriction in the deed. But generally, in real estate transactions, providing clear title is implied unless stated otherwise.\n\nOption D: The woman wins because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law. This one interests me. There's a principle in property law called the \"rule against perpetuities,\" which generally prevents interests in property from being tied up indefinitely. Also, there might be other legal doctrines that could render such a restriction unenforceable, especially if it's seen as an unreasonable restraint on alienation\u2014that is, preventing the owner from selling or transferring the property.\n\nLet me think about this more deeply. The deed says she can't transfer the land for 10 years. Is this a valid restriction? In some jurisdictions, such restraints on transfer might be enforceable for a certain period if they serve a legitimate purpose, like ensuring that the land isn't developed too quickly or something along those lines. However, in many places, especially in common law countries, such restraints are disfavored and may be struck down if they unduly restrict the owner's ability to dispose of their property.\n\nAlso, considering that the restriction is only for 10 years, it's not a perpetual restriction. So, it might be seen as a temporary restraint, which could be enforceable. But, on the other hand, if the restriction is too broad or doesn't serve a legitimate purpose, it could still be invalid.\n\nNow, back to the scenario. The woman has sued for specific performance. That means she's asking the court to order the investor to go through with the purchase as per their contract. For specific performance to be granted, the plaintiff (the woman) generally needs to show that she has performed or is ready to perform her part of the contract and that the defendant (the investor) has breached by refusing to close.\n\nHowever, if the woman doesn't have clear title to the property, that could be a significant defect in her performance. The investor would reasonably expect to receive clear title when purchasing the property. So, if the restriction in the deed is valid and enforceable, it would mean that the woman can't transfer good title to the investor, which could be a valid reason for the investor to refuse to close the transaction.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, maybe the restriction is not enforceable. If the court were to find that the restraint on transfer is void, then the investor's objection would fall away, and the woman could proceed with the sale.\n\nLet me consider the contract between the woman and the investor. The contract is silent as to the woman's title obligation. Does that mean that the woman doesn't have to provide clear title? Probably not. In real estate transactions, it's generally understood that the seller must provide clear title unless otherwise specified. So, even if the contract doesn't explicitly say so, the investor would still expect to receive clear title.\n\nTherefore, if the restriction in the deed is valid, the woman can't provide clear title, and the investor has a valid reason to refuse to close. In that case, the investor would likely prevail.\n\nOn the other hand, if the restriction is invalid, then the woman does have clear title, and the investor's refusal to close is unjustified. In that scenario, the woman would likely prevail in her suit for specific performance.\n\nSo, the crux of the matter is whether the restriction in the deed is enforceable.\n\nLet me look into the law regarding restraints on transfer.\n\nIn property law, restraints on alienation (transfer) are generally disfavored because they interfere with the free transferability of property. There are two main types: restraints on alienation in general and restraints on particular modes of alienation.\n\nA restraint on alienation in general is one that prohibits the owner from transferring the property altogether or imposes a condition that makes transfer difficult. Such restraints are typically void unless they serve some legitimate purpose and are limited in time or scope.\n\nIn this case, the restraint is a prohibition on transferring the land for 10 years. That's a general restraint on alienation for a fixed period.\n\nNow, a restraint for a fixed period might be more likely to be enforced if it's reasonably limited in time and serves a legitimate purpose.\n\nBut, in many jurisdictions, even a time-limited restraint on alienation is void unless it's necessary to carry out the grantor's intent or serves some other valid purpose.\n\nSo, without knowing the specific purpose of the restraint in this deed, it's hard to say for sure. If the court finds that the restraint serves no legitimate purpose or that it's overly burdensome, it might strike it down.\n\nAlternatively, the court might enforce the restraint if it's seen as reasonable in scope and duration.\n\nGiven that the restraint is only for 10 years, which isn't an indefinite period, it might be more likely to be enforced.\n\nHowever, the woman is still alive and trying to sell the land, so her heirs aren't directly involved here. Option B seems irrelevant.\n\nOption C suggests that the woman wins because the contract didn't require her to provide marketable title. But, as I thought earlier, in real estate transactions, providing clear title is generally implied. So, even if it's not explicitly stated in the contract, the investor would still expect clear title.\n\nOption D posits that the restraint is void as a matter of law, which, if true, would mean the woman can sell the land without any issues, and the investor's refusal to close is unjustified.\n\nSo, between options A and D, I need to decide which one is more likely to be correct.\n\nIf the restraint is void, then the investor's argument falls apart, and the woman should prevail.\n\nBut if the restraint is valid, then the investor has a valid reason not to close, and the woman's suit for specific performance should fail.\n\nNow, considering that the restraint is only for 10 years, which is a finite period, it might be seen as reasonable and enforceable.\n\nHowever, there might be public policy considerations that make such restraints unenforceable, especially if they hinder the free market in real estate.\n\nI need to consider the balance here.\n\nPerhaps, in some jurisdictions, a 10-year restraint on transfer might be enforceable, while in others, any restraint on transfer is void.\n\nWithout knowing the specific law of the jurisdiction in question, it's challenging to be certain.\n\nBut, for the purposes of this question, I need to make an educated guess based on general property law principles.\n\nGiven that, I think that the restraint in the deed is likely to be enforceable, at least to some extent.\n\nTherefore, the investor has a valid reason to refuse to close the transaction because the woman can't provide clear title.\n\nSo, in that case, the investor should prevail.\n\nBut wait, option A says: \"The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\"\n\nThat seems straightforward. If the deed says she can't transfer the land for 10 years, and she's trying to sell it after only two years, then yes, she's violating the deed's terms.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a argument that the restraint is unenforceable, as option D suggests.\n\nBut, as I thought, if the restraint is for a limited time, it might be enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the restraint is against public policy and therefore void.\n\nBut I don't have enough information to make that determination.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the restraint is void, making option D the correct answer.\n\nBut that seems like a big assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court will find that the restraint is enforceable, and therefore the investor is justified in refusing to close.\n\nIn that case, the investor should prevail.\n\nBut option A only says \"the investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\"\n\nThat seems to align with the idea that the restraint is enforceable.\n\nOption D says \"the woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\"\n\nThat's the opposite conclusion.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the restraint is only for 10 years, which isn't forever, I think option A is the more plausible answer.\n\nTherefore, I believe the investor is likely to prevail in this case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
