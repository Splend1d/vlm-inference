                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about what would produce a faster rate of economic growth for the United States. There are four options: A is higher tariffs on imported goods, B is more investment in capital infrastructure and less consumption of nondurable goods and services, C is eliminating mandatory school attendance laws, and D is setting annual limits on the number of foreigners immigrating into the country. I need to pick which one of these would lead to faster economic growth.\n\nFirst, let's think about option A: higher tariffs on imported goods. Tariffs are taxes on imports, and they can make foreign products more expensive, which might encourage people to buy American-made goods instead. That could help domestic industries grow, right? But on the other hand, higher tariffs could lead to trade wars, where other countries retaliate by putting higher tariffs on our exports. That could hurt American businesses that sell products overseas. So, it's not entirely clear if this would lead to faster economic growth overall.\n\nOption B is more investment in capital infrastructure and less consumption of nondurable goods and services. Capital infrastructure includes things like roads, bridges, and maybe factories or equipment that help businesses operate more efficiently. Investing in these should make the economy more productive in the long run, right? Nondurable goods are things like food, clothing, and other items that don't last very long. Consuming less of these might mean people have more savings, which could be invested in more productive areas. So, this option seems like it could lead to faster economic growth by increasing productivity and potentially increasing savings and investment.\n\nOption C is eliminating mandatory school attendance laws. Mandatory school attendance laws require children to attend school up to a certain age, usually until they graduate or reach their late teens. If these laws are eliminated, kids might leave school earlier, perhaps to enter the workforce sooner. But would that lead to faster economic growth? Maybe in the short term, if more young people are working and contributing to the economy. However, in the long term, if these individuals have less education, they might not be as productive or earn as much. So, this could potentially slow down economic growth over time.\n\nOption D is setting annual limits on the number of foreigners immigrating into the United States. Immigration can affect the economy in several ways. Immigrants can add to the labor force, which can increase production and potentially grow the economy. They can also bring new skills and ideas, which can foster innovation and entrepreneurship. Limiting immigration could slow down population growth and potentially reduce the size of the labor force, which might lead to slower economic growth, especially if there's a shortage of workers in certain sectors.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option B seems the most straightforward way to promote faster economic growth. Investing in capital infrastructure can make the economy more efficient and productive, while reducing consumption of nondurable goods might increase savings and investment, which can also fuel growth. The other options either have potential downsides or aren't as directly linked to increasing economic growth rates.\n\nI think the answer is B. More investment in capital infrastructure and less consumption of nondurable goods and services.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
