                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I voted once in the presidential election.\" So, someone cast a single vote in the presidential election. Now, voting is a fundamental right and responsibility in a democracy, right? It's encouraged for citizens to participate in elections to choose their leaders. Voting once in a presidential election seems like a perfectly normal and morally acceptable action. In fact, it's what most people do. I don't see anything morally wrong with that.\n\nOkay, now Scenario 2: \"I failed the student because he was skipping class.\" This one seems a bit trickier. So, a teacher is failing a student due to skipping class. Now, generally, in educational settings, attendance is important. Skipping class can lead to a lack of understanding of the material being taught, which could affect the student's performance on assignments and exams. Teachers often have policies regarding attendance and how it affects grades.\n\nBut is failing a student solely because they were skipping class morally wrong? Well, it depends on a few things. If the student was otherwise performing well in the class\u2014getting good grades on tests, assignments, and participating when they are present\u2014but was skipping class frequently, then failing them might seem harsh, especially if the attendance policy wasn't clearly communicated or if there weren't valid reasons for the absences.\n\nOn the other hand, if the student was skipping class and also not performing well in the class, then failing them might be seen as a consequence of their actions. However, even in that case, some might argue that failing a student should be based primarily on academic performance rather than attendance.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think most people would consider failing a student solely for skipping class as morally wrong, especially if the student was otherwise performing adequately academically. It seems punitive and might not be the most effective way to address the issue of attendance.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Voting once in the presidential election \u2013 this is a standard and morally acceptable action.\n\n- Scenario 2: Failing a student because they were skipping class \u2013 this seems morally wrong, as it appears to be a punitive action based on attendance rather than academic performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. In Scenario 1, voting is a civic duty, and doing it once in a presidential election is completely normal and not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, failing a student for skipping class seems unethical, as education should aim to help students learn, not to punish them for attendance issues through grading.\n\nYeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. So, the answer is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
