                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this problem about relativistic momentum. The problem says that the total energy of a particle with mass m is equal to twice its rest energy, and I need to find the magnitude of the particle's relativistic momentum. The options are mc/2, mc/(2^(1/2)), mc, and (3^(1/2))mc.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic relativistic relationships. I know that the total energy of a particle is given by the equation E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), and mc\u00b2 is the rest energy.\n\nAlso, the relativistic momentum is given by p = \u03b3mv, where m is the mass, v is the velocity, and \u03b3 is the same Lorentz factor.\n\nThe problem states that the total energy is equal to twice the rest energy. So, E = 2 * rest energy. The rest energy is mc\u00b2, so E = 2mc\u00b2.\n\nSo, E = \u03b3mc\u00b2 = 2mc\u00b2.\n\nFrom this equation, I can solve for \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = E / mc\u00b2 = 2mc\u00b2 / mc\u00b2 = 2.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 2.\n\nNow, I need to find the relativistic momentum, p = \u03b3mv.\n\nI need to express this in terms of mc.\n\nBut first, I need to find v in terms of c.\n\nSince \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 2,\n\nI can set up the equation:\n\n1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 2.\n\nSo, \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/2.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nThen, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, v\u00b2 = (3/4)c\u00b2.\n\nSo, v = (\u221a3/2)c.\n\nNow, the relativistic momentum is p = \u03b3mv.\n\nI have \u03b3 = 2, and v = (\u221a3/2)c.\n\nSo, p = 2 * m * (\u221a3/2)c = 2 * m * (\u221a3/2) * c.\n\nSimplifying, the 2 and the 2 in the denominator cancel out:\n\np = m * \u221a3 * c.\n\nSo, p = (\u221a3)mc.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D is (3^(1/2))mc, which is the same as (\u221a3)mc.\n\nWait, 3^(1/2) is indeed \u221a3.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nI recall that for relativistic particles, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is given by:\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nGiven that E = 2mc\u00b2, and mc\u00b2 is the rest energy,\n\nSo, (2mc\u00b2)\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nLet's plug in:\n\n4m\u2074c\u2074 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074.\n\nI can rearrange this:\n\np\u00b2c\u00b2 = 4m\u2074c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u2074 = (4m\u2074 - m\u00b2)c\u2074.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the units.\n\nActually, the equation should be E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nGiven E = 2mc\u00b2,\n\nSo, (2mc\u00b2)\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nExpanding:\n\n4m\u2074c\u2074 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074.\n\nSubtract m\u00b2c\u2074 from both sides:\n\n4m\u2074c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u2074 = p\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nSo, p\u00b2c\u00b2 = (4m\u2074c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u2074) = c\u2074(4m\u2074 - m\u00b2).\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor it differently.\n\np\u00b2c\u00b2 = 4m\u2074c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u2074 = c\u2074(4m\u2074 - m\u00b2).\n\nBut that doesn't help directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can divide both sides by c\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 = (4m\u2074c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u2074)/c\u00b2 = 4m\u2074c\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nStill not helpful.\n\nMaybe I should solve for p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 = 4m\u2074c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u2074 = c\u2074(4m\u2074 - m\u00b2).\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe I need to express everything in terms of m and c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between \u03b3 and p.\n\nI recall that \u03b3 = E / mc\u00b2 = 2, as previously found.\n\nAnd p = \u03b3mv.\n\nI already found v = (\u221a3/2)c, so p = \u03b3mv = 2 * m * (\u221a3/2)c = \u221a3 mc.\n\nSo, this confirms option D.\n\nBut maybe there's a more straightforward way to get this result.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nI know that for relativistic particles, the momentum is related to the energy by:\n\nE = \u221a( (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2 ).\n\nBut in this case, I have E = 2mc\u00b2.\n\nSo, 2mc\u00b2 = \u221a( (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2 ).\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n4m\u00b2c\u2074 = (pc)\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074.\n\nSubtract m\u00b2c\u2074 from both sides:\n\n4m\u00b2c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u2074 = (pc)\u00b2.\n\nSo, 3m\u00b2c\u2074 = (pc)\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, pc = \u221a(3m\u00b2c\u2074) = m c \u221a3.\n\nSo, p = \u221a3 mc.\n\nAgain, this matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (3^(1/2))mc.\n\nI think that's it. I might have overcomplicated it a bit, but in the end, I arrived at the same conclusion through different methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
