                    "text": "Let's see here. This question is about a passage from Marcus Garvey in 1920, where he talks about how different countries are saying things like \"Canada for the Canadians\" and \"America for the Americans,\" and so on. Then he asks if it's unreasonable for Black people to say \"Africa for the Africans.\" So, I need to figure out which ongoing debate in American history this relates to.\n\nOption A is about interventionism versus isolationism in foreign policy. Hmm, that seems more related to how the United States interacts with other countries, like going to war or staying out of other countries' affairs. This passage seems more focused on racial and national identity, so I don't think that's the right choice.\n\nOption B is about separatism versus integration for African Americans in American society. Separatism would mean Black people should have their own communities, maybe even their own country, separate from White people. Integration would mean everyone should live together, with equal rights and opportunities, in the same society. Garvey's statement about \"Africa for the Africans\" sounds like he's advocating for Black people to have their own land or country, which aligns more with separatism. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C is about exclusion versus inclusion in immigration policy. This would involve debates over who gets to come into the United States, whether to restrict immigration or allow more people to enter. While Garvey's message might touch on ideas of nationality and belonging, it's more directly about the place of Black people in the world, particularly in Africa, rather than specifically about immigration policies in the U.S.\n\nOption D is about laissez-faire policies versus government intervention in economic affairs. Laissez-faire means minimal government involvement in the economy, while interventionism involves more regulation and involvement by the government. This seems unrelated to Garvey's statement about \"Africa for the Africans.\"\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is B. The debate between separatism and integration when it came to the place of African Americans in American society. Garvey's words suggest a separatist view, advocating for Black people to have their own homeland in Africa, separate from other societies.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. Was Marcus Garvey known for his views on separatism? I recall that he was a proponent of Back-to-Africa movements, which encouraged Black people to return to Africa and establish their own nations. That sounds a lot like separatism, doesn't it? Compared to, say, someone like W.E.B. Du Bois, who advocated for full integration and civil rights within American society.\n\nYes, that reinforces my thinking. So, in the context of American history, Garvey's position aligns with the separatist side of the debate, whereas those who favored integration would disagree, preferring a more unified, multi-racial society with equal rights for all.\n\nI don't think the other options capture the essence of Garvey's statement as well. While immigration and foreign policy were certainly debates in American history during that time, Garvey's message was more intrinsically tied to the status and future of African Americans and Black people worldwide.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. The debate between separatism and integration when it came to the place of African Americans in American society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
