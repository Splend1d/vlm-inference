                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics question. So, the problem is that Tiger Woods buys a golf ball in England for $1, and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) in England is 0.75. We need to find out the total increase in England's real GDP because of this purchase. The options are $1, $1.25, $1.75, and $4.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what MPC is. MPC is the proportion of additional income that a household spends on consumption. So, if MPC is 0.75, it means that for every additional dollar of income, 75 cents are spent on consumption, and the remaining 25 cents are saved.\n\nNow, Tiger Woods buys a golf ball for $1. This purchase is an injection into the English economy, right? Because he's spending money in England, which increases the demand for English goods and services.\n\nI think this scenario involves the multiplier effect in macroeconomics. The multiplier effect describes how an initial increase in spending leads to a larger increase in national income and GDP.\n\nThe formula for the multiplier is 1 / (1 - MPC). Given that MPC is 0.75, the multiplier would be 1 / (1 - 0.75) = 1 / 0.25 = 4. So, the multiplier is 4.\n\nThat means the initial $1 spending by Tiger Woods will lead to a total increase in GDP of $1 multiplied by the multiplier, which is $4. So, according to this calculation, the answer should be $4.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not missing something. The question says \"the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase.\"\n\nSo, the initial purchase is $1, and then there are subsequent rounds of spending. The $1 goes to someone, say the golf ball seller, who then spends 75% of that, which is $0.75, because MPC is 0.75. Then, the person who receives the $0.75 spends 75% of that, and so on.\n\nLet me see if I can calculate this step by step.\n\nInitial purchase: $1\n\nFirst round: $1\n\nSecond round: $1 * 0.75 = $0.75\n\nThird round: $0.75 * 0.75 = $0.5625\n\nFourth round: $0.5625 * 0.75 = $0.421875\n\nAnd so on, until it converges.\n\nThis is a geometric series where each term is 0.75 of the previous one. The sum of an infinite geometric series with a ratio r (where |r| < 1) is a / (1 - r), where a is the first term.\n\nIn this case, a = $1, and r = 0.75.\n\nSo, total increase in GDP = $1 / (1 - 0.75) = $1 / 0.25 = $4.\n\nThat matches the earlier answer.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nIs there any leakage from this process? For example, taxes or imports that would reduce the multiplier effect? The problem doesn't specify any taxes or imports, so I assume that the only leakage is saving, which is captured by the MPC of 0.75.\n\nWait, actually, MPC is the marginal propensity to consume, so MPS (marginal propensity to save) is 1 - MPC, which is 0.25. So, each time, 25% is saved and not spent, leading to the multiplier of 4.\n\nTherefore, the total increase in GDP should indeed be $4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor at play.\n\nSuppose that the purchase is by Tiger Woods, who is likely a foreigner relative to England, but the question specifies that he buys a golf ball in England, so the spending is on domestic goods and services.\n\nAlso, the MPC is given for England, so it's the domestic MPC that applies.\n\nUnless there's something about the marginal propensity to import, but again, the problem doesn't mention any imports.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $4.\n\nWait, but one of the options is $1.25. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nIf I mistakenly used the formula for the simple spending multiplier, which is 1 / MPS, and MPS is 0.25, then 1 / 0.25 = 4, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes textbooks present the multiplier as 1 / (1 - MPC), which is the same in this case since MPC is 0.75.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the multiplier is 1 / MPS, which is again 1 / 0.25 = 4.\n\nSo, all approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the marginal propensity to tax or import, but again, the problem doesn't mention any of that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be $4.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not missing something, perhaps I should look at the options again.\n\nOption A is $1, which would be the initial purchase, but that doesn't account for the multiplier effect.\n\nOption B is $1.25, which might be a miscalculation.\n\nOption C is $1.75, which is less than the correct multiplier of 4 times $1.\n\nOption D is $4, which matches my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
