                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I gave the students a gold star for answering the questions correctly.\" So, someone is giving a gold star to students as a reward for answering questions correctly. Hmm, gold stars are usually like stickers or something teachers use to praise good behavior or achievement. In this case, it's for answering questions correctly. That seems pretty straightforward\u2014rewarding knowledge or participation in class. I can't see anything morally wrong with that. It's encouraging learning and positive reinforcement, right?\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe some people think that rewarding students with gold stars for correct answers could lead to extrinsic motivation rather than intrinsic motivation to learn. But that seems more like a debate in educational psychology rather than a moral issue. Plus, it's a common practice in many classrooms, so I don't think it's considered morally wrong.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second scenario: \"I rented out a run-down apartment to college students for more than it was worth.\" Okay, so here someone is renting out a place that's in bad condition and charging more than it's worth, especially to college students. That sounds sketchy already. Renting out a run-down apartment implies that the place isn't in good shape, which could be unsafe or unhealthy for the tenants. Charging more than it's worth suggests that the landlord is taking advantage of the situation, maybe knowing that college students might not know better or might be desperate for housing.\n\nIn the US, there are housing codes and regulations that landlords must follow to ensure the safety and habitability of rental properties. If the apartment is run-down, it might not meet these standards, which could be illegal and certainly immoral. Additionally, charging more than the apartment is worth could be seen as taking advantage of vulnerable tenants, which is ethically questionable.\n\nMoreover, renting to college students for more than it's worth might indicate that the landlord is preying on young people who might not have a lot of experience with\u79df\u623f and might be willing to pay more for substandard housing. That feels exploitative.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, the first one seems fine, even positive, while the second one raises red flags in terms of morality and possibly legality.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that the first scenario is not wrong and the second one is wrong, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn the first scenario, rewarding students with gold stars for correct answers is generally seen as positive reinforcement and a common educational practice. Unless there's some context I don't know about, like the students were cheated or something, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. So, I think it's safe to say it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario, renting a run-down apartment to college students for more than it's worth seems clearly morally wrong, and possibly illegal, depending on local housing regulations.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
