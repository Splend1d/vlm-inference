                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about Louis and his chemical company. It seems like they've been doing some pretty bad stuff with their waste disposal, contaminating the water supply and all that. Louis is saying he didn't know about these irresponsible practices and is blaming the general manager, even firing him. Now, I need to figure out what kind of image restoration strategy he's using from the options given: denial, evasion of responsibility, reducing the offensiveness, or corrective action.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these strategies means in the context of public relations or image management.\n\nStarting with denial: this is when someone claims that they didn't do something wrong or weren't involved in the misconduct. It's like saying, \"Hey, it's not my fault because I didn't know or didn't do it.\" So, in this case, Louis is saying he had no knowledge of the irresponsible practices. That sounds a bit like denial, but let's see what else is going on.\n\nNext, evasion of responsibility: this might involve acknowledging that something wrong happened but trying to shift the blame onto someone else or external factors. Here, Louis is blaming the general manager and firing him. That sounds like he's trying to avoid personal responsibility by pointing the finger at someone else.\n\nReducing the offensiveness: this could be about minimizing the severity of the wrongdoing or presenting it in a way that seems less harmful. For example, saying that the contamination wasn't that bad or that it was an isolated incident. In this scenario, Louis isn't doing that directly; he's denying knowledge and blaming someone else.\n\nCorrective action: this would involve taking steps to fix the problem and prevent it from happening again. For instance, implementing new waste disposal procedures or compensating those affected. There's no mention of Louis doing any of that in the scenario.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Louis is both denying personal knowledge and evading responsibility by blaming the general manager. But the question is asking for the primary image restoration strategy he's using.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Denial involves rejecting the accusation or claim that he was involved in the wrongdoing. Evasion of responsibility involves acknowledging that something wrong happened but trying to shift the blame or avoid personal accountability.\n\nIn this case, Louis is denying that he knew about the irresponsible practices, which is a form of denial. At the same time, by blaming the general manager and firing him, he's evading responsibility for the company's actions, suggesting that it was the general manager's fault and not his own.\n\nBut is one of these strategies more prominent than the other? Is he primarily denying his knowledge or evading responsibility?\n\nWell, by denying knowledge, he's already distancing himself from the wrongdoing. Blaming the general manager reinforces this distancing, as he's suggesting that the general manager was acting independently or against company policies, which isn't necessarily true.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's a combination of both denial and evasion. But the question is likely looking for the main strategy.\n\nLet me consider the definitions again:\n\n- Denial: rejecting the accusation or claim of wrongdoing.\n\n- Evasion of responsibility: avoiding accountability for the wrongdoing.\n\nIn Louis's case, he's denying that he knew about the irresponsible practices, which is a direct rejection of personal involvement. Then, by blaming the general manager and firing him, he's further distancing himself from the issue.\n\nHowever, evasion of responsibility often involves acknowledging that something wrong happened but trying to shift the blame or minimize personal involvement. Louis is doing that by blaming the general manager.\n\nBut is his primary strategy denial (saying he didn't know) or evasion (shifting blame to the general manager)?\n\nI think the key here is that he's denying personal knowledge, which is a form of denial, and simultaneously shifting blame to the general manager, which is evasion.\n\nBut perhaps the denial is the primary strategy because it directly addresses his personal involvement, and the evasion is a consequence of that denial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the evasion is the primary strategy, and the denial is just a part of it.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at it differently.\n\nConsider that denial is about rejecting the accusation, while evasion is about avoiding responsibility. In this scenario, Louis is both denying personal knowledge and trying to avoid personal responsibility by blaming someone else.\n\nIf I had to choose one, I might lean towards evasion of responsibility because he's not only denying his own involvement but also actively shifting the blame to another person.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps reducing the offensiveness could be considered if Louis was trying to minimize the severity of the contamination or the company's actions. But in the scenario provided, he's not doing that. He's straight up denying knowledge and blaming the general manager.\n\nCorrective action isn't being taken, as far as we know, so that's out of the question.\n\nSo, between denial and evasion of responsibility, which one is Louis primarily using?\n\nMaybe it's a mix, but if I have to pick one, I'd say evasion of responsibility.\n\nHere's why: by denying knowledge, he's trying to evade personal responsibility. But more directly, by blaming the general manager and firing him, he's explicitly trying to avoid taking responsibility for the company's actions.\n\nIn corporate settings, when something goes wrong, it's common for higher-ups to blame lower-level managers to protect themselves, even if they themselves might have been negligent in oversight.\n\nSo, in that context, evasion of responsibility seems more fitting because it captures the act of avoiding accountability by shifting blame.\n\nDenial is certainly part of it, but it's more of a component of the evasion strategy.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. evasion of responsibility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
