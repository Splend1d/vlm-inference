                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Thorndike's Law of Effect, and I've got these options to choose from. Let me see if I can figure out which one best paraphrases it.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what Thorndike's Law of Effect is all about. I recall that Edward L. Thorndike was a behavioral psychologist who did a lot of work with cats in puzzle boxes. Basically, he put cats in these boxes and they had to figure out how to escape to get to their food. Over time, they learned to perform certain actions that led to their release.\n\nFrom these experiments, Thorndike developed the Law of Effect, which is a fundamental concept in behaviorism. The way I understand it, the law states that behaviors that lead to positive outcomes are more likely to be repeated, while behaviors that lead to negative outcomes are less likely to be repeated. So, it's all about the consequences of actions affecting future behavior.\n\nNow, looking at option A: \"All behavior is caused: everything that is done has an effect on behavior.\" Hmm, this seems a bit too broad. It says that all behavior is caused by something and that everything done has an effect on behavior. While it's true that behavior is influenced by various factors, this option doesn't specifically mention the role of consequences in shaping behavior, which is the crux of Thorndike's Law. So, maybe not the best paraphrase.\n\nOption B: \"Elimination of the unconditioned stimulus or the reward results in a decreased frequency of behavior.\" This sounds like it's touching on something related to classical conditioning or perhaps extinction in operant conditioning. But Thorndike's Law is more about the strengthening of connections between stimuli and responses based on the effects of those responses. This option seems to be more about removing a stimulus or reward and seeing a decrease in behavior, which isn't directly aligning with the Law of Effect as I understand it.\n\nOption C: \"A positive correlation exists between responding and aversive stimulation.\" This one is tricky. It suggests that there's a relationship where aversive stimulation increases responding. But in Thorndike's Law, the focus is on positive outcomes reinforcing behavior, not aversive ones. While aversive stimuli can certainly affect behavior, this seems more related to punishment or negative reinforcement, which aren't the primary focus of the Law of Effect. So, probably not the best paraphrase.\n\nOption D: \"A reward tends to increase the probability of recurrence of the response that it follows.\" This sounds very much like Thorndike's idea. It directly states that when a response is followed by a reward, the likelihood of that response happening again increases. This is essentially the principle behind the Law of Effect. The law originally stated that any behavior followed by a satisfying effect is more likely to be repeated, and this option captures that idea perfectly.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think option D is the best paraphrase of Thorndike's Law of Effect. It clearly expresses the core concept that rewards following a behavior increase the chance of that behavior being repeated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
