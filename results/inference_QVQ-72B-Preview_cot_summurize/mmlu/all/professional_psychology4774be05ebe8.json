From what I've read, both are methods to change the nature of a job, but they do it in different ways. Job enlargement seems to involve giving employees more tasks to do, kind of broadening their role. Job enrichment, on the other hand, is about making the job more meaningful and giving employees more responsibility and control over their work.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the major difference between these two, specifically what job enrichment does that job enlargement doesn't. The options are:\n\nA. provides management with tighter control of work activities\n\nB. appeals mostly to workers in mass-production-type jobs\n\nC. gives workers quasi-managerial tasks to perform\n\nD. lengthens the work cycle\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that job enrichment provides management with tighter control of work activities. Hmm, I thought job enrichment was about giving employees more autonomy and control over their work. So, if anything, it should be the opposite\u2014giving employees looser control, not tighter. Maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B says that job enrichment appeals mostly to workers in mass-production-type jobs. Well, mass-production jobs are typically very repetitive and specialized, with each worker doing the same task over and over. Job enlargement might be more relevant in such settings because it can give workers a variety of tasks to do, making their job less monotonous. But job enrichment is more about adding depth and responsibility to the job, which might not be as directly applicable in mass-production settings. So, maybe this is a difference, but I'm not sure if it's the major difference.\n\nOption C says that job enrichment gives workers quasi-managerial tasks to perform. Quasi-managerial tasks would be tasks that are similar to what managers do, like planning, decision-making, or overseeing others' work. In job enrichment, employees are often given more decision-making authority and responsibility, which could include such tasks. Job enlargement, on the other hand, is more about increasing the number of tasks or the variety of tasks, but not necessarily giving them more responsibility or decision-making power. This seems like a significant difference.\n\nOption D says that job enrichment lengthens the work cycle. The work cycle refers to the sequence of tasks that make up a job. Job enlargement might involve doing more tasks, which could potentially lengthen the cycle, but job enrichment could also involve more complex tasks that take longer to complete. However, lengthening the work cycle isn't necessarily the primary goal of job enrichment. It's more about making the job more satisfying and meaningful for the employee.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to be the most accurate description of a major difference between job enrichment and job enlargement. Job enrichment gives workers quasi-managerial tasks to perform, which involves giving them more responsibility and decision-making power, whereas job enlargement is more about increasing the scope or variety of tasks without necessarily adding managerial responsibilities.\n\nI think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
