                    "text": "So I have this question about price discrimination. It says, \"Which of these situations is not an example of price discrimination?\" and then gives four options: A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which one doesn't show price discrimination.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what price discrimination is. From what I remember, price discrimination is when a seller charges different prices to different buyers for the same product or service, usually based on things like when they buy, how much they buy, or some characteristics about them.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Brent works nights, so he chooses to buy bread at 7 a.m. rather than at 7 p.m.\n\nHmm, this seems like Brent is choosing a different time to buy bread because of his work schedule. But is this price discrimination? Wait, the question is asking which situation is not an example of price discrimination.\n\nWait, maybe the store charges different prices at different times. Like, perhaps bread is cheaper in the morning than in the evening. If that's the case, then Brent is choosing to buy at a different time to get a better price, which would be an example of price discrimination.\n\nBut the way it's phrased, it just says he chooses to buy at 7 a.m. rather than 7 p.m., but doesn't specify that the prices are different. Maybe the price is the same regardless of when he buys it. If that's the case, then it's not price discrimination because the price isn't changing based on the time of purchase.\n\nWait, but in reality, some stores might have different prices at different times, like happy hours or early bird specials. But the option doesn't specify that.\n\nOption B: Bob and Nancy each receive a \"$1 off\" coupon in the mail, but Bob redeems it while Nancy does not.\n\nOkay, so both Bob and Nancy get the same coupon, but only Bob uses it. Does this constitute price discrimination?\n\nWell, price discrimination usually involves the seller charging different prices to different buyers intentionally. In this case, both Bob and Nancy were offered the same discount, but Nancy chose not to use it. So, the seller offered the same deal to both, but due to their individual choices, they ended up paying different prices.\n\nIs this price discrimination? It seems a bit gray. The seller offered the same terms to both, but Nancy didn't take advantage of the discount. Maybe it's more about targeted discounts based on certain criteria.\n\nOption C: Katie buys 12 Cokes for $3, and Josh buys one Coke at a time for $1.\n\nHere, Katie is buying in bulk and getting a better price per Coke ($3 for 12 Cokes is 25 cents each, while Josh pays $1 for one Coke). This seems like a quantity discount, which is a common form of price discrimination. The seller is offering a lower price per unit when you buy more.\n\nSo, this is definitely an example of price discrimination.\n\nOption D: Velma likes to go to the movies at the lower afternoon matinee price, and Rosemary would rather pay more for the evening show.\n\nThis seems similar to option A. Different showtimes have different prices, with matinees often being cheaper. So, Velma chooses the cheaper option, while Rosemary prefers the more expensive one.\n\nThis appears to be price discrimination based on the time of day or perhaps the demand for different showtimes.\n\nNow, comparing all these options, option A seems ambiguous because it doesn't specify that there are different prices at different times. The other options clearly show differences in price based on quantity purchased or the time of day.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option A is not an example of price discrimination because the price remains the same regardless of when Brent buys the bread.\n\nBut wait, maybe the store does have different prices at different times, like discounted morning deals or something. But since it's not specified, I should assume that the price is the same.\n\nTherefore, option A is not an example of price discrimination.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn option A, Brent is choosing to buy at 7 a.m. because he works nights, but there's no mention of the price being different at that time. So, unless specified otherwise, I think it's safe to assume that the price is the same.\n\nIn option B, both Bob and Nancy get the same coupon, but only Bob uses it. This seems more like a difference in behavior rather than the seller intentionally charging different prices.\n\nWait, but if the coupon is offered to both, and only one uses it, the price difference is due to their individual choices, not because the seller is treating them differently based on some characteristic.\n\nOption C is clearly price discrimination based on quantity purchased.\n\nOption D is price discrimination based on the time of day or showtime.\n\nTherefore, between options A and B, option A seems less likely to be an example of price discrimination because it doesn't specify any difference in price, whereas option B involves a coupon that only one person uses, which could be seen as a form of price discrimination.\n\nBut the question is asking for the situation that is not an example of price discrimination.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I would say option A is not an example of price discrimination because there's no indication that the price changes based on the time of purchase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
