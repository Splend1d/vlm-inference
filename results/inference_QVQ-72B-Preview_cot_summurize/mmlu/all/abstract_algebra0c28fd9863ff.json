                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about groups of order 42 and their normal subgroups. Specifically, there are two statements:\n\nStatement 1: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nAnd I need to determine whether each statement is true or false.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some group theory facts. The order of a group is the number of its elements, and a normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by members of the group.\n\nThe order here is 42. Let's factorize 42 to understand its structure better. 42 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7. So, it's the product of three distinct prime numbers.\n\nI remember there's something called the Sylow theorems that deal with subgroups of prime power orders. Maybe I can apply those here.\n\nSo, the Sylow p-subgroups for the prime factors of 42 are:\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroups, which have order 2.\n\n- Sylow 3-subgroups, which have order 3.\n\n- Sylow 7-subgroups, which have order 7.\n\nLet me denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups by n_p.\n\nAccording to Sylow's first theorem, for each prime power dividing the group order, there exists at least one Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nSylow's second theorem says that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n\nSylow's third theorem states that n_p divides the index of the subgroup, which is (group order)/(p^k), and n_p \u2261 1 mod p.\n\nIn our case:\n\n- For p = 2, n_2 divides 21 (since 42/2 = 21), and n_2 \u2261 1 mod 2. So n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\n- For p = 3, n_3 divides 14 (42/3 = 14), and n_3 \u2261 1 mod 3. So n_3 can be 1 or 7.\n\n- For p = 7, n_7 divides 6 (42/7 = 6), and n_7 \u2261 1 mod 7. So n_7 can be 1 or 7.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these Sylow subgroups are normal. A Sylow p-subgroup is normal if and only if n_p = 1.\n\nSo, for statement 1: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nFrom above, n_7 can be 1 or 7. If n_7 = 1, then the Sylow 7-subgroup is unique and hence normal. If n_7 = 7, then there are 7 Sylow 7-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nBut is there a guarantee that n_7 = 1 for every group of order 42?\n\nI don't think so. Because n_7 depends on the specific group structure. There might be groups of order 42 where n_7 = 7.\n\nFor example, in the case of the symmetric group S_3, which has order 6, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 3, which is not 1, so they are not normal.\n\nSimilarly, for groups of order 42, it's possible to have n_7 = 7.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false because not every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nNow, statement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nWait a minute, 42 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, so the prime factors are 2, 3, and 7. There is no prime power 8 in the factorization of 42.\n\n8 is 2^3, but 42 is only divisible by 2 once, since 42 = 2 \u00d7 21.\n\nTherefore, there is no subgroup of order 8 in a group of order 42, because 8 does not divide 42.\n\nHence, statement 2 is also false, because a group of order 42 cannot have a subgroup of order 8, normal or otherwise.\n\nSo, both statements are false.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFor statement 1, as I said, n_7 can be 1 or 7, so it's not guaranteed that the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal.\n\nFor statement 2, 8 does not divide 42, so there can't be a subgroup of order 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
