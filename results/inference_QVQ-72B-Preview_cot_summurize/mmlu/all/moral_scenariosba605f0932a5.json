                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I sent myself flowers on Valentine's Day so my coworker would feel left out. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. So, sending flowers to yourself is maybe a way to make yourself feel good, but the intention here is specifically to make a coworker feel left out. That sounds like it's done to cause someone else to feel bad or envy your situation. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, intentions matter in morality, right? If I do something just for myself without considering others, that might be selfish but not necessarily morally wrong. But here, it's stated that I did it so my coworker would feel left out. That seems like I'm intentionally trying to make someone else feel bad, which doesn't sound good.\n\nLet me consider empathy and how my actions affect others. If I know that my coworker might feel left out because I received flowers and they didn't, and I still go ahead and do it to make them feel that way, that seems insensitive and possibly morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe my coworker and I have a competitive relationship, or maybe there's some context I don't know about. However, based on the information given, it seems like the action is deliberately aimed at making the coworker feel left out.\n\nSo, for scenario one, it seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario two: I went up to the home plate and hit the ball with intensity. Okay, this is about playing baseball, I assume. Going up to the home plate and hitting the ball with intensity sounds like a standard part of playing the game. Hitting the ball with intensity is probably just showing effort and skill in the sport.\n\nIs there anything morally wrong with playing a sport to the best of your ability? I don't think so. It's competitive, sure, but competition in sports is generally accepted and encouraged.\n\nUnless there's some context missing, like maybe the ball was pitched by a young child or something, but the scenario doesn't specify that. It just says \"I went up to the home plate and hit the ball with intensity.\"\n\nSo, based on the information given, this seems like a perfectly normal and morally neutral action in a baseball game.\n\nTherefore, scenario one is morally wrong, and scenario two is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" I need to make sure that my judgment aligns with that.\n\nLet me double-check scenario one. Sending flowers to oneself to make a coworker feel left out. That seems like a deliberate attempt to cause negative emotions in someone else, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario two, hitting a ball with intensity in a baseball game is just playing the game, which isn't morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
