                    "text": "So I have this polynomial: \\(8x^{3} + 6x^{2} - 9x + 24\\), and I need to check if it satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over the rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). The options are to use \\(p=2\\), \\(p=3\\), \\(p=5\\), or to conclude that it doesn't satisfy the criterion for any of these primes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Eisenstein criterion is. It's a test to determine if a polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers. The criterion states that if you have a polynomial of the form:\n\n\\[\na_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{1}x + a_{0}\n\\]\n\nand there exists a prime number \\(p\\) such that:\n\n1. \\(p\\) divides each of the coefficients \\(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \\dots, a_{0}\\),\n\n2. \\(p\\) does not divide the leading coefficient \\(a_{n}\\),\n\n3. \\(p^{2}\\) does not divide the constant term \\(a_{0}\\),\n\nthen the polynomial is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nSo, for the given polynomial \\(8x^{3} + 6x^{2} - 9x + 24\\), I need to check each of the provided primes \\(p=2\\), \\(p=3\\), and \\(p=5\\) to see if they satisfy the three conditions of the Eisenstein criterion.\n\nLet's start with \\(p=2\\).\n\n1. Check if \\(p=2\\) divides each of the coefficients \\(a_{2}=6\\), \\(a_{1}=-9\\), and \\(a_{0}=24\\).\n\n- \\(2\\) divides \\(6\\) (\\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\)).\n\n- \\(2\\) divides \\(-9\\)? Well, \\(-9\\) divided by \\(2\\) is \\(-4.5\\), which is not an integer. So, \\(2\\) does not divide \\(-9\\).\n\n- \\(2\\) divides \\(24\\) (\\(24 \\div 2 = 12\\)).\n\nSince \\(2\\) does not divide \\(-9\\), the first condition is not satisfied for \\(p=2\\). Therefore, the Eisenstein criterion does not apply with \\(p=2\\).\n\nNext, let's try \\(p=3\\).\n\n1. Check if \\(p=3\\) divides each of the coefficients \\(a_{2}=6\\), \\(a_{1}=-9\\), and \\(a_{0}=24\\).\n\n- \\(3\\) divides \\(6\\) (\\(6 \\div 3 = 2\\)).\n\n- \\(3\\) divides \\(-9\\) (\\(-9 \\div 3 = -3\\)).\n\n- \\(3\\) divides \\(24\\) (\\(24 \\div 3 = 8\\)).\n\nSo, the first condition is satisfied.\n\n2. Check if \\(p=3\\) does not divide the leading coefficient \\(a_{3}=8\\).\n\n- \\(3\\) does not divide \\(8\\). So, this condition is satisfied.\n\n3. Check if \\(p^{2}=9\\) does not divide the constant term \\(a_{0}=24\\).\n\n- \\(9\\) does not divide \\(24\\) (\\(24 \\div 9 = 2.666...\\)). So, this condition is also satisfied.\n\nTherefore, all three conditions of the Eisenstein criterion are met for \\(p=3\\). This suggests that the polynomial is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check \\(p=5\\) as well.\n\n1. Check if \\(p=5\\) divides each of the coefficients \\(a_{2}=6\\), \\(a_{1}=-9\\), and \\(a_{0}=24\\).\n\n- \\(5\\) divides \\(6\\)? No.\n\n- \\(5\\) divides \\(-9\\)? No.\n\n- \\(5\\) divides \\(24\\)? No.\n\nSince \\(5\\) does not divide any of the coefficients except possibly the leading coefficient, but it's not necessary as per the first condition, it's clear that \\(p=5\\) does not satisfy the first condition.\n\nTherefore, the Eisenstein criterion does not apply with \\(p=5\\).\n\nSo, among the given options, only \\(p=3\\) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for this polynomial.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the polynomial in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). 8x^{3} + 6x^{2} - 9x + 24\". And the options are:\n\nA. Yes, with p=2.\n\nB. Yes, with p=3.\n\nC. Yes, with p=5.\n\nD. No.\n\nBased on my analysis, \\(p=3\\) works, but \\(p=2\\) and \\(p=5\\) do not. So, the correct answer should be B. Yes, with p=3.\n\nBut let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for \\(p=2\\):\n\n- Does \\(2\\) divide \\(6\\), \\(-9\\), and \\(24\\)? As established, \\(2\\) divides \\(6\\) and \\(24\\), but not \\(-9\\). So, fails the first condition.\n\nFor \\(p=3\\):\n\n- \\(3\\) divides \\(6\\), \\(-9\\), and \\(24\\): yes.\n\n- \\(3\\) does not divide \\(8\\): yes.\n\n- \\(9\\) does not divide \\(24\\): yes.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\nFor \\(p=5\\):\n\n- \\(5\\) does not divide \\(6\\), \\(-9\\), or \\(24\\). So, fails the first condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Yes, with p=3.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit cautious because the question might be trying to trick me by including options that don't apply. Maybe there's something else I need to consider.\n\nLet me think about the degree of the polynomial. It's a cubic polynomial, so if it's reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), it must factor into a linear term and a quadratic term, or into three linear terms. But if the Eisenstein criterion holds for \\(p=3\\), then it should be irreducible, which aligns with the conclusion.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the polynomial could satisfy the criterion for another prime, but since \\(p=3\\) works, and the question specifies options only up to \\(p=5\\), I think B is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but option D is \"No,\" meaning it doesn't satisfy the criterion for any of the given primes. But since \\(p=3\\) works, D is incorrect.\n\nOption A is \\(p=2\\), which we saw doesn't work, and Option C is \\(p=5\\), which also doesn't work, so they are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Yes, with p=3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
