Supermarkets, B. Convenience stores, C. Category-killer stores, and D. Limited line retailers.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. I need to match the description with the right type of shop.\n\nFirst, supermarkets are big stores that sell a wide variety of food and household items, right? They're usually pretty big and have a lot of products, but the question mentions \"last-minute purchase needs.\" Supermarkets might be convenient, but maybe they're not the first place people go for quick, urgent purchases because they can be crowded and time-consuming to navigate.\n\nNext, convenience stores. The name itself suggests that they're meant to be convenient. They're often located in places that are easy to access, like near residential areas or along busy streets. They usually stay open for long hours, sometimes 24/7, which is great for people who need something right away outside of regular shopping hours. They stock a range of grocery and household items, maybe not as wide as supermarkets, but enough for common needs.\n\nCategory-killer stores sound interesting. I think these are stores that specialize in a particular category of products and offer a very wide selection in that area. For example, a furniture store that has everything you could possibly need for your home's decor. But the question is about a range of grocery and household items, not just one specific category. So, maybe not the best fit for last-minute general needs.\n\nLimited line retailers, I'm not as familiar with that term. Maybe they offer a limited range of products, focusing on specific lines or brands. If that's the case, they might not have the variety needed for last-minute grocery and household purchases. Consumers might not find everything they need there in a hurry.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, convenience stores seem to fit the description best. They're designed for quick stops, offer a variety of everyday items, and are often open when other stores are closed, making them ideal for last-minute purchases.\n\nLet me double-check. The question says \"a range of grocery and household items that cater for last-minute purchase needs of consumers.\" Convenience stores definitely offer groceries and household items, and their whole business model is built around being convenient and accessible for urgent needs.\n\nSupermarkets might also offer these items, but they aren't primarily known for last-minute purchases. Category-killer stores focus on a single category, which doesn't match the description. And limited line retailers seem too specialized for general grocery and household needs.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be B. Convenience stores.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
