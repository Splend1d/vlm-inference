                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is about trypsin, and I need to find out which statement is not true. Okay, so trypsin is an enzyme, right? It's involved in digestion, specifically in breaking down proteins. So, it's an organic compound made of proteins. That sounds right, but I should double-check.\n\nOption A says it's an organic compound made of proteins. Enzymes are generally proteins, and trypsin is an enzyme, so this seems correct.\n\nOption B says it's a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction. Well, enzymes are catalysts; they speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. So, this also seems true.\n\nOption C says it is operative over a wide pH range. Now, I recall that enzymes have an optimal pH where they work best. For trypsin, since it's found in the small intestine, which has a neutral to slightly alkaline environment, its optimal pH is around 8-9. But is it operative over a wide pH range? I think most enzymes have a fairly narrow range where they're most active, and their activity drops off outside of that range. So, maybe this isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption D says the rate of catalysis is affected by the concentration of substrate. This makes sense because as you add more substrate, the enzyme can work faster up to a point where all the active sites are saturated. So, substrate concentration does affect the reaction rate.\n\nHmm, so between A, B, and D, they all seem to be true statements about trypsin. But C seems a bit iffy. Let me think about it more.\n\nI remember that enzymes are sensitive to changes in pH and temperature. Each enzyme has an optimal pH at which its activity is highest, and deviations from this pH can denature the enzyme, making it less effective or even inactive. For trypsin, which works in the intestines, the pH is normally around 7-8, which is slightly alkaline. But does it work well at other pH levels too?\n\nLet me consider the pH range over which trypsin is active. I think trypsin can function within a certain pH range, but it's not extremely broad. For example, some enzymes can work at very acidic pH levels, like in the stomach, where the pH is around 2, but trypsin would be denatured at that pH.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, trypsin is not operative over a wide pH range; it prefers a more alkaline environment. Therefore, option C might be the incorrect statement.\n\nTo make sure, let's think about it differently. If trypsin were operative over a wide pH range, it would mean it could function effectively at both acidic and alkaline pH levels. But we know that in the human body, trypsin is primarily active in the small intestine, where the pH is around 7-8. In the stomach, where the pH is highly acidic, trypsin would be denatured and lose its activity.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to say that trypsin is not operative over a wide pH range. It has a specific optimal pH and works best within a narrow range around that point.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- A: Trypsin is an organic compound made of proteins \u2013 true, as enzymes are proteins.\n\n- B: It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction \u2013 true, enzymes are catalysts.\n\n- C: It is operative over a wide pH range \u2013 not true, as it has an optimal pH and works best within a narrow range.\n\n- D: The rate of catalysis is affected by the concentration of substrate \u2013 true, as per enzyme kinetics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
