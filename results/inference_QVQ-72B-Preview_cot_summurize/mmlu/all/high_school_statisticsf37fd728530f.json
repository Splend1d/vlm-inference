                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about residuals in regression analysis. There are four statements, and I need to pick the true one. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Influential scores have large residuals.\" Hmm, I think influential points can have large residuals, but not necessarily always. Maybe it depends on how influential the point is and where it lies relative to the regression line. Perhaps sometimes influential points can pull the regression line towards them, reducing the residual. But I'm a bit unsure here.\n\nOption B says, \"If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals.\" Wait, is that necessarily true? I think in a good linear model, residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, but the number of positive and negative residuals doesn't have to be exactly the same. It's more about the distribution being symmetric around zero. Maybe this isn't the best way to define a good linear model.\n\nOption C says, \"The mean of the residuals is always zero.\" I recall from my statistics class that in least squares regression, one of the properties is that the sum of the residuals is zero. Therefore, the mean of the residuals should also be zero, provided that there's an intercept term in the model. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says, \"If the correlation is 0, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot.\" If the correlation is 0, that means there's no linear relationship between the variables. In that case, the residual plot should show no particular pattern; it should look like a random scatter of points. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nBased on this, option C seems to be the correct choice. The mean of the residuals is always zero, assuming there's an intercept in the model.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
