                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We've got an electric motor with some specifications, and we need to figure out at what constant speed it can lift a 6-kilogram mass. The options are 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s, 1.5 m/s, or 2.0 m/s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the motor's input power is and how that relates to its output mechanical power, since it's lifting a mass. The label says the input is 120 volts AC at 1.0 ampere and 60 Hz, and the efficiency is 75%. So, the input power should be voltage times current, right? Let's calculate that.\n\nInput power = voltage \u00d7 current = 120 V \u00d7 1.0 A = 120 watts.\n\nBut the motor isn't 100% efficient, so not all of that power is converted into mechanical power. The efficiency is 75%, so the output mechanical power is 75% of 120 watts.\n\nMechanical power = input power \u00d7 efficiency = 120 W \u00d7 0.75 = 90 watts.\n\nNow, the motor is lifting a mass, which means it's doing work against gravity. The power in this case can also be expressed as the force times the velocity, since power is work per unit time, and work is force times distance.\n\nPower = force \u00d7 velocity.\n\nThe force here is the weight of the mass, which is the mass times gravity.\n\nForce = mass \u00d7 gravity = 6 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2 = 58.8 newtons.\n\nSo, power = 58.8 N \u00d7 velocity.\n\nWe know the mechanical power is 90 watts, so:\n\n90 W = 58.8 N \u00d7 velocity.\n\nTo find the velocity, we can rearrange this equation:\n\nVelocity = power / force = 90 W / 58.8 N.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n90 divided by 58.8.\n\nWell, 58.8 times 1.5 is 88.2, which is close to 90. The exact calculation is:\n\nVelocity = 90 / 58.8 \u2248 1.53 m/s.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1.5 m/s is the closest to 1.53 m/s.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 1.5 m/s.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, input power is indeed 120 V \u00d7 1.0 A = 120 W.\n\nEfficiency is 75%, so mechanical power is 120 W \u00d7 0.75 = 90 W.\n\nForce due to gravity is 6 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2 = 58.8 N.\n\nPower is force times velocity, so:\n\n90 W = 58.8 N \u00d7 velocity.\n\nVelocity = 90 / 58.8.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n90 \u00f7 58.8 = 1.527... which is approximately 1.5 m/s.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might consider significant figures or rounding, but since the options are in whole numbers, 1.5 m/s is the closest.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. 1.5 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
