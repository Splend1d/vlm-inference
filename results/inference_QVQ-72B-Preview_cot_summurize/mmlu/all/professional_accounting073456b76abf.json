                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the standard deviation of a portfolio that's composed of one quarter in Security A and three quarters in Security B. The correlation between A and B is -0.20, and their standard deviations are 8% and 18%, respectively.\n\nFirst, I recall that the standard deviation of a portfolio is not just the weighted average of the individual standard deviations. That's because the assets can be correlated, and correlation affects the portfolio's overall risk. So, the formula for the portfolio standard deviation involves the weights of the assets, their individual standard deviations, and the correlation between them.\n\nThe general formula for the standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio is:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{w_a^2 \\sigma_a^2 + w_b^2 \\sigma_b^2 + 2 \\cdot w_a \\cdot w_b \\cdot \\rho_{ab} \\cdot \\sigma_a \\cdot \\sigma_b}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( \\sigma_p \\) is the portfolio standard deviation.\n\n- \\( w_a \\) and \\( w_b \\) are the weights of Securities A and B in the portfolio.\n\n- \\( \\sigma_a \\) and \\( \\sigma_b \\) are the standard deviations of Securities A and B.\n\n- \\( \\rho_{ab} \\) is the correlation between Securities A and B.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( w_a = 0.25 \\) (one quarter)\n\n- \\( w_b = 0.75 \\) (three quarters)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_a = 8\\% = 0.08 \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma_b = 18\\% = 0.18 \\)\n\n- \\( \\rho_{ab} = -0.20 \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{(0.25)^2 \\times (0.08)^2 + (0.75)^2 \\times (0.18)^2 + 2 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.75 \\times (-0.20) \\times 0.08 \\times 0.18}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (0.25)^2 \\times (0.08)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(0.25)^2 = 0.0625\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.0625 \\times (0.08)^2 = 0.0625 \\times 0.0064 = 0.0004\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( (0.75)^2 \\times (0.18)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(0.75)^2 = 0.5625\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.5625 \\times (0.18)^2 = 0.5625 \\times 0.0324 = 0.018225\n\\]\n\nThen, calculate the covariance term:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.75 \\times (-0.20) \\times 0.08 \\times 0.18\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 2 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.75 \\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 0.25 = 0.50\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 0.75 = 0.375\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by the correlation and the product of the standard deviations:\n\n\\[\n0.375 \\times (-0.20) = -0.075\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-0.075 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.18 = -0.075 \\times 0.00144 = -0.000108\n\\]\n\nNow, sum all these up inside the square root:\n\n\\[\n0.0004 + 0.018225 + (-0.000108) = 0.0004 + 0.018225 - 0.000108 = 0.018517\n\\]\n\nFinally, take the square root of that sum to get the portfolio standard deviation:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{0.018517} \\approx 0.136077\n\\]\n\nConverting to percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.136077 \\times 100\\% \\approx 13.61\\%\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8.70%\n\nB. 13.20%\n\nC. 54%\n\nD. 6.60%\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 13.61%, which is closest to option B. 13.20%. Maybe I made a rounding error, but it's definitely between 13.20% and 13.60%.\n\nLet me check my calculations again to ensure accuracy.\n\nRecomputing the covariance term:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.75 \\times (-0.20) = -0.075\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-0.075 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.18 = -0.075 \\times 0.00144 = -0.000108\n\\]\n\nSum inside the square root:\n\n\\[\n0.0004 + 0.018225 - 0.000108 = 0.018517\n\\]\n\nSquare root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{0.018517} \\approx 0.136077\n\\]\n\nWhich is about 13.61%, closest to option B. 13.20%.\n\nPerhaps the exact answer is slightly less due to rounding in intermediate steps. Anyway, among the given options, 13.20% is the closest to my calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 13.20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 13.20\\%} \\]"
