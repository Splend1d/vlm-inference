                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the characteristics of all living organisms. Let's see what it's asking. The question is: \"The ability to do which of the following is a characteristic of all living organisms?\" And then there are four options:\n\nA. Move from place to place\n\nB. Detect and respond to changes in the environment\n\nC. Produce sugars by photosynthesis\n\nD. Produce heat to maintain a constant internal temperature\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out which one of these is something that all living things can do. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what do we mean by \"all living organisms\"? Well, that would include every type of life form we know of, from single-celled bacteria and protozoa to plants, animals, fungi, and more complex organisms.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one and see if it applies to all of them.\n\nOption A: Move from place to place.\n\nDo all living organisms move from place to place? Hmm, not necessarily. For example, plants are generally stationary; they don't pick up and move to a different location like animals do. Similarly, some fungi and bacteria may not move in the same way that animals do. So, if this is the case, then this option can't be the answer because it doesn't apply to all living organisms.\n\nOption B: Detect and respond to changes in the environment.\n\nThis seems promising. Even if an organism can't move from place to place, it might still detect and respond to environmental changes in other ways. For example, plants can't move, but they can respond to light by growing towards it (phototropism). They can also respond to touch, like when certain plants close their leaves when touched (like the sensitive plant). Similarly, bacteria can sense their environment and respond to changes in nutrient availability or pH.\n\nAnimals, of course, detect and respond to environmental changes through their senses and behaviors. Fungi can respond to environmental cues by growing in certain directions or producing spores under specific conditions.\n\nSo, this seems like a strong candidate because it applies to a wide range of organisms, from the simplest to the most complex.\n\nOption C: Produce sugars by photosynthesis.\n\nThis is a process that's primarily associated with plants and some algae. But not all living organisms can do this. Animals, for instance, don't perform photosynthesis; they get their energy by consuming other organisms or organic matter. Fungi also don't perform photosynthesis; they break down organic materials and absorb nutrients.\n\nTherefore, this option can't be the answer because it doesn't apply to all living organisms, only to those that are photosynthetic, like plants and some algae.\n\nOption D: Produce heat to maintain a constant internal temperature.\n\nThis is another interesting one. In animals, some can regulate their body temperature internally, producing heat to maintain a constant temperature, which is called endothermy. Birds and mammals are examples of endothermic animals. However, most animals are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. This includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates.\n\nPlants, fungi, and bacteria don't typically maintain a constant internal temperature in this way. So, this option is also not applicable to all living organisms.\n\nAfter considering all these options, it seems that option B, detecting and responding to changes in the environment, is the most universal characteristic among all living organisms.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think of a few more examples. Take, for instance, single-celled organisms like amoebas. They can sense their environment and move towards food sources or away from harmful substances. This is called chemotaxis.\n\nAnother example is viruses, but wait a minute\u2014viruses are considered by some to be on the border between living and non-living. They can replicate inside host cells but can't carry out metabolic processes on their own. However, they do respond to their environment in terms of finding host cells and replicating when conditions are right.\n\nBut since the question is about characteristics of all living organisms, and there's some debate about whether viruses are alive, maybe it's best to stick with the organisms that are universally accepted as living, like cells with metabolism and reproduction.\n\nIn any case, even if we exclude viruses, option B still holds for the rest.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that detecting and responding to changes in the environment is a characteristic shared by all living organisms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
