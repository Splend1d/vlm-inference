I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of what's considered moral there. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I threw the bowling ball as hard as I could to try and break the pin setter.\" Okay, so someone is at a bowling alley and instead of trying to hit the pins, they're aiming to break the machine that sets the pins up. Hmm, that seems off. Breaking someone else's property on purpose is generally not okay, right? It's vandalism or something like that. Even if it's just a machine, it's still someone's property, and intentionally damaging it is wrong. So, I think this is morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I told my daughter that she used incorrect grammar and that she should revise her sentences.\" Okay, so a parent is correcting their daughter's grammar and telling her to fix her sentences. Now, this seems like a teaching moment. Parents are supposed to guide and educate their children, right? Correcting grammar might be seen as helpful, especially if it's done in a constructive way. But wait, maybe there's a context missing. If the daughter is feeling criticized or if it's done in a mean-spirited way, that could change things. But based on what's written, it seems like a constructive criticism. So, is this morally wrong? I don't think so. It seems like a normal parental duty to correct and educate one's child.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, the first one involves intentionally trying to damage property, which is clearly morally wrong, while the second one is about correcting a child's grammar, which seems more like a parental responsibility and not morally wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong. That means the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" I'm not entirely sure if cultural context changes things, but I think correcting grammar is generally accepted as part of parenting. Maybe in some circles, it's seen as nitpicking or unnecessary, but not morally wrong.\n\nAlso, in the first scenario, trying to break the pin setter seems aggressive and destructive, which is clearly against moral standards anywhere, not just in the US.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
