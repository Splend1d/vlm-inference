                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this macroeconomics concept. The question is about what happens when aggregate demand increases, and we're supposed to consider that we're operating in the intermediate range of the aggregate supply curve. The options are:\n\nA. Price level only\n\nB. Real GDP only\n\nC. Neither price level nor real GDP\n\nD. Price level and real GDP\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the aggregate supply (AS) curve represents. I know that the AS curve shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied in an economy. There are different shapes for the AS curve depending on the range we're looking at:\n\n1. The horizontal range (classical range), where the AS curve is flat, meaning that changes in the price level don't affect real GDP.\n\n2. The intermediate range, where the AS curve is upward sloping, suggesting that both price level and real GDP can change.\n\n3. The vertical range (Keynesian range), where the AS curve is vertical, meaning that changes in the price level don't affect real GDP.\n\nSo, in the intermediate range, the AS curve is upward sloping. That means that as the price level increases, the quantity of real GDP supplied also increases, but not as much as in the classical range.\n\nNow, if aggregate demand (AD) increases in this intermediate range, what should happen?\n\nI think of the AD-AS model. When AD increases, the AD curve shifts to the right. In the intermediate range, the AS curve is upward sloping, so when AD increases, the equilibrium point moves up and to the right.\n\nThis should result in both an increase in the price level and an increase in real GDP.\n\nWait, but the question says \"in the intermediate range,\" which I believe is the same as the intermediate range of the AS curve, where the curve is upward sloping.\n\nLet me double-check this.\n\nIn the intermediate range, the AS curve is upward sloping because, at higher price levels, producers are willing to supply more output due to higher prices making production more profitable. So, an increase in AD would lead to both higher prices and higher output in the short run.\n\nBut I should consider if there's any possibility that only one of them increases.\n\nOption A says price level only, which might happen if we were in the vertical range of the AS curve, but in the intermediate range, both price level and real GDP increase.\n\nOption B says real GDP only, which might happen if we were in the horizontal range of the AS curve, but again, in the intermediate range, both increase.\n\nOption C says neither, which doesn't make sense because in the intermediate range, both do increase when AD increases.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. Price level and real GDP.\n\nWait, but I recall that in the intermediate range, both increase, but maybe not by the same proportion.\n\nAlso, in the intermediate range, the relationship isn't perfectly inelastic or perfectly elastic, so changes in AD affect both price level and real GDP.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Price level and real GDP.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
