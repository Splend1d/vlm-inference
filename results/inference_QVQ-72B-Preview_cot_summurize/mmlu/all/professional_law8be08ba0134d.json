Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nThere's a seller who agreed to sell a residential parcel to a buyer. The agreement says the seller has to provide a good and marketable title. That means the title should be clear of any liens or claims that might affect the buyer's ownership.\n\nDuring the title search, they found an open mortgage from a previous owner to a local bank. This mortgage is really old, like 25 years ago, and the person who took the mortgage can't be found, and the bank has lost its records. So, it's a bit of a mess.\n\nThe purchase agreement has a clause that gives the seller an extra 90 days in such situations to clear the title by bringing a quiet title action. A quiet title action is when someone sues to establish their right to property and remove any clouds on the title.\n\nBut the seller didn't follow that provision. Instead, she went to settlement with the bad title and demanded more extra time to file the quiet title action. The buyer didn't want to wait and asked for their down payment back and to cancel the deal.\n\nNow, the question is, if there's litigation, will it most likely favor the buyer's position?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\n\nB. No, because the seller always has the right to bring an action for adverse possession against the holder of the open mortgage.\n\nC. Yes, because the open mortgage is so old that it would be declared void by all courts.\n\nD. No, because the buyer did not act in good faith when it refused to give the seller additional time at the closing.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each one.\n\nStarting with option A: the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure in the purchase agreement.\n\nWell, the agreement said the seller has to convey good and marketable title. It also gave her an extra 90 days to clear the title via a quiet title action if there are issues like this open mortgage. But she didn't do that. Instead, she went to settlement with the bad title and asked for more time.\n\nSo, by not following the agreed procedure, did she breach the agreement? It seems like she did because she didn't adhere to the terms set out in the contract regarding clearing the title.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there are implied terms or other considerations.\n\nMoving on to option B: the seller always has the right to bring an action for adverse possession against the holder of the open mortgage.\n\nAdverse possession is when someone occupies someone else's land without permission for a certain period and then can claim ownership under certain circumstances. But in this case, the seller is trying to clear the title of an open mortgage, not necessarily claim adverse possession over the property itself.\n\nMoreover, adverse possession typically involves physical possession of the property, not just having a mortgage lien on it. So, I'm not sure if adverse possession is the right tool here to clear the title of a mortgage lien.\n\nMaybe this option is not the best fit.\n\nOption C: yes, because the open mortgage is so old that it would be declared void by all courts.\n\nThis touches on the idea of whether liens or mortgages have a statute of limitations or can become invalid over time if not enforced.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there are laws that say liens or mortgages must be enforced within a certain period, or they can be considered expired or unenforceable. Twenty-five years is a long time, so it's possible that this mortgage is no longer valid.\n\nHowever, just because it's old doesn't automatically mean it's void. The seller would likely need to go through a legal process, like a quiet title action, to have a court declare the mortgage void.\n\nSo, while the age of the mortgage might work in the seller's favor in a quiet title action, it doesn't necessarily mean the mortgage is automatically void without that legal determination.\n\nTherefore, this option seems a bit too absolute.\n\nOption D: no, because the buyer did not act in good faith when it refused to give the seller additional time at the closing.\n\nGood faith is an important principle in contracts, meaning that parties should act honestly and fairly towards each other.\n\nThe seller asked for more extra time at the closing to file a quiet title action, but the buyer refused and demanded their down payment back and to cancel the deal.\n\nThe buyer had a right to expect the seller to follow the agreement. The agreement gave the seller an extra 90 days to clear the title via a quiet title action, but she didn't do that. Instead, she showed up at closing with the bad title and asked for more time.\n\nThe buyer was within their rights to expect the seller to have followed the agreed procedure. By not doing so, the seller breached the agreement.\n\nTherefore, the buyer's refusal to give more time might be seen as reasonable, especially since the seller didn't follow the agreed process.\n\nSo, this option suggests the buyer didn't act in good faith, but based on the information, it seems like the buyer was justified in their actions.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like option A is the most accurate: yes, the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\n\nThe other options don't seem to align as closely with the facts presented.\n\nSo, my answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
