                    "text": "So I have this question about potassium-40, which is an isotope of potassium found in nature. It's radioactive and can be detected with simple radiation counters. The question is asking about how many protons, neutrons, and electrons it has when it's part of a compound called K\u2082SO\u2084, which is potassium sulfate. So, the options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst off, I know that in any atom, the number of protons determines what element it is. Potassium is element number 19 on the periodic table, so it always has 19 protons, no matter what isotope it is. So, for potassium-40, it should have 19 protons.\n\nNow, isotopes of an element have different numbers of neutrons but the same number of protons. The mass number of an isotope is given by the sum of protons and neutrons. So, for potassium-40, the mass number is 40. Since protons and neutrons both have a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu), the mass number tells us the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom.\n\nSo, mass number = protons + neutrons.\n\nGiven that the mass number is 40 and protons are 19, neutrons should be 40 - 19 = 21.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons. So, if the mass number is 40 and the atomic number (protons) is 19, then neutrons should indeed be 40 - 19 = 21.\n\nBut looking at the options, option A says 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons. Hmm, that doesn't seem right because in a neutral atom, the number of electrons should equal the number of protons. So, if it has 19 protons, it should have 19 electrons in a neutral state.\n\nOption B says 20 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons. But if the mass number is 40, and protons are 19, neutrons should be 21, as I calculated earlier.\n\nOption C is 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons, which matches my initial thoughts.\n\nOption D is 19 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons. But that would make the mass number 19 + 19 = 38, which contradicts the given potassium-40.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems correct. But let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nThe question mentions that potassium-40 is part of K\u2082SO\u2084, which is potassium sulfate. But does being part of a compound affect the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the atom?\n\nI don't think so. The atomic structure of an element doesn't change when it forms a compound, at least not in terms of the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The electrons might be involved in bonding, but their total number remains the same.\n\nSo, in K\u2082SO\u2084, the potassium atoms should still have their usual atomic structures.\n\nWait, but maybe there's something about ionization. Potassium can form ions, like K\u207a, by losing one electron. But in the compound K\u2082SO\u2084, the potassium is likely present as K\u207a ions, since sulfate is SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, and two K\u207a balance the charge.\n\nSo, if potassium is present as K\u207a, it would have lost one electron, meaning in the ion, it has 18 electrons instead of 19.\n\nBut the question is asking about the potassium-40 atom when it's part of K\u2082SO\u2084. Is it referring to the atom before forming the ion, or the ion itself?\n\nI think it's referring to the atom in the compound, but perhaps I need to consider its ionic form.\n\nLet me see. If potassium is in K\u2082SO\u2084 as K\u207a, then it has lost one electron, so it would have 18 electrons, while still having 19 protons and 21 neutrons.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons, which matches the K\u207a ion.\n\nOption C is 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons, which would be the neutral potassium atom, not the ion.\n\nBut the question says \"when it is part of K\u2082SO\u2084,\" which is likely in its ionic form, K\u207a.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is correct.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased a bit strangely. It says \"how many protons, neutrons, and electrons does potassium-40 have when it is part of K\u2082SO\u2084?\"\n\nIs it asking about the atom itself or the ion in the compound?\n\nI think it's asking about the ion, since in the compound, potassium exists as K\u207a.\n\nSo, in that case, the atom has 19 protons, 21 neutrons, and normally 19 electrons, but when it forms K\u207a, it loses one electron, so it has 18 electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to say that in the compound, the potassium atom still has its full complement of electrons, but that doesn't make sense because in reality, it forms an ion by losing one electron.\n\nLet me check again. Potassium, atomic number 19, typically forms K\u207a by losing its outermost electron.\n\nSo, in K\u2082SO\u2084, there are two K\u207a ions and one SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b ion.\n\nTherefore, each K\u207a ion has 18 electrons, while the neutral potassium atom has 19.\n\nSo, if the question is asking about potassium-40 in K\u2082SO\u2084, which is likely referring to the K\u207a ion, then yes, it has 18 electrons.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B: 20 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons. This doesn't match our calculation of 21 neutrons.\n\nOption C: 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons. This would be the neutral potassium atom, not the ion in the compound.\n\nOption D: 19 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons. This would be a different isotope with a mass number of 38, which isn't potassium-40.\n\nTherefore, option A is indeed the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
