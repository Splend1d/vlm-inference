                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what's included in the statement of activities for government-wide financial statements. I have these four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a government-wide statement of activities is. I think it's a financial statement that shows how a government's activities affect its net position over a certain period. It's supposed to give a big-picture view, right? So, it should include all the government's activities, but maybe group them in a certain way for clarity.\n\nOption A says there are separate columns for governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units. Hmm, that sounds plausible. Governmental activities are like the core services provided by the government, business-type activities are those that operate more like businesses, maybe charging fees for services, and component units are other entities that the government controls or influences significantly, but they're presented separately.\n\nOption B suggests separate columns for each major governmental fund. Wait, but in fund-based financial statements, we have different funds like general fund, special revenue funds, etc. In government-wide statements, I think the idea is to aggregate these funds into broader categories rather than showing each fund separately. So, maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption C mentions separate columns for each nonmajor governmental fund. Again, this seems similar to option B. If government-wide statements are supposed to provide a consolidated view, showing each nonmajor fund separately might not align with that purpose. Maybe these are included in a different way.\n\nOption D talks about a separate section at the bottom of the statement that shows program and general revenues. Program revenues are likely tied to specific programs or activities, while general revenues are things like taxes that aren't restricted to specific uses. Having a section that summarizes these makes sense, but I'm not sure if it's presented as a separate section at the bottom.\n\nLet me think again. The statement of activities in government-wide financial statements is meant to show the flows of resources for the government as a whole, distinguishing between different types of activities. So, having separate columns for governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units seems logical because it helps users understand the different aspects of the government's operations.\n\nIn contrast, showing each individual fund in separate columns, whether major or nonmajor, would be more in line with fund-based financial statements, not the government-wide ones which are intended to provide a higher-level view.\n\nAs for option D, while it's true that program and general revenues are important classifications, I don't recall that they're presented in a separate section at the bottom of the statement of activities. Maybe they're integrated throughout the statement rather than being summarized at the end.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A seems the most accurate: separate columns for governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider an example. Suppose a city has several funds: a general fund, a few special revenue funds, some capital projects funds, debt service funds, and permanent funds. In the government-wide statement of activities, these would be grouped into governmental activities, business-type activities, and component units, rather than being listed separately.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
