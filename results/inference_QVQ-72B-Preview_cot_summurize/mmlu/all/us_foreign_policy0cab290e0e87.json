                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following considers states to be the primary actors in international relations? A. Realism, B. Idealism, C. Liberalism, D. None of the above.\" Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not super familiar with all these terms, but I think I have a basic understanding of each one. Let me try to recall what I know about realism, idealism, and liberalism in international relations.\n\nFirst off, realism is a theory that emphasizes the role of states as the main actors in international politics. It suggests that states are sovereign and look out for their own national interests, often focusing on power and security. So, from what I remember, in realism, states are definitely the primary actors.\n\nIdealism, on the other hand, seems a bit different. It emphasizes moral and ethical considerations in international relations. Idealists believe that countries should act according to certain principles and values, not just their own self-interest. They might consider non-state actors or international organizations as important in promoting these ideals. So, maybe states aren't the only primary actors here.\n\nLiberalism is another theory. I think it focuses on the role of international institutions and non-state actors in promoting cooperation and reducing conflicts between states. So, in liberalism, while states are important, there's also a significant role for things like international organizations, NGOs, and even individuals in shaping international relations. So, perhaps states aren't the sole primary actors in this view either.\n\nGiven that, it seems like realism is the theory that puts states at the center of international relations. Idealism and liberalism both consider other factors and actors to be important as well. So, the answer should be A. Realism.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it. In realism, states are seen as rational actors that pursue their national interests, defined primarily in terms of power and security. They interact in an international system that has no central authority, which leads to a focus on military\u5b9e\u529b and balance of power. So, yes, states are the primary actors here.\n\nIn idealism, there's a focus on moral progress and the possibility of a more peaceful and cooperative world order. Idealists might emphasize the importance of international law, collective security, and the spread of democracy. While states are still important, the emphasis shifts to transcending traditional state-centered approaches and considering the welfare of all people, perhaps even forming a world government someday. So, in this case, states might not be the only or primary actors.\n\nLiberalism, also known as international relations liberalism, emphasizes the role of international institutions and organizations in facilitating cooperation and reducing the likelihood of conflict. It also highlights the importance of economic interdependence and the idea that trade can promote peace. In this framework, non-state actors like multinational corporations, NGOs, and international organizations play crucial roles alongside states. So, again, states aren't the only primary actors.\n\nTherefore, based on this comparison, realism is the theory that considers states to be the primary actors in international relations. The other options\u2014idealism and liberalism\u2014incorporate a broader range of actors and factors. So, the correct answer should be A. Realism.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance that \"none of the above\" could be the answer. But that doesn't make much sense, because all three theories do consider states as important actors, even if idealism and liberalism give more weight to other actors as well. So, no, D. None of the above isn't a suitable choice.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is A. Realism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
