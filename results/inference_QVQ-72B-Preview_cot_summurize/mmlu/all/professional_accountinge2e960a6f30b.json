                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these items isn't subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation. The options are discontinued operations, income from continuing operations, extraordinary gains and losses, and operating income. I need to recall what intraperiod income tax allocation is and then see which one of these doesn't fit into that.\n\nFirst off, intraperiod income tax allocation is a concept in accounting where a company's income taxes are allocated across different components of income in the income statement. So, instead of just showing a single income tax expense, the company breaks it down to show how much tax is attributable to continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, etc.\n\nFrom what I remember, the idea is to provide more transparency about where the tax expenses are coming from and how they relate to different parts of the business.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Discontinued operations\n\nB. Income from continuing operations\n\nC. Extraordinary gains and losses\n\nD. Operating income\n\nI need to think about which of these wouldn't require a separate tax allocation.\n\nLet me recall what each of these is:\n\n- **Discontinued operations:** This refers to a component of a company's business that has been disposed of or is being prepared for disposal. It's presented separately in the income statement because it's not part of the ongoing operations.\n\n- **Income from continuing operations:** This is the profit from the ongoing, main activities of the company, excluding any discontinued operations or extraordinary items.\n\n- **Extraordinary gains and losses:** These are events that are both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence. They are separate from the company's regular operations and are reported net of tax separately in the income statement.\n\n- **Operating income:** This is the profit from the company's main business operations, before interest and taxes. It's calculated by subtracting operating expenses from gross profit.\n\nGiven that, intraperiod income tax allocation typically involves allocating tax expenses to different components of income. So, for discontinued operations, income from continuing operations, and extraordinary gains and losses, companies usually allocate taxes specifically to these items.\n\nWait a minute, but operating income is a part of continuing operations, right? So, would it be subject to tax allocation separately, or is it included in the continuing operations' tax allocation?\n\nLet me think deeper. Operating income is a part of income from continuing operations. Specifically, income from continuing operations is calculated by taking operating income and adjusting it for other income and expenses, and then subtracting income taxes.\n\nSo, operating income is a component of income from continuing operations, before taxes. Therefore, the tax allocation for continuing operations would encompass the tax related to operating income, as well as other components like other income and expenses.\n\nBut the question is asking which item is not subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation. So, perhaps operating income isn't directly subject to separate tax allocation because it's already included in the income from continuing operations' tax allocation.\n\nLet me check a textbook or accounting standard to confirm this.\n\nAccording to FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, which provides guidance on intraperiod tax allocation, taxes should be allocated to each component of income, such as continuing operations, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items.\n\nHowever, operating income is not a separate component for which taxes are allocated individually; rather, it's a part of continuing operations.\n\nSo, in that case, operating income wouldn't be subject to separate intraperiod tax allocation because it's already included in the income from continuing operations' tax allocation.\n\nOn the other hand, discontinued operations and extraordinary items are separately reported and thus would have their own tax allocations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Operating income.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps income from continuing operations itself is not subject to intraperiod tax allocation, but that doesn't seem right because intraperiod tax allocation is precisely about allocating taxes to continuing operations, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items.\n\nBut wait, income from continuing operations is the primary component, and taxes are allocated to it, as well as to discontinued operations and extraordinary items.\n\nOperating income, being a part of continuing operations, would have its tax implications included in the continuing operations' tax allocation.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that operating income isn't separately subject to intraperiod tax allocation.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Operating income.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
