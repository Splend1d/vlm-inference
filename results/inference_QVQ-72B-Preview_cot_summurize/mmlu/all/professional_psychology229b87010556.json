                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a college freshman who took four different exams: English, math, chemistry, and history. He got scores of 150 on English, 100 on math, 55 on chemistry, and 30 on history. The problem also gives me the mean and standard deviation for each exam: \n\n- English: mean = 125, standard deviation = 20\n\n- Math: mean = 90, standard deviation = 10\n\n- Chemistry: mean = 45, standard deviation = 5\n\n- History: mean = 30, standard deviation = 5\n\nAnd the question is asking which exam he performed best on, based on this information. The options are A. English, B. Math, C. Chemistry, D. History.\n\nAlright, so to figure out which exam he performed best on, I need to consider not just his raw scores, but also how those scores compare to the class performance, right? Because if everyone did really well on one exam, his score might not be as impressive relative to theirs. Similarly, if an exam was really hard and everyone scored low, his score might look better in comparison.\n\nSo, one way to standardize this is to use z-scores. A z-score tells you how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular score is. A higher z-score would indicate better performance relative to the class.\n\nThe formula for z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(x - \\text{mean})}{\\text{standard deviation}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( x \\) is the raw score\n\n- Mean is the average score\n\n- Standard deviation is the measure of spread\n\nSo, I'll calculate the z-score for each exam.\n\nStarting with English:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{English}} = \\frac{150 - 125}{20} = \\frac{25}{20} = 1.25 \\]\n\nSo, his English score is 1.25 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nNext, math:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{math}} = \\frac{100 - 90}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1.0 \\]\n\nSo, his math score is 1 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nChemistry:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{chemistry}} = \\frac{55 - 45}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2.0 \\]\n\nHis chemistry score is 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nAnd history:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{history}} = \\frac{30 - 30}{5} = \\frac{0}{5} = 0 \\]\n\nHis history score is exactly at the mean.\n\nSo, based on z-scores, he performed best on chemistry, since it has the highest z-score of 2.0, meaning he was two standard deviations above the mean in that subject.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's think about this. Is there any other way to interpret \"best performance\"? Maybe considering the difficulty of the exams or something else.\n\nFor example, maybe in chemistry, getting 55 is really good because the exam is notoriously hard, and a 55 is exceptional compared to others. Similarly, in history, getting exactly the mean might not be great, but perhaps the exam was easy, and everyone scored high.\n\nBut according to the z-scores, chemistry seems to be the standout.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider percentiles. A higher z-score corresponds to a higher percentile rank in the class.\n\nFor example, a z-score of 2.0 in chemistry corresponds to being in the 97.7th percentile (since the standard normal distribution has a cumulative distribution function that gives about 97.7% for z=2).\n\nSimilarly, z=1.25 is about the 89th percentile, z=1.0 is about the 84th percentile, and z=0 is the 50th percentile.\n\nSo, again, chemistry looks the best here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider standardized scores, like converting all scores to a common scale, say 0-100, using z-scores.\n\nFor example, in chemistry, his z-score is 2.0. If we standardize this to a scale where the mean is 50 and standard deviation is 15 (similar to some grading scales), his chemistry score would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{standardized score} = 50 + (15 \\times z) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{chemistry standardized} = 50 + (15 \\times 2) = 50 + 30 = 80 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for English:\n\n\\[ \\text{English standardized} = 50 + (15 \\times 1.25) = 50 + 18.75 = 68.75 \\]\n\nFor math:\n\n\\[ \\text{math standardized} = 50 + (15 \\times 1) = 50 + 15 = 65 \\]\n\nAnd history:\n\n\\[ \\text{history standardized} = 50 + (15 \\times 0) = 50 \\]\n\nSo, again, chemistry has the highest standardized score.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the difficulty of each subject. Maybe some subjects are harder than others, and his performance should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut the z-scores already account for that by standardizing his performance relative to the class performance in each subject.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the question is trying to trick me by providing means and standard deviations that make his scores look better or worse.\n\nFor example, in history, the mean is 30 and his score is 30, so he's average. In chemistry, the mean is 45, and he scored 55, which is above average.\n\nWait, but I already considered that with z-scores.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Perhaps the reliability of the exams or the student's own preparation time, but that information isn't provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the range of possible scores. For instance, if one exam allows for a maximum score of 200 and another has a maximum of 50, then his scores might need to be adjusted for that.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide information about the maximum possible scores, so I'll assume that the means and standard deviations are all that's needed here.\n\nAnother angle: maybe using z-scores isn't the best way, and I should use a different standardization method.\n\nFor example, I could use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{standardized score} = \\frac{x - \\text{mean}}{\\text{range}} \\]\n\nBut I don't know the range for each exam, only the standard deviation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the interquartile range, but again, that information isn't provided.\n\nGiven the information provided, z-scores seem like the most appropriate way to compare his performance across different exams with different means and standard deviations.\n\nSo, based on the z-scores:\n\n- Chemistry: z = 2.0\n\n- English: z = 1.25\n\n- Math: z = 1.0\n\n- History: z = 0\n\nTherefore, his best performance was on the chemistry exam.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. chemistry.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that another interpretation could lead to a different conclusion?\n\nFor example, perhaps considering the variability within each class. Suppose that in chemistry, the standard deviation is small (5), meaning that scores are clustered tightly around the mean, so getting 55 is really good.\n\nWhereas in English, the standard deviation is larger (20), so his 150 might not be as impressive relative to the class.\n\nBut according to the z-score, it's still 1.25 standard deviations above the mean, which is pretty good, but not as good as chemistry's 2.0.\n\nSimilarly, in math, standard deviation is 10, and his score is 10 above the mean, so z=1.0.\n\nHistory, as before, z=0.\n\nSo, again, chemistry stands out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the coefficient of variation, which is the standard deviation divided by the mean, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem is trying to test understanding of standard deviation and mean in relation to individual scores.\n\nIf that's the case, then using z-scores is indeed the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing whether students recognize that a higher z-score indicates better relative performance.\n\nIn that case, again, chemistry is the best.\n\nWait, but the answer choices are labeled as A. English, B. Math, C. Chemistry, D. History.\n\nSo, according to my calculations, C. Chemistry is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other statistical measure that could change this conclusion.\n\nFor example, perhaps using t-scores instead of z-scores.\n\nT-scores are similar to z-scores but are typically used when the sample size is small.\n\nHowever, in this problem, there's no indication of sample size, so z-scores are appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different scaling method, like converting all scores to percentages based on the mean and standard deviation.\n\nBut that seems unnecessary when z-scores already provide a direct measure of how many standard deviations above or below the mean each score is.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that chemistry is the subject on which he performed best.\n\nSo, the answer is C. chemistry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. chemistry}} \\]"
