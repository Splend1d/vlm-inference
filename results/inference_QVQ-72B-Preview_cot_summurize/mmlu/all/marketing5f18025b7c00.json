                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about distribution strategies. It's asking which approach involves placing a product or service in as many outlets or locations as possible to maximize the chances of customers finding it. The options are exclusive distribution, intensive distribution, selective distribution, and direct distribution. I need to pick the one that best fits this description.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each type of distribution means. Starting with exclusive distribution, I think that's when a manufacturer sells their products through only a limited number of outlets, like premium stores or specific retailers. So, it's the opposite of what the question is asking\u2014maximizing outlets rather than limiting them. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nNext is intensive distribution. That sounds like it involves placing the product in as many places as possible. Maybe like putting a product in every possible store or outlet that will sell it. That seems to align with the question's description of maximizing outlets to increase the chance of customers finding the product. But I should check the other options to be sure.\n\nSelective distribution seems similar to exclusive distribution but not as restrictive. It involves choosing a limited number of outlets, but more than exclusive distribution. So, again, not matching the idea of placing the product in as many outlets as possible.\n\nLastly, direct distribution refers to selling products directly to consumers without using intermediaries like retailers. So, that's more about cutting out the middleman rather than placing the product in multiple outlets.\n\nGiven these understandings, intensive distribution seems to be the most fitting answer. It's about placing the product in as many outlets as possible to maximize customer access and visibility.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about some examples to confirm. Like, if a soft drink company wants to make sure their drinks are available everywhere, from small convenience stores to big supermarkets, they might use intensive distribution to get their products in as many of those places as possible. That makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, if a luxury car manufacturer only sells through a few select dealerships, that's more like exclusive or selective distribution, which doesn't match the wide availability described in the question.\n\nSo, based on this, intensive distribution is the correct choice for maximizing the number of outlets and locations where customers can find the product.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance that another option could also fit. Exclusive distribution is definitely not about maximizing outlets; it's about limiting them for exclusivity. Selective distribution is a bit in between\u2014it's more selective than intensive but less exclusive than exclusive distribution. Direct distribution is about the path to market, not the number of outlets. So, none of these other options match the description provided in the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Intensive distribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Intensive distribution.}} \\]"
