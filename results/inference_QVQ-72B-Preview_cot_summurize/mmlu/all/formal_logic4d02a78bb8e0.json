                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to determine if the argument is valid using indirect truth tables. The argument is:\n\nH \u2261 (~I \u2228 J)\n\nH \u2228 ~J / ~I\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. There's an equivalence here: H is equivalent to not I or J. And then there's a disjunction: H or not J, and from that, we're supposed to conclude not I.\n\nI need to check if this argument is valid. In logic, an argument is valid if it's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false at the same time.\n\nThe method I should use is indirect truth tables, which means I'll assume the argument is invalid and try to find a case where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If I can find such a case, the argument is invalid; otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo, let's identify the premises and the conclusion:\n\nPremises:\n\n1. H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J)\n\n2. H \u2228 ~J\n\nConclusion:\n\n~I\n\nI need to assume that the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and see if that's possible.\n\nFirst, let's consider the conclusion being false, which means I is true.\n\nSo, if I is true, then ~I is false.\n\nNow, let's see what happens with the premises.\n\nFirst premise: H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J)\n\nSince I is true, ~I is false, so (~I \u2228 J) is false or J, depending on J's truth value.\n\nBut this is an equivalence, so H must have the same truth value as (~I \u2228 J).\n\nSecond premise: H \u2228 ~J\n\nThis is a disjunction, so it's true if H is true or ~J is true.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nGiven that I is true (so ~I is false), let's consider possible truth values for H and J.\n\nLet's try option B: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and J are false.\n\nSo, H = false, I = false, J = false.\n\nThen, ~I = true.\n\nFirst premise: H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J) = false \u2261 (true \u2228 false) = false \u2261 true = false \u2261 true = false.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let's compute (~I \u2228 J) first: true \u2228 false = true.\n\nSo, H \u2261 true, which is false \u2261 true, which is false.\n\nSo, the first premise is false when H is false and (~I \u2228 J) is true.\n\nBut we want the premises to be true, so this doesn't work.\n\nOption B suggests that when H, I, and J are false, it's a counterexample, but in this case, the first premise is false, which doesn't fit our requirement of having all premises true.\n\nSo, option B is not a valid counterexample.\n\nNext, option C: Invalid. Counterexample when H and I are true and J is false.\n\nSo, H = true, I = true, J = false.\n\nThen, ~I = false.\n\nFirst premise: H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J) = true \u2261 (false \u2228 false) = true \u2261 false = false.\n\nSo, the first premise is false because true \u2261 false is false.\n\nAgain, we need the premises to be true, so this doesn't work either.\n\nOption D: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false.\n\nSo, H = false, I = true, J = false.\n\n~I = false.\n\nFirst premise: H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J) = false \u2261 (false \u2228 false) = false \u2261 false = true.\n\nSo, false \u2261 false is true, so the first premise is true.\n\nSecond premise: H \u2228 ~J = false \u2228 true = true.\n\nSo, both premises are true.\n\nNow, the conclusion is ~I, which is false.\n\nSo, premises are true, conclusion is false. This matches our requirement of premises being true and conclusion false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid, and option D provides a counterexample.\n\nBut let's check if there are other possible counterexamples.\n\nLet's consider if there are other truth value assignments where premises are true and conclusion is false.\n\nLet's try H = true, I = false, J = true.\n\n~I = true.\n\nFirst premise: H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J) = true \u2261 (true \u2228 true) = true \u2261 true = true.\n\nSecond premise: H \u2228 ~J = true \u2228 false = true.\n\nConclusion: ~I = true.\n\nSo, premises are true, conclusion is true. Doesn't contradict, so not a counterexample.\n\nNext, H = true, I = false, J = false.\n\n~I = true.\n\nFirst premise: true \u2261 (true \u2228 false) = true \u2261 true = true.\n\nSecond premise: true \u2228 true = true.\n\nConclusion: true.\n\nAgain, premises and conclusion are true.\n\nNot a counterexample.\n\nH = false, I = false, J = true.\n\n~I = true.\n\nFirst premise: false \u2261 (true \u2228 true) = false \u2261 true = false.\n\nSo, first premise is false.\n\nNot a counterexample.\n\nH = false, I = false, J = false.\n\nAlready checked, first premise is false.\n\nH = true, I = true, J = true.\n\n~I = false.\n\nFirst premise: true \u2261 (false \u2228 true) = true \u2261 true = true.\n\nSecond premise: true \u2228 false = true.\n\nConclusion: false.\n\nSo, premises are true, conclusion is false. Another counterexample.\n\nSo, there are at least two counterexamples: H = false, I = true, J = false; and H = true, I = true, J = true.\n\nBut among the options provided, option D matches one of them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
