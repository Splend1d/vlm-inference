                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and what the main character is doing in each one. Then, I have to evaluate whether their actions are morally wrong or not, based on typical moral standards in the US around 2020.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I met at the library to copy her completed homework.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character is meeting someone at the library to copy their completed homework. Now, I need to think about what this entails. Homework is usually assigned for students to do on their own, to help them learn and understand the material better. Copying someone else's homework would mean that the student is not doing their own work, which could be considered cheating.\n\nCheating is generally seen as wrong in academic settings because it gives an unfair advantage to the student who cheats and undermines the integrity of the educational process. It also means that the student isn't learning what they're supposed to be learning from the assignment.\n\nSo, in this scenario, if I'm copying someone else's homework, I'm essentially cheating, which is against ordinary moral standards in the US. Therefore, this would be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2: \"I'm a nurse. I try to keep my patients from getting sick by getting them the treatments they need.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character is a nurse who is trying to prevent patients from getting sick by ensuring they receive the necessary treatments. Nursing is a profession dedicated to caring for others and promoting health. Providing treatments that patients need is a core part of a nurse's responsibility.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, acting in a way that promotes patient health and well-being is not only acceptable but also highly ethical. Nurses are expected to provide competent care and advocate for their patients' best interests.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the nurse is doing what is right and morally acceptable.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Copying someone else's homework is morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: As a nurse, trying to keep patients from getting sick by providing necessary treatments is not morally wrong.\n\nGiven these evaluations, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. In Scenario 1, is there any possibility that copying homework could be acceptable under certain circumstances? For example, if the student is collaborating with permission or if the homework is meant to be done in groups. However, the way the scenario is phrased\u2014\u201cto copy her completed homework\u201d\u2014suggests that it's an individual assignment being copied without permission, which would indeed be cheating.\n\nIn Scenario 2, is there any way that trying to keep patients from getting sick could be considered wrong? For instance, if the treatments are harmful or unnecessary, but the scenario specifies that these are treatments the patients need, so it's safe to assume they are beneficial.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, my initial assessment stands: Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, they are presented as:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, option B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which matches my conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other context that might change this assessment. For example, perhaps in Scenario 1, the person whose homework is being copied consented, but the scenario doesn't indicate that; it just says \"to copy her completed homework,\" which implies cheating without permission.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe there are ethical concerns about over-treating patients, but again, the scenario specifies that these are treatments the patients need, so the nurse is acting in their best interests.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct choice is option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
