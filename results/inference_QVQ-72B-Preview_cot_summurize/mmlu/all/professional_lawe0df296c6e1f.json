                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a university student who's suing her university and the athletic director over the elimination of the women's varsity volleyball team. She thinks the university broke a federal law, and she's filed a lawsuit in federal court in State B, where the university is located. The university is a nonprofit corporation incorporated in State B, and the athletic director is a citizen of State B. Now, the question is about the best method to serve the defendants.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what \"serving the defendants\" means. It's the process of giving official notice to the parties being sued that they're being sued, usually by delivering a copy of the complaint and summons to them. This is important because it ensures they know about the lawsuit and can prepare to respond.\n\nNow, since this is a federal court case, I should look to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) for guidance on service of process. FRCP Rule 4 outlines the rules for serving individuals and organizations.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Service as required by State B's rules of civil procedure.\n\nI know that in federal court, the Federal Rules generally govern procedure, but sometimes state laws can apply. However, for service of process, FRCP Rule 4 specifies how service should be made, and it generally preempts state rules. So, while state rules might be relevant in some circumstances, especially if the federal rules allow for it, generally, in federal court, it's the federal rules that apply. So, this option might not be the best.\n\nB. Service by a process server's leaving copies of the summons and complaint with copies of the summons and complaint with secretaries in the respective offices of the athletic director and the university president.\n\nHmm, this sounds a bit confusing. It seems like there might be a typo here. It says \"leaving copies of the summons and complaint with copies of the summons and complaint with secretaries.\" I think it might mean that the process server leaves copies of the summons and complaint with the secretaries of the athletic director and the university president.\n\nIn FRCP, service on an individual can be made by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to them personally, or to someone of suitable age and discretion at their dwelling or usual place of abode, or to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.\n\nFor an organization like the university, service is typically made on an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or law to receive service.\n\nSo, if the secretaries are agents authorized to receive service, this could be acceptable. However, I need to check if secretaries are generally considered authorized to receive service.\n\nIn many organizations, the secretary might not be the person authorized to receive service. Usually, it's the registered agent, the president, the CEO, or other high-level officials. So, unless the secretary is specifically authorized, this might not be sufficient.\n\nC. Service by emailing copies of the summons and complaint to the athletic director and the university president.\n\nFRCP allows for service by mail, but email is a bit different. While some courts might accept email service in certain circumstances, especially if the party has consented to electronic service, generally, email service isn't explicitly provided for in the rules.\n\nMoreover, for service to be effective, it needs to provide actual notice and be reasonably calculated to apprise the defendant of the action. Email might not be reliable enough, and there could be issues with proving that the email was received or read.\n\nSo, this seems risky and probably not the best method.\n\nD. Service by the student herself on the athletic director and the university president.\n\nIn FRCP, service can be made by any person who is not a party to the action and who is at least 18 years old, unless state law requires that service be made by a particular type of person, like a sheriff or marshal.\n\nHowever, it's generally better practice to have service made by a professional process server or a U.S. Marshal, especially in federal court, to ensure that it's done correctly and to avoid any appearance of bias or impropriety.\n\nHaving the plaintiff serve the defendants herself might raise questions about the validity of the service, and it might not be the most efficient or proper way to handle it.\n\nGiven all this, none of these options seem perfect, but I need to pick the best one.\n\nOption A suggests following State B's rules, but in federal court, it's the FRCP that applies.\n\nOption B involves leaving papers with secretaries, which might not be sufficient unless the secretaries are authorized to receive service.\n\nOption C is email service, which isn't reliable or explicitly allowed in FRCP.\n\nOption D is the plaintiff serving the defendants herself, which might not be the best practice.\n\nI think the best approach here would be to follow the FRCP directly. For an individual like the athletic director, service can be made personally or to someone of suitable age and discretion at their dwelling or usual place of abode. For the university, as a corporation, service can be made on an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or law to receive service.\n\nSo, perhaps the student should hire a process server to serve the athletic director personally or to someone authorized to receive service on his behalf, and similarly, serve the university through its registered agent or an officer.\n\nBut among the given options, the closest one to this would be Option B: service by a process server leaving copies with secretaries.\n\nIf the secretaries are authorized to receive service, this could be acceptable. However, as I mentioned earlier, secretaries might not typically be authorized to receive service unless specifically designated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the process server could serve the athletic director personally or serve the university through its registered agent.\n\nBut since none of these exact methods are listed, and considering the options provided, I think Option B is the most feasible.\n\nOption A is following State B's rules, which might not be applicable in federal court.\n\nOption C is email service, which is unreliable and not standard practice.\n\nOption D is the plaintiff serving herself, which isn't best practice.\n\nTherefore, Option B, having a process server leave copies with the secretaries, seems like the best method among those provided, assuming that the secretaries are authorized to receive service.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if secretaries can receive service.\n\nIn many organizations, the secretary might not be the person authorized to receive service. Typically, it's the registered agent, the president, the CEO, or another high-level official.\n\nSo, if the secretary is not authorized, then this service might be invalid.\n\nGiven that, perhaps this option isn't the best after all.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the university is a public institution, and service on public entities might have specific requirements.\n\nBut the problem states that the university is a nonprofit corporation incorporated in State B, so it's likely a private entity, not a government entity.\n\nWait, but universities can be either public or private. If it's a nonprofit corporation, it's probably private.\n\nIn that case, service should be made on an officer or agent authorized to receive service.\n\nPerhaps the university has a registered agent for service of process.\n\nIn that case, serving the university through its registered agent would be the proper way.\n\nBut again, that's not one of the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, and considering the potential issues with Option B, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the best method is to have the process server serve the athletic director personally and serve the university through its president, assuming the president is authorized to receive service.\n\nBut again, that's not exactly what Option B says.\n\nOption B says the process server leaves copies with the secretaries of the athletic director and the university president.\n\nIf the secretaries are not authorized to receive service, then this might not be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some jurisdictions, leaving papers with an agent at the office is acceptable under FRCP.\n\nLet me check FRCP Rule 4.\n\nRule 4(e)(2) for serving an individual allows for serving them at their dwelling house or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there.\n\nFor serving a corporation, Rule 4(h)(1)(B) allows for serving an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent or employee of the corporation who is of suitable age and discretion and who is reasonably likely to give notice of the service to the corporation's officers or managing or general agents.\n\nSo, if the secretaries are agents of the corporation who are likely to give notice to the officers, then service on them could be acceptable for the university.\n\nHowever, for the athletic director, who is an individual, leaving papers with his secretary might not be sufficient unless the secretary resides with him or is otherwise authorized to receive service.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to have the process server serve the athletic director personally and serve the university through its registered agent or an officer like the president.\n\nBut since that's not one of the options, and considering that Option B involves a process server leaving papers with secretaries, which might be acceptable under certain circumstances, perhaps that's the next best thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the university has specific rules for service, being a nonprofit corporation.\n\nBut again, in federal court, it's the FRCP that applies.\n\nGiven all this, I think Option B is the most feasible among the provided choices, assuming that the secretaries are agents of the defendants and are likely to give notice of the service.\n\nTherefore, I would go with Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
