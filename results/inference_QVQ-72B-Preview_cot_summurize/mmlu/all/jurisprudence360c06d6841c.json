Command, D. Sociological. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these schools of thought believes that law is shaped by logic.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each of these schools stands for. Starting with the Historical School, I think it emphasizes the importance of history and tradition in shaping the law. So, they might argue that laws evolve over time based on customs and past practices. But does this school particularly focus on logic shaping the law? Not really, from what I remember. Maybe logic plays a role in how laws develop, but it's not the primary driving force in this school of thought. So, maybe A. Historical isn't the best choice.\n\nNext, the Analytical School. I believe this school is all about clarifying legal concepts and definitions through logical analysis. They try to understand the structure and logic behind legal rules. So, they might argue that law should be based on clear, logical principles. That sounds promising. If they focus on logical analysis, then perhaps they maintain that law is shaped by logic. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nThen there's the Command School, which I think is associated with legal positivism. It sees law as commands from sovereign authorities that are enforced by the threat of sanctions. So, in this view, law is more about the will of the sovereign and less about logic per se. While there might be some logical consistency in the way commands are structured, the primary focus isn't on logic shaping the law. So, probably not C. Command.\n\nLastly, the Sociological School. This approach views law as a social construct that reflects the needs and values of society. It emphasizes the role of law in society and how it can be used to achieve social goals. So, in this school, law is shaped by social factors, not necessarily by logical principles. Again, while logic might be used in formulating laws, it's not the main driving force here.\n\nGiven all that, it seems like the Analytical School is the one that really\u5f3a\u8c03s the role of logic in shaping law. They focus on logical analysis to understand and define legal concepts. So, I think the answer should be B. Analytical.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any chance that another school also emphasizes logic in a similar way? For example, does the Historical School use logic in their approach, even if history is their main focus? Well, history can be analyzed logically, but I don't think that's the primary focus of the Historical School. Similarly, in the Command School, logic might be used to enforce commands consistently, but again, it's not the central aspect.\n\nAnd in the Sociological School, logic could be used to understand social needs, but the emphasis is more on empirical social facts and less on abstract logical principles. So, no, I don't think those schools put as much emphasis on logic as the Analytical School does.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Analytical. The Analytical School of jurisprudence maintains that the law is shaped by logic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
