                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Moore's definition. The options are:\n\nA. good\n\nB. yellow\n\nC. horse\n\nD. all of the above\n\nAnd the question is, according to Moore, which of these concepts can be defined.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Moore's position is on definitions, especially in the context of philosophy. I recall that G.E. Moore was a British philosopher who made significant contributions to ethics and metaphysics. He was known for his common-sense approach and his emphasis on clarity in definition.\n\nLet me start by considering each option one by one.\n\nStarting with \"good.\" I remember that Moore is famous for his intuitionist ethics, where he argued that \"good\" is a simple, indefinable quality. In his work \"Principia Ethica,\" he introduced the \"open question argument\" to support this view. The idea is that no matter what definition you try to give for \"good,\" it will always be possible to ask whether that definition is really identical to goodness. This suggests that \"good\" cannot be defined in terms of other properties or concepts. So, according to Moore, \"good\" is indefinable.\n\nNext, \"yellow.\" This is a color, and colors are perceptual qualities. Moore was an empiricist and placed a lot of emphasis on sense experience. He believed that our knowledge begins with our senses and that complex ideas are built up from simple sense data. Now, color is something that we perceive directly through our senses. Moore might argue that \"yellow\" is a simple, unanalyzable quality that we just perceive. Similar to \"good,\" it's possible that he would consider \"yellow\" as indefinable because it's a primary quality that can't be broken down further.\n\nThen, \"horse.\" This seems different from the previous two because \"horse\" is a type of animal, a specific kind of being. Moore was interested in metaphysics and the nature of reality. He believed in a common-sense approach to metaphysics, where ordinary language and concepts are taken at face value. Given that, he might accept that \"horse\" can be defined in terms of its properties or characteristics. For example, a horse is a large mammal with hooves, used for riding or pulling loads. Unlike \"good\" or \"yellow,\" which seem to be more abstract or perceptual qualities, \"horse\" refers to a class of objects with shared features that can be defined.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that according to Moore, \"good\" and \"yellow\" are indefinable, while \"horse\" can be defined. Therefore, the correct answer would be C. horse.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's see.\n\nI know that Moore was critical of definitions that tried to capture moral properties like \"good\" in terms of natural properties or other concepts. He thought that \"good\" was a simple, non-natural quality that couldn't be reduced to anything else. So, that reinforces the idea that \"good\" is indefinable.\n\nAs for \"yellow,\" while I haven't found a direct quote from Moore about colors, his general approach suggests that he would consider colors as simple, perceptual qualities that can't be defined in terms of anything else. So, it's likely that he would also consider \"yellow\" as indefinable.\n\nOn the other hand, \"horse\" is a concept that refers to a type of entity in the world, and Moore believed in the importance of clear, empirical definitions for such entities. He would probably agree that \"horse\" can be defined based on its observable characteristics and features.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, \"horse\" is the one that Moore would say can be defined.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. horse.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
