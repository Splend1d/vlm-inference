                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"What percentage of older adults report feeling very or often lonely? And the options are A. 10%, B. 25%, C. 50%, D. 75%. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I don't have any specific data memorized about this, but maybe I can recall some general information or look up something to make an educated guess.\n\nFirst off, I know that loneliness is a significant issue among older adults. As people age, they might experience changes in their social circles, like losing friends or family members, which can lead to feelings of isolation. Also, health issues can sometimes prevent them from being as socially active as they used to be.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that about one in four older adults feels lonely or isolated. Let me see if that rings a bell. Is it one in four? That would be 25%, which is option B. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the exact statistic.\n\nLet me think about another angle. I know that the AARP did a study on social isolation among older adults. Maybe I can recall some findings from that. I think they found that around 17% of older adults experience serious loneliness, but that seems lower than what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing different studies. I should try to verify this. Let me consider that different studies might have different percentages based on the sample size, location, and how they define loneliness.\n\nAnother thing I recall is that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the issue of loneliness in older adults due to lockdowns and social distancing measures. But I don't think that would affect long-term statistics.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the definition of \"older adults.\" In many studies, this refers to people aged 65 and above. So, if I can recall any data specific to that age group, that would be helpful.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are any global or national surveys on this topic. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) might have data on this. I think they've reported that around 25% to 50% of older adults experience social isolation, but that's a wide range.\n\nWait, social isolation and loneliness are related but distinct concepts. Social isolation is about lacking contact with other people, while loneliness is about feeling alone or disconnected, even if you're around others. So, maybe the percentage for feeling lonely is different from the percentage for being socially isolated.\n\nI need to be careful to distinguish between the two. The question specifically asks about feeling lonely, not about being isolated.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific studies or surveys that asked older adults about their feelings of loneliness.\n\nI think there was a study that surveyed older adults in the United States and found that about 22% reported feeling lonely at least some of the time. That's closer to option B, 25%.\n\nAlso, I recall that in some European countries, the percentage is around 20% to 40%, but again, that's a broad range.\n\nMaybe I should consider averaging the percentages I've heard. If one study says 22%, another says 17%, and another says around 25%, then the average would be roughly 21.33%. That's closest to option B, 25%.\n\nAdditionally, I remember that the MacArthur Foundation's Successful Aging study found that about 25% of older adults reported feeling lonely on a regular basis.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B, 25%, is the most accurate answer based on the information I can recall.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A, 10%, seems too low. While some studies might report lower percentages, especially in communities with strong social support, the general consensus seems to be higher.\n\nOption C, 50%, seems too high. While social isolation affects a significant portion of older adults, I don't think the percentage reporting frequent loneliness reaches half of all older adults.\n\nOption D, 75%, also seems excessive. That would mean three-quarters of older adults feel very or often lonely, which doesn't align with what I've read.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option B, 25%, is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my memory. I recall that the AARP Foundation and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging reported in 2018 that about 27% of older adults live alone, which could correlate with feelings of loneliness, but living alone doesn't necessarily equate to feeling lonely.\n\nMoreover, a 2020 report from the National Institute on Aging mentioned that approximately 25% of older adults experience loneliness.\n\nGiven these pieces of information, I believe 25% is the most accurate percentage among the given options.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
