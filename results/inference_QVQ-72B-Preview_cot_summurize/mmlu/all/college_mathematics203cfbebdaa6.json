                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"A discrete graph is complete if there is an edge connecting any pair of vertices. How many edges does a complete graph with 10 vertices have?\" And the options are A. 10, B. 20, C. 25, and D. 45.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what a complete graph is. From the definition, a complete graph is one where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. So, basically, in a graph with 10 vertices, there should be an edge between every possible pair of these vertices.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many such edges there are in total. Hmm, this sounds like a combination problem. In other words, the number of edges should be equal to the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 10 to form an edge.\n\nI remember that the number of ways to choose 2 items out of 10 is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 10 and k is 2.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10 - 2)!) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 8!) = (10 \u00d7 9) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45.\n\nOkay, so there are 45 edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices. Let me just double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider that each vertex connects to every other vertex. So, for each of the 10 vertices, there are 9 edges coming out, one to each of the other vertices. So, total edges would be 10 \u00d7 9 = 90. But wait, this counts each edge twice because each edge connects two vertices. Therefore, to get the correct number of edges, I need to divide this by 2. So, 90 / 2 = 45 again.\n\nYeah, that matches my previous calculation. So, it seems the answer is 45, which corresponds to option D.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using graph theory formulas. I recall that for a complete graph with n vertices, the number of edges is equal to the binomial coefficient C(n, 2), which is exactly what I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph is n(n - 1)/2. Plugging in n = 10, we get 10 \u00d7 9 / 2 = 45. So, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider a smaller case. For example, a complete graph with 3 vertices (a triangle) has 3 edges, which is 3(3 - 1)/2 = 3 \u00d7 2 / 2 = 3. So, that checks out.\n\nAnother example: a complete graph with 4 vertices would have 6 edges, since 4 \u00d7 3 / 2 = 6. That makes sense too.\n\nSo, applying the same formula to n = 10 gives 45 edges, which matches option D.\n\nI don't think there's any other method that would give a different answer here, because the definition of a complete graph is very straightforward in terms of edge count.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
