Hmm, I need to remember what a rhombus is and how many sides it has.\n\nFirst off, I know that a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral. Quadrilaterals have four sides, right? So, options B, C, and D are all more than four sides, which means they might be other shapes, but not a rhombus. Let me double-check that.\n\nA rhombus is a polygon with four sides, where all sides are of equal length. So, it's a quadrilateral with four equal sides. That means it should have four sides in total. So, option A. 4 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any trick here. Is there a possibility that a rhombus could have more or fewer sides under certain conditions? No, I don't think so. By definition, a rhombus is a quadrilateral, which always has four sides.\n\nLet me think about another angle. In geometry, shapes are defined by their properties. For example, a square is a type of rhombus because it has four equal sides, but it also has four right angles. Similarly, a rhombus doesn't necessarily have right angles, but it still has four sides.\n\nMaybe I should visualize it. If I draw a rhombus, it looks like a diamond shape, with all sides the same length. Counting the sides: one, two, three, four. Yep, definitely four sides.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recall that in Euclidean geometry, the number of sides of a polygon corresponds to its name. For instance, triangle has three sides, quadrilateral has four, pentagon has five, and so on. Since a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral, it must have four sides.\n\nI should also consider the properties of a rhombus to make sure there's no confusion. Properties of a rhombus include:\n\n- All sides are equal in length.\n\n- Opposite angles are equal.\n\n- The diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\n- The diagonals bisect the vertex angles.\n\nNone of these properties suggest anything about the number of sides changing or being different from four.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can look up the definition of a rhombus. According to standard geometric definitions, a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. So, again, confirming that it has four sides.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each time, I arrive at the conclusion that a rhombus has four sides. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 4.\n\nWait, just to be extra sure, I can think about the formula for the perimeter of a rhombus. Since all sides are equal, the perimeter is just four times the length of one side. That again reinforces that there are four sides.\n\nAlso, considering the internal structure, a rhombus can be divided into two congruent triangles by one of its diagonals. Each triangle has three sides, but that doesn't change the fact that the entire shape has four sides.\n\nAnother consideration could be the number of vertices a rhombus has. It has four vertices, each forming an angle, which aligns with it being a quadrilateral and having four sides.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possible ways to confirm that a rhombus has four sides. So, I'm confident that the answer is A. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. 4} \\]"
