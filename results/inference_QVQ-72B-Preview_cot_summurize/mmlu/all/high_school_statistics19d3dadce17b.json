                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about fuses from two different companies. Company I makes fuses that burn an average of 50 minutes with a standard deviation of 10 minutes, and Company II advertises theirs burn an average of 55 minutes with a standard deviation of 5 minutes. The question is, which company's fuse is more likely to last at least 1 hour? And there are some options given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have two normal distributions for the burn times of the fuses from these two companies. I need to find the probability that a randomly selected fuse from each company will last at least 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, I need to find P(X > 60) for both distributions and see which one has a higher probability.\n\nFor Company I, the mean (\u03bc) is 50 minutes and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 10 minutes.\n\nFor Company II, the mean is 55 minutes and the standard deviation is 5 minutes.\n\nI remember that in a normal distribution, the probability density function is symmetric around the mean, and the standard deviation tells me how spread out the values are.\n\nSince both distributions are normal, I can use z-scores to standardize the values and find the probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the z-score for 60 minutes for each company.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nFor Company I:\n\nz1 = (60 - 50) / 10 = 10 / 10 = 1\n\nFor Company II:\n\nz2 = (60 - 55) / 5 = 5 / 5 = 1\n\nSo both companies have a z-score of 1 for 60 minutes.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that X > 60, which is P(Z > 1), where Z is the standard normal variable.\n\nI recall that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution gives P(Z < z), so P(Z > z) = 1 - P(Z < z).\n\nFrom standard normal tables, P(Z < 1) is approximately 0.8413.\n\nTherefore, P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\nSo for both companies, P(X > 60) \u2248 0.1587, which is about 0.159.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Company I's, because of its greater standard deviation\n\nB. Company II's, because of its greater mean\n\nC. For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is 0.159\n\nD. For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is 0.841\n\nBased on my calculations, option C seems correct because both companies have approximately the same probability of 0.159 that a fuse will last at least 1 hour.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check if the z-scores are indeed the same for both companies. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nFor Company I:\n\nz1 = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n\nFor Company II:\n\nz2 = (60 - 55) / 5 = 1\n\nYes, that seems correct. Both have a z-score of 1.\n\nBut hold on, is there any possibility that the standard deviation could affect the probability differently? I mean, Company I has a larger standard deviation, which means its distribution is more spread out, so maybe the probability isn't exactly the same.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nIn Company I, with a mean of 50 minutes and SD of 10 minutes, a fuse lasting 60 minutes is one standard deviation above the mean. Similarly, in Company II, with a mean of 55 minutes and SD of 5 minutes, 60 minutes is also one standard deviation above the mean.\n\nSince both are normally distributed, the probability of exceeding one standard deviation above the mean should be the same for both, which is P(Z > 1) \u2248 0.1587 or 0.159.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because the standard deviations are different. Maybe I should calculate the exact probabilities using the normal distribution tables or a calculator.\n\nLet me try calculating P(X > 60) for both companies separately.\n\nFirst, for Company I:\n\nMean (\u03bc1) = 50 minutes\n\nStandard deviation (\u03c31) = 10 minutes\n\nWe already have z1 = 1\n\nP(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z < 1) \u2248 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\nSo P(X1 > 60) \u2248 0.1587\n\nFor Company II:\n\nMean (\u03bc2) = 55 minutes\n\nStandard deviation (\u03c32) = 5 minutes\n\nz2 = (60 - 55)/5 = 1\n\nP(Z > 1) = 0.1587\n\nSo P(X2 > 60) \u2248 0.1587\n\nWait, but this seems too straightforward. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nLet me consider if the standard deviations being different could lead to different probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formulas.\n\nI know that for a normal distribution, P(X > x) = 1 - \u03a6((x - \u03bc)/\u03c3), where \u03a6 is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.\n\nGiven that, for both companies, (x - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = 1, so P(X > 60) = 1 - \u03a6(1) \u2248 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\nSo indeed, both companies have the same probability of approximately 0.159.\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nOption A says Company I's because of its greater standard deviation. But actually, the probability is the same for both, so this is incorrect.\n\nOption B says Company II's because of its greater mean. Again, the probability is the same for both, so this is also incorrect.\n\nOption C says for both companies, the probability is 0.159, which matches my calculations.\n\nOption D says for both companies, the probability is 0.841, which is P(Z < 1), not P(Z > 1), so that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\nSuppose the distributions aren't exactly normal, but the problem states they are, so I can assume they are normal.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the sample size affects this, but since we're dealing with population parameters (mean and SD), sample size isn't relevant here.\n\nAlso, perhaps I should use the exact values instead of approximations.\n\nUsing the standard normal table, P(Z < 1) is approximately 0.8413, so P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587, which rounds to 0.159.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator or software to find the exact value, but for the purpose of this problem, the approximation should be sufficient.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option C is correct: for both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is 0.159.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
