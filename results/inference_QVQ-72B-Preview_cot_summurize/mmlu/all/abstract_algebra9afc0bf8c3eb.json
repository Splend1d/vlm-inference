                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these two statements about group homomorphisms. The first one says that the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic, and the second one says that the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian. I need to determine whether both are true, both are false, or if one is true and the other is false.\n\nLet me start by recalling what a homomorphic image is. A homomorphism between two groups is a function that preserves the group operation. The homomorphic image of a group under such a function is the image of that group in the codomain.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement 1: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.\n\nA cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element. So, if G is a cyclic group generated by 'g', then G = {g^n | n \u2208 Z}. Now, if \u03c6 is a homomorphism from G to H, then the image of G under \u03c6 is \u03c6(G) = {\u03c6(g^n) | n \u2208 Z}.\n\nSince \u03c6 is a homomorphism, \u03c6(g^n) = \u03c6(g)^n. Therefore, \u03c6(G) = {\u03c6(g)^n | n \u2208 Z}, which means the image is generated by \u03c6(g). So, the image is cyclic. Wait, that seems straightforward. But is there any case where this might not hold?\n\nLet me think about it. If \u03c6 is not injective, then some elements might map to the same element in H, but even then, the image is still cyclic because it's generated by \u03c6(g). Unless \u03c6(g) is the identity element, but even then, the image is the trivial cyclic group.\n\nSo, it seems like the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is indeed cyclic. That would make statement 1 true.\n\nNow, moving on to statement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\n\nAn Abelian group is one in which the group operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements a and b in the group, a * b = b * a.\n\nIf \u03c6 is a homomorphism from G to H, and G is Abelian, then for any a, b in G, \u03c6(a * b) = \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(b), and since G is Abelian, \u03c6(b * a) = \u03c6(b) * \u03c6(a). But \u03c6(a * b) = \u03c6(b * a), so \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(b) = \u03c6(b) * \u03c6(a). This shows that the image is Abelian.\n\nWait, is that always true? Let me see. Suppose G is Abelian, and \u03c6: G \u2192 H is a homomorphism. Then, for any \u03c6(a), \u03c6(b) in the image, \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(b) = \u03c6(a * b) = \u03c6(b * a) = \u03c6(b) * \u03c6(a). So, the image is Abelian.\n\nI can't think of any counterexample where G is Abelian, \u03c6 is a homomorphism, but the image is not Abelian. It seems like the commutativity is preserved under homomorphisms.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any exceptions or special cases that might make one of these statements false.\n\nFor statement 1, suppose G is cyclic, say G = <g>, and \u03c6: G \u2192 H is a homomorphism. If \u03c6(g) has finite order, then \u03c6(G) is cyclic of that order. If \u03c6(g) is of infinite order, then \u03c6(G) is isomorphic to the integers, which is also cyclic. So, no matter what, the image is cyclic.\n\nFor statement 2, if G is Abelian, and \u03c6: G \u2192 H is a homomorphism, then for any \u03c6(a), \u03c6(b) in \u03c6(G), \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(b) = \u03c6(a * b) = \u03c6(b * a) = \u03c6(b) * \u03c6(a), so the image is Abelian.\n\nI really can't find any way for these statements to be false. So, my conclusion is that both statements are true.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
