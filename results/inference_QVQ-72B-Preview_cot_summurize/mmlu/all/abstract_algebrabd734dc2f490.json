                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements, and I need to determine whether each one is true or false. Let's tackle them one at a time.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.\"\n\nOkay, so first off, I know that abelian groups are commutative, meaning that for any two elements a and b in the group, a * b = b * a. The order of the group is 45, and we're looking for a subgroup of order 10.\n\nI recall that by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. So, for a group of order 45, possible subgroup orders are divisors of 45. Let's list the divisors of 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45.\n\nNow, 10 is not a divisor of 45. So, according to Lagrange's theorem, there shouldn't be any subgroup of order 10 in a group of order 45.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's an exception or something I'm missing. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nI know that for finite groups, Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. So, if a group has order 45, subgroups can have orders 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, or 45. Since 10 does not divide 45, there shouldn't be any subgroup of order 10.\n\nMoreover, in abelian groups, subgroups are easier to handle because of the commutativity. But even in non-abelian groups, Lagrange's theorem still holds.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Statement 1 is false.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider the structure of an abelian group of order 45. The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5. So, possible abelian groups of order 45 include:\n\n- Z_45\n\n- Z_15 \u00d7 Z_3\n\n- Z_9 \u00d7 Z_5\n\n- Z_3 \u00d7 Z_3 \u00d7 Z_5\n\nIn any of these, by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, the orders of subgroups must divide the order of the group. Again, 10 doesn't divide 45, so no subgroup of order 10 should exist.\n\nJust to double-check, suppose there was a subgroup of order 10 in a group of order 45. That would mean that there are elements in this subgroup whose orders are factors of 10, namely 1, 2, 5, and 10. But in a group of order 45, the possible orders of elements are divisors of 45, which are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. There's no way to have an element of order 2 or 10 in such a group, because 2 and 10 don't divide 45.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for an abelian group of order 45 to have a subgroup of order 10. So, Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\"\n\nAlright, so normal subgroups are subgroups that are invariant under conjugation by elements of the group. In other words, for a subgroup H of G to be normal, it must satisfy gH = Hg for all g in G.\n\nThe number of left cosets of H in G is given by the index of H in G, which is [G : H] = |G| / |H|, provided G is finite. Similarly, the number of right cosets is also [G : H].\n\nSo, in terms of the number of cosets, the number of left cosets is always equal to the number of right cosets, because both are equal to [G : H].\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. So, the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets, but that's true for any subgroup, not just normal ones. So, having the same number of left and right cosets doesn't imply that H is normal.\n\nIn fact, normality of H in G is about the equality of left and right cosets for each g in G, i.e., gH = Hg for all g in G. It's not about the number of cosets, but about the equality of each individual coset.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to be suggesting that equality of the number of left and right cosets implies normality, but as we've seen, the number of left and right cosets is always equal, regardless of whether H is normal or not.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is false.\n\nBut let me double-check this understanding. Suppose G is any group, and H is any subgroup. Then, the set of left cosets is G/H, and the set of right cosets is G\\H. The index [G : H] is the number of left cosets, and it equals the number of right cosets.\n\nSo, [G : H] = [G : H], always.\n\nTherefore, saying that the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets doesn't tell us anything new, because it's always true for any subgroup.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different interpretation. Perhaps in some contexts, the number of distinct left cosets and right cosets could differ, but in general, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem or other group theory results, the index is well-defined and equal for left and right cosets.\n\nActually, no, in any group, the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets, as both are equal to the index [G : H].\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, both statements are false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be B. False, False.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that Statement 1 could be true.\n\nSuppose there exists some abelian group of order 45 that somehow has a subgroup of order 10. As we've seen, this would violate Lagrange's theorem, which is a fundamental result in group theory. I can't think of any exception or special case where this would hold.\n\nSimilarly, for Statement 2, the number of left and right cosets is always equal, so the statement is incorrect in suggesting that this equality defines normal subgroups.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that both statements are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
