                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Monte Alb\u00e1n is located in the ________ and was built by the _________.\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Valley of Mexico; Aztec.\n\nB. Valley of Oaxaca; Zapotec.\n\nC. Amazon floodplain; Olmec.\n\nD. Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula; Maya.\n\nAlright, I need to figure out where Monte Alb\u00e1n is and who built it. I'm not super familiar with Mesoamerican civilizations, but I think I can work this out.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Valley of Mexico is where the Aztecs built Tenochtitl\u00e1n, which is now Mexico City. So, if Monte Alb\u00e1n was built by the Aztecs, it would probably be in the Valley of Mexico. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption B is the Valley of Oaxaca and the Zapotec. I've heard of Oaxaca; it's in southern Mexico, right? And the Zapotec were an ancient civilization known for their architecture and culture. Maybe they built Monte Alb\u00e1n.\n\nThen there's option C: the Amazon floodplain and the Olmec. The Olmec are often referred to as the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica, and they were based in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico. The Amazon floodplain is in South America, though, so that seems geographically off.\n\nOption D is the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and the Maya. The Maya had many great cities there, like Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Uxmal. But I don't recall Monte Alb\u00e1n being a Mayan site.\n\nLet me think about this. I think Monte Alb\u00e1n is in Oaxaca, which would make option B correct. But I should double-check.\n\nI remember that Oaxaca is in southern Mexico, and the Zapotec civilization flourished there from around 500 BCE to 700 CE. Monte Alb\u00e1n was one of their major cities, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nLet me consider the other options again to make sure.\n\nThe Valley of Mexico is further north, and the Aztecs rose to power in the 14th century, long after Monte Alb\u00e1n was established. So, it's unlikely that the Aztecs built Monte Alb\u00e1n.\n\nThe Amazon floodplain is in South America, and the Olmec were in southeastern Mexico and northeastern Guatemala. Plus, the Olmec were earlier, from about 1500 BCE to 400 BCE, and Monte Alb\u00e1n was built later.\n\nThe Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is where the Maya had their classic period from about 250 CE to 900 CE, and again, Monte Alb\u00e1n is associated with the Zapotec in Oaxaca.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Monte Alb\u00e1n is located in the Valley of Oaxaca and was built by the Zapotec civilization.\n\nWait a minute, option A says \"Valley of Mexico; Aztec,\" but that doesn't align with what I know about Monte Alb\u00e1n. Similarly, option C has \"Amazon floodplain; Olmec,\" which is geographically incorrect, and option D is \"Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula; Maya,\" which doesn't match Monte Alb\u00e1n's location.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: Valley of Oaxaca; Zapotec.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll recall that Monte Alb\u00e1n was a large pre-Columbian archaeological site, situated in the Santa Cruz Xoxocotl\u00e1n municipality in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. It was a significant center of the Zapotec civilization.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Valley of Oaxaca; Zapotec.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
