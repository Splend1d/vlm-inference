                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Brandt's terminology regarding a moral code having currency in a society. The options are:\n\nA. A high proportion of the adults in the society subscribe to its principles.\n\nB. It is recognized as the moral code of the society.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n\nI need to figure out what Brandt would consider necessary for a moral code to have currency in a society.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"currency\" means in this context. Currency usually refers to something that is in general use or circulation, like money. So, in this sense, a moral code with currency in a society is one that is widely accepted or used by that society.\n\nNow, option A says that a high proportion of adults subscribe to its principles. That sounds like a lot of people agree with and follow these moral principles. If many adults believe in and follow a particular moral code, it seems logical that this code has currency in the society because it's being practiced and valued by a significant portion of the adult population.\n\nOption B states that it is recognized as the moral code of the society. This seems related to the idea that the society as a whole acknowledges this moral code as their standard or official set of morals. Recognition implies that it's accepted and perhaps even endorsed by institutions or the general consensus of the society.\n\nNow, both A and B seem relevant. If many people subscribe to it (A), and it's recognized by the society (B), then certainly it has currency. But is one of them more necessary than the other, or do they both need to be present?\n\nLet me think about this. If a moral code is recognized by the society but not many people actually follow it, does it still have currency? For example, maybe there's a official set of morals, but in practice, people don't live by them. In that case, it might not have real currency because it's not being used or followed by the majority.\n\nOn the other hand, if a high proportion of adults subscribe to a moral code, but it's not officially recognized, does it still have currency? Maybe. If people are living by it and it influences their behavior, then in a practical sense, it has currency. But perhaps recognition by the society adds a formal or official status to it.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, practical adherence seems crucial for a moral code to have currency. On the other hand, recognition might give it additional weight or importance in the society.\n\nLet me consider another angle. In philosophy, especially in ethics, there are discussions about whether moral codes derive their authority from social consensus or from some other source. If we're talking about currency in a society, perhaps social consensus is key.\n\nIf that's the case, then recognition as the moral code of the society might be more central. But I still think that recognition without subscription might be hollow. For example, if everyone agrees that this is our moral code but doesn't actually follow it, is it really currency in any meaningful way?\n\nMaybe both aspects are important. Subscription ensures that it's actually being followed, and recognition ensures that it's acknowledged as the standard.\n\nBut then, could a moral code have currency without being recognized officially? For example, in a society where there are multiple moral codes followed by different groups, none of which are officially recognized, but one is followed by a large majority. Would that majority's moral code have currency?\n\nPerhaps, in that sense, option A is sufficient. But option C suggests both A and B, which might be overkill if A alone is enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe recognition is necessary to establish it as the moral code of the society, and subscription is a consequence of that recognition. In that case, B might be seen as preceding A.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look at this differently. Maybe recognition is about acknowledgment, and subscription is about adherence. For a moral code to have currency, it needs both to be acknowledged and adhered to.\n\nBut does currency require adherence? If something is in circulation, like money, people use it for transactions. Similarly, a moral code in currency would be used for making moral decisions and judgments.\n\nSo, perhaps adherence is more important than just recognition.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose in a society, there's a moral code that says \"treat others with respect.\" If this code is recognized by the society as their moral code, but only a small proportion of adults actually treat others with respect, does this code have currency?\n\nIt seems not, because it's not being used or followed in practice. On the other hand, if a high proportion of adults treat others with respect because they believe in this moral code, even if it's not officially recognized as the society's moral code, does it have currency?\n\nIn this case, it might still have currency because it's being practiced widely.\n\nTherefore, perhaps subscription is more crucial for currency than recognition.\n\nBut the question is phrased in Brandt's terminology. I should recall who Brandt is. R.B. Brandt was a philosopher known for his work in ethical theory, particularly in moral particularism and act utilitarianism.\n\nA quick search in my notes: Brandt was an American philosopher who worked on ethical particularism, suggesting that moral judgments are context-dependent and that there are no universal moral principles.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in Brandt's view, the moral code of a society is not based on universal principles but on the particular practices and beliefs of that society.\n\nIn that case, maybe recognition and subscription both play a role.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Brandt would emphasize the practical aspect, meaning that subscription is more important than recognition.\n\nI need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me consider another perspective. In philosophy, there's a concept called \"folk morality,\" which refers to the moral beliefs and practices of a particular culture or society.\n\nIn that context, for a moral code to have currency in a society, it would need to be part of the folk morality, which involves both recognition and subscription.\n\nSo, in that sense, both A and B would be necessary.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should look at it in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nIs subscription (A) necessary and sufficient for a moral code to have currency?\n\nIf most adults subscribe to it, does that make it the moral code of the society? Not necessarily, because there might be multiple moral codes followed by different groups.\n\nIs recognition (B) necessary and sufficient? If the society recognizes it as their moral code, but few subscribe to it, does it have currency? Probably not.\n\nTherefore, perhaps both A and B are necessary.\n\nBut maybe recognition follows from subscription. If most adults subscribe to a moral code, then naturally, it would be recognized as the society's moral code.\n\nIn that case, A might be sufficient to imply B.\n\nHowever, it's possible to have a society where multiple moral codes exist, and one is recognized as the official one, but not subscribed to by most.\n\nFor example, in some countries, there might be an official moral code enforced by law, but in practice, people follow their own moral codes.\n\nIn such a case, recognition without subscription might not grant currency to the moral code.\n\nAlternatively, in a society where there is no single recognized moral code, but one moral code is followed by most people, that moral code has currency by virtue of widespread subscription.\n\nTherefore, subscription seems more fundamental.\n\nBut I feel like I'm going in circles.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the question.\n\n\"In Brandt's terminology, a moral code has currency in a society only if:\"\n\nOptions:\n\nA. A high proportion of the adults in the society subscribe to its principles.\n\nB. It is recognized as the moral code of the society.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n\nThe key word here is \"only if,\" which implies a necessary condition.\n\nSo, for a moral code to have currency in a society, it must be the case that...\n\nOption A suggests that it must be subscribed to by a high proportion of adults.\n\nOption B suggests that it must be recognized as the society's moral code.\n\nPerhaps both are necessary conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one is sufficient.\n\nWait, the question says \"only if,\" which is about necessity, not sufficiency.\n\nSo, I need to identify which of these is necessary for the moral code to have currency.\n\nLet me consider that recognition might be a necessary condition because for a moral code to have currency, it needs to be acknowledged by the society as their moral code.\n\nBut then, what if it's recognized but not subscribed to? Would it still have currency? Probably not, because it's not being used or followed.\n\nTherefore, subscription seems also necessary.\n\nHence, option C: both A and B.\n\nBut maybe recognition is a consequence of subscription. If most adults subscribe to a moral code, then naturally, it would be recognized as the society's moral code.\n\nIn that case, subscription might be sufficient to imply recognition.\n\nBut is that always the case? Suppose there's a society where multiple moral codes coexist, and one is followed by a high proportion, but another is officially recognized.\n\nIn that scenario, the officially recognized one might not be the one with widespread subscription.\n\nSo, perhaps both A and B are necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe recognition is more about official status, while subscription is about practical adherence.\n\nIn that case, for a moral code to have currency, both aspects are important: it needs to be followed (subscription) and acknowledged (recognition).\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C: both A and B.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident.\n\nLet me check some philosophical sources to see what Brandt might have meant by \"currency\" in this context.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Brandt discussed moral codes in his work on particularism, suggesting that moral judgments are context-dependent and that there are no universal moral principles applicable to all situations.\n\nIn that framework, moral codes would vary from society to society, based on their particular circumstances and values.\n\nGiven that, for a moral code to have currency in a society, it would need to be reflective of the society's values and practices, which aligns with subscription (option A).\n\nRecognition (option B) might be more about the formal acknowledgment, perhaps by institutions or leaders, that this is the society's moral code.\n\nIn Brandt's view, which emphasizes the particularity of moral codes, perhaps subscription is more fundamental, as it reflects the actual moral practices and beliefs of the society.\n\nTherefore, option A might be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both subscription and recognition are important because the society needs to both follow and acknowledge the moral code for it to have currency.\n\nBut I'm still leaning towards option C.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased in Brandt's terminology, and I need to consider his specific views.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a specific reference or quote from Brandt that defines \"currency\" in this context.\n\nUnfortunately, without that specific reference, it's challenging to be precise.\n\nHowever, based on general philosophical understanding, I would conclude that for a moral code to have currency in a society, it needs both to be subscribed to by a high proportion of adults and to be recognized as the society's moral code.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
