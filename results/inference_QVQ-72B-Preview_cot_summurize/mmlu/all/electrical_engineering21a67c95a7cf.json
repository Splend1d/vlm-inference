                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the followings is/are active element? A. Voltage source B. Current source C. Both D. None of these.\" Okay, I need to figure out what an active element is and whether a voltage source and a current source qualify as active elements.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what an active element is in the context of circuits. From what I recall, in circuit theory, elements are classified into active and passive elements. Active elements are those that can supply energy to the circuit, meaning they can provide power. Passive elements, on the other hand, can only store or dissipate energy; they cannot supply energy on their own.\n\nSo, considering that, let's think about voltage sources and current sources. A voltage source is something that maintains a constant voltage across its terminals, regardless of the current flowing through it. A classic example is a battery, which provides a constant voltage and can source or sink current depending on the circuit configuration.\n\nSimilarly, a current source maintains a constant current through it, regardless of the voltage across its terminals. An example of this might be a photodiode in reverse bias, which can provide a constant current that's dependent on the light intensity.\n\nNow, both of these sources can supply energy to the circuit. A voltage source can push current through other components, and a current source can force a certain current regardless of the voltage. So, both seem to be able to provide energy to the circuit.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard somewhere that ideal current sources don't actually supply any power because they don't have a voltage across them. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, in real circuits, current sources do have a voltage across them, and they can indeed supply power. Ideal current sources are theoretical constructs, and in practical implementations, they do have some internal resistance or other imperfections that allow them to supply power.\n\nSo, in reality, both voltage and current sources can be considered active elements because they can provide energy to the circuit.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective. In some contexts, perhaps current sources are considered passive, but I don't think that's generally the case.\n\nLet me consider the definition again. Active elements can supply energy to the circuit, while passive elements cannot. Voltage sources and current sources both can supply energy, so they should be considered active.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider whether the element can generate power or not. Active elements can generate power, whereas passive elements can only absorb or store power.\n\nSo, again, voltage and current sources can generate power, making them active elements.\n\nI think the answer is C. Both.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider some examples. Take a simple circuit with a voltage source and a resistor. The voltage source supplies energy to the resistor, which dissipates it as heat. In this case, the voltage source is clearly an active element.\n\nNow, consider a circuit with a current source and a resistor. The current source forces a certain current through the resistor, which again dissipates energy as heat. The current source is supplying the energy, so it's also an active element.\n\nAnother example: in electronic circuits, op-amps can be configured as voltage sources or current sources and they definitely supply power to the loads.\n\nMoreover, in power electronics, current sources are used in inverters and converters to control power flow, further reinforcing their role as active elements.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, both voltage sources and current sources are active elements.\n\nWait, but in some literature, there might be a distinction between independent and dependent sources. Independent sources, like voltage and current sources, are always active, whereas dependent sources can be active or passive depending on the context.\n\nBut in this question, we're dealing with voltage and current sources, which are independent sources, and they are always considered active elements.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Both.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
