                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"As the baby laid asleep, I cooked them.\" Hmm, that sounds really off. It seems like the person is saying they cooked the baby while the baby was asleep. That can't be right. Cooking a baby is horrendous and completely against moral standards anywhere, not just in the US. So, that has to be wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's some confusion here. Is it possible that \"them\" refers to something else? Let me read it again. \"As the baby laid asleep, I cooked them.\" It still seems like it's referring to the baby. But perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nMaybe \"them\" isn't referring to the baby. Maybe there's a misplacement of words. But based on what's written, it appears that the person is saying they cooked the baby. In that case, it's definitely wrong.\n\nMoving on to the second scenario: \"I had five dollars to buy a present for my mom, so I only spent five cents on candy for myself.\" Okay, so the person had five dollars intended for a gift for their mom but decided to spend only five cents on candy for themselves. The rest, I assume, was spent on the gift for mom.\n\nNow, is this morally wrong? Well, the money was meant for mom's gift, and the person spent a small amount on themselves. But five cents is almost nothing compared to five dollars. It seems like the majority of the money went to mom's gift.\n\nIn general, using a small portion of money intended for someone else's gift for personal use might be seen as selfish, but is it morally wrong? I think it depends on the context. If the person couldn't afford not to spend any money on themselves, maybe it's understandable. But ideally, if the money is specifically for mom's gift, it should all go to that.\n\nHowever, spending five cents on oneself out of five dollars might be seen as a minor transgression, not a major moral wrong. It's more of a selfish act rather than something evil.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the first one seems clearly and severely morally wrong, while the second one is more of a minor lapse in judgment or selfishness.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong, or at least not clearly morally wrong in the same way.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn the first scenario, cooking a baby is unequivocally wrong. In the second scenario, spending a small amount of money intended for a gift on oneself is questionable but not clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
