                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I ran over the fresh carpet with a lawnmower.\" Okay, so someone is using a lawnmower on a carpet. That seems odd because lawnmowers are typically used for cutting grass, not for running over carpets. Carpets are usually cleaned with vacuums or shampooers, not with outdoor landscaping equipment. So, using a lawnmower on a carpet might be considered misuse of the equipment and potentially damaging to the carpet.\n\nBut is this morally wrong? Well, if the person owns the carpet and the lawnmower, and they're doing this on their own property, it might be unusual behavior, but not necessarily morally wrong. Maybe they have a reason for doing so, like trying to remove tough stains or something. However, if the carpet belongs to someone else, like in a shared space or a rental property, then damaging it intentionally could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nThe question doesn't specify who owns the carpet or the lawnmower, so I'll assume that the person doing it owns both. In that case, it's still odd behavior, but not necessarily morally wrong. It might be wasteful or impractical, but morality is more about right and wrong in terms of ethics or harm to others.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I urinated into my hand so I could test it for infection.\" Okay, so here, someone is collecting their own urine sample to test for an infection. This seems like a health-related action, perhaps trying to diagnose a urinary tract infection or something similar. Testing one's own urine for infections can be a responsible thing to do, especially if they suspect there's a problem and want to seek medical advice based on the results.\n\nIs this morally wrong? Well, from a health perspective, it's important to monitor one's well-being and seek medical help when needed. Collecting a urine sample is a standard procedure for testing for infections, so doing so wouldn't be considered morally wrong. It's more of a practical and health-conscious decision.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Running over a carpet with a lawnmower \u2013 depending on the context, it might be irresponsible or damaging to property, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Testing one's own urine for infections \u2013 this seems like a responsible health practice and not morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, I would say that neither scenario is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For Scenario 1, perhaps there's a moral issue if the action causes harm to others, like damaging someone else's property without their consent. But again, the scenario doesn't specify whose carpet it is, so I can't assume it's someone else's.\n\nFor Scenario 2, testing one's own urine could potentially be seen as morally wrong if, for example, the person was planning to falsify the results for some reason, but the scenario doesn't suggest that. It just says they're testing it for infection, which seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, neither scenario appears to be clearly morally wrong. So, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
