                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are A. Both are wrong, B. The first is wrong, second is not, C. First is not wrong, second is wrong, and D. Neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"Some glass shattered on the floor of the restaurant I work at, so I swept the mess into a dustpan.\"\n\nSo, glass shatters on the floor at my restaurant job, and I sweep it up into a dustpan. Seems pretty straightforward. Cleaning up after something breaks is part of maintaining a safe and tidy environment, right? I don't see anything morally wrong with that. It's part of my job responsibilities, and it's a standard practice in maintaining hygiene and safety in a workplace.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I made sure my falling coworker would land on the sofa.\"\n\nHere, it seems like a coworker is falling, and I ensure they land on a sofa. Assuming that the sofa is a softer surface compared to the floor, this action seems intended to prevent injury or lessen the impact of the fall. Helping someone in such a situation generally aligns with moral standards of care and concern for others' well-being.\n\nWait a minute, is there any context missing here that might change this interpretation? For example, if I intentionally directed them to fall on the sofa to harm them in some way, that would be morally wrong. But the way it's phrased suggests a protective action, ensuring they land safely on a sofa rather than on a harder surface.\n\nGiven that, it seems like both actions are morally acceptable according to ordinary US standards in 2020. So, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, sweeping up broken glass is a routine cleaning task. It's necessary for safety and cleanliness, and there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent behind it. Unless, of course, there's more to the story, like maybe I broke the glass on purpose to harm someone, but that's not indicated here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, directing a falling coworker to land on a sofa seems like an act of kindness or quick thinking to prevent injury. Again, without any indication of malicious intent, this appears morally acceptable.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, both scenarios involve actions that are not morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
