                    "text": "So I'm here trying to figure out these two statements about group homomorphisms. I'm not super confident with group theory yet, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst statement: \"For any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism of G into G'.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So, groups are these algebraic structures with a set and an operation that satisfies certain properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. A homomorphism between two groups is a function that preserves the group operation. So, if f is a homomorphism from G to G', then f(g1 * g2) = f(g1) *' f(g2), where * is the operation in G and *' is the operation in G'.\n\nNow, the statement says that for any two groups, there exists a homomorphism from one to the other. I need to think about whether this is always true.\n\nLet me consider some examples. Take the group of integers under addition, Z, and the group of real numbers under multiplication, R*. Is there a homomorphism from Z to R*?\n\nWell, a homomorphism f: Z \u2192 R* would satisfy f(m + n) = f(m) * f(n). Since Z is generated by 1, f is determined by where it sends 1. So, if I set f(1) = a, where a is a nonzero real number, then f(n) = a^n for all integers n. That seems like a valid homomorphism.\n\nBut wait, is this the only homomorphism from Z to R*? Well, yes, because Z is cyclic, and any homomorphism is determined by where it sends the generator.\n\nSo in this case, there does exist a homomorphism.\n\nBut does this hold in general for any two groups?\n\nLet me think of another pair. Suppose G is the cyclic group of order 2, say {e, a}, where a^2 = e, and G' is the cyclic group of order 3, {e, b, b^2}, with b^3 = e.\n\nIs there a homomorphism from G to G'?\n\nWell, a homomorphism f: G \u2192 G' must send the identity e of G to the identity e of G'. Also, since a has order 2, f(a) must have order dividing 2 in G'. But in G', the only element of order dividing 2 is e, because b and b^2 both have order 3.\n\nSo, f(a) must be e. But then f is not really mapping G \"into\" G' in a meaningful way, since the only element being mapped is the identity. But technically, the trivial homomorphism where every element of G is mapped to e in G' is still a homomorphism.\n\nSo, in this case, there exists a homomorphism, even if it's just the trivial one.\n\nBut wait, is there a group where there is no homomorphism to another group?\n\nLet me consider the group G = {e}, the trivial group, and any other group G'. Then, the only possible function from G to G' is the one that maps e to e in G', which is a homomorphism. So, even in this case, a homomorphism exists.\n\nHmm, maybe the first statement is true. For any two groups, there exists at least the trivial homomorphism where everything is mapped to the identity of G'.\n\nBut I should check if there are any groups where even the trivial homomorphism isn't possible.\n\nWait, in group theory, the identity element is unique, and the definition of a homomorphism usually requires that it maps the identity of the domain to the identity of the codomain. So, in any case, there should at least be the trivial homomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the first statement seems to be true.\n\nNow, the second statement: \"Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.\"\n\nThis seems straightforward. A one-to-one map, or injection, means that different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain.\n\nBut I know that not all homomorphisms are one-to-one.\n\nFor example, consider the trivial homomorphism where everything maps to the identity. That's not one-to-one unless the domain group is trivial.\n\nAnother example: the homomorphism from Z to Z/2Z (integers modulo 2) defined by f(n) = n mod 2. This is a homomorphism, but it's not one-to-one because both even and odd integers map to 0 and 1 respectively, but infinitely many map to each.\n\nSo, in general, homomorphisms are not necessarily one-to-one. They can be many-to-one, as long as the group operation is preserved.\n\nTherefore, the second statement is false.\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, the correct answer should be C. True, False.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst statement: For any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism of G into G'.\n\nWell, at least the trivial homomorphism exists, mapping everything in G to the identity in G'. So, yes, this statement is true.\n\nSecond statement: Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.\n\nThis is not true, as shown by the examples where multiple elements map to the same element in the codomain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
