                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles that have an equal number of pins. Then he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile, and after that, he had 66 pins left. I need to find out how many pins John originally had.\n\nOkay, first things first, let's try to break this down. John divided his pins into two equal piles. So if he had a total of, say, P pins originally, then each pile would have P/2 pins.\n\nNow, he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. So, let's focus on one pile. One pile is P/2 pins. One-third of that pile would be (P/2)/3, which is P/6. Then, one-half of that would be (P/6)/2, which is P/12.\n\nSo, he gave away P/12 pins to his brother. After giving that away, he had 66 pins left. That means that his original number of pins minus the pins he gave away equals 66.\n\nSo, P - P/12 = 66.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Did he give away from only one pile or both? The problem says he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. So, it seems like he gave away from one pile only. So, if each pile has P/2 pins, and he gave away P/12 from one pile, then the remaining pins would be P minus P/12.\n\nBut, actually, since he divided the pins into two piles, and he gave away from one pile, does that mean the remaining pins are from both piles? Or did he only give away from one pile, so the other pile remains untouched?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.\"\n\nSo, he has two piles, each with P/2 pins. He gave away from one pile an amount equal to one-half of one-third of that pile.\n\nSo, one-third of one pile is (P/2)/3 = P/6.\n\nThen, one-half of that is (P/6)/2 = P/12.\n\nSo, he gave away P/12 pins from one pile.\n\nNow, the total number of pins he had originally is P.\n\nAfter giving away P/12 from one pile, the remaining pins are P - P/12 = (12P - P)/12 = 11P/12.\n\nBut wait, does giving away from one pile affect the other pile? If he only gave away from one pile, then the other pile remains unchanged. So, the remaining pins would be one pile minus P/12 plus the other pile.\n\nWait, no. If he has two piles, each with P/2 pins, and he gives away P/12 from one pile, then the remaining pins in that pile would be P/2 - P/12.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nP/2 - P/12 = (6P - P)/12 = 5P/12.\n\nSo, one pile now has 5P/12 pins, and the other pile still has P/2 pins.\n\nSo, total remaining pins are 5P/12 + P/2.\n\nWait, P/2 is equal to 6P/12, so 5P/12 + 6P/12 = 11P/12.\n\nSo, total remaining pins are 11P/12.\n\nAnd we know that this equals 66.\n\nSo, 11P/12 = 66.\n\nNow, to find P, we can solve for P in this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 12: 11P = 66 * 12.\n\nCalculate 66 * 12: 60 * 12 = 720, and 6 * 12 = 72, so total is 792.\n\nSo, 11P = 792.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 11: P = 792 / 11.\n\nLet's do the division: 11 goes into 79 how many times? 11 * 7 = 77, which is less than 79, and 11 * 8 = 88, which is too big. So, 7 times.\n\n7 * 11 = 77.\n\nSubtract 77 from 79: remainder is 2.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 2, so now it's 29.\n\n11 goes into 29 how many times? 11 * 2 = 22, remainder 7.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 2, so now it's 72.\n\n11 * 6 = 66, remainder 6.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 2, and so on.\n\nBut actually, since we're dealing with exact division here, and 11 * 72 = 792, so P = 72.\n\nWait, but let's check that.\n\n11 * 72 = 792.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, P = 72.\n\nTherefore, John originally had 72 pins.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 792\n\nB. 66\n\nC. 396\n\nD. 72\n\nSo, option D is 72, which matches our calculation.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal number of pins: P.\n\nDivided into two equal piles: each pile has P/2.\n\nGave away one-half of one-third of one pile:\n\nOne-third of one pile: (P/2)/3 = P/6.\n\nOne-half of that: (P/6)/2 = P/12.\n\nSo, gave away P/12 from one pile.\n\nRemaining in that pile: P/2 - P/12 = 5P/12.\n\nOther pile remains unchanged: P/2.\n\nTotal remaining pins: 5P/12 + P/2 = 11P/12.\n\nSet equal to 66: 11P/12 = 66.\n\nMultiply both sides by 12: 11P = 66 * 12 = 792.\n\nDivide by 11: P = 72.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?\"\n\nOkay, so he divided into two equal piles, gave away from one pile a certain amount, and had 66 pins left in total.\n\nWait, does \"he had 66 pins left\" refer to the remaining pins in both piles combined, or just in one pile?\n\nThe problem says: \"John had 66 pins left.\" It doesn't specify whether it's the total pins or just one pile.\n\nGiven that he divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles, and then gave away some pins from one pile, it's reasonable to assume that \"John had 66 pins left\" refers to the total number of pins he had after the transaction, i.e., both piles combined.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"John had 66 pins left\" refers only to one pile, but that doesn't make much sense because he gave away from one pile, so the other pile should still have its full amount.\n\nWait, but if he gave away from one pile, and the other pile remains unchanged, then the total pins left would be the remaining pins in the first pile plus the full second pile.\n\nWhich is what I did: 5P/12 + P/2 = 11P/12 = 66.\n\nSo, P = 72.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that he gave away from one pile, but the total pins left are both piles combined.\n\nWait, but that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the two piles are separate, and he gave away from one pile, so the total pins left are the remaining pins in that pile plus the full other pile.\n\nWhich again is 5P/12 + P/2 = 11P/12 = 66, leading to P = 72.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original number of pins as P.\n\nDivided into two equal piles: each pile has P/2.\n\nHe gave away one-half of one-third of one pile.\n\nSo, one-third of one pile is (P/2)/3 = P/6.\n\nOne-half of that is (P/6)/2 = P/12.\n\nSo, he gave away P/12 pins.\n\nNow, the total pins he had originally were P.\n\nAfter giving away P/12, he had 66 pins left.\n\nSo, P - P/12 = 66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, P = 72.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that he divided into two piles, each with P/2, and gave away P/12 from one pile, so the remaining pins are P - P/12 = 66.\n\nThus, P = 72.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 72.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
