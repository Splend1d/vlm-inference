Permeability is about how easily water can pass through a material, right? So, if the permeability is rapid, that means water moves through the subsoil quickly.\n\nNow, subsoil texture is about the size of the particles that make up the soil. The options are coarse, medium, fine, and silty. I need to recall which texture would allow water to pass through quickly.\n\nLet me think about this. Coarse textures have larger particles, like gravel or sand, and finer textures have smaller particles, like silt or clay.\n\nI remember that in soils, the larger the particle size, the larger the spaces between them, which allows water to flow more easily. So, coarse textures should have higher permeability because water can move through those bigger spaces faster.\n\nOn the other hand, finer textures have smaller spaces between particles, which makes it harder for water to flow through, so permeability is lower.\n\nGiven that, if permeability is rapid, meaning high permeability, it should correspond to a coarse texture.\n\nLet me double-check this. Imagine pouring water through different types of soil:\n\n- In coarse soil with large particles, the water should drain quickly because there are big gaps for the water to flow through.\n\n- In medium-textured soil, the particles are smaller, so the gaps are smaller, and water flows a bit slower.\n\n- In fine-textured soil, like silt, the particles are very small, and the gaps are minimal, so water moves very slowly.\n\n- Silty soil is similar to fine-textured soil; it has very small particles and low permeability.\n\nTherefore, if permeability is rapid, meaning water is moving through quickly, the texture must be coarse.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that another factor could influence permeability besides particle size? For example, the structure of the soil, porosity, or the presence of organic matter.\n\nBut the question is specifically about texture, so I think particle size is the primary factor here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the definitions:\n\n- Coarse texture: composed of particles with diameters greater than 2 mm, like gravel, or between 0.05 and 2 mm, like sand.\n\n- Medium texture: particles between 0.002 and 0.05 mm, like silt.\n\n- Fine texture: particles less than 0.002 mm, like clay.\n\n- Silty texture: characterized by a high proportion of silt particles, which are finer than sand but coarser than clay.\n\nGiven these definitions, coarse texture has the largest particles, leading to larger pore spaces and higher permeability.\n\nSo, if permeability is rapid, the subsoil is most likely coarse-textured.\n\nLet me see if there's any trick here. Maybe the term \"subsoil\" has specific properties that could affect permeability differently.\n\nSubsoil is typically located below the topsoil and can vary in composition, but generally, it's less porous than topsoil due to compaction.\n\nHowever, even in subsoil, the relationship between texture and permeability should hold true: coarser textures allow faster water movement.\n\nI think the answer is A. coarse.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ coarse}} \\]"
