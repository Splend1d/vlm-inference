                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about the Treaty of Tordesillas from 1494. It's about dividing the newly discovered lands between Spain and Portugal by drawing a line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. The question is asking which inference best explains why the King of Portugal insisted on controlling the territory east of this demarcation line.\n\nLet me first make sure I understand the context. In 1492, Columbus sailed west and discovered the Americas for Spain. Portugal, which had been exploring south along the African coast, was worried that Spain might claim lands that Portugal had been eyeing. So, to prevent conflict, they negotiated this treaty to draw a line: everything to the east would be Portugal's, and everything to the west would be Spain's.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA. Portuguese explorers were convinced that the route to the New World was easier traveled by going east.\n\nB. The Portuguese desired to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land.\n\nC. The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico.\n\nD. The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa.\n\nI need to think about which of these would best explain Portugal's insistence on the eastern territories.\n\nStarting with option A: that Portuguese explorers thought the route to the New World was easier going east. Hmm, but geographically, the New World is to the west from Europe. Portugal is on the western coast of Europe, so actually, sailing west would be the direction to go to reach the New World. Maybe this isn't the best reason.\n\nOption B: continuing the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land. Well, the Mamelukes were based in Egypt and Syria, which is to the east, but that's more towards the Mediterranean. Portugal had been involved in the Reconquista against the Moors in Spain, but I'm not sure about direct crusades against the Mamelukes. Maybe not the primary motivation here.\n\nOption C: desiring control of the wealthy lands of Mexico. Mexico is in Central America, which is to the west. If Portugal wanted Mexico, they would want the western territories, not the eastern ones. This seems contradictory.\n\nOption D: knowing about a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. This rings a bell. Portugal had been exploring along the African coast, trying to find a sea route to India to trade spices and other goods directly, bypassing the overland routes controlled by the Ottomans.\n\nIn 1488, Bartolomeu Dias reached the Cape of Good Hope, proving that it was possible to sail around Africa to reach India. So, Portugal was invested in this southern route to India.\n\nIf they controlled the eastern side of the demarcation line, that would include the route along the African coast and potentially the newly discovered lands there.\n\nWait, but the line is drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, which are off the coast of West Africa. So, to the east of that line would include most of West Africa and the Atlantic islands like the Azores and Cape Verde.\n\nPortugal had already established trade routes and colonies in West Africa and the Atlantic islands, like the Azores, Madeira, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. So, by insisting on the eastern side, they were protecting their existing interests in these areas.\n\nMoreover, Vasco da Gama would reach India by sailing around the Cape of Good Hope in 1498, just a few years after the treaty. So, controlling the eastern side would secure their route to India.\n\nOption D seems the most plausible. Portugal knew about the potential for a southern sea route to India via the Cape of Good Hope, and wanted to ensure that this route fell within their designated territory.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A suggests they thought going east was easier for reaching the New World, but geographically, the New World is to the west from Europe. Portugal's main interest was in the western Atlantic for reaching the New World, but their primary focus was actually on the southern route to India.\n\nOption B mentions crusades against the Mamelukes. While there was interest in crusades during this period, Portugal's main directional focus was southward along the African coast, not directly east toward the Levant.\n\nOption C suggests Portugal wanted Mexico, which is in the New World to the west. But again, controlling the eastern side of the demarcation line wouldn't give them Mexico; that would be on the western side, which was assigned to Spain.\n\nSo, yeah, option D seems the most accurate. Portugal wanted to secure their route to India via the Cape of Good Hope, which was to the east of the demarcation line they agreed upon.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there were any other motivations that might not be listed here. For example, perhaps Portugal had claims or interests in other eastern territories that we haven't considered. But based on the options provided, D seems the best fit.\n\nAlso, considering the historical context, Portugal had been investing heavily in exploring the African coast, establishing trading posts, and searching for a sea route to Asia. So, securing the eastern side of the demarcation line aligns perfectly with that goal.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: the Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
