Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a guidance counselor who stays on campus during spring break because he's working on a research project. One night, after working late, he decides to enter a student's room. This student is from a very wealthy family. The counselor is rummaging through the room, looking for something valuable to steal. He finds an expensive suitcase under the bed, opens it, and discovers an express mail envelope. He knows that the student's father often sends money to his son via express mail envelopes. When he opens the envelope, he finds a large quantity of white powder that he suspects is heroin. So, he calls the police, and an officer comes to the school. The counselor hands over the envelope to the officer, who then takes it to the police station. At the station, they open the envelope and send a sample of the substance to the lab, which confirms it's heroin. The police didn't get a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student is arrested for unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance, and now his attorney is trying to suppress the heroin as evidence.\n\nSo, the question is, will the motion to suppress be granted or denied, and for what reason?\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. Granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.\n\nB. Granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.\n\nC. Denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.\n\nD. Denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with option A: granted because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.\n\nWell, the envelope was found by the counselor, who is a private citizen, not a police officer. He found it and then handed it over to the police. So, the act of seizing the envelope was done by the counselor, not the police. Generally, searches and seizures conducted by private citizens aren't subject to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, which applies to government actors like the police. So, if the counselor is considered a private citizen, his act of seizing the envelope wouldn't require a warrant.\n\nBut wait, the counselor is a school employee. Does that change things?\n\nIn loco parentis is a legal doctrine that allows schools to act in the place of parents for certain purposes, like disciplinary actions. But does that extend to search and seizure?\n\nI think not directly. The in loco parentis doctrine is more about disciplinary actions and student conduct, not about law enforcement powers. Schools can conduct searches for educational purposes or to maintain order, but they don't have the same authority as police officers regarding searches and seizures.\n\nMoreover, the counselor in this case was acting outside of his professional duties, as he was rummaging through the student's room looking for valuable items to steal. So, he wasn't acting in his capacity as a counselor or in loco parentis; he was acting criminally.\n\nTherefore, his actions would be considered those of a private citizen, not a government actor, and thus, the warrant requirement wouldn't apply to his seizure of the envelope.\n\nSo, option A seems unlikely.\n\nNow, option B: granted because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.\n\nThe police received the envelope from the counselor and then opened it at the station house without a warrant.\n\nGenerally, the police are required to obtain a warrant before conducting a search, unless an exception applies.\n\nBut in this case, the envelope was already in their possession, handed over by the counselor.\n\nHowever, the counselor had already opened the envelope and seen the white powder before giving it to the police.\n\nBut the police themselves opened the envelope again at the station house.\n\nDoes that matter?\n\nWell, the counselor had already compromised the envelope's privacy by opening it, but the police still need to ensure that their actions comply with the Fourth Amendment.\n\nIf the police had probable cause to believe that the envelope contained contraband based on the counselor's report, they might not need a warrant to open it, especially if they had already seen evidence of its contents.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to consider.\n\nLet me think about the expectation of privacy.\n\nThe student had an express mail envelope, which is typically sealed and private. Opening it without a warrant could be a violation of the student's privacy rights.\n\nHowever, since the counselor had already opened it, that might have diminished the student's expectation of privacy to some extent.\n\nBut the police still need to act lawfully.\n\nMaybe the police should have obtained a warrant before opening the envelope, even if the counselor had already opened it.\n\nAlternatively, since the counselor is a private citizen, and he had already viewed the contents, perhaps the police could rely on that information without needing a warrant.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me look up some case law or principles that might apply here.\n\nI recall that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by government actors.\n\nIn this case, the initial search and seizure were done by the counselor, who is a private citizen, but the police became involved afterward.\n\nGenerally, private searches by citizens aren't subject to the Fourth Amendment, but if the police are involved or if the private citizen is acting at the direction of the police, then it could be considered a government search.\n\nIn this scenario, the counselor acted on his own initiative, not at the direction of the police.\n\nTherefore, his actions wouldn't be covered by the Fourth Amendment.\n\nHowever, when the police received the envelope and opened it, their actions would be subject to the Fourth Amendment.\n\nIf the police had probable cause to believe that the envelope contained contraband based on the counselor's report, they might not need a warrant to open it.\n\nProbably, the police had probable cause because the counselor, who saw white powder that looked like heroin, reported it to them.\n\nSo, in that case, opening the envelope without a warrant might be permissible.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider the concept of \"private search doctrine.\"\n\nAccording to this doctrine, if a private party conducts a search and turns over evidence to the police, the evidence may still be admissible even if the private party's actions would have violated the Fourth Amendment if done by the police.\n\nHowever, there are limits to this doctrine.\n\nIf the private party was acting as an agent of the police or was acting at their direction, then the search could be considered a government search and subject to the Fourth Amendment.\n\nIn this scenario, the counselor acted on his own, without any involvement or direction from the police.\n\nTherefore, his search and seizure of the envelope would be considered a private search, not subject to the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThus, the evidence obtained from his search could be admissible.\n\nBut then, why would the police need to get a warrant to open the envelope?\n\nWell, even if the counselor had already opened it, the police still need to ensure that their actions are lawful.\n\nIf the counselor had already viewed the contents, perhaps the police could rely on that and open it without a warrant, given the counselor's report of finding white powder that looked like heroin, which would give them probable cause.\n\nAlternatively, if the police had independent probable cause to believe the envelope contained contraband, they could open it without a warrant.\n\nIn this case, the counselor's report would provide that probable cause.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the police didn't need a warrant to open the envelope, as they had probable cause based on the counselor's report.\n\nSo, option B seems unlikely.\n\nNow, option C: denied because the search was conducted by a private party.\n\nThis aligns with what I was thinking earlier.\n\nThe counselor is a private citizen, not a government actor, so his search isn't subject to the Fourth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the motion to suppress based on illegal search and seizure grounds wouldn't succeed.\n\nHowever, if the counselor is a school employee, could he be considered a government actor?\n\nGenerally, school employees are considered government actors for certain purposes, but in this case, he was acting outside of his official duties, committing a crime by entering the student's room and stealing.\n\nSo, his actions shouldn't be considered government actions.\n\nTherefore, the search was by a private party, and the evidence should be admissible.\n\nBut wait, the police became involved afterward.\n\nIf the police had probable cause to open the envelope based on the counselor's report, their action of opening it without a warrant might be permissible.\n\nBut perhaps there's an argument that the police should have obtained a warrant before opening the envelope, even if the counselor had already opened it.\n\nHowever, given that the counselor had already compromised the envelope's privacy, and the police had probable cause, it's likely that opening it without a warrant is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, option C seems plausible: denied because the search was conducted by a private party.\n\nNow, option D: denied because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.\n\nAs I thought earlier, in loco parentis is about schools acting in place of parents for disciplinary and educational purposes.\n\nIt doesn't grant schools the same search and seizure powers as the police.\n\nMoreover, the counselor was acting criminally in this scenario, not in his official capacity.\n\nTherefore, in loco parentis wouldn't apply here.\n\nSo, option D seems incorrect.\n\nTherefore, between options A, B, C, and D, option C seems to be the most accurate: denied because the search was conducted by a private party.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any chance that the counselor could be considered a government actor in this scenario?\n\nHe is a school employee, but he was acting outside of his official duties, committing a crime.\n\nTherefore, his actions shouldn't be attributed to the government.\n\nHence, his search was a private search, not subject to the Fourth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the evidence he obtained can be used, and the motion to suppress should be denied.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
