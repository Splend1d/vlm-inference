                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence will be granted or denied. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, a reliable police informant calls the police and reports seeing two men in a blue car selling narcotics outside a local movie theater. The informant gives a detailed description of the men and the license number of the vehicle. Based on this information, a patrol car is sent to the movie theater.\n\nA few minutes later, the police see a car that matches the description parked about two blocks from the movie theater. They approach the car and see one man who fits the description provided. So far, it seems like the police have reasonable suspicion to approach and investigate further based on the informant's tip and their observation of the matching vehicle and description.\n\nNext, the police proceed to the car and open the doors of the vehicle. Then, they pry open a locked tool case in the rear of the vehicle and find an envelope containing about one gram of cocaine. After that, they place the driver under arrest and open the glove compartment, finding a small amount of marijuana.\n\nNow, the driver is being prosecuted for two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances and has filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence. I need to determine whether this motion will most likely be granted or denied, and for which substances.\n\nTo do this, I should consider the legality of the searches that led to the discovery of the cocaine and the marijuana. The admissibility of evidence can depend on whether the search and seizure complied with constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, typically under the Fourth Amendment in the United States.\n\nLet's consider the search of the tool case first. The police pryd open a locked tool case and found cocaine inside. Was this search lawful?\n\nWell, the police had approached the vehicle based on reasonable suspicion due to the informant's tip and their observations. But did they have probable cause to search the vehicle and the tool case?\n\nProbably cause exists when the police have sufficient evidence to believe that a crime has been or is being committed. In this case, the informant's tip, combined with the police observing a matching vehicle and a man fitting the description, might provide probable cause to believe that narcotics are present in the vehicle.\n\nHowever, to search a vehicle, the police generally need a warrant unless there are exceptions that apply, such as consent, plain view, or exigent circumstances.\n\nDid the police have consent to search the vehicle? The scenario doesn't specify that they asked for or received consent, so I'll assume they did not.\n\nWas the cocaine in plain view? It was inside a locked tool case, so likely not in plain view.\n\nWere there exigent circumstances? Exigent circumstances might include the imminent destruction of evidence or the need to act quickly to prevent harm. The scenario doesn't indicate any urgent situation, so it's unclear if this exception applies.\n\nGiven that, the search of the tool case might be considered unlawful, meaning the cocaine could be excluded from evidence.\n\nNow, let's look at the marijuana found in the glove compartment. This search occurred after the driver was placed under arrest.\n\nWhen someone is arrested, the police can conduct a search incident to arrest, which typically allows them to search the person being arrested and the area within their immediate control.\n\nThe glove compartment might be considered within the driver's immediate control, especially if it was unlocked or easily accessible from the driver's seat.\n\nHowever, if the glove compartment was locked and required prying open, similar to the tool case, then it might not be considered within the immediate control or subject to a search incident to arrest without a warrant.\n\nIn this scenario, it's not specified whether the glove compartment was locked or not. If it was unlocked, then the search might be permissible as part of the search incident to arrest. If it was locked, then prying it open might require a warrant unless there are exigent circumstances.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the scenario mentions that the police opened the glove compartment after arresting the driver, it's possible that the search was lawful if the glove compartment was unlocked and within the driver's immediate control.\n\nAlternatively, if the police had probable cause to believe that evidence related to the crime was inside the glove compartment, they might have had grounds for searching it without a warrant, depending on the specific circumstances.\n\nGiven that the driver has been arrested for the cocaine found in the tool case, the police might argue that they had probable cause to search the entire vehicle, including the glove compartment, as part of the arrest.\n\nHowever, to ensure the search was lawful, the police would need to demonstrate that they had probable cause to believe that evidence of the crime was located in the glove compartment.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the search of the tool case might be more tenuous because it was locked and not necessarily within the immediate control of the driver, and there might not have been exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless search.\n\nOn the other hand, the search of the glove compartment after the arrest might be more justifiable under the search incident to arrest doctrine, especially if the glove compartment was unlocked and within the driver's immediate control.\n\nTherefore, the motion to exclude might be granted as to the cocaine found in the tool case but denied as to the marijuana found in the glove compartment.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. granted, as to the cocaine only.\n\nB. granted, as to the marijuana only.\n\nC. granted, as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\n\nD. denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.\n\nBased on my analysis, option A seems the most appropriate: granted, as to the cocaine only.\n\nHowever, I should consider that the scenario might have different nuances that could affect this conclusion. For example, if the informant was particularly reliable, and the police had additional information that strengthened their probable cause, then the search of the tool case might be upheld.\n\nAlternatively, if the police obtained a warrant based on the informant's tip and their observations, then both searches would be lawful, and the evidence would be admissible.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't mention a warrant being obtained, so I'll assume it was a warrantless search.\n\nAnother consideration is that after arresting the driver for the cocaine in the tool case, the police might have had probable cause to search the entire vehicle, including the glove compartment, as part of the arrest.\n\nIn that case, the search of the glove compartment might be justified without a warrant.\n\nHowever, the rules regarding vehicle searches after arrest can be complex, and they vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances.\n\nIn any case, based on the information provided, it seems most likely that the motion to exclude will be granted as to the cocaine only, with the marijuana being admissible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
