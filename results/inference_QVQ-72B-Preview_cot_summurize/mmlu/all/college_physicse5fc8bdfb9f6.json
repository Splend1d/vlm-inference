                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about special relativity. There are two light sources at x=0 and x=10 meters, and an observer O, who is right in the middle at rest, sees them flash simultaneously. But another observer, O', moving along the x-axis, sees one flashing 13 nanoseconds before the other. I need to find out how fast O' is moving relative to O.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some concepts from special relativity. Simultaneity is relative; different observers in different inertial frames can disagree on whether two events happen at the same time. This is a direct consequence of the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames.\n\nSo, observer O is at rest and positioned at the midpoint between the two light sources, at x=5 meters. Both sources flash simultaneously according to O. But observer O', moving relative to O, sees these flashes at different times.\n\nI think I should use the Lorentz transformation to relate the coordinates of the events in the two frames. The Lorentz transformation equations are:\n\nx' = \u03b3(x - vt)\n\nt' = \u03b3(t - (vx)/c\u00b2)\n\nWhere:\n\n- x and t are the coordinates in O's frame\n\n- x' and t' are the coordinates in O's frame\n\n- v is the relative speed between O and O'\n\n- \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to approach this problem without getting too deep into the math right away.\n\nLet's consider the events:\n\nEvent 1: Light source at x=0 flashes.\n\nEvent 2: Light source at x=10 meters flashes.\n\nObserver O, at rest at x=5 meters, sees both events simultaneously. That means, according to O, the flashes reach him at the same time.\n\nObserver O', moving at speed v along the x-axis, sees one flash 13 nanoseconds before the other.\n\nLet's assume O' is moving in the positive x-direction. If O' is moving to the right, the flash from x=10 meters will have a shorter distance to travel to reach O' compared to the flash from x=0.\n\nWait, actually, I need to think about this carefully. If O' is moving to the right, the light from x=10 meters has to travel a shorter distance to reach O', but it's also moving away from the source. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the direction of motion more carefully.\n\nActually, in special relativity, it's better to think in terms of the coordinates transformed by the Lorentz transformation rather than thinking about the distances traveled by light directly.\n\nLet's try to set up the problem properly.\n\nIn O's frame:\n\n- Both flashes occur simultaneously at t=0.\n\n- One source is at x=0, the other at x=10 meters.\n\nIn O's frame, the midpoint is at x=5 meters.\n\nIn O's frame, the flashes reach O at t=0.\n\nIn O's frame, the time for light to travel from x=0 to x=5 is t = (5 m) / c.\n\nSimilarly, from x=10 to x=5 is t = (5 m) / c.\n\nSo, both flashes reach O at the same time, as expected.\n\nNow, in O's frame, the events are:\n\nEvent 1: (x1, t1) = (0, 0)\n\nEvent 2: (x2, t2) = (10 m, 0)\n\nIn O's frame, these events are simultaneous.\n\nIn O's frame, O' is moving at speed v along the x-axis.\n\nWe need to find v.\n\nIn O's frame, the position of O' at time t is x' = vt.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in O's frame, O' is moving at speed v, so the position of O' at time t is x' = vt.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use the Lorentz transformation to find the coordinates of the events in O's frame and O's frame.\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's recall that in special relativity, the Lorentz transformation relates the coordinates of an event in one inertial frame to another inertial frame moving at constant velocity relative to the first.\n\nSo, the transformation equations are:\n\nx' = \u03b3(x - vt)\n\nt' = \u03b3(t - (vx)/c\u00b2)\n\nWhere \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nIn O's frame, the events are at t=0, so in O's frame, t=0.\n\nWait, but if t=0 in O's frame for both events, then in O's frame, the time is zero.\n\nBut in O's frame, the flashes are simultaneous, so t1 = t2 = 0.\n\nNow, in O's frame, the positions are x1=0 and x2=10 meters.\n\nIn O's frame, O' is moving at speed v.\n\nNow, in O's frame, the time for light to travel from x=0 to O's position at x=5 is t1 = (5 m) / c.\n\nSimilarly, from x=10 to x=5 is t2 = (5 m) / c.\n\nSo, in O's frame, both flashes reach O at the same time, t=0.\n\nBut in O's frame, O' is moving, so the time O' measures for the flashes to reach him would be different.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the time O' measures for the flashes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of time dilation or the relativity of simultaneity.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSince O sees the flashes as simultaneous, but O' does not, this is a direct application of the relativity of simultaneity.\n\nThe time difference \u0394t' between the two events, as measured by O', is given by:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3 * (\u0394t - (v * \u0394x)/c\u00b2)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u0394t is the time difference between the events in O's frame (which is zero since they are simultaneous).\n\n- \u0394x is the spatial separation of the events in O's frame (10 m - 0 = 10 m).\n\n- v is the relative speed.\n\n- \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3 * (0 - (v * 10)/c\u00b2)\n\n\u0394t' = -\u03b3 * (v * 10)/c\u00b2\n\nBut according to the problem, O' sees one flash 13 nanoseconds before the other, so \u0394t' = -13 ns.\n\nWait, the problem says \"one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other\", but it doesn't specify which one flashes first according to O'. It just says \"one source flashes 13 ns before the other\".\n\nAssuming O' sees one flash earlier by 13 ns, then \u0394t' = -13 ns (if the flash from x=0 is earlier) or \u0394t' = +13 ns (if the flash from x=10 is earlier).\n\nI need to be careful with the signs.\n\nLet's assume O' is moving in the positive x-direction.\n\nThen, the flash from x=10 meters is closer to O' compared to the flash from x=0.\n\nSo, according to O', the flash from x=10 meters should be seen earlier.\n\nTherefore, the flash from x=10 meters occurs earlier in O's frame by 13 ns.\n\nSo, \u0394t' = -13 ns (if the flash from x=10 is earlier).\n\nWait, but in the Lorentz transformation, the time difference is \u0394t' = \u03b3 * (- (v * \u0394x)/c\u00b2)\n\nGiven that \u0394x = 10 m, and assuming v is positive (since O' is moving to the right), then \u0394t' would be negative, meaning the flash from x=10 meters occurs earlier.\n\nSo, \u0394t' = -\u03b3 * (v * 10)/c\u00b2 = -13 ns\n\nTherefore, \u03b3 * (v * 10)/c\u00b2 = 13 ns\n\nBut \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n(1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) * (v * 10)/c\u00b2 = 13 ns\n\nThis is an equation I can solve for v.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept that the time difference between two events, as seen by an observer moving relative to the frame where the events are separated in space, is given by:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3 * (\u0394x * v / c\u00b2)\n\nBut in this case, since \u0394t = 0, then \u0394t' = \u03b3 * (v * \u0394x / c\u00b2)\n\nAnd this should equal 13 ns.\n\nSo, \u03b3 * (v * 10) / c\u00b2 = 13 ns\n\nBut earlier, I had \u0394t' = -\u03b3 * (v * 10)/c\u00b2 = -13 ns\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with the signs.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nIn the Lorentz transformation, the time transformation is:\n\nt' = \u03b3(t - (v x)/c\u00b2)\n\nFor event 1 at (x1=0, t1=0):\n\nt1' = \u03b3(0 - (v * 0)/c\u00b2) = 0\n\nFor event 2 at (x2=10 m, t2=0):\n\nt2' = \u03b3(0 - (v * 10)/c\u00b2) = -\u03b3(v * 10)/c\u00b2\n\nSo, the time difference in O's frame is:\n\n\u0394t' = t2' - t1' = -\u03b3(v * 10)/c\u00b2\n\nAccording to the problem, O' sees one flash 13 ns before the other, meaning one flash is earlier by 13 ns.\n\nAssuming O' sees the flash from x=10 meters earlier, then \u0394t' = -13 ns.\n\nTherefore, -\u03b3(v * 10)/c\u00b2 = -13 ns\n\nSo, \u03b3(v * 10)/c\u00b2 = 13 ns\n\nNow, I can solve for v.\n\nFirst, express \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo,\n\n1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) * (v * 10)/c\u00b2 = 13 ns\n\nThis equation is a bit messy to solve directly. Maybe I can make some approximations or find a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall that in special relativity, the time difference between two events that are spatially separated is given by:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3 * (\u0394x * v / c\u00b2)\n\nWhich is what I had earlier.\n\nSo, \u0394t' = \u03b3 * (v * \u0394x / c\u00b2) = 13 ns\n\nBut since \u0394t' is negative (one event is earlier), and \u03b3 is positive, then v * \u0394x / c\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nGiven that v is positive (moving to the right), and \u0394x is positive (10 m), then indeed \u0394t' is negative, as expected.\n\nSo, \u03b3 * (v * 10)/c\u00b2 = 13 ns\n\nNow, I can plug in the values.\n\nFirst, convert 13 ns to seconds:\n\n13 ns = 13 * 10^-9 s\n\nAnd c = 3 * 10^8 m/s\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b3 * (v * 10) / (3 * 10^8) = 13 * 10^-9\n\nLet me solve for v.\n\nFirst, express \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo,\n\n1 / \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) * (v * 10) / (3 * 10^8) = 13 * 10^-9\n\nThis is still complicated. Maybe I can rearrange it.\n\nLet me denote \u03b2 = v/c, then \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)\n\nSo,\n\n(1 / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)) * (\u03b2 * 10) / (3 * 10^8) = 13 * 10^-9\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1 / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)) * (\u03b2 * 10) = 13 * 10^-9 * 3 * 10^8\n\nCalculate right side:\n\n13 * 10^-9 * 3 * 10^8 = 13 * 3 * 10^{-9+8} = 39 * 10^{-1} = 3.9\n\nSo,\n\n(1 / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2)) * (\u03b2 * 10) = 3.9\n\nNow, solve for \u03b2.\n\nThis is a transcendental equation and might be tricky to solve algebraically.\n\nMaybe I can make an approximation.\n\nSince 13 ns is a very small time interval, and c is very large, perhaps \u03b2 is small, and I can approximate.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, plug in the equation:\n\n(\u03b2 * 10) / \u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2) = 3.9\n\nLet me denote x = \u03b2, then:\n\nx * 10 / \u221a(1 - x\u00b2) = 3.9\n\nSo,\n\nx * 10 = 3.9 * \u221a(1 - x\u00b2)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(x * 10)^2 = (3.9)^2 * (1 - x\u00b2)\n\n100 x\u00b2 = 15.21 * (1 - x\u00b2)\n\n100 x\u00b2 = 15.21 - 15.21 x\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n100 x\u00b2 + 15.21 x\u00b2 - 15.21 = 0\n\n115.21 x\u00b2 - 15.21 = 0\n\n115.21 x\u00b2 = 15.21\n\nx\u00b2 = 15.21 / 115.21 \u2248 0.1319\n\nx = \u221a0.1319 \u2248 0.363\n\nSo, \u03b2 \u2248 0.363\n\nTherefore, v = \u03b2 c \u2248 0.363 c\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.13c\n\nB. 0.15c\n\nC. 0.36c\n\nD. 0.53c\n\nSo, the answer is C. 0.36c\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense.\n\nIs \u03b2 = 0.363 reasonable?\n\nLet me verify the calculations.\n\nStarting from:\n\nx * 10 / \u221a(1 - x\u00b2) = 3.9\n\nThen:\n\nx * 10 = 3.9 * \u221a(1 - x\u00b2)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n100 x\u00b2 = 15.21 (1 - x\u00b2)\n\n100 x\u00b2 = 15.21 - 15.21 x\u00b2\n\n100 x\u00b2 + 15.21 x\u00b2 = 15.21\n\n115.21 x\u00b2 = 15.21\n\nx\u00b2 = 15.21 / 115.21 \u2248 0.1319\n\nx \u2248 \u221a0.1319 \u2248 0.363\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the direction of motion more carefully, but given the symmetry and the way I set up the coordinates, this should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.36c\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
