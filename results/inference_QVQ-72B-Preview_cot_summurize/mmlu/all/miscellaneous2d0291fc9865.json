                    "text": "So I have this question about antitrust laws, and I need to figure out what their primary purpose is. The options are:\n\nA. Help businesses that are in financial trouble\n\nB. Encourage business investment\n\nC. Prevent business behavior that hampers competition\n\nD. Establish trust between government and businesses\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what antitrust laws are. I remember that antitrust laws are regulations that governments use to prevent companies from gaining too much market power and dominating the market in a way that could harm competition. So, they're mostly about maintaining fair competition in the marketplace.\n\nOption A says help businesses that are in financial trouble. That sounds more like something related to bankruptcy laws or financial assistance programs, not specifically antitrust laws. Antitrust laws aren't really about bailing out struggling businesses; they're about ensuring that even successful businesses don't abuse their position in the market. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B is encourage business investment. While a healthy competitive environment can indeed encourage investment by spurring innovation and efficiency, antitrust laws are more about regulating business behavior rather than directly stimulating investment. So, this seems like a indirect effect rather than the primary purpose. Maybe not B.\n\nOption C says prevent business behavior that hampers competition. This seems spot on with what I recall about antitrust laws. They are designed to stop companies from engaging in practices like price-fixing, monopolistic practices, or forming cartels that could restrict competition. By doing so, they ensure that markets remain competitive, which benefits consumers through lower prices and better products. So, this looks like a strong candidate for the primary purpose of antitrust laws.\n\nOption D is establish trust between government and businesses. While trust between government and businesses is important for a functioning economy, antitrust laws are more about regulating business conduct to protect competition rather than building trust per se. Trust might be a byproduct of fair regulation, but it's not the main goal of antitrust laws.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think the primary purpose of antitrust laws is to prevent business behavior that hampers competition. That would be option C.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Antitrust laws are also known as competition laws in some countries, and they are indeed focused on preventing anti-competitive practices. These can include things like mergers that would lead to monopolies, collusive behavior among competitors, or abusive practices by companies with market dominance.\n\nFor example, if a large company is found to be engaging in predatory pricing to drive smaller competitors out of the market, antitrust laws would be used to address such behavior because it hampers competition.\n\nAnother example is when companies in the same industry agree to set prices at a certain level, which is known as price-fixing. This reduces competition and can lead to higher prices for consumers. Antitrust laws aim to prevent such agreements.\n\nSo, based on these examples, it's clear that the main purpose is to prevent actions that reduce competition in the marketplace.\n\nI don't think the other options are correct for the reasons I outlined earlier. Helping businesses in financial trouble is more about bankruptcy or financial aid policies, encouraging investment is more related to tax incentives or subsidies, and establishing trust between government and businesses might be a goal of some regulations but isn't the primary focus of antitrust laws.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
