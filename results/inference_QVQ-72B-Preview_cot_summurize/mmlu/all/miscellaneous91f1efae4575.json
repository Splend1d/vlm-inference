                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the film \"The Hudsucker Proxy.\" It's asking what popular toy is featured in the movie, and the options are Beanie Babies, Hula Hoop, Lincoln Logs, and Lite Brite. Hmm, I need to recall the plot of the film to answer this correctly.\n\nFirst off, \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" is a comedy film directed by the Coen brothers, who are known for their quirky and offbeat movies. I remember that the story is set in the 1950s and revolves around a large corporation called Hudsucker Industries. The plot involves a power struggle within the company and the introduction of a new product that becomes a fad.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about a popular toy that's featured in the film. Let me think about the toys listed:\n\nA. Beanie Babies\n\nB. Hula Hoop\n\nC. Lincoln Logs\n\nD. Lite Brite\n\nI need to recall which one was prominent in the movie.\n\nStarting with Beanie Babies, I know that they are small, plush toys that were extremely popular in the 1990s. Each Beanie Baby has a unique name and a birthday, and collectors would trade them, thinking they might be valuable someday. However, considering that \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" is set in the 1950s, and Beanie Babies weren't around until the 90s, it's unlikely that they would be featured in the film.\n\nNext is the Hula Hoop. This is a fitness and play tool that consists of a ring that's spun around the waist. It was invented in the mid-20th century and became a massive craze in the 1950s. In fact, the Hula Hoop was such a phenomenon that it fits perfectly with the era depicted in \"The Hudsucker Proxy.\" I seem to recall a scene in the movie where the Hula Hoop is introduced as a new product by Hudsucker Industries and quickly captures the imagination of the public.\n\nMoving on to Lincoln Logs. These are wooden building toys that allow children to construct various structures, often resembling log cabins. They've been around since the early 20th century and are still popular today. While they were certainly present in the 1950s, I don't specifically recall them being a focal point in \"The Hudsucker Proxy.\" The movie seems to center more around the Hula Hoop as the innovative product that causes all the excitement.\n\nLastly, there's Lite Brite. This is a pegboard toy where children can insert colored pegs into a grid to create pictures. It was first introduced in the 1960s, which is slightly after the setting of \"The Hudsucker Proxy.\" Although the film does touch on the concept of toys and trends, Lite Brite doesn't seem to align with the time period depicted.\n\nPutting it all together, the Hula Hoop seems to be the most fitting answer. It was a significant toy during the 1950s, matching the film's setting, and I do recall it playing a prominent role in the plot of \"The Hudsucker Proxy.\" The other toys either don't match the time period or aren't as closely associated with the film's storyline.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Hula Hoop.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
