                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that the graph of the equation \\(x + 2y + 3 = 0\\) is perpendicular to the graph of the equation \\(ax + 2y + 3 = 0\\), and I need to find the value of \\(a\\). The options are A. -4, B. -13, C. -9, D. -15.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what it means for two lines to be perpendicular. From what I remember, two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. So, if I have two lines with slopes \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\), then \\(m_1 \\times m_2 = -1\\).\n\nOkay, so my plan is to find the slope of both lines and then set their product equal to -1 to solve for \\(a\\).\n\nLet's start with the first equation: \\(x + 2y + 3 = 0\\).\n\nI need to solve for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) to find its slope. So, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\(2y = -x - 3\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\nSo, the slope of the first line is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nNow, for the second equation: \\(ax + 2y + 3 = 0\\).\n\nAgain, solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\(2y = -ax - 3\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\(y = -\\frac{a}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\nSo, the slope of the second line is \\(-\\frac{a}{2}\\).\n\nNow, since these two lines are perpendicular, their slopes should satisfy:\n\n\\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\times -\\frac{a}{2} = -1\\)\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check that.\n\nThe product of the slopes should be -1, so:\n\n\\(m_1 \\times m_2 = -1\\)\n\nSubstituting the slopes:\n\n\\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\times -\\frac{a}{2} = -1\\)\n\nMultiplying the negatives gives positive:\n\n\\(\\frac{a}{4} = -1\\)\n\nNow, solve for \\(a\\):\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\(a = -4\\)\n\nOkay, so the answer should be A. -4.\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I found the slope of the first line as \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), which seems correct.\n\nThen, for the second line, the slope is \\(-\\frac{a}{2}\\), which also seems correct.\n\nThe product of the slopes is \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\times -\\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{a}{4}\\), and that should equal -1.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{a}{4} = -1\\), which gives \\(a = -4\\).\n\nThat seems solid. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it another way.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that two lines are perpendicular if and only if the dot product of their normal vectors is zero. Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating it, but it's good to know.\n\nIn this case, the normal vector to the first plane is \\(\\langle 1, 2 \\rangle\\) (the coefficients of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)), and for the second plane, it's \\(\\langle a, 2 \\rangle\\).\n\nIf the lines are perpendicular, then the normal vectors are orthogonal, so their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, \\(1 \\times a + 2 \\times 2 = 0\\)\n\nWhich gives \\(a + 4 = 0\\), so \\(a = -4\\).\n\nOkay, that confirms the same answer.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier when I thought about the slopes. Wait, no, both methods give me \\(a = -4\\).\n\nWait, but let me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that the lines could be the same or parallel? Well, no, because they are supposed to be perpendicular.\n\nAlso, I should check if \\(a = -4\\) really makes the lines perpendicular.\n\nSo, plug \\(a = -4\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\(-4x + 2y + 3 = 0\\)\n\nSolve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\(2y = 4x - 3\\)\n\n\\(y = 2x - \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\nSo, the slope is 2.\n\nNow, the first line has a slope of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the second has a slope of 2.\n\nThe product is \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = -1\\), which confirms they are perpendicular.\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nI don't think there's another value of \\(a\\) that would satisfy this condition, based on the options provided.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is A. -4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-4} \\]"
