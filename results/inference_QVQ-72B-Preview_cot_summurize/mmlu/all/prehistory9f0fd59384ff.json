                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement about the main Indus Valley cities isn't true. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that a citadel was built on the western margin of each city. I remember that in the Indus Valley Civilization, cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa had citadels, which were like fortified areas, probably for protection. But I'm not entirely sure about their exact locations within the cities. Maybe I should look that up.\n\nOption B mentions that the \"upper cities\" were encompassed by monumental walls. I think the \"upper cities\" refer to the citadels or the elevated areas that might have been for important buildings or defense. Again, walls were likely part of their construction, but I need to confirm.\n\nOption C states that the blocks of residences were added haphazardly as needed. Now, from what I recall, the Indus Valley cities were known for their urban planning and grid-like street layouts. That suggests that they had a planned approach to city design, not haphazard additions. Maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nOption D says that the bricks used in the houses were a consistent size and shape. I have read that one of the notable features of Indus Valley construction was the use of standardized bricks, which were roughly the same size and shape across different sites. So, that seems to be true.\n\nLet me double-check. If I recall correctly, the Indus Valley cities were well-planned with a grid system, and houses were built using standardized bricks. The citadels were indeed fortified areas, probably located in strategic positions within the cities, perhaps on higher ground or near important buildings. As for the walls, it's likely that the citadels were enclosed by walls for defense.\n\nGiven that, option C seems contradictory to what I know about their urban planning. They didn't just add blocks haphazardly; there was a systematic approach to how the cities were laid out.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. The blocks of residences were added haphazardly as needed. That doesn't seem to align with the known facts about Indus Valley urban planning.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me see if there's any evidence to the contrary. Maybe some areas were expanded over time, but generally, the cities were planned with a grid layout, and new areas were likely added in a planned manner, not randomly.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident that C is the incorrect statement. The Indus Valley cities were famous for their advanced urban planning, not for haphazard development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
