                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Including the bottom, how many sides are on a square-based pyramid?\" And the options are A. three, B. four, C. five, D. six. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand what a square-based pyramid is and how many sides it has in total, including the base.\n\nFirst off, I know that a pyramid is a polyhedron with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a common point called the apex. In a square-based pyramid, the base is a square, and the sides are four triangular faces that slope up to the apex.\n\nSo, if I just consider the triangular faces, that's four sides, right? But the question says \"including the bottom,\" which is the square base. So, total sides would be the four triangular faces plus the square base, which adds up to five sides. Wait, but is the base considered a \"side\"? I think in geometry, the base is sometimes considered a face, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think about this again. In a square-based pyramid, the base is a square, and the four sides are triangles. So, total, there are five faces: four triangles and one square. But is the base considered a side in the context of this question? I think so, because the question specifies \"including the bottom.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of lateral sides plus the base. If that's the case, then it would still be five. But let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should visualize it or draw a diagram. Let me sketch a square-based pyramid in my mind. Imagine a square at the bottom, and then four triangles meeting at a single point above the square. So, the square is one face, and each of the four triangles is another face. Therefore, total faces are five.\n\nBut maybe the question is referring to the number of sides in terms of edges or something else. No, it specifically says \"sides,\" which in polyhedrons usually refers to the faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"sides\" refers to the number of faces excluding the base. But the question says \"including the bottom,\" so I think we need to count the base as well.\n\nLet me consider the definition of a pyramid. A pyramid is a polyhedron whose base is a polygon and whose lateral faces are triangles meeting at a common point. So, for a square-based pyramid, the base is a square (one face), and the lateral faces are four triangles.\n\nTherefore, total number of sides (faces) is base plus lateral faces: 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nWait, but one of the options is six. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let's consider that the base could be considered as having sides, but in terms of faces, it's one face.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to ask for the number of lateral sides plus the base. But that still adds up to five.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe \"sides\" refers to the number of faces, and in a square-based pyramid, there are four triangular faces plus one square base, totaling five.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"sides\" refers to the number of edges or something else, but that doesn't seem likely.\n\nI think the answer is five, which is option C.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a simple example. Take a square-based pyramid like the Egyptian pyramids. They have a square base and four triangular faces sloping up to the apex. So, total faces: square (1) + triangles (4) = 5.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer should be C. five.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
