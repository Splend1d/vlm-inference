They create a subdivision plan with 90 one-acre residential lots and set aside a 10-acre plot for a public school. The sales brochure highlights the proximity of the proposed school and notes that the county school district won't have to spend tax money to acquire the property for school construction. Cool, so it seems like the investor is positioning this as a benefit for both the homeowners and the school district.\n\nIn 1996, the subdivision plan is recorded with the county recorder's office. Over the next few years, the investor sells 50 residential lots to individual buyers. Then, in 2002, they sell the remaining 40 lots and the 10-acre tract to a builder. The deeds for these transactions include language similar to the first 50 deeds, presumably confirming the school site dedication. By 2007, the builder has sold all 40 lots, and each deed specifies that the lots are part of the subdivision.\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting. On January 9, 2008, the builder sells the 10-acre tract to a buyer. This deed doesn't mention the subdivision. Two weeks later, the county school board decides to build a new school on that 10-acre tract. But before they can act, the buyer starts constructing a pizzeria on the same tract. The school board sues the buyer to stop the construction of the pizzeria.\n\nThe question is: who would the court rule in favor of in this lawsuit?\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the investor created a subdivision plan that included a 10-acre tract for a school. This plan was recorded in 1996, which likely means it's a matter of public record and part of the property's title history.\n\nThe sales brochure mentions that the school district won't have to spend tax money to acquire the property for school construction. This suggests that the investor intended to donate or make available the 10-acre tract for school use.\n\nOver time, the investor sold 50 lots to individual buyers, then sold the remaining 40 lots and the 10-acre tract to a builder. The deeds for these sales included language similar to the first 50 deeds, which probably reinforced the idea that the 10-acre tract was designated for school use.\n\nThe builder then sold all 40 lots, and each deed specified that the lots were part of the subdivision, again likely referencing the school site.\n\nThen, in 2008, the builder sells the 10-acre tract to a buyer, but this deed doesn't mention the subdivision. Despite that, the school board plans to build a school there, but the buyer starts building a pizzeria instead.\n\nSo, the crux of the issue is whether the 10-acre tract is legally designated for school use, binding the buyer to that use, or if the buyer can develop it as they see fit because their deed didn't mention the subdivision.\n\nOption A says the buyer wins because their deed made no mention of the subdivision. That seems like a straightforward argument. If the deed is silent on the matter, perhaps the buyer is free to use the property as they wish.\n\nHowever, there are a few counterarguments.\n\nFirst, the subdivision plan was recorded in 1996, which is a matter of public record. When the builder bought the 10-acre tract in 2002, the deeds included language similar to the first 50 deeds, which likely referenced the subdivision and the school site. So, the builder was aware of the subdivision plan and the designated use of the 10-acre tract.\n\nWhen the builder sold the 40 lots and the 10-acre tract, the deeds for the lots specified they were part of the subdivision, which again tied into the school site.\n\nThen, when the builder sold the 10-acre tract to the buyer in 2008, even though the deed didn't mention the subdivision, the buyer should have been aware of the recorded subdivision plan and the designated use of the property through due diligence or title search.\n\nMoreover, the school board's intention to build a school there suggests that they believed the property was intended for school use.\n\nSo, perhaps the buyer should have been aware of the designated use through the recorded subdivision plan and the history of the property.\n\nOption B says the buyer wins because the dedication was not made to the public in general. Hmm, that's an interesting point. For a dedication to be effective, it generally needs to be accepted by the intended beneficiary.\n\nIn this case, the investor seems to have dedicated the 10-acre tract for school use, and the school board has indicated their intention to build a school there. So, it appears that the school board has accepted the dedication, at least implicitly.\n\nBut perhaps the dedication wasn't formally accepted, or maybe there are some formalities that weren't followed.\n\nOption C says the school district wins because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use. That seems plausible. The subdivision plan set aside the 10 acres for a public school, and the school board has plans to build there. So, the designated use is for public education.\n\nHowever, the buyer is arguing that since their deed didn't mention the subdivision, they're not bound by it. But as I thought earlier, the recorded subdivision plan is part of the chain of title, and subsequent buyers are typically bound by it unless there's a clear release or modification.\n\nOption D says the school district wins because the 10-acre tract constitutes an equitable servitude. An equitable servitude is a restriction on the use of land that runs with the land and is enforceable in equity.\n\nIn this scenario, the subdivision plan created a scheme where the 10-acre tract was designated for school use, benefiting the residential lots in the subdivision.\n\nSo, if the school board is seeking to enforce the designated use of the 10-acre tract for school purposes, it could be seen as an equitable servitude benefiting the subdivision.\n\nBut, to establish an equitable servitude, there needs to be a clear intention to create such a restriction, and it needs to touch and concern the land.\n\nGiven that the subdivision plan was recorded and included the 10-acre tract for school use, and that this was part of the marketing and sales efforts, it's plausible that an equitable servitude was created.\n\nMoreover, the residential lot owners might have a vested interest in the school site being used for its intended purpose, as it was part of the reason they purchased their lots.\n\nBut, the buyer of the 10-acre tract might argue that since their deed didn't mention the subdivision, they're not bound by any restrictive covenants or servitudes related to it.\n\nHowever, generally, recorded subdivision plans are binding on subsequent owners, provided they have notice of the plan, which is typically the case since it's recorded.\n\nSo, even if the buyer's deed didn't specifically mention the subdivision, the recorded plan should still impose restrictions on the use of the 10-acre tract.\n\nAdditionally, the school board's intention to build a school there suggests that they believed the property was designated for school use, and perhaps they had some agreement or understanding with the previous owners.\n\nBut, the buyer has started building a pizzeria, which is inconsistent with the designated school use.\n\nSo, in this situation, the court would likely need to determine whether the 10-acre tract is legally bound by the subdivision plan and the designated school use.\n\nGiven that the subdivision plan was recorded, and the property was part of the subdivision, it's reasonable to assume that the 10-acre tract is subject to the same restrictions as the rest of the subdivision.\n\nMoreover, the school board's plan to build a school there indicates that they considered the property to be designated for school use.\n\nTherefore, the buyer's action in building a pizzeria would be in violation of the designated use.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the court would probably grant judgment for the school district, enjoining the construction of the pizzeria on the 10-acre tract.\n\nBetween the options given:\n\nA. the buyer, because his own deed made no mention of the subdivision.\n\nB. the buyer, because the dedication was not made to the public in general.\n\nC. the school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\n\nD. the school district, because the 10-acre tract constituted an equitable servitude.\n\nI think the best answer is C. the school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\n\nWhile option D also makes sense, option C is more directly related to the designated use of the property for a public school, which is a public use.\n\nOption D refers to an equitable servitude, which is a legal concept that might underpin the restriction, but option C is more straightforward in describing the issue at hand.\n\nTherefore, the court would grant judgment for the school district because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use as a school site.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
