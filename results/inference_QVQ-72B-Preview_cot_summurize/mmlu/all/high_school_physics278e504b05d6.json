                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the gravitational field at the surface of Mars. It says that the radius of Mars is about half that of Earth, and its mass is about one-tenth that of Earth. I need to find which of the given options is closest to the gravitational field at the surface of Mars: 10 N/kg, 4 N/kg, 2 N/kg, or 0.5 N/kg.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the gravitational field strength is. I know that the gravitational field strength at the surface of a planet can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(g\\) is the gravitational field strength,\n\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant,\n\n- \\(M\\) is the mass of the planet,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the radius of the planet.\n\nSo, if I have the mass and radius of both Mars and Earth, I can find the ratio of their gravitational field strengths.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\(g_{\\text{Earth}} = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\), which is the gravitational field strength on Earth,\n\n- \\(M_{\\text{Earth}}\\) is the mass of Earth,\n\n- \\(r_{\\text{Earth}}\\) is the radius of Earth,\n\n- \\(M_{\\text{Mars}} = 0.1 \\times M_{\\text{Earth}}\\), since Mars has one-tenth the mass of Earth,\n\n- \\(r_{\\text{Mars}} = 0.5 \\times r_{\\text{Earth}}\\), since Mars has half the radius of Earth.\n\nI can write the gravitational field strength for Mars as:\n\n\\[g_{\\text{Mars}} = \\frac{GM_{\\text{Mars}}}{r_{\\text{Mars}}^2}\\]\n\nSubstituting the relationships:\n\n\\[g_{\\text{Mars}} = \\frac{G \\times 0.1 M_{\\text{Earth}}}{(0.5 r_{\\text{Earth}})^2} = \\frac{0.1 G M_{\\text{Earth}}}{0.25 r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{0.1}{0.25} \\times \\frac{G M_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = 0.4 \\times g_{\\text{Earth}}\\]\n\nSo, \\(g_{\\text{Mars}} = 0.4 \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 3.92 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\).\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 10 N/kg\n\nB. 4 N/kg\n\nC. 2 N/kg\n\nD. 0.5 N/kg\n\n3.92 m/s\u00b2 is approximately 4 N/kg, so the closest option is B. 4 N/kg.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the formula for gravitational field strength is indeed \\(g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}\\).\n\nGiven that Mars has half the radius and one-tenth the mass of Earth, the ratios are correct.\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[g_{\\text{Mars}} = \\frac{0.1 M_{\\text{Earth}}}{(0.5 r_{\\text{Earth}})^2} = \\frac{0.1}{0.25} \\times g_{\\text{Earth}} = 0.4 \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 3.92 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\]\n\nWhich is closest to option B. 4 N/kg.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this calculation.\n\nIs there any possibility that the distribution of mass affects the gravitational field at the surface? Well, assuming both planets are spherical and have uniform density, which is a reasonable approximation for this problem, the formula \\(g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}\\) should hold.\n\nAlso, are there any units I need to watch out for? The gravitational field is expressed in m/s\u00b2, which is equivalent to N/kg, so the units are consistent.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the gravitational constant G is the same for both planets. Yes, G is a universal constant, so it should be the same for both.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct, and the closest answer is B. 4 N/kg.\n\nJust to explore further, let's think about the actual values for Mars' mass and radius.\n\nThe mass of Mars is approximately 6.39 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 kg, and its radius is approximately 3,389.5 km.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[g_{\\text{Mars}} = \\frac{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{kg s}^2 \\times 6.39 \\times 10^{23} \\, \\text{kg}}{(3.3895 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m})^2} \\]\n\n\\[g_{\\text{Mars}} = \\frac{4.26 \\times 10^{13} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}^2}{1.148 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{m}^2} \\]\n\n\\[g_{\\text{Mars}} \\approx 3.72 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\]\n\nThis is approximately 3.72 m/s\u00b2, which is closer to 4 N/kg than to 3.5 N/kg, but considering the approximations in the problem statement, 4 N/kg is still the closest option.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 4 N/kg.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
