Sugar Ray Leonard. Hmm, I need to figure out who the main actor is in that show.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" is a popular sitcom that was on TV for a while. I think it was about a family with Raymond, who is a sportswriter or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Ray Liotta \u2013 I know Ray Liotta from movies like \"Goodfellas\" and \"Field of Dreams.\" He's a good actor, but I don't recall him being in \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" Maybe he guest-starred at some point, but he's not the main star of the show.\n\nB. Ray Romano \u2013 Now, Ray Romano rings a bell in relation to \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" I think he played the lead character, Raymond Barone. He's known for his comedy roles, and this show was his big break. So, this seems like a likely answer.\n\nC. Ray Parker Jr. \u2013 I remember Ray Parker Jr. from the '80s, especially his hit song \"Ghostbusters.\" He's more of a musician than an actor, so I don't think he was in \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" Maybe he did some acting, but not in this show.\n\nD. Sugar Ray Leonard \u2013 Sugar Ray Leonard is a famous boxer. He transitioned into acting somewhat, appearing in a few movies and TV shows, but I don't think he was the star of \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" He might have made a cameo, but he's not the lead.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Ray Romano is the actor who played Raymond Barone in \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" I think the correct answer is B. Ray Romano.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my memory. The show was about Raymond, a sportswriter, and his family, including his overbearing parents and his brother Robert, who was a police officer. Ray Romano was definitely the lead in that show.\n\nI don't think Ray Liotta was ever part of the main cast; he's more associated with film work. Ray Parker Jr. is primarily a musician, and Sugar Ray Leonard is known for boxing and some acting roles, but not this particular show.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Ray Romano.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Ray Romano}} \\]"
