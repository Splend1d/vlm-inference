                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about primary data. Let's see what it's asking. The options are:\n\nA. Data collected for the first time specifically for a marketing research study.\n\nB. Less time-consuming to acquire and less costly than secondary data.\n\nC. Newly-published results of government investigations.\n\nD. Part of a strategic planning activity to ensure proper resource allocation.\n\nAnd the question is: Primary data are...\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what primary data is. From what I recall, primary data is data that's collected directly by the researcher for a specific purpose or research question. So, it's original data, right?\n\nLet's look at option A: \"Data collected for the first time specifically for a marketing research study.\" This sounds a lot like primary data. It's collected specifically for that study, which means it's original data gathered for that particular purpose.\n\nOption B: \"Less time-consuming to acquire and less costly than secondary data.\" Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. I thought that primary data is usually more time-consuming and costly because you have to collect it yourself. Secondary data, on the other hand, is already collected by someone else, so it should be cheaper and faster to obtain. So, this option seems to be contradicting what I know.\n\nOption C: \"Newly-published results of government investigations.\" This makes me think of secondary data. Government publications are often considered secondary data because they're compiled and analyzed by someone else, not by the researcher themselves.\n\nOption D: \"Part of a strategic planning activity to ensure proper resource allocation.\" This seems a bit vague. Strategic planning can involve both primary and secondary data, but it doesn't specifically define primary data.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A seems to be the correct definition of primary data. It's data collected for the first time specifically for a marketing research study, which aligns with the concept of primary data being directly collected by the researcher for a specific purpose.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Primary data is indeed data that is collected directly by the researcher or through their methods, specifically for the purpose of addressing the research question at hand. So, yes, option A fits this description.\n\nOption B contradicts what I know about primary and secondary data collection costs and time efforts. Primary data collection is generally more time-consuming and costly because it involves designing the research, collecting the data, and analyzing it from scratch.\n\nOption C refers to government publications, which are typically secondary data sources since they compile and analyze data that may have been collected by others or through various means.\n\nOption D is too broad and doesn't specifically define primary data. Strategic planning can involve both primary and secondary data, so it doesn't exclusively describe primary data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: Data collected for the first time specifically for a marketing research study.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that in the context of marketing research, primary data is indeed defined this way. Maybe there's some specific terminology I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about it. In marketing research, primary data is indeed data that is collected specifically for the research project at hand. This can include surveys, interviews, observations, and experiments conducted by the researcher or commissioned by them.\n\nSo, option A seems accurate. But just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be considered primary data in certain contexts.\n\nOption B: Less time-consuming to acquire and less costly than secondary data. This seems incorrect because, as I thought earlier, primary data collection is usually more time-consuming and costly due to the efforts involved in data generation and collection.\n\nOption C: Newly-published results of government investigations. Even if they're newly published, government investigations are typically secondary data sources because they're compiled and analyzed by government agencies, not by the researcher themselves.\n\nOption D: Part of a strategic planning activity to ensure proper resource allocation. This seems more like the application of data rather than the definition of primary data. Strategic planning might use primary data, but it's not the definition of primary data.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I still believe that option A is the correct definition of primary data.\n\nJust to cross-verify, I can recall that in research methodology, primary data is distinguished from secondary data based on who collects the data and for what purpose. Primary data is original data collected by the researcher for their specific research question, whereas secondary data is data that has already been collected and processed by someone else, often for a different purpose.\n\nTherefore, option A perfectly fits the definition of primary data in the context of marketing research.\n\nSo, my final answer is option A: Data collected for the first time specifically for a marketing research study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
