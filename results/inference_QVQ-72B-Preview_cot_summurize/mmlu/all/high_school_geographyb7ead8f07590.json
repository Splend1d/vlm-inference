Let's think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A: desert cities. I know that Ankara is located in the central Anatolian plateau of Turkey, which is mostly a steppe climate, not exactly a desert. Islamabad is in Pakistan, which has parts that are desert-like, especially in the west, but Islamabad is situated in the northern part near the Himalayas, which is more mountainous and not a desert. So, I don't think desert cities is the right choice.\n\nOption B: forward-thrust capitals. I'm not entirely sure what this means, but I think it refers to capitals that are moved from their original locations to new sites, often for strategic or developmental reasons. Ankara was made the capital of Turkey in 1923, replacing Istanbul, primarily for its central location and symbolic distance from the Ottoman past. Islamabad was built as the new capital of Pakistan in the 1960s, replacing Karachi, mainly for similar reasons of central location and strategic importance. So, both cities became capitals after their countries gained independence and were chosen for forward-looking reasons. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C: old colonial capitals. Ankara was part of the Ottoman Empire, which was more of an empire than a colony. Islamabad was established after Pakistan gained independence from British rule. Neither was really an old colonial capital in the way we think of cities like New Delhi or Yangon, which were directly administered by colonial powers. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption D: rival cities. I'm not sure what this refers to. Maybe cities that compete with each other economically or culturally, but I don't see a direct rivalry between Ankara and Islamabad. They're in different regions and don't seem to be competing in any significant way.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B, forward-thrust capitals, seems to be the most appropriate description for both Ankara and Islamabad. Both cities were established as new capitals after their respective countries' independence, shifting from previous capital cities to locations that were more centrally located and symbolized new beginnings for their nations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
