                    "text": "So I have this question about writs of certiorari, and I need to pick the most accurate statement. I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I think I can figure it out by eliminating some options and seeing which one makes the most sense.\n\nOption A says that fewer than 5% of petitions for writs of certiorari are granted by the Supreme Court. Hmm, I recall that the Supreme Court receives a lot of petitions every year, like thousands, but they only agree to hear a small fraction of them. Maybe around 100 cases or so. So, if they receive, say, 7000 petitions and only accept 100, that's about 1.4%, which is indeed less than 5%. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B states that the Supreme Court grants writs of certiorari only when there is a \"circuit split.\" I've heard of circuit splits before. I think they happen when different appellate courts have conflicting rulings on the same issue. It makes sense that the Supreme Court would want to step in to resolve those conflicts to ensure uniformity in the law. But is \"only\" the right word here? I doubt they only hear cases with circuit splits. There must be other reasons for granting certiorari, like cases involving important constitutional questions or when there's a need to clarify existing precedent. So, I think this statement is too absolute.\n\nOption C says that the lower court's ruling is overturned if the Supreme Court denies a writ of certiorari. Wait a minute, I think denying certiorari means the Supreme Court chooses not to hear the case. In that case, doesn't the lower court's decision stand as is? So, if the Supreme Court denies cert, the lower court's ruling remains in effect, right? It's not overturned; it's just left unchanged. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D claims that only the solicitor general may petition for a writ of certiorari. I'm not sure about this one. The solicitor general is the person who represents the federal government before the Supreme Court, but I don't think they have exclusive rights to petition for certiorari. I believe that any party to a case can petition for certiorari, whether it's the plaintiff, the defendant, or the government. So, this seems too restrictive.\n\nLooking back, option A seems to be the most accurate statement based on my understanding. The Supreme Court does receive a large number of petitions for writs of certiorari and only grants a small percentage of them, certainly less than 5%. The other options either contain inaccuracies or are too limiting.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check my understanding of each option:\n\n- A: Fewer than 5% of petitions for writs of certiorari are granted by the Supreme Court.\n\n- B: The Supreme Court grants writs of certiorari only when there is a \"circuit split.\"\n\n- C: The lower court's ruling is overturned if the Supreme Court denies a writ of certiorari.\n\n- D: Only the solicitor general may petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\nI'm pretty confident that A is correct. B is incorrect because the Supreme Court hears cases for various reasons beyond just circuit splits. C is wrong because denying certiorari typically means the lower court's decision stands, not that it's overturned. D is incorrect because any party to a case can petition for certiorari, not just the solicitor general.\n\nSo, my final answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
