                    "text": "So I have this question about cross-price elasticity of demand. It says that a positive sign on cross-price elasticity of demand indicates that the two products are:\n\nA. luxuries.\n\nB. necessities.\n\nC. substitutes.\n\nD. complements.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what cross-price elasticity of demand is all about. I remember that cross-price elasticity measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. The sign of the elasticity tells us about the relationship between the two goods.\n\nFirst, let's think about substitutes. If two goods are substitutes, like tea and coffee, when the price of coffee goes up, people might switch to tea. So, if the price of coffee increases, the demand for tea would increase. That means the cross-price elasticity between tea and coffee would be positive because when one's price goes up, the other's quantity demanded goes up.\n\nOn the other hand, if two goods are complements, like cars and gasoline, when the price of cars goes up, the demand for gasoline might decrease because fewer people are buying cars and thus needing gasoline. So, in this case, the cross-price elasticity would be negative because when one's price goes up, the other's quantity demanded goes down.\n\nLuxuries and necessities, I think, relate more to income elasticity of demand rather than cross-price elasticity. Luxuries are goods that people buy more of as their income increases, and necessities are goods that people buy regardless of income changes, though their consumption might not increase as much with higher income. So, I don't think luxuries or necessities directly relate to cross-price elasticity.\n\nLet me double-check that. Income elasticity of demand measures how quantity demanded changes in response to changes in income, whereas cross-price elasticity measures how quantity demanded of one good changes in response to changes in the price of another good.\n\nSo, given that, the options A and B\u2014luxuries and necessities\u2014are more related to income elasticity, not cross-price elasticity.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be either C or D. But which one?\n\nWait, the question is asking what a positive sign on cross-price elasticity indicates about the relationship between the two products. As I thought earlier, if it's positive, that suggests that the goods are substitutes because when the price of one goes up, the demand for the other goes up.\n\nIf they were complements, the cross-price elasticity would be negative, meaning when the price of one goes up, the demand for the other goes down.\n\nSo, based on that, the answer should be C. substitutes.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose we have two products, A and B. If the price of A increases and, as a result, the quantity demanded of B increases, that indicates that A and B are substitutes. The cross-price elasticity would be positive in this case.\n\nConversely, if A and B were complements, and the price of A increases, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded of B, the cross-price elasticity would be negative.\n\nTherefore, a positive cross-price elasticity indicates that the goods are substitutes.\n\nI think that's the right understanding. So, the answer is C. substitutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
