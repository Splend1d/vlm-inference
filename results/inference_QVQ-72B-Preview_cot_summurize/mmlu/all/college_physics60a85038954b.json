                    "text": "So I have this question about bosons and fermions, and I need to figure out which statement is true. I remember that bosons and fermions are two types of particles distinguished by their spin and how they behave in quantum mechanics, especially regarding the Pauli exclusion principle and the symmetry of their wave functions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what defines a boson and what defines a fermion. Bosons are particles that have integer spin values (like 0, 1, 2, etc.), and they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. Fermions, on the other hand, have half-integer spin values (like 1/2, 3/2, etc.) and follow Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n\nOne of the key differences is how they behave when you swap two identical particles. For bosons, their wave function remains the same (it's symmetric), which means that the probability distribution doesn't change. For fermions, their wave function changes sign (it's antisymmetric) when you swap two particles. This antisymmetry leads to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nSo, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Bosons have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nWait, I thought bosons have symmetric wave functions, but they don't obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The principle is associated with fermions, right? So, this seems partially correct but not entirely accurate.\n\nB. Bosons have antisymmetric wave functions and do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nNo, that can't be right. Bosons have symmetric wave functions, not antisymmetric. And again, they don't obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nC. Fermions have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nHmm, fermions have antisymmetric wave functions, not symmetric. But they do obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThis seems accurate. Fermions do have antisymmetric wave functions due to the exchange of particles, and they obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nSo, based on this, option D should be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the symmetry of the wave function for identical particles is determined by their spin statistics. Bosons, with integer spin, have symmetric wave functions under particle exchange. Fermions, with half-integer spin, have antisymmetric wave functions under particle exchange.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle is a direct consequence of the antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions. It states that no two fermions can be in the exact same quantum state simultaneously. Bosons, being symmetric, do not follow this principle; multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state, which is why, for example, lasers and Bose-Einstein condensates are possible.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is indeed option D: Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
