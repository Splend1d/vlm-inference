                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Rawls and his theory of the original position. He thinks that if people were in this hypothetical situation where they don't know anything about themselves, like their social status, abilities, or even their moral views, they would agree on certain principles of justice. Now, the question is about why these parties wouldn't accept utilitarianism in that scenario.\n\nUtilitarianism is this idea that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being. So, it's all about the greatest good for the greatest number. But Rawls seems to think that in the original position, people wouldn't go for that. The options are:\n\nA. It's too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness.\n\nB. Doing so would be too risky.\n\nC. It requires us to do unjust things, like executing innocent people.\n\nD. They would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism.\n\nHmm, let's think about each option.\n\nOption A says it's too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness. That makes some sense because in the original position, people don't know what their own interests are, so they might not be able to calculate what would make the most people happy. But is that the main reason Rawls thinks they'd reject utilitarianism?\n\nOption B says that accepting utilitarianism would be too risky. Maybe because utilitarianism could lead to situations where the majority's happiness is prioritized at the expense of the minority, and since everyone is behind the veil of ignorance, they don't know if they'll be in that majority or minority. So, they might not want to take that chance.\n\nOption C mentions that utilitarianism can require doing unjust things, like executing innocent people, if it leads to greater overall happiness. Rawls was critical of utilitarianism for this reason, arguing that it doesn't respect individual rights and can justify immoral actions in the name of the greater good.\n\nOption D suggests that they wouldn't accept utilitarianism because they don't know about it due to the veil of ignorance. But that seems a bit simplistic. The veil of ignorance is about not knowing specific facts about oneself, not about being ignorant of philosophical ideas.\n\nNow, I need to pick the best answer. Rawls was particularly known for critiquing utilitarianism on the grounds that it doesn't guarantee fair distribution of rights and resources. He thought that in the original position, people would prefer principles that ensure basic liberties and a just distribution of resources, rather than a system that might sacrifice some individuals' rights for the greater good.\n\nGiven that, option C seems quite relevant because it directly addresses one of Rawls' main criticisms of utilitarianism\u2014that it can justify actions that are intuitively unjust, like harming innocents if it leads to more overall happiness.\n\nBut let's consider if there's a better option. Option B talks about risk. Rawls did emphasize the idea of maximizing the worst-case scenario, which is related to the maximin principle. Accepting utilitarianism might be seen as risky because one doesn't know if they'll end up being part of a minority whose interests are overlooked.\n\nHowever, I think option C is more directly aligned with Rawls' criticism of utilitarianism. He believed that utilitarianism fails to respect certain moral constraints, particularly individual rights, which are essential in his theory of justice.\n\nSo, I would go with option C: it requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
