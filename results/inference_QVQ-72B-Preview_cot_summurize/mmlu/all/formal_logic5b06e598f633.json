The symbols are:\n\n- e: Earth\n\n- j: Jupiter\n\n- Bxy: x is bigger than y\n\nSo, I need to represent the idea that Earth is not bigger than Jupiter using these symbols.\n\nFirst, if I were to express \"Earth is bigger than Jupiter\" in predicate logic, it would be B(e, j). But since it's \"isn't bigger than,\" that means it's not true that Earth is bigger than Jupiter. So, I need to negate that statement.\n\nIn logic, negation is usually represented by \"~\". So, to say \"it is not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter,\" I would write ~B(e, j).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. ~Bje\n\nThis seems close, but the order of the letters is a bit confusing. It might be a typo or misplacement of symbols.\n\nB. Bej\n\nThis is B(e, j), which means \"Earth is bigger than Jupiter.\" But that's the opposite of what we want to say.\n\nC. Bje~\n\nThis looks like a mix-up. It's not clear what this represents.\n\nD. ~Bej\n\nThis seems like it could be \"~B(e, j)\", which would mean \"it is not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter,\" which is what we're trying to express.\n\nSo, comparing options A and D:\n\nOption A is ~Bje, which seems to have the letters in a different order, possibly indicating a mistake in ordering.\n\nOption D is ~Bej, which seems correctly to negate the predicate B(e, j).\n\nTherefore, the best translation should be D. ~Bej.\n\nWait a minute, but in standard logical notation, the predicate comes first, followed by the arguments, and negation is applied to the whole predicate application.\n\nSo, B(e, j) is \"Earth is bigger than Jupiter.\"\n\nTo negate it, it's ~B(e, j).\n\nSo, writing it as ~Bej seems correct.\n\nOption A, ~Bje, might be an alternative way of writing it, but in standard logical notation, the standard form is ~B(e, j), which would be ~Bej.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct choice.\n\nI think the confusion might come from different conventions in writing logical expressions, but in standard logical notation, D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
