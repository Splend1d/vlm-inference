The Paper Chase.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these shows isn't set in the U.S. I'm pretty familiar with most of them, but just to be sure, maybe I should go through each one and recall where they're set.\n\nStarting with \"Picket Fences.\" I remember that show; it was about a law firm in a small town. I think the town was called Rome, Wisconsin. That's definitely in the United States. So, A. Picket Fences is set in the U.S.\n\nNext is \"M*A*S*H.\" That stands for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. It was set during the Korean War, and the units were based in South Korea. Wait a minute, Korea is not in the United States. But hold on, the show was about American soldiers and doctors working in Korea, but the location itself is in Korea, which is not in the U.S. So, maybe that's the one.\n\nBut let me check \"Northern Exposure\" next. I recall that it was set in a small town in Alaska, called Cicely. Alaska is a state of the United States, so that means it's set in the U.S. So, C. Northern Exposure is set in the U.S.\n\nLastly, \"The Paper Chase.\" I think that was about a law school, maybe Harvard Law School? Harvard is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is definitely in the United States. So, D. The Paper Chase is also set in the U.S.\n\nSo, based on this, \"M*A*S*H\" is set in Korea, which is not in the United States. Therefore, the answer should be B. M*A*S*H.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. \"M*A*S*H\" was primarily set in a fictional Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Korea during the Korean War. Although the characters were American, the setting was indeed in Korea. So, that confirms it's not set in the U.S.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any part of the show that's set in the U.S. I remember that some episodes might have flashbacks or dreams set in the U.S., but the main action was in Korea. So, overall, the series is not set in the United States.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The correct answer is B. M*A*S*H.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
