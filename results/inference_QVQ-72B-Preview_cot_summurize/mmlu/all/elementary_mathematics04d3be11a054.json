                    "text": "So I have this problem: 8 \u2022 (\u22127) \u2022 (\u22121), and I need to simplify it using the Associative Property of Multiplication. I'm looking at the options, and they're all numbers, but I need to make sure I understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Associative Property of Multiplication says that when multiplying three or more numbers, the way you group them doesn't affect the result. So, for example, (a \u2022 b) \u2022 c is the same as a \u2022 (b \u2022 c). That makes sense.\n\nSo, in this problem, I have three numbers: 8, -7, and -1. I can group them in different ways, but the product should be the same no matter how I group them.\n\nLet me try grouping them differently to see if I get the same answer each time.\n\nFirst, I'll do (8 \u2022 -7) \u2022 -1.\n\n8 times -7 is -56. Then, -56 times -1 is 56.\n\nSo, that gives me 56.\n\nNow, let's try 8 \u2022 (-7 \u2022 -1).\n\nFirst, -7 times -1 is 7. Then, 8 times 7 is 56.\n\nAgain, I get 56.\n\nHmm, both ways I get 56. But let's see if there's another way to group them, just to be sure.\n\nWait, there are only three numbers, so there are only two ways to group them: (a\u2022b)\u2022c or a\u2022(b\u2022c). I just did both, and both gave me 56.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \u221263\n\nB. 56\n\nC. 48\n\nD. \u221256\n\nSo, 56 is option B.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there a simpler way to look at this without changing the grouping?\n\nI mean, I could just multiply the numbers in order.\n\n8 times -7 is -56, and then -56 times -1 is 56.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the negative signs.\n\nI know that when I multiply two negative numbers, I get a positive number.\n\nSo, -7 times -1 is positive 7.\n\nThen, 8 times 7 is 56.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it's straightforward multiplication with the associative property showing that the grouping doesn't matter.\n\nI think the answer is clearly 56, which is option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there any chance that the associative property doesn't hold here? No, because the associative property applies to all real numbers, and these are just integers.\n\nAlso, checking the other options:\n\nOption A is -63. That would be 9 times -7, but that's not relevant here.\n\nOption C is 48. That might be 8 times 6, but again, not related to this problem.\n\nOption D is -56, which is what you get if you multiply 8 and -7, but then multiply by -1 incorrectly.\n\nSo, no, the only correct answer is B, 56.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]"
