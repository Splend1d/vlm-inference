                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Of the following sorting algorithms, which has a running time that is LEAST dependent on the initial ordering of the input? The options are A. Insertion sort, B. Quicksort, C. Merge sort, D. Selection sort.\"\n\nAlright, I need to understand what this question is asking. It wants to know which sorting algorithm's performance is least affected by how the input data is ordered initially. In other words, no matter how the data is arranged\u2014whether it's already sorted, reverse sorted, or completely random\u2014the algorithm should have a consistent performance, ideally its worst-case or average-case time complexity.\n\nSo, I need to look at each algorithm's time complexity in different scenarios:\n\n1. **Best case**: when the input is already sorted.\n\n2. **Worst case**: when the input is arranged in the worst possible way for the algorithm.\n\n3. **Average case**: when the input is randomly ordered.\n\nThe algorithm that shows the least variation in running time across these scenarios is the one we're looking for.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n**A. Insertion sort**\n\n- Best case: O(n), when the array is already sorted.\n\n- Worst case: O(n\u00b2), when the array is reverse sorted.\n\n- Average case: O(n\u00b2), for random input.\n\nHere, the best-case time is better than the average and worst cases. So, insertion sort's performance does depend on the initial ordering.\n\n**B. Quicksort**\n\n- Best case: O(n log n), typically when the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal parts.\n\n- Worst case: O(n\u00b2), when the pivot is the smallest or largest element every time.\n\n- Average case: O(n log n), for random input.\n\nQuicksort's performance can vary significantly based on the pivot selection, which is influenced by the initial ordering. However, with techniques like median-of-three or random pivot selection, we can mitigate this dependency. But generally, quicksort's performance can be affected by the initial order.\n\n**C. Merge sort**\n\n- Best case: O(n log n)\n\n- Worst case: O(n log n)\n\n- Average case: O(n log n)\n\nMerge sort has a consistent time complexity of O(n log n) regardless of the initial ordering of the input. It always divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together.\n\nThis suggests that merge sort's performance is not dependent on the initial ordering of the input, as its time complexity remains the same in best, worst, and average cases.\n\n**D. Selection sort**\n\n- Best case: O(n\u00b2)\n\n- Worst case: O(n\u00b2)\n\n- Average case: O(n\u00b2)\n\nSelection sort always has a time complexity of O(n\u00b2), regardless of the input order. It doesn't take advantage of already sorted elements and performs the same number of comparisons and swaps in any case.\n\nComparing all these, merge sort and selection sort both have a consistent time complexity across different input orders. However, selection sort is less efficient with a O(n\u00b2) time complexity, whereas merge sort has a better time complexity of O(n log n).\n\nTherefore, between merge sort and selection sort, merge sort is more efficient and has a running time that is least dependent on the initial ordering of the input.\n\nBut wait, the question is specifically about which algorithm's running time is least dependent on the initial ordering. Both merge sort and selection sort have consistent performance across different input orders, but merge sort is more efficient. So, in terms of time complexity, merge sort is superior.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any scenario where merge sort's performance might still vary based on the input order. Merge sort is a comparison-based sort that divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges them back. The merge step's efficiency doesn't depend on the order of elements within each half as long as they are sorted individually. So, regardless of the initial order, merge sort performs the same amount of work.\n\nSelection sort, on the other hand, always performs the same number of comparisons and swaps, regardless of the input order, hence its consistent O(n\u00b2) time complexity.\n\nGiven that, both algorithms have consistent performance across different input orders, but merge sort is more efficient. However, the question is specifically about which algorithm's running time is least dependent on the initial ordering, not necessarily which one is the fastest.\n\nSince both merge sort and selection sort have consistent performance, but merge sort is faster, I think the answer is merge sort.\n\nWait, but selection sort also has a consistent performance regardless of input order, but it's less efficient. So, if I have to choose the one with the least dependency on initial ordering, and efficiency is also a consideration, merge sort is the better choice.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is strictly about dependency on initial ordering, and not about efficiency, then both could be considered, but since merge sort is more efficient and has no dependency on initial ordering, it's the better answer.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Merge sort.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Merge sort}} \\]"
