                    "text": "So I have this problem here: compute 22 / 2 + 9. And there are some multiple-choice options: A. 10, B. 11, C. 20, D. 2. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember the order of operations in math. I think it's PEMDAS, right? Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and then Addition and Subtraction. So, according to that, I should do the division before the addition.\n\nSo, 22 divided by 2 is... let's see. 2 times 11 is 22, so that should be 11. Then, I add 9 to that. 11 plus 9 is 20. So, according to that, the answer should be 20.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that the addition could come before the division? No, I don't think so. Division should definitely come before addition in the order of operations.\n\nLet me double-check. PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, in 22 / 2 + 9, I first do 22 / 2, which is 11, and then add 9, which is 20.\n\nI think the answer is C. 20.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe if I consider the entire expression as 22 divided by (2 + 9), but that would be 22 / 11, which is 2, and that's option D. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is written as 22 / 2 + 9, without parentheses.\n\nWait, maybe if I consider the division and addition simultaneously, but no, the division should definitely come first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation, like following a different order of operations, but I can't think of any standard that would suggest doing the addition first.\n\nLet me consider the units. If 22 is in some unit, say apples, then dividing by 2 reduces the number of apples, and adding 9 would add more apples. So, 22 apples divided by 2 is 11 apples, plus 9 apples is 20 apples. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it in terms of fractions, 22 divided by 2 is the same as 22 times one-half, which is 11, and then adding 9 gives 20. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nMaybe I can plug in the numbers into a calculator to verify, but since it's a simple calculation, I should be able to do it mentally.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to convert the division into multiplication by the reciprocal. So, 22 times (1/2) plus 9, which is 11 plus 9, equaling 20.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The key is remembering the order of operations and performing the division before the addition.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any context that might change this interpretation. For example, if there are units involved or if this is part of a larger equation, but since it's presented as a standalone problem, I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nAlso, considering the multiple-choice options, 20 is one of them, so it's possible. Option A is 10, which would be if I mistakenly added 9 and 2 to get 11 and then divided by 2, but that doesn't make sense. Option B is 11, which is just 22 divided by 2, but that ignores the addition. Option D is 2, which would be if I did 22 divided by 11, but that's not what's written.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
