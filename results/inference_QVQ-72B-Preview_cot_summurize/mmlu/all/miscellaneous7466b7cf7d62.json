Hmm, I need to figure out which planet these moons belong to.\n\nFirst off, I know that planets have moons, and some planets have a lot of them. Jupiter is famous for having many moons, like Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. But the question mentions Phoebe, Dione, and Helene. Let me think about that.\n\nPhoebe is a name I've heard before in relation to Saturn. I think Saturn has a moon called Phoebe. It's one of its outer moons, maybe? Dione also sounds familiar; I believe it's another moon of Saturn. And Helene, I think that's also associated with Saturn.\n\nLet me double-check that. If Phoebe, Dione, and Helene are all moons of Saturn, then the answer should be B. Saturn. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nI recall that Jupiter has many moons, but I don't remember Phoebe being one of them. Jupiter's moons include the Galilean moons\u2014Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto\u2014and then a lot of smaller inner and outer moons, but Phoebe isn't among them.\n\nNeptune has Triton and Nereid, and some smaller ones, but again, Phoebe, Dione, and Helene don't ring a bell there.\n\nPluto, although sometimes considered a dwarf planet, does have moons, like Charon, but definitely not Phoebe, Dione, or Helene.\n\nSo, based on what I know, these three moons\u2014Phoebe, Dione, and Helene\u2014all belong to Saturn. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Saturn.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap:\n\n- Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and many others, but not Phoebe, Dione, or Helene.\n\n- Saturn: Phoebe, Dione, Helene, among others like Titan and Enceladus.\n\n- Neptune: Triton, Nereid, and others, but not the ones listed in the question.\n\n- Pluto: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, but none of the mentioned moons.\n\nSo, yeah, the answer is definitely B. Saturn.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
