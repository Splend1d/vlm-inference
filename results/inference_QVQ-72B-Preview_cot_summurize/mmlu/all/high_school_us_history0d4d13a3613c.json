                    "text": "So I have this question here about a Supreme Court decision that validated the practice of \"separate but equal\" facilities for blacks and whites. The options are Marbury v. Madison, Bradwell v. Illinois, Plessy v. Ferguson, and Holden v. Hardy. Hmm, I think I remember something about \"separate but equal\" from history class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"separate but equal\" means. I think it's about segregating people based on race but making sure that the facilities for each race are equal in quality. Like, having separate schools or bathrooms for black and white people, but they should be equal in terms of how good they are. But I also recall that in practice, the facilities for black people were often not equal to those for white people.\n\nNow, the question is asking which Supreme Court decision validated this practice. Let me think about each option:\n\nA. Marbury v. Madison \u2013 I think this is the case where the Supreme Court established its power of judicial review. It's from 1803, and it's more about the balance of power between the branches of government. I don't remember it being about segregation or \"separate but equal\" facilities. So, probably not this one.\n\nB. Bradwell v. Illinois \u2013 This case rings a bell. I think it was about a woman who was denied a law license because of her sex. So, it's about gender equality in the profession, not about racial segregation. Not the right one.\n\nC. Plessy v. Ferguson \u2013 Now, this sounds familiar in the context of segregation. I think this is the case where the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws, as long as the facilities were equal. The phrase \"separate but equal\" comes from this decision, I believe. Let me confirm that.\n\nD. Holden v. Hardy \u2013 I'm not as familiar with this case. I think it had to do with state regulation of working hours or something like that. It doesn't seem related to segregation or \"separate but equal\" facilities.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, Plessy v. Ferguson is the case that established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. That was in 1896, I think. Then, later, in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the Supreme Court overturned this doctrine, declaring that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider if any of the other cases could possibly be related to \"separate but equal.\" Marbury v. Madison is about judicial review, Bradwell v. Illinois is about gender equality in the profession, and Holden v. Hardy is about economic regulations. None of these seem directly related to segregation or the \"separate but equal\" principle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nWait a minute, the quote in the question is from Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. The question is asking in which decision the Supreme Court validated the practice of \"separate but equal\" facilities. So, since Brown v. Board of Education overturned the doctrine, the doctrine must have been established in a previous case, which I believe is Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nJust to double-check, here's a brief summary:\n\n- Plessy v. Ferguson (1896): Established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, allowing segregated facilities as long as they were equal.\n\n- Brown v. Board of Education (1954): Overturned Plessy v. Ferguson, declaring that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal and violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSo, given this background, it's clear that Plessy v. Ferguson is the case that validated \"separate but equal\" facilities.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is C. Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
