                    "text": "So I have this question about how paying out salaries affects a corporation's assets and liabilities. The question is about Corporation X paying out $300,000 in salaries and what happens to its assets and liabilities. There are four options provided, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what paying salaries means in accounting terms. When a company pays salaries, it's essentially paying its employees for their work. This payment is an expense for the company, and it reduces the company's cash balance.\n\nSo, salary expense is increased by the amount paid, which is $300,000 in this case. At the same time, the cash, which is an asset, decreases by the same amount.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000\n\nB. Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000\n\nC. Salary expense is decreased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000\n\nD. Salary expense is decreased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000\n\nFrom my understanding, paying salaries should increase the salary expense (because it's an expense) and decrease the cash (an asset).\n\nOption A says salary expense increases by $300,000 and cash increases by $300,000. That doesn't make sense because paying salaries should decrease cash, not increase it.\n\nOption B says salary expense increases by $300,000 and cash decreases by $300,000. This seems correct because paying salaries should increase the expense and decrease the cash.\n\nOption C says salary expense decreases by $300,000 and cash increases by $300,000. This is the opposite of what should happen. Decreasing salary expense and increasing cash isn't what happens when you pay salaries.\n\nOption D says salary expense decreases by $300,000 and cash decreases by $300,000. Again, this doesn't align with the act of paying salaries.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIn accounting, when a company pays salaries, it records salary expense and simultaneously reduces cash. So, salary expense increases, and cash decreases. That's straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other accounts affected or any exceptions to this.\n\nFor example, if the company pays salaries in arrears, maybe there's an accrued liability that's being settled, but the question doesn't specify that.\n\nAlso, sometimes, companies might have prepaid expenses or something, but again, the question is straightforward: paying out $300,000 in salaries.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should be option B: salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the journal entry for paying salaries.\n\nDebit: Salary Expense $300,000\n\nCredit: Cash $300,000\n\nThis shows that salary expense increases (debit), and cash decreases (credit).\n\nTherefore, salary expense increases by $300,000, and cash decreases by $300,000.\n\nYes, option B is correct.\n\nI should avoid overcomplicating these questions. Sometimes, it's just straightforward accounting entries.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
