                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out who should win this lawsuit. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a landlord who owns a three-story house. He leases it to a tenant for 10 years. In the lease, the tenant agrees to pay $300 monthly rent and also to pay the taxes on the property during the lease term. Importantly, the lease says that the tenant can't assign or sublease the property without permission.\n\nFor two years, everything goes fine. The tenant and their family live in the house. But then, the tenant assigns their lease to a student. The assignment is in writing and says that the student will pay the $300 monthly rent, but it doesn't mention anything about paying taxes. The student didn't know about the prohibition against assignments, but the assignment was in writing and expressly provided for paying rent, just not taxes.\n\nThe landlord never objects to this assignment, which is key. So, even though the lease said no assignments, the landlord doesn't complain when the tenant assigns it to the student. Then, six months after the assignment, the landlord sells the property to a new owner.\n\nNow, the student hasn't been paying the taxes on the property. The new owner pays the taxes and sues the student to get that money back. The question is, who should win this lawsuit?\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The new owner.\n\nB. The student, because he didn't contract to pay taxes.\n\nC. The student, because the covenant to pay taxes won't \"run with the land\" unless clearly expressed in the original lease.\n\nD. The student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and doesn't \"run with the land.\"\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what it means for a covenant to \"run with the land.\" Generally, covenants in leases can be either personal to the parties or they can bind successors in interest. For a covenant to run with the land, it usually needs to touch and concern the property and be intended to bind successors.\n\nIn this case, the original lease had a covenant that the tenant would pay taxes. But the assignment from the tenant to the student was silent on taxes. The student is now occupying the property under this assignment.\n\nThe new owner is trying to hold the student responsible for the taxes based on the original lease's covenant. But the student didn't sign the original lease; he signed an assignment from the tenant that only\u627f\u8bfa to pay rent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the covenant to pay taxes binds the student, who is not a party to the original lease.\n\nOption B says the student shouldn't have to pay because he didn't contract to pay taxes. That seems straightforward. He agreed to pay rent, but nothing about taxes.\n\nOption C mentions that the covenant won't \"run with the land\" unless clearly expressed in the original lease. But the original lease does clearly express that the tenant must pay taxes. So, that part is met. But does that obligation bind the assignee, the student, who wasn't a party to the original lease?\n\nOption D says that the covenant is merely collateral and doesn't \"run with the land.\" I need to understand what \"collateral\" means in this context. Generally, collateral covenants are those that don't touch and concern the property but are more personal to the parties.\n\nSo, perhaps the covenant to pay taxes is considered collateral and doesn't bind successors like the student.\n\nBut, on the other hand, taxes are directly related to the property, so maybe it does touch and concern the property.\n\nWait, but the student is not a party to the original lease, and the assignment only mentions rent.\n\nAlso, the landlord didn't object to the assignment, so maybe some of the original lease terms don't apply to the assignee.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think about privity of contract. Generally, only parties to a contract are bound by it. So, the student isn't bound by the original lease unless there's some principle that extends the obligation to pay taxes to him.\n\nBut, in lease assignments, sometimes covenants do bind assignees, especially if they are covenants that touch and concern the property.\n\nTaxes definitely touch and concern the property, as they are directly related to the property's use and ownership.\n\nSo, perhaps the covenant to pay taxes does run with the land and binds the assignee, the student.\n\nBut, the assignment was silent on taxes, and the student may have reasonably assumed that since it wasn't mentioned, he didn't have to pay taxes.\n\nAlso, the tenant had breached the lease by assigning without permission, although the landlord didn't object.\n\nMaybe the landlord's acquiescence in the assignment means that the student isn't bound by all the terms of the original lease.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the student is still bound by the covenant to pay taxes because it's a fundamental part of the lease.\n\nBut, in practice, when a lease is assigned, the assignee is generally bound by the covenants in the lease, provided they had notice of them.\n\nThe student was unaware of the prohibition against assignments, but he did enter into an assignment that expressly provided for paying rent, implying that he was aware of some lease terms.\n\nHowever, since the assignment was silent on taxes, he might not have known about that particular covenant.\n\nBut, generally, an assignee of a lease is bound by the covenants in the lease, including those that touch and concern the property, like paying taxes.\n\nSo, even if the student didn't know about the tax covenant, he might still be liable for it.\n\nBut, in this case, the landlord didn't object to the assignment, which might imply that he consented to it, and perhaps the student relied on that consent.\n\nAlternatively, the landlord's failure to object might mean that he waived his right to enforce some of the lease terms against the student.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between the landlord and the new owner.\n\nThe landlord sold the property to the new owner after the assignment to the student.\n\nThe new owner is now suing the student for the taxes that weren't paid.\n\nBut the new owner wasn't a party to the original lease or the assignment.\n\nWait, the landlord conveyed his property interest to the new owner.\n\nDoes that include the leasehold interest?\n\nProbably, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAssuming it does, the new owner steps into the landlord's shoes regarding the lease.\n\nSo, the new owner can enforce the lease against the tenant and assignees.\n\nBut, in this case, the student is an assignee, and the lease had a covenant against assignments without consent.\n\nThe landlord didn't object, so perhaps the prohibition against assignments is waived.\n\nBut, even if waived, does that mean the student isn't bound by the covenant to pay taxes?\n\nMaybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the student is still bound by the covenant to pay taxes because it's a covenant that runs with the land.\n\nBut, as per option C, unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease that the covenant runs with the land, it may not bind the student.\n\nWait, the original lease stipulated that the tenant may not assign or sublease without permission.\n\nThe tenant did assign without permission, but the landlord didn't object.\n\nSo, perhaps the assignment is valid, and the student is bound by the lease's covenants.\n\nBut, the assignment itself is silent on taxes.\n\nSo, does that mean the student isn't bound to pay taxes?\n\nProbably not, because the lease required the tenant to pay taxes, and the assignment didn't modify that covenant.\n\nSo, unless the assignment explicitly relieved the assignee of that obligation, the student is still bound by it.\n\nBut, the assignment was in writing and expressly provided for paying rent, but was silent on taxes.\n\nSo, perhaps the student is still bound by the covenant to pay taxes.\n\nBut, the student might argue that since the assignment didn't mention taxes, he didn't agree to pay them.\n\nHowever, in law, when you assign a lease, you generally take on all the obligations of the lease, unless the landlord agrees otherwise.\n\nHere, the landlord didn't object to the assignment, which might imply consent, but didn't specify any modifications to the lease terms.\n\nSo, perhaps the student is still bound by the covenant to pay taxes.\n\nBut, the student was unaware of the prohibition against assignments, and presumably unaware of the covenant to pay taxes.\n\nDoes that matter?\n\nGenerally, ignorance of the lease terms doesn't excuse an assignee from complying with them, especially if the assignee had reason to know about them.\n\nBut, in this case, the assignment was in writing and silent on taxes, which might lead the student to believe that taxes weren't his responsibility.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the student should have inquired about the lease terms before agreeing to the assignment.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nThe new owner has paid the taxes and is suing the student for reimbursement.\n\nThe student is in possession of the property under the assignment.\n\nThe lease required the tenant to pay taxes.\n\nThe assignment didn't relieve the assignee of that obligation.\n\nSo, perhaps the student is still liable to pay the taxes.\n\nBut, the new owner didn't have a direct contract with the student.\n\nDoes that matter?\n\nWell, the new owner stepped into the landlord's shoes regarding the lease.\n\nSo, the new owner can enforce the lease against the tenant and assignees.\n\nTherefore, the new owner can seek to hold the student liable for the taxes.\n\nBut, in practice, if the student didn't agree to pay taxes in the assignment, maybe the new owner can't enforce that particular covenant against him.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the student is only liable for rent, as per the assignment, and the new owner has to look elsewhere for the taxes.\n\nWait, but the lease clearly required the tenant to pay taxes, and the assignment didn't modify that.\n\nSo, unless the assignment explicitly relieved the student of that obligation, he should still be responsible for paying taxes.\n\nBut, since the assignment was silent on taxes, it's unclear.\n\nMaybe the student is only responsible for rent, as per the assignment, and not taxes.\n\nBut, that seems unfair, because the lease clearly required the tenant to pay taxes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the student is responsible for all lease obligations, unless explicitly relieved of them in the assignment.\n\nGiven that, the student would still be responsible for taxes.\n\nBut, the student might argue that since the assignment only mentions rent, he only agreed to pay rent.\n\nThis is a common issue in lease assignments.\n\nI think the answer is that the covenant to pay taxes does run with the land and binds the assignee, the student, unless explicitly relieved in the assignment.\n\nSince the assignment was silent on taxes, the student is still bound by the original lease's covenant to pay taxes.\n\nTherefore, the new owner should prevail in the lawsuit against the student for the taxes paid.\n\nSo, the answer is A. the new owner.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
