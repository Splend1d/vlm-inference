                    "text": "So I've got this question about rectal findings, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that finding a palpable median groove in the prostate is an adverse finding. Hmm, I remember that the prostate has a median groove, which is a normal anatomical feature. It's located on the posterior surface of the prostate gland. So, if I can feel a median groove during a digital rectal exam, is that bad? I think it's actually a sign of a normal prostate. A healthy prostate should have a distinct median groove. If the groove is obliterated, that might indicate enlargement or other pathological changes. So, contrary to what option A says, finding a palpable median groove should be considered normal, not adverse. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOption B says that impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour. That sounds plausible. Impacted faeces can cause significant mass in the rectum, which might be misinterpreted as a tumour during a rectal exam. It's important to distinguish between the two because the treatment and management would be different. So, this seems like a possible true statement.\n\nOption C states that a thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless. Wait a minute, I thought thrombosed haemorrhoids were typically very painful. A thrombosed haemorrhoid occurs when a blood clot forms in an external haemorrhoid, causing swelling and pain. In fact, thrombosed haemorrhoids are known for causing acute pain, especially with sitting or walking. So, saying they are painless seems incorrect. Maybe I'm missing something, but I'm pretty sure thrombosed haemorrhoids are painful.\n\nOption D claims that peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy. Peri-anal warts, also known as condyloma acuminata, are usually visible on physical examination without the need for proctoscopy. Proctoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor to look inside the rectum and lower colon, but peri-anal warts are generally located around the anus and can be seen directly by inspecting the area. So, I don't think proctoscopy is necessary to demonstrate peri-anal warts. Maybe in some cases where the warts are internal, but generally, they can be seen externally.\n\nSo, let's summarize:\n\n- Option A: Palpable median groove in the prostate is actually normal, not adverse.\n\n- Option B: Impacted faeces can indeed be mistaken for a rectal tumour.\n\n- Option C: Thrombosed haemorrhoids are typically painful, not painless.\n\n- Option D: Peri-anal warts can usually be seen without proctoscopy.\n\nBased on this, option B seems to be the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's any chance that one of the other options could also be true.\n\nFor option A, maybe in certain contexts, a palpable median groove could be considered adverse, but I can't think of any. It's generally a sign of a normally shaped prostate.\n\nOption C: Thrombosed haemorrhoids are definitely painful. I'm confident about that.\n\nOption D: Peri-anal warts are external and visible without any invasive procedures. Proctoscopy is not required for diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
