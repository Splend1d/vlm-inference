I know that a complete circle is 360 degrees. So, if an angle turns through 3/4 of a complete circle, that should mean it's 3/4 times 360 degrees, right?\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nAngle measure = (3/4) * 360\u00b0\n\nOkay, so 3/4 of 360... let's see, 1/4 of 360 is 90\u00b0, because 360 divided by 4 is 90. So, 3/4 would be 3 times 90, which is 270\u00b0.\n\nWait, but there's another way to think about it. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert 3/4 of a circle into degrees directly. Since a full circle is 360\u00b0, multiplying that by 3/4 should give the same result.\n\nSo, (3/4) * 360\u00b0 = 270\u00b0.\n\nThat seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let's consider what 3/4 of a circle looks like.\n\nImagine the clock face. A full circle is 360\u00b0, and the clock is divided into 12 hours, so each hour represents 30\u00b0 (since 360\u00b0/12 = 30\u00b0). If an angle turns through 3/4 of a circle, that would be 9 hours on the clock (since 12 hours * 3/4 = 9 hours), and 9 hours correspond to 270\u00b0 (because 9 * 30\u00b0 = 270\u00b0).\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of radians, a full circle is 2\u03c0 radians, so 3/4 of that would be (3/4)*2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/2 radians, which is also 270\u00b0.\n\nWait, but the options are in degrees, not radians, so 270\u00b0 seems appropriate.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that 3/4 of a circle could correspond to a different angle measure? Maybe if we consider negative angles or something, but no, that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the circumference of a circle. If an angle turns through 3/4 of a circle, it's like traversing 3/4 of the circumference.\n\nBut since the question is about the measure of an angle, not the arc length, that might not be directly relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what \"turns through 3/4 of a complete circle\" means. Maybe it's referring to the terminal side of the angle.\n\nFor example, if you start at the positive x-axis and turn counterclockwise through 3/4 of a circle, you end up at the negative y-axis, which is indeed 270\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, if you turn clockwise, you'd end up at the positive y-axis, which is still 270\u00b0 in standard position.\n\nWait, but the direction isn't specified in the question, but generally, angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\nSo, assuming it's counterclockwise, 3/4 of 360\u00b0 is 270\u00b0.\n\nBut let's see, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the angle is measured in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is being considered in radians, but no, the options are in degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a central angle in a circle, but again, that would still be 270\u00b0 for 3/4 of a circle.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion with quadrants.\n\nA full circle has 4 quadrants, so 3 quadrants would be 270\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe thinking in terms of coordinates: at 0\u00b0, you're at (1,0); at 90\u00b0, (0,1); at 180\u00b0, (-1,0); at 270\u00b0, (0,-1); back to 360\u00b0, (1,0).\n\nSo, 3/4 of a circle takes you to 270\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the unit circle concept, where the angle corresponds to the rotation from the initial side to the terminal side.\n\nAgain, 3/4 of 360\u00b0 is 270\u00b0.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the fraction of the circle and correspond it to degrees.\n\nFraction of circle = 3/4\n\nTotal degrees in circle = 360\u00b0\n\nTherefore, angle measure = (3/4) * 360\u00b0 = 270\u00b0\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a formula for finding the measure of an angle based on the fraction of the circle, that might be it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of proportions.\n\nSet up proportion: fraction of circle to total degrees.\n\nSo, (3/4) / 1 = x / 360\u00b0\n\nSolve for x: x = (3/4) * 360\u00b0 = 270\u00b0\n\nThat matches what we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the relationship between fractions and degrees directly.\n\nFor example, 1/4 of a circle is 90\u00b0, 1/2 is 180\u00b0, 3/4 would be 270\u00b0, and full circle is 360\u00b0.\n\nThis reinforces the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of equivalent fractions or multiplying fractions.\n\nBut in this case, it's straightforward multiplication: (3/4) * 360\u00b0 = 270\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the angle is 270\u00b0.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 34\u00b0\n\nB. 43\u00b0\n\nC. 75\u00b0\n\nD. 270\u00b0\n\nThe correct choice is D. 270\u00b0.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 270^\\circ} \\]"
