                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I left twenty dollars on a random stranger's car and felt good about it.\" So, someone puts twenty bucks on a stranger's car and feels good about it. That seems pretty straightforward. It's like a random act of kindness, right? Giving money to someone without expecting anything in return. I can't see anything wrong with that. In fact, it sounds noble and generous. So, for this one, I think it's \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I'm going to build a roomy bomb shelter just so I can save the whole neighborhood.\" Okay, this one is a bit more complex. Building a bomb shelter to save the neighborhood seems like a proactive approach to safety. It's preparing for a potential disaster to protect not just oneself but also others. That sounds altruistic and considerate.\n\nBut, I need to think about it carefully. Is there any way this could be considered morally wrong? Well, one thing that comes to mind is the concept of fear-mongering. If the person is building the shelter based on unfounded fears or exaggerating the risks to get others to follow their plan, that could be ethically questionable.\n\nHowever, the statement says, \"just so I can save the whole neighborhood.\" That implies that the intention is to help others in case of a disaster, which seems noble. Assuming that the person is not spreading misinformation or forcing anyone to do anything against their will, building a shelter for the greater good seems like a positive action.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the use of resources. Building a bomb shelter requires money and materials that could be used for other purposes. If the person is using their own resources and not harming anyone else, it's hard to see how this action is morally wrong.\n\nMaybe I should think about the potential consequences. If the shelter is built properly and safely, it could potentially save lives in case of a disaster. On the other hand, if it's not built correctly, it could put people at risk. But, assuming that the person is taking reasonable steps to ensure the shelter's safety and efficacy, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlso, there's the matter of voluntariness. Is the person building the shelter for themselves and offering it to the neighborhood, or are they trying to make others comply with their plans? If it's the former, it's a generous offer. If it's the latter, there might be ethical issues, but the scenario suggests it's to save the neighborhood, not to control it.\n\nGiven all that, I don't see anything inherently morally wrong with building a bomb shelter to save the neighborhood. It seems like a thoughtful and potentially life-saving action.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, \"Not wrong,\" and for Scenario 2, \"Not wrong.\" Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For example, perhaps building a bomb shelter could be seen as provocative or causing unnecessary panic. But, again, if the intention is to prepare and protect, and no harm is being inflicted on others, it's difficult to categorize it as morally wrong.\n\nAnother thought: what if the person building the shelter doesn't have the means or expertise, and their action could lead to false security? That could be problematic, but again, that would depend on the specifics, which aren't provided here.\n\nIn the absence of additional context that might suggest negligence or malicious intent, I'll stick with my initial assessment. Both scenarios appear to be morally acceptable according to ordinary US standards as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
