                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Dworkin's view on legal questions having only one right answer. I need to find out which proposition is most inconsistent with that claim. Let me first make sure I understand Dworkin's position.\n\nDworkin argues that for every legal question, there's only one correct answer. This suggests a view of law where legal principles are determinate and objective, meaning that there's a single right answer discoverable through proper legal reasoning.\n\nNow, I need to look at each option and see which one contradicts or is most at odds with this idea.\n\nOption A says, \"In hard cases judges generally decide cases on the basis of rights.\" Hmm, this seems to align with Dworkin's view. He emphasizes the importance of rights in legal reasoning, especially in hard cases where principles come into play. So, this option seems consistent with his position.\n\nOption B states, \"The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.\" Again, this sounds like something Dworkin would agree with. He believes that rights are central to legal interpretation and that judges should consider these rights when making decisions. So, this also seems consistent.\n\nOption C says, \"Judges exercise strong discretion.\" This one makes me pause. Dworkin's view is that law is a coherent system with determinate answers, which implies that judges should be applying principles to find the one correct answer, not exercising discretion. Discretion suggests that judges have some leeway in deciding cases, which contradicts the idea that there's only one right answer. So, this seems inconsistent with Dworkin's position.\n\nOption D reads, \"Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.\" This seems related to Dworkin's idea of interpretive fit. In his theory, judges should interpret the law in a way that provides the best fit with the existing body of law and constitutional history. So, this also seems consistent with his views.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C, \"Judges exercise strong discretion,\" appears to be the most inconsistent with Dworkin's claim that there's only one right answer to every legal question. If judges have strong discretion, it implies that there can be multiple acceptable answers to a legal question, which contradicts Dworkin's idea of a single correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any possibility that discretion could be compatible with Dworkin's view. Dworkin does acknowledge that in some cases, there might be indeterminacy, but his overall position is that this is the exception rather than the rule. He believes that most legal questions have definitive answers discoverable through principled reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the idea that judges exercise strong discretion suggests a level of indeterminacy and subjectivity that is at odds with Dworkin's assertion of a single right answer.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Judges exercise strong discretion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
