                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: (2 + 5)^2 \u2212 42. I need to simplify it, and there are some multiple-choice options: A. 7, B. 16, C. 30, D. 33. Okay, let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the order of operations. I remember that PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, I should start with what's inside the parentheses.\n\nSo, 2 + 5 is 7. Now, the expression becomes 7^2 \u2212 42.\n\nNext, I need to deal with the exponent. 7 squared is 49. So, now I have 49 \u2212 42.\n\nFinally, subtract 42 from 49, which gives me 7.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. 7 seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: (2 + 5)^2 \u2212 42.\n\nParentheses first: 2 + 5 is 7.\n\nThen exponent: 7 squared is indeed 49.\n\nSubtract 42: 49 \u2212 42 = 7.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other ways to interpret the expression.\n\nIs there any possibility of interpreting (2 + 5)^2 \u2212 42 differently? For example, could there be implicit multiplications or divisions that aren't obvious?\n\nNo, the expression is pretty straightforward: parentheses, exponent, subtraction.\n\nI don't see any tricks here. It's a direct application of the order of operations.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 7, which corresponds to option A.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether the subtraction is actually addition of a negative number. Sometimes, that can lead to confusion.\n\nSo, 49 \u2212 42 is the same as 49 + (\u221242), which still equals 7.\n\nYeah, that doesn't change the result.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's plug in the numbers into a calculator.\n\nFirst, add 2 + 5, which is 7.\n\nThen square it: 7 times 7 is 49.\n\nSubtract 42 from 49: 49 minus 42 is 7.\n\nYep, confirms my initial answer.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
