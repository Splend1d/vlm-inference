                    "text": "So I have this problem about Trish's heart rate. It says that her resting heart rate is 50 beats per minute, and for every minute she exercises, her heart rate increases by 5 beats per minute. I need to find out how long it will take her to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Trish starts at 50 beats per minute and adds 5 beats per minute for every minute she exercises. I need to find out how many minutes she needs to exercise to reach 120 beats per minute.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. Maybe I can set up an equation to represent this situation.\n\nLet\u2019s let the variable \\( m \\) represent the number of minutes she exercises. So, for each minute she exercises, her heart rate increases by 5 beats per minute.\n\nStarting heart rate: 50 beats per minute.\n\nIncrease per minute: 5 beats per minute.\n\nTarget heart rate: 120 beats per minute.\n\nSo, the total increase needed is 120 - 50 = 70 beats per minute.\n\nNow, since each minute increases her heart rate by 5 beats, I can set up the equation:\n\n50 + 5m = 120\n\nWhere m is the number of minutes she exercises.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using a formula for linear equations or something like that.\n\nWell, the problem seems pretty straightforward. It's a linear relationship between time exercised and heart rate.\n\nLet me solve the equation I have:\n\n50 + 5m = 120\n\nSubtract 50 from both sides:\n\n5m = 70\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nm = 14\n\nSo, it would take her 14 minutes to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense.\n\nStarting at 50 bpm.\n\nAfter 1 minute: 50 + 5*1 = 55 bpm.\n\nAfter 2 minutes: 50 + 5*2 = 60 bpm.\n\n...\n\nAfter 14 minutes: 50 + 5*14 = 50 + 70 = 120 bpm.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor that could affect the heart rate? Like, does the heart rate increase instantly, or is there a lag? But the problem assumes a direct increase per minute, so I think it's safe to proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nAlso, looking at the answer choices:\n\nA. 5 minutes\n\nB. 14 minutes\n\nC. 34 minutes\n\nD. 70 minutes\n\nMy answer matches option B. 14 minutes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach.\n\nPerhaps using a formula for heart rate increase over time, but I think the equation I set up is sufficient for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the rate of increase and calculate the time needed based on that.\n\nRate of increase is 5 bpm per minute, and the total increase needed is 70 bpm, so time = increase / rate = 70 / 5 = 14 minutes.\n\nAgain, that points to the same answer.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here beyond what's stated in the problem.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is 14 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
