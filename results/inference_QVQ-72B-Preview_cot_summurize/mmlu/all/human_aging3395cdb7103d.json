                    "text": "So I've been reading about how light affects sleep, and it's pretty interesting. The question here is: Being in bright light during the later parts of the day seems to...\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what \"circadian rhythm\" means. I think it's like our body's internal clock that helps regulate when we feel sleepy or awake. So, if bright light during the later part of the day can restore that, that would be option A.\n\nBut wait, I've also heard that light before bedtime can sometimes make it harder to fall asleep. So, could it increase insomnia instead? That would be option B.\n\nOption C says restore deep sleep. Hmm, not sure about that. I think deep sleep is more about the quality of sleep you get once you're asleep, not necessarily influenced directly by light exposure before bed.\n\nAnd option D says it has no real influence on sleep or dreams. But I have a feeling that light does affect sleep in some way.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. I recall that exposure to light, especially blue light from screens, can suppress melatonin production, which is the hormone that makes us feel sleepy. So, if I'm exposed to bright light in the evening, might that suppress melatonin and make it harder to fall asleep? That sounds like it could increase insomnia.\n\nBut on the other hand, I've also read about light therapy for people with seasonal affective disorder, where they sit in front of bright lights in the morning to help regulate their sleep patterns. So, maybe in some cases, it can restore normal circadian rhythm.\n\nI need to find some research or reliable sources to confirm this. Maybe I should look up studies on light exposure and its effects on sleep.\n\nAlright, after a quick search, I found that bright light, particularly in the blue wavelength, can indeed affect our circadian rhythms. In general, exposure to bright light in the evening or at night can delay the body's internal clock, making it harder to fall asleep on time. This aligns with option B, increasing insomnia.\n\nHowever, there's also evidence that timed light exposure can be used therapeutically to treat sleep disorders by resetting the circadian clock. So, in that case, it could restore normal circadian rhythm, which is option A.\n\nBut the key here is \"timed\" light exposure. Without specific timing, just being in bright light during the later parts of the day might not have a consistent effect across all individuals.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"seems to,\" which suggests that it's a general observation, not necessarily a guaranteed outcome.\n\nSo, if I consider that generally, being in bright light late in the day makes it harder to fall asleep, that would point towards option B, increasing insomnia.\n\nBut perhaps it's not that straightforward. Maybe it depends on the individual's specific circadian type, like whether they're morning people or night owls.\n\nAlso, I should consider the natural light cycles. In summer, days are longer, and sunset is later, so people might naturally be exposed to brighter light in the evening without it causing insomnia.\n\nMaybe the answer isn't as clear-cut as I thought. Perhaps both options A and B can be true in different contexts.\n\nBut since I have to choose one, and considering that most people associate evening bright light with difficulty sleeping, I might lean towards option B, increase insomnia.\n\nHowever, I'm still a bit unsure because of the potential therapeutic effects of light exposure.\n\nLet me see if there's more information that can help me decide.\n\nI found another source that explains that light exposure in the evening can suppress melatonin, leading to a delay in the sleep-wake cycle. So, again, this points to difficulty falling asleep, which aligns with option B.\n\nOn the other hand, some studies suggest that moderate light exposure in the evening can help maintain a regular sleep schedule, but it's not as strong as the evidence for melatonin suppression.\n\nGiven that, I think the most accurate answer is option B, increase insomnia.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll check one more source.\n\nThis article mentions that evening light can disrupt sleep by suppressing melatonin, making it harder to fall asleep. It also notes that using electronic devices with screens before bed can exacerbate this effect due to the blue light they emit.\n\nSo, this reinforces the idea that bright light in the evening can lead to insomnia.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option B, increase insomnia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
