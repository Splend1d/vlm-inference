                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which option is correct for this question about financial statement audits. It's been a while since I've studied auditing, but I'll try to recall the key points.\n\nOption A says that tests of details typically provide a low level of assurance. Hmm, I think I remember that tests of details are designed to directly test the monetary amounts in the financial statements. They're like substantive testing of transactions, accounts balances, and disclosures. I think they're supposed to provide a high level of assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. So, saying they provide a low level of assurance seems contrary to that. Maybe this isn't right.\n\nOption B states that analytical procedures are an inefficient means of obtaining assurance. Analytical procedures involve looking at financial information from a big-picture perspective, comparing it to expectations or prior periods, and identifying fluctuations or relationships that might indicate potential issues. I recall that analytical procedures are actually quite efficient because they can give auditors a broad understanding of the business and its environment without having to test every single transaction. Plus, they can be very effective in identifying anomalies or areas that need more detailed testing. So, calling them inefficient seems off. Probably not the correct choice.\n\nOption C suggests that the procedures to be applied on a particular engagement are a matter of the auditor's professional judgment. This rings true. Auditing is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it's tailored to the specific circumstances of each client. Auditors need to exercise professional judgment to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures based on factors like the client's industry, size, complexity, and assessed risks of material misstatement. So, this seems like a solid statement.\n\nOption D mentions that the use of tests of controls should be considered without regard to the level of assurance required. Tests of controls are procedures designed to assess whether the client's internal controls are operating effectively. They're particularly important when the auditor plans to rely on those controls to reduce the extent of substantive testing. But, I think the decision to perform tests of controls and the extent of such testing should be directly related to the level of assurance the auditor needs. If the auditor needs higher assurance, they might perform more extensive tests of controls. So, saying that tests of controls should be considered without regard to the level of assurance required seems incorrect.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option C seems to be the most accurate statement. The procedures to be applied in an audit are indeed a matter of the auditor's professional judgment, taking into account various factors specific to the engagement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
