I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about U.S. political engagement with the Philippines. It mentions a speech from 1898 by Albert J. Beveridge called \"The March of the Flag,\" and it asks when the U.S. became politically engaged with the Philippines after which military conflict. The options are the Mexican-American War, World War II, the Spanish-American War, and the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand the context of the speech. It's from 1898, which was a significant year in American history, especially regarding its imperial ambitions. The Spanish-American War happened in 1898, so that seems relevant.\n\nLet me recall what happened in the Spanish-American War. It was a conflict between the United States and Spain that resulted in Spain ceding several territories to the U.S., including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. So, that would make sense as a direct cause for U.S. political engagement with the Philippines.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. The Mexican-American War was in the 1840s, which is earlier, and the Boxer Rebellion was around the turn of the 20th century, but more towards the end of the 1890s and early 1900s. World War II is way later, in the 1940s.\n\nSo, the Spanish-American War seems like the most plausible answer because it directly involved the U.S. acquiring the Philippines from Spain in 1898.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nThe Mexican-American War was fought from 1846 to 1848, and it resulted in the U.S. gaining a large amount of territory from California to Texas. But that didn't involve the Philippines, so it's probably not the right choice.\n\nWorld War II was from 1939 to 1945, which is much later than 1898. During WWII, the Philippines was under Japanese occupation, and the U.S. fought to liberate it. But again, that's after 1898, so it doesn't fit the timeline mentioned in the question.\n\nThe Boxer Rebellion was an anti-foreigner movement in China that occurred from 1899 to 1901. The U.S. was involved in intervening to protect its citizens and interests in China. However, this was more focused on China and didn't directly involve the Philippines.\n\nGiven all that, it seems clear that the Spanish-American War is the correct answer. It was the military conflict that led to the U.S. acquiring the Philippines in 1898, which aligns perfectly with the date of the speech and the beginning of significant U.S. political engagement with the Philippines.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look back at the speech excerpt. It talks about governing peoples without their consent, mentioning Indians, territories, and children, and then refers to the Philippines. It also mentions rescuing them from \"reeking hands,\" likely referring to the Spanish colonial rule.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the Spanish-American War is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
