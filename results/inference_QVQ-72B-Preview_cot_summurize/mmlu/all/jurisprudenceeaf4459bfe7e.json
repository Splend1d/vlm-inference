                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about the will theory of rights and the interest theory without the correlativity of rights and duties. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the will theory of rights suggests that the enforcement of Y's duty requires the exercise of will by X. And it assumes that rights and duties are correlative, meaning that if X has a right, Y has a corresponding duty, and vice versa.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option formulates the interest theory without this correlativity. So, we need to find an option that talks about interests without necessarily tying it directly to duties in the same way that rights are correlated with duties.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty.\n\nThis seems similar to the will theory, where rights are correlated with duties. If we're saying that X's interest is directly related to Y's duty, it sounds like we're still assuming a correlativity between interest and duty, which is what we're trying to avoid.\n\nB. Accepting that conferring right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.\n\nThis option talks about conferring a right, which implies that there is a recognition of an interest that should be protected. But it doesn't explicitly state that this recognition entails imposing a duty on someone else. It seems to focus more on recognizing the interest without necessarily correlating it directly with a duty.\n\nC. Treating an interest as the exercise of choice.\n\nThis option seems a bit vague. It suggests that an interest is equivalent to the exercise of choice. I'm not sure how this directly relates to the interest theory or how it avoids the correlativity of rights and duties.\n\nD. Asserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties - only when they are actually imposed.\n\nThis option seems to suggest that X has a right based on the recognition that protecting X's interest is a reason to impose duties on others, but only when those duties are actually imposed. This still seems to imply a correlation between X's right and Y's duty, which again is what we're trying to avoid.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option B seems to be the one that focuses on recognizing an interest without necessarily tying it directly to a corresponding duty. It talks about conferring a right based on an interest that ought to be recognized, without specifying that this recognition requires imposing duties on others.\n\nTherefore, I think option B succeeds in formulating the interest theory without the correlativity of rights and duties.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nOption A directly relates X's interest to Y's duty, which is similar to the will theory's correlativity.\n\nOption C is about treating interest as the exercise of choice, which doesn't clearly connect to the interest theory's focus on protecting interests without correlating rights and duties.\n\nOption D still ties the recognition of X's right to the imposition of duties on others, which is again the correlativity we're trying to avoid.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, emphasizes recognizing the interest represented by the right without mentioning the imposition of duties. So, it seems to focus on the interest itself rather than on the duties that might correspond to rights in the will theory.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
