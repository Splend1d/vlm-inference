                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Considering 0.1 M aqueous solutions of each of the following, which solution has the lowest pH? The options are A. Na2CO3, B. Na3PO4, C. Na2S, D. NaCl.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what determines the pH of a solution. pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. A lower pH means the solution is more acidic, and a higher pH means it's more basic. So, I need to figure out which of these sodium salts, when dissolved in water, will produce the most acidic solution.\n\nOkay, all of these are sodium salts of different acids. I remember that when a salt dissolves in water, it can either act as a weak base, a weak acid, or be neutral, depending on the properties of the acid and base that formed it.\n\nLet me recall: When a salt is formed from a strong acid and a strong base, it should be neutral in solution. But if it's formed from a weak acid and a strong base, it will be basic because the conjugate base of the weak acid will hydrolyze in water, producing OH- ions. Similarly, if it's formed from a strong acid and a weak base, it would be acidic due to the conjugate acid producing H+ ions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Na2CO3 \u2013 This is sodium carbonate. Carbonic acid (H2CO3) is a weak diprotic acid, and sodium hydroxide is a strong base. So, Na2CO3 is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. According to my understanding, this should make the solution basic because the carbonate ion (CO3^2-) is the conjugate base and will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the lowest pH, which would be the most acidic. So, if Na2CO3 makes the solution basic, it's not going to be the answer.\n\nB. Na3PO4 \u2013 This is sodium phosphate. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a weak polyprotic acid, and sodium hydroxide is a strong base. So, similar to Na2CO3, this is also a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. Therefore, it should also make the solution basic due to the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions, producing OH- ions. Again, this means it's not acidic, so not the one with the lowest pH.\n\nC. Na2S \u2013 This is sodium sulfide. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong diprotic acid, but wait, actually, sulfuric acid is a strong acid because its first dissociation is complete in water. However, the second dissociation is partial, making it a weak acid for the second proton. But Na2S is formed from the complete neutralization of sulfuric acid with sodium hydroxide. Wait, no, sulfuric acid is H2SO4, and its conjugate base after losing two protons would be SO4^2-, which is sulfite, but I think Na2S is actually sodium sulfide, which comes from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a weak acid. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a weak diprotic acid, and sodium hydroxide is a strong base. So, Na2S is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, similar to Na2CO3 and Na3PO4. Therefore, it should also make the solution basic due to the hydrolysis of the sulfide ion (S^2-), which is a strong base and will accept protons from water to produce OH- ions.\n\nSo, again, this should make the solution basic, not acidic.\n\nD. NaCl \u2013 This is sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, and sodium hydroxide is a strong base. So, NaCl is the salt of a strong acid and a strong base. When NaCl dissolves in water, neither the sodium ion nor the chloride ion hydrolyzes significantly because both are spectator ions in terms of acid-base reactions. Therefore, NaCl solution should be neutral, with a pH of around 7.\n\nSo, among all these options, NaCl is neutral, while the others are basic. Therefore, NaCl has the lowest pH compared to the others, which are basic.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the lowest pH, and NaCl is neutral, pH 7. Is there any chance that one of the other salts could produce a solution with a pH lower than 7?\n\nLet me think again. All of A, B, and C are salts of weak acids and strong bases, which should make the solutions basic, with pH greater than 7. NaCl is neutral, pH 7. So, indeed, NaCl has the lowest pH among them.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of these salts could somehow produce acidity in solution. For example, if the salt was from a weak base and a strong acid, it would be acidic. But in this case, all the salts are from weak acids and strong bases, except NaCl, which is from a strong acid and strong base.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the conjugate bases. In A, B, and C, the conjugate bases are CO3^2-, PO4^3-, and S^2-, respectively, all of which are weak bases because their parent acids are weak. Therefore, they will accept protons from water, increasing the OH- concentration and making the solution basic.\n\nIn D, Cl- is the conjugate base of HCl, a strong acid, so it doesn't significantly base hydrolyze because it's a weak base. Similarly, Na+ doesn't affect the pH.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. NaCl, as it is the only one that doesn't make the solution basic and remains neutral.\n\nWait, but the question says \"which solution has the lowest pH?\" and options A, B, and C are all basic, with pH above 7, while D is neutral, pH 7. So, indeed, D has the lowest pH among them.\n\nI think the answer is D. NaCl.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
