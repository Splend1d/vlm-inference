I need to figure out which statement about point B is true.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for point B to be 5 less than point A. Since point A is at -20, and B is 5 less than that, I should subtract 5 from -20 to find B's position. Let me do that: -20 minus 5. Hmm, subtracting a positive number from a negative number. I think that's negative twenty-five, right? Because subtracting a positive is the same as adding a negative. So, point B should be at -25.\n\nNow, I need to determine where -25 is in relation to point A, which is at -20. On a number line, numbers increase to the right and decrease to the left. Since -25 is less than -20, it should be to the left of point A.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. It is located at -25 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.\n\nB. It is located at -15 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.\n\nC. It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n\nD. It is located at -15 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n\nBased on my calculations, point B should be at -25 and to the left of point A. So, option C seems to match that.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. If point A is at -20 and point B is 5 less than that, indeed, -20 minus 5 is -25. And on the number line, since -25 is smaller than -20, it should be to the left. So, options A and B are incorrect because they place point B at -25 but say it's to the right of point A, which doesn't make sense. Option D places point B at -15, but that's not what the problem states; it says point B is 5 less than point A, which is -20, so it should be -25, not -15.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option C: it is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the number line.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick here. The problem says \"point B is 5 less than point A.\" That seems straightforward. Sometimes, these problems can be tricky with negative numbers, but in this case, it appears to be a simple subtraction.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that \"less than\" means subtracting, so point B is -20 minus 5, which is -25. And on the number line, since -25 is smaller than -20, it's to the left.\n\nI don't see any confusion here. The answer should be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
