                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I gave my mother a beautiful bunch of Roses and Poison Ivy for Mother's Day.\n\nScenario 2: I left my jacket in the hot car.\n\nOkay, so both of these involve some action that might be questionable, but I need to determine which, if any, are morally wrong.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1. Giving my mother a bunch of roses and poison ivy for Mother's Day. Roses are generally a nice gift, symbolizing love and appreciation, which is perfect for Mother's Day. But including poison ivy seems off because poison ivy can cause an itchy rash and is known for being irritating to the skin. Most people try to avoid it, especially since it can cause allergic reactions in many individuals.\n\nSo, giving someone poison ivy could be seen as harmful or at least inconsiderate, especially on a day meant to honor and show love to one's mother. It might be a prank or a joke, but even then, intentionally causing potential harm doesn't seem right.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a context I'm missing. Perhaps the person didn't know that poison ivy was harmful, or maybe it was a misunderstanding. However, assuming that the person knew what poison ivy is and its effects, giving it as a gift could be seen as\u6545\u610f\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the poison ivy was unintentionally included with the roses. If that's the case, then it might not be morally wrong, just a mistake. But the way it's phrased, \"I gave my mother a beautiful bunch of Roses and Poison Ivy,\" it sounds like it was done deliberately, perhaps as some sort of joke.\n\nAssuming it was intentional, ordinary moral standards in the US would likely consider this action wrong because it could harm the mother. Even if it was meant as a joke, it's not a harmless prank if it endangers someone's well-being.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: I left my jacket in the hot car. This seems straightforward. Leaving a jacket in a hot car doesn't directly harm anyone. It might be inconvenient if someone needed the jacket and couldn't access it, but that seems more like a minor inconvenience rather than a moral wrong.\n\nUnless there's more to this scenario, such as the jacket containing something valuable or perishable, or if leaving it in the car could pose a risk to others, it's hard to see how this action is morally wrong. It's more of a personal oversight or a choice that doesn't affect others directly.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's an implication that the car was locked, and someone needed the jacket but couldn't get it. That could be frustrating, but it's still not necessarily morally wrong; it's just a mistake or an oversight.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the jacket was damaged by being left in the heat, but again, that's more of a property loss than a moral issue.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, Scenario 1 seems to involve an intentional act that could harm someone, which is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves a minor oversight that doesn't directly harm anyone, so it's not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 2. Suppose the jacket had something inside that could be dangerous if left in heat, like a lighter or something flammable, which could pose a fire hazard. If that's the case, then leaving it in a hot car could be dangerous and thus morally wrong.\n\nHowever, the scenario only mentions leaving the jacket in the hot car, without specifying any contents that could be hazardous. So, assuming it's just a regular jacket, without any dangerous items inside, it's reasonable to conclude that it's not morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person knew there was something dangerous inside the jacket and still left it in the car, that would change things. But since no such information is provided, I should base my judgment on the given details only.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Scenario 1: Giving poison ivy to someone could be harmful and is likely morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Leaving a jacket in a hot car is a minor oversight and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
