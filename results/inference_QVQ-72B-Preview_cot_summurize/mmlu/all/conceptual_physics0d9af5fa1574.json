                    "text": "Let's see what this question is about. There's a big fish that swims and swallows a small fish that's just sitting there, not moving. After eating, the big fish is fatter, which probably means its mass has increased. The question is asking what changes after this event: the fish's speed, its momentum, or both, or neither.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic physics concepts. Momentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. So, momentum (p) equals mass (m) times velocity (v). Speed is the magnitude of velocity, so it's just how fast something is moving without considering the direction.\n\nIn this scenario, the big fish swallows the small fish, which is initially at rest. So, before the big fish eats the small fish, it has some mass and some velocity, which gives it some momentum. After eating the small fish, the big fish's mass increases, but its velocity might change or stay the same. I need to figure that out.\n\nLet's think about the conservation of momentum. If we consider the big fish and the small fish as a system, and assuming no external forces are acting on them (like water currents or anything), the total momentum before and after the interaction should be the same.\n\nBefore the interaction:\n\n- The big fish has mass m\u2081 and velocity v\u2081.\n\n- The small fish has mass m\u2082 and is at rest, so its velocity is 0.\n\nTherefore, the total initial momentum is m\u2081 * v\u2081 + m\u2082 * 0 = m\u2081 v\u2081.\n\nAfter the interaction:\n\n- The big fish has eaten the small fish, so its new mass is m\u2081 + m\u2082.\n\n- Its new velocity is v\u2082.\n\nThe final momentum is (m\u2081 + m\u2082) * v\u2082.\n\nAccording to the conservation of momentum:\n\nm\u2081 v\u2081 = (m\u2081 + m\u2082) v\u2082.\n\nNow, I can solve for v\u2082:\n\nv\u2082 = (m\u2081 / (m\u2081 + m\u2082)) v\u2081.\n\nSince m\u2082 is positive (it's a real mass), the denominator is larger than m\u2081, so v\u2082 is less than v\u2081. That makes sense because the fish has gained mass, and to conserve momentum, its speed decreases.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the small fish is at rest, so its momentum is zero. So, the total initial momentum is just m\u2081 v\u2081.\n\nAfter eating, the mass becomes m\u2081 + m\u2082, and the velocity is v\u2082, such that (m\u2081 + m\u2082) v\u2082 = m\u2081 v\u2081.\n\nSo, v\u2082 = (m\u2081 / (m\u2081 + m\u2082)) v\u2081.\n\nSince m\u2081 < m\u2081 + m\u2082, v\u2082 < v\u2081. So, the speed decreases.\n\nBut the question is asking about speed and momentum after lunch.\n\nFirst, about speed: since v\u2082 < v\u2081, the speed decreases.\n\nSecond, about momentum: the total momentum is conserved, so the final momentum is equal to the initial momentum.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"right after lunch, the fattened big fish has a change in... A. speed B. momentum C. both D. neither.\"\n\nFrom the above, the speed changes (decreases), but the momentum remains the same (conserved).\n\nSo, it seems like the speed changes, but the momentum does not change.\n\nBut wait, in reality, is momentum really conserved in this situation?\n\nLet's think about it again.\n\nIn an isolated system without external forces, momentum is conserved. Assuming no water currents or other external forces, and neglecting any reaction forces from the water during swallowing, etc., momentum should be conserved.\n\nBut in reality, when the big fish swallows the small fish, there might be some forces exerted on the water, which could affect the momentum. However, if we consider the system to be the big fish and the small fish together, and assume that any forces exerted on the water are negligible or balanced, then momentum should be conserved.\n\nTherefore, the momentum before and after the interaction should be the same.\n\nSo, the momentum doesn't change, but the speed does change.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. speed.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the collision between the big fish and the small fish. Since the small fish is at rest, it's like a completely inelastic collision, where the two objects stick together.\n\nIn completely inelastic collisions, momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not.\n\nSo, momentum before = momentum after.\n\nTherefore, the momentum doesn't change.\n\nBut what about speed?\n\nIn this case, since mass increases and velocity decreases to conserve momentum, speed decreases.\n\nSo, speed changes, but momentum doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. speed.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the momentum?\n\nWell, if we consider that during the act of swallowing, the big fish might push against the water, which could transfer some momentum to the water, thereby not conserving the total momentum of the fish system.\n\nHowever, typically in physics problems, especially at an introductory level, we assume that such interactions are internal and don't affect the total momentum.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to assume that momentum is conserved in this scenario.\n\nThus, the answer is A. speed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
