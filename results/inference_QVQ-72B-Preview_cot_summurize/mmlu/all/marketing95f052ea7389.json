Retailers.\"\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these options is the correct way to categorize McDonald's and KFC. Let me think about what each term means.\n\nFirst, distributors are companies that facilitate the movement of products from producers to retailers or directly to consumers. They usually don't sell directly to the public but rather supply other businesses with products. McDonald's and KFC are both fast-food restaurant chains that sell food directly to consumers, so I don't think they're distributors.\n\nNext, franchising is a business model where a company (the franchisor) licenses its brand, systems, and products to individuals or groups (franchisees) who then operate their own locations under that brand. Both McDonald's and KFC are known for their franchising models. McDonald's, for example, has thousands of franchised restaurants around the world, and KFC is similarly franchised in many countries. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nA merchant is generally someone who buys and sells goods, often in a retail setting. While McDonald's and KFC do sell food products directly to consumers, which could be considered a form of merchandising, this term seems a bit too broad and doesn't specifically capture their business model.\n\nRetailers are businesses that sell goods or services directly to consumers for personal or household use. Fast-food restaurants like McDonald's and KFC certainly fit into this category since they provide food services to individual customers. However, again, this doesn't account for their specific business model of franchising.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to get at the fact that McDonald's and KFC are examples of franchising rather than just being retailers or merchants. Franchising is a specific way they've expanded their business model, allowing others to operate under their brand and system while maintaining consistency across locations.\n\nLet me consider this another way. If I look at McDonald's and KFC, I know that a significant portion of their outlets are franchised\u2014that is, owned and operated by independent business owners who pay royalties and fees to the parent company for the right to use their name, menu, and operating procedures.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were distributors, they'd be involved in distributing products to other businesses, which isn't their primary function. As merchants, they do sell goods, but that's a very general term. Retailers is accurate, but again, franchising seems more specific to their business model.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is B. Franchising, because it directly refers to the method by which these companies have grown and operate their chain of restaurants.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there a possibility that they could be considered all of these to some extent? For example, McDonald's and KFC might distribute supplies to their franchisees, making them involved in distribution, but their primary business is still the operation of restaurants through franchising.\n\nAlso, they are retailers in the sense that they sell food products directly to consumers. But again, franchising seems more pertinent to their specific business structure.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that franchising is a specific type of business relationship, where the franchisor licenses its brand and operational methods to franchisees, who then operate individual locations.\n\nGiven that, McDonald's and KFC are primarily known for their franchising models, which have allowed them to expand globally at a rapid pace.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer to the question is B. Franchising.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
