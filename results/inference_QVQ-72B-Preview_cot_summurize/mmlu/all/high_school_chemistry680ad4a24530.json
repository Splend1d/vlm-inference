                    "text": "So I have this question: \"How many moles of propane (C3H8) are there in 6.2 g of propane?\" And the options are A. 14.1 mol, B. 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol, C. 71 mol, D. 7.1 mol. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I remember that moles are related to the mass of a substance and its molar mass. So, probably, I need to find the molar mass of propane and then use that to convert the grams into moles.\n\nFirst, I need to know the molar mass of propane. Propane is C3H8, which means it has 3 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. I should look up the atomic masses of carbon and hydrogen.\n\nI recall that the atomic mass of carbon is approximately 12.01 g/mol, and hydrogen is about 1.008 g/mol. So, the molar mass of propane would be (3 \u00d7 12.01) + (8 \u00d7 1.008).\n\nLet me calculate that: 3 times 12.01 is 36.03 g/mol, and 8 times 1.008 is 8.064 g/mol. Adding them up, 36.03 plus 8.064 is 44.094 g/mol. So, propane has a molar mass of roughly 44.094 g/mol.\n\nNow, I have 6.2 grams of propane, and I need to find out how many moles that is. I think I can use the formula:\n\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\n\nSo, moles = 6.2 g / 44.094 g/mol\n\nLet me do that division: 6.2 divided by 44.094.\n\nWell, 44 times 0.14 is 6.16, which is close to 6.2. So, maybe it's approximately 0.14 moles.\n\nBut let me be more precise. Using a calculator, 6.2 divided by 44.094 equals approximately 0.1406 moles.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol seems closest to my calculation. But let me make sure about the significant figures.\n\nThe question gives 6.2 g, which has two significant figures. So, my answer should have two significant figures as well. 0.1406 rounded to two significant figures is 0.14 mol, which can also be written as 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but is there any chance I made a mistake with the molar mass? Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nLet me recalculate the molar mass of propane. Carbon is 12.01 g/mol, times 3 is 36.03 g/mol. Hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol, times 8 is 8.064 g/mol. Adding them up, 36.03 + 8.064 = 44.094 g/mol. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, dividing 6.2 by 44.094 gives approximately 0.1406 mol, which rounded to two significant figures is indeed 0.14 mol or 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol.\n\nLooking at the other options:\n\nA. 14.1 mol \u2013 that's way higher than what I calculated.\n\nC. 71 mol \u2013 that's even higher, which doesn't make sense for 6.2 g.\n\nD. 7.1 mol \u2013 still higher than my calculation.\n\nSo, based on my calculations, option B seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider whether propane has any other elements or if there's a trick in the question. But no, propane is simply C3H8, so there are no other elements to consider.\n\nAlso, confirming that the question is asking for the number of moles in 6.2 g of propane, and that's what I calculated.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be B. 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 1.4 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\text{mol}} \\]"
