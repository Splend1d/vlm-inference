Let me read the description again to make sure I understand.\n\n\"A teacher provides support for small, flexible groups of beginning readers. As students read a text or a book that is unfamiliar to them, the teacher works with the students to teach them how to use a variety of reading strategies.\"\n\nOkay, so the teacher is working with small groups, and these groups are flexible, meaning they probably change based on the needs of the students. The students are beginning readers, so they're just starting out with reading. The teacher is helping them read texts or books that are new to them, and teaching them different ways to approach reading.\n\nNow, I need to match this description with one of the options: Direct instruction, Literature circle, Guided reading, or Read-aloud.\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\n**A. Direct instruction:**\n\nIn direct instruction, the teacher explicitly teaches specific skills or strategies. It's usually very structured and teacher-led. While this might involve small groups, the flexibility mentioned in the description seems more about adapting to student needs rather than a fixed set of instructions. Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\n**B. Literature circle:**\n\nIn a literature circle, students read a book and then discuss it in a group. The teacher facilitates the discussion but doesn't\u4e3b\u5bfc it. This seems more about discussion and collaboration among students, not necessarily the teacher teaching strategies directly. Doesn't seem to fit the description as well.\n\n**C. Guided reading:**\n\nGuided reading involves the teacher working with small groups of students who are reading books at similar levels. The teacher provides instruction tailored to the group's needs, helping them use strategies to comprehend and enjoy the text. This sounds a lot like what's described in the scenario.\n\n**D. Read-aloud:**\n\nIn read-aloud, the teacher reads a book to the students, often stopping to discuss vocabulary, make connections, or ask questions. It's a whole-group activity, not small groups, so it doesn't match the description.\n\nComparing all the options, guided reading seems to be the best fit. It involves small, flexible groups based on reading levels or needs, and the teacher provides direct instruction on reading strategies as students read texts.\n\nWait, but direct instruction also involves teaching strategies, but it's more about explicit teaching in a structured way. Guided reading combines small-group instruction with student-led reading, where the teacher guides and supports as needed.\n\nI think the key here is that the groups are flexible and based on the students' current reading needs, and the teacher is teaching strategies while students are actively reading.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Guided reading.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
