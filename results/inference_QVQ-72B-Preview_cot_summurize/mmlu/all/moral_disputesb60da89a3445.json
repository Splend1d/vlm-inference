                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Aquinas and his view on law. The question is: According to Aquinas, every law is ordained to...\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. the truth.\n\nB. human perfection.\n\nC. the common good.\n\nD. individual happiness.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what Aquinas said about the purpose or end of law.\n\nI know that Aquinas had a hierarchical view of law, right? Like, there's eternal law, natural law, human law, and divine law. But I think this question is more general, referring to law in general, not specifically one type.\n\nLet me think about the nature of law according to Aquinas. He believed that law is a rational ordering of things, right? And it's meant to guide behavior towards some end.\n\nOption A says \"the truth.\" Aquinas did value truth highly, as it's connected to God, who is truth itself. But does he say that law is ordained to the truth directly? I'm not sure. Maybe indirectly, since all things should aim towards truth, but I don't think it's the primary purpose of law.\n\nOption B is \"human perfection.\" Aquinas did talk about perfection in the sense of moral perfection or virtue. He believed that laws can help guide us towards virtue, but again, is that the primary end of every law? Maybe not. Some laws are just about maintaining order and preventing harm, not necessarily about moral perfection.\n\nOption C is \"the common good.\" This one rings a bell. I think Aquinas emphasized that laws are made for the common good of society, not just for individual benefit. He might have said that the purpose of law is to promote the common good and to help society function harmoniously.\n\nOption D is \"individual happiness.\" While Aquinas would likely agree that individual happiness is important, I don't think he saw it as the sole end of law. His philosophy is more communal, emphasizing the good of the community as a whole rather than just individual happiness.\n\nLet me cross-reference this. I recall that in the Summa Theologica, Aquinas discusses the ends of law. He says that law is for the governance of human beings, who are social creatures, and that the ultimate end of law is the common good of the community.\n\nAlso, he distinguishes between just and unjust laws, saying that just laws are those that promote the common good, while unjust laws do not.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the common good is a central concept in Aquinas's understanding of law.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other aspect of his philosophy that might suggest another answer.\n\nFor example, in his discussion of natural law, Aquinas talks about certain fundamental goods, like life, procreation, and so on, which are part of human nature and should be promoted by law. But again, these seem to be aspects of the common good.\n\nMoreover, he discusses the purpose of divine law as guiding humans to their ultimate end, which is God. But again, that seems more about the highest good rather than the immediate end of every law.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different way to look at this. Perhaps every law is ordained to the common good, but ultimately, that leads to individual happiness as well, since the common good includes the well-being of individuals.\n\nBut Aquinas might argue that individual happiness is a consequence of the common good being promoted, not the primary objective of law.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is C. the common good.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any text from Aquinas that directly supports this.\n\nI remember a quote from the Summa Theologica where Aquinas says, \"Every law made by man is a participation of the eternal law, according to the mode of a particular, either in respect of things, persons, or places.\"\n\nBut that doesn't directly answer the question about the end of law.\n\nAnother place: \"The law, being an ordinance of the ruler for the sake of the common good, is directed to that which is ordered by the law.\"\n\nSo, the law is directed to the common good.\n\nAlso, he says that the end of law is to lead humans to their final end, which is happiness in the vision of God, but that's more about eternal law and divine law.\n\nFor human law, which is what we're probably referring to here, the end seems to be the common good of the community.\n\nAdditionally, Aquinas discusses the idea that laws are made for the sake of the community, not for the sake of the ruler, which further supports the idea that the end of law is the common good.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the answer is C. the common good.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
