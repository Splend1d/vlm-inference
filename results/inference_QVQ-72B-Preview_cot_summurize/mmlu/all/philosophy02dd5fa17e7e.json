                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about John Locke's political theory. The question is: According to Locke, every man, by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to everyone of that society to submit to the determination of...\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. the majority\n\nB. the king\n\nC. the judges\n\nD. his own will\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that John Locke was a 17th-century English philosopher who had a significant influence on modern political thought, especially regarding the social contract and natural rights.\n\nLocke believed that people enter into a social contract by consenting to form a government and society. In doing so, they agree to be governed by certain rules and authorities for the common good.\n\nThe question is about what Locke thought people were obligating themselves to submit to when they agree to form a body politic, which is basically a society governed by a common authority.\n\nSo, when people consent to form a government, what are they agreeing to submit to?\n\nOption A is \"the majority.\" That sounds plausible because in a democracy, decisions are often made based on the majority's choice. Locke did support the idea of majority rule in some contexts.\n\nOption B is \"the king.\" Hmm, Locke was critical of absolute monarchy and believed in limiting the power of the government, so it seems unlikely that he would suggest people are obligating themselves to submit to a king.\n\nOption C is \"the judges.\" Locke believed in the separation of powers, including legislative, executive, and federative powers, but I don't recall him emphasizing judicial authority in the same way.\n\nOption D is \"his own will.\" That seems contradictory because if everyone just follows their own will, there's no need for a social contract or government in the first place.\n\nSo, between the options, A seems the most likely answer. But I should double-check.\n\nI recall that in \"Two Treatises of Government,\" Locke discusses the social contract and how individuals consent to be governed. He argues that in the state of nature, people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property, but there's no formal way to enforce these rights. So, they agree to form a government to protect these rights.\n\nIn this social contract, individuals give up some of their natural freedom to the community, but they do so with the understanding that their rights will be protected by the government.\n\nNow, regarding decision-making, Locke did support the idea of majority rule in the context of the social contract. He believed that the consent of the governed is important, and that the will of the majority should prevail in making decisions for the society.\n\nBut, he also emphasized that the government's power is limited and that it must act within certain bounds to protect individual rights.\n\nSo, going back to the question, it seems that Locke would argue that by consenting to form a body politic, individuals obligate themselves to submit to the determination of the majority, as that represents the collective will of the society.\n\nThis aligns with his ideas on democracy and majority rule.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's another perspective. For example, perhaps he thought that people submit to the determination of the laws passed by the legislature, which would be representative of the people's will.\n\nBut, in that case, it would still be akin to submitting to the majority's decision, as laws are typically passed by a majority vote.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he thought that people submit to the determination of the executive power, which enforces the laws.\n\nBut again, the executive power is supposed to act in accordance with the laws made by the legislature, which again reflects the will of the majority.\n\nSo, whether it's the legislature or the executive, ultimately, it's the will of the majority that individuals are submitting to when they consent to the social contract.\n\nTherefore, option A, \"the majority,\" seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider a specific quote from Locke. In \"Two Treatises of Government,\" he writes:\n\n\"Men being, as has been said, by nature all free, equal, and independent, no one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the political power of another, without his own consent. The only way whereby any one can transfer his natural liberty to the political power is by agreeing with other men to join and unite into a community, for their comfortable, safe, and peaceful living, one amongst another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties, and a greater security against any, that are not of it.\"\n\nThis passage emphasizes that individuals consent to form a community for mutual benefit and security. It doesn't directly answer the question about submitting to the determination of the majority, but it sets the context for why people enter into a social contract.\n\nAnother relevant quote from Locke is:\n\n\"When any number of men have, by the consent of every individual, made a community, they have thereby agreed that every one shall be bound by the decisions of the majority, and that the majority shall have the power to act for the rest in all that is necessary to those ends for which they united into one community.\"\n\nThis quote directly supports the idea that in forming a community, individuals agree to be bound by the decisions of the majority.\n\nTherefore, based on Locke's philosophy, particularly as expressed in \"Two Treatises of Government,\" it's clear that by consenting to form a body politic, individuals obligate themselves to submit to the determination of the majority.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. the majority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
