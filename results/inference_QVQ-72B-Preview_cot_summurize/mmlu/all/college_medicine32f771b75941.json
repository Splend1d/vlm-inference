                    "text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a chemical reaction involving ethane and oxygen producing carbon dioxide and water. The question is, if I start with 84 grams of ethane and unlimited oxygen, how many grams of carbon dioxide will be produced? The options are 78g, 528g, 264g, or 156g.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the reaction. The unbalanced equation is C2H4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O. But it's not balanced, so I should balance it to figure out the stoichiometry correctly.\n\nLet me balance the equation. Starting with:\n\nC2H4 + O2 -> 2CO2 + 2H2O\n\nWait, let me check that. I have 2 carbon atoms in ethane, so I need 2 CO2 molecules to balance carbon. For hydrogen, there are 4 hydrogens in ethane, so I need 2 H2O molecules to balance hydrogen. For oxygen, on the product side, each CO2 has 2 oxygens and each H2O has 1 oxygen, so that's 2*2 + 2*1 = 6 oxygens on the product side. Therefore, I need 3 O2 molecules on the reactant side because each O2 provides 2 oxygens. So the balanced equation should be:\n\nC2H4 + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 2H2O\n\nOkay, that looks balanced now.\n\nNow, I need to find out how much carbon dioxide is produced from 84 grams of ethane. Since oxygen is unlimited, ethane is the limiting reactant.\n\nFirst, I should convert the mass of ethane to moles, then use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to find the moles of CO2 produced, and finally convert that to grams.\n\nLet me find the molar mass of ethane. Ethane is C2H4. Carbon has an atomic weight of 12 amu, and hydrogen is 1 amu.\n\nSo, molar mass of C2H4 = (2*12) + (4*1) = 24 + 4 = 28 g/mol\n\nNow, 84 grams of ethane is how many moles?\n\nMoles of ethane = mass / molar mass = 84 g / 28 g/mol = 3 moles\n\nAccording to the balanced equation, 1 mole of C2H4 produces 2 moles of CO2.\n\nSo, 3 moles of C2H4 will produce 3 * 2 = 6 moles of CO2\n\nNow, what's the molar mass of CO2? Carbon is 12 amu, and oxygen is 16 amu each.\n\nSo, molar mass of CO2 = 12 + (2*16) = 12 + 32 = 44 g/mol\n\nTherefore, 6 moles of CO2 have a mass of 6 * 44 = 264 grams\n\nSo, the answer should be 264 grams of CO2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the balanced equation: C2H4 + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 2H2O\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nMolar mass of ethane: 28 g/mol\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nMoles of ethane: 84 g / 28 g/mol = 3 moles\n\nStoichiometry: 1 mole C2H4 produces 2 moles CO2, so 3 moles C2H4 produce 6 moles CO2.\n\nMolar mass of CO2: 44 g/mol\n\nMass of CO2: 6 moles * 44 g/mol = 264 grams\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think the answer is 264 grams, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{264g} \\]"
