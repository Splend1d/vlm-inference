I need to pick the correct answer from these choices.\n\nFirst off, I know that North Dakota is a state in the United States, located in the Midwestern region. It's known for its agricultural production, like wheat and soybeans, and also for its oil reserves. But what's its capital?\n\nLet me think about this. I think I learned about state capitals in school, but it's been a while. I remember that some state capitals have the same name as famous cities or historical figures. For example, Boston is the capital of Massachusetts, and Sacramento is the capital of California. But that doesn't help me here.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Bismarck: I've heard of Bismarck. I think it's a city in North Dakota. Is it the capital? I seem to recall that it is, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check.\n\nB. Fargo: Fargo is another city in North Dakota. It's known for the Coen brothers' movie \"Fargo,\" which is set there. But is it the capital? I don't think so. I think it's a major city in the state but not the capital.\n\nC. Sioux Falls: This sounds familiar, but I think this is in South Dakota, not North Dakota. South Dakota has Sioux Falls, which is a pretty big city there. So, probably not the capital of North Dakota.\n\nD. Pierre: This is a city in South Dakota as well, I believe. It's the capital of South Dakota, actually. So, that can't be the capital of North Dakota.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Bismarck is the most likely option among the given choices. I should probably go with A. Bismarck as the capital of North Dakota.\n\nJust to make sure, I can recall that in geography class, we learned about Bismarck being the capital of North Dakota. It's centrally located in the state and serves as the seat of government. Plus, it's the smallest city among the options, which might make sense for being the capital.\n\nLet me double-check: Fargo is a larger city in North Dakota, known for its connection to the film industry, but it's not the capital. Sioux Falls is definitely in South Dakota, and Pierre is also in South Dakota. So, by elimination, Bismarck is the correct answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with that choice. The capital of North Dakota is Bismarck.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Bismarck}} \\]"
