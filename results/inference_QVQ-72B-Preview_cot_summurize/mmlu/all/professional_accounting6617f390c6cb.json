                    "text": "So I have this question about general partnerships, and I need to figure out which of these statements is not true about a partner's rights or privileges in such a partnership. Let me see, I'm a bit rusty on partnership law, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst off, a general partnership is when two or more people join together to run a business. Each partner is involved in the management and operations of the business, and importantly, each partner is personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. So, that's the basic background.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. To participate in management.\n\nI think this is generally true. In a general partnership, all partners have the right to participate in the management of the business. That's kind of the point of being a partner, right? They get a say in how the business is run. So, I don't think this is the incorrect one.\n\nB. To review accounting records.\n\nAgain, as a partner, you should have the right to review the accounting records. Transparency is important in partnerships, and partners typically have the right to inspect the books and records to ensure everything is above board. So, this seems correct as well.\n\nC. To enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners.\n\nHmm, this one seems a bit tricky. In a general partnership, each partner has the authority to bind the partnership in contracts with third parties. That means if one partner signs a contract, the partnership is bound by it, unless there's some agreement stating otherwise. However, there might be limitations if there's a partnership agreement that requires consent from all partners for certain types of contracts or decisions. But generally, each partner can enter into contracts on behalf of the partnership without needing the other partners' consent. So, maybe this isn't always true, depending on the specific agreements in place.\n\nD. To be liable only for personal negligence.\n\nThis one is interesting. In a general partnership, each partner is jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. That means if the partnership can't pay its debts, creditors can go after the personal assets of any partner to satisfy those debts, regardless of whether that partner was directly responsible for the debt. So, even if a partner wasn't negligent personally, they can still be held liable for the partnership's obligations. That seems to suggest that option D might be incorrect because partners aren't only liable for their own negligence; they're liable for the partnership's obligations in general.\n\nLet me double-check that. If a partner acts negligently and causes damage to a third party, the partnership as a whole would be liable, and so would the other partners, even if they weren't involved in that specific act. So, yes, partners are liable beyond just their personal negligence.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the one that's not generally true. Partners in a general partnership are not only liable for their personal negligence; they're liable for the partnership's obligations as a whole, including the actions of other partners.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider the other options again:\n\nA. Participate in management \u2013 generally true.\n\nB. Review accounting records \u2013 generally true.\n\nC. Enter into contracts without consent \u2013 generally true, though there might be some exceptions based on specific partnership agreements.\n\nD. Liable only for personal negligence \u2013 not generally true, as partners are jointly and severally liable for partnership obligations.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option D is the correct answer to the question \"A partner in a general partnership is usually not entitled to which of the following?\"\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"not entitled to,\" so it's asking which of these a partner doesn't have the right to do. Since D is stating that a partner is only liable for personal negligence, which isn't accurate in a general partnership, it means they are not entitled to be liable only for personal negligence because they are liable for more than that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance that D could be considered correct in some contexts. For example, in limited partnerships, partners have limited liability, but that's not the case here; we're talking about general partnerships where all partners have unlimited liability for the partnership's obligations.\n\nAdditionally, if there's a partnership agreement that limits a partner's authority to bind the partnership in certain situations, but generally, in the absence of such agreements, each partner has the authority to enter into contracts without the consent of the others.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
