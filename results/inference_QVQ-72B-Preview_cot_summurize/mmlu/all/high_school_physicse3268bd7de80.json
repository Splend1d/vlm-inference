                    "text": "Let's see what's going on here. I have an electron that's moving upwards into a region with a uniform magnetic field that's directed into the page. The electron has a mass \\(m\\), charge \\(-e\\), and it's moving with a speed \\(v\\) upwards. I need to describe its subsequent circular motion and choose the correct option among A, B, C, and D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a charged particle moves in a magnetic field. I know that when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it experiences a Lorentz force that makes it move in a circular path. The Lorentz force is given by:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = q \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\]\n\nwhere \\(q\\) is the charge, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the velocity, and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the magnetic field.\n\nSince the electron is moving upwards and the magnetic field is into the page, I need to determine the direction of the force using the right-hand rule. Let's see: point my right thumb in the direction of the velocity (upwards), and my fingers in the direction of the magnetic field (into the page). The force should be perpendicular to both, so my palm should face in the direction of the force. Wait, actually, for the cross product, using the right-hand rule, if \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is upwards and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is into the page, the force should be to the left.\n\nBut the electron has a negative charge, so the actual force would be in the opposite direction, which would be to the right. So, the force is to the right.\n\nNow, this force acts as a centripetal force, causing the electron to move in a circle. The centripetal force is given by:\n\n\\[F_c = m \\frac{v^2}{r}\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass, \\(v\\) is the velocity, and \\(r\\) is the radius of the circular path.\n\nSetting this equal to the Lorentz force magnitude:\n\n\\[m \\frac{v^2}{r} = |q| v B\\]\n\nBut since the charge is negative, I should be careful with the signs. The magnitude of the force is indeed \\(|q| v B\\), so:\n\n\\[m \\frac{v^2}{r} = |q| v B\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[r = \\frac{m v}{|q| B}\\]\n\nFor an electron, \\(q = -e\\), where \\(e\\) is the elementary charge. So, \\(|q| = e\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[r = \\frac{m v}{e B}\\]\n\nSo, the radius of the path is \\(\\frac{m v}{e B}\\), which matches parts A and B, but not C and D.\n\nNow, I need to determine the direction of rotation. Is it clockwise or counterclockwise?\n\nGiven that the electron is moving upwards into the page and the magnetic field is into the page, and the force is to the right, I need to visualize this.\n\nLet me draw a quick diagram in my mind:\n\n- The page is considered the x-y plane.\n\n- The magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is into the page, so in the negative z-direction.\n\n- The electron is moving upwards, say along the y-axis.\n\n- Using the right-hand rule, \\(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\) points in the positive x-direction, but since the charge is negative, the force is in the negative x-direction.\n\nSo, the force is to the left (negative x-direction). Therefore, if the electron is moving upwards, and being forced to the left, its circular path should be clockwise when looking from above.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the electron is moving upwards (along y), and the force is to the left (along -x), then its path should curve to the left, meaning it's rotating clockwise in the plane of the page.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the right-hand rule for the magnetic field. The magnetic field is into the page, electron is moving upwards, and the force is to the left, which corresponds to a clockwise rotation.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is clockwise rotation with a radius of path \\(r = \\frac{m v}{e B}\\).\n\nSo, the answer should be A: Clockwise rotation; radius of path = mv/(eB).\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't any confusion. Sometimes, the direction can be tricky with negative charges and magnetic fields pointing into the page.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use Fleming's left-hand rule for motion in magnetic fields. According to Fleming's left-hand rule:\n\n- Extend your left hand.\n\n- Point your thumb in the direction of the motion (upwards).\n\n- Point your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field (into the page).\n\n- The force will be perpendicular to both, which for my left hand would be to the left.\n\nAgain, since the charge is negative, the actual force is in the opposite direction, to the right. So, the electron is being forced to the right as it moves upwards, leading to a clockwise rotation when viewed from above.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct choice is A: Clockwise rotation; radius of path = mv/(eB).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
