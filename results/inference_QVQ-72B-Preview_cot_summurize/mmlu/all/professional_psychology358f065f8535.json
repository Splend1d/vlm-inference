                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a skewed distribution. It says that in a skewed smooth distribution with a tail extended to the left, the statistic with the highest value is which one: standard deviation, mode, median, or mean.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a skewed distribution is. Skewness in statistics refers to the asymmetry of a probability distribution. If the tail is extended to the left, that means there are more extreme values on the left side of the distribution. I think that's called negative skewness or left-skewed distribution.\n\nIn a symmetric distribution like the normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal. But in a skewed distribution, they can differ.\n\nFor a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, because the tail is pulling the mean towards the lower values. The mode is the highest point of the distribution, which in a left-skewed distribution is towards the right side.\n\nSo, in this case, the mode should be higher than the median, and the median is higher than the mean.\n\nBut wait, the options include standard deviation. Standard deviation measures the spread of the data, but it's not a measure of central tendency like mean or median. In a skewed distribution, the standard deviation can be affected by the skewness, but it's not directly comparable to mean, median, or mode in terms of value.\n\nMaybe the question is asking which of these statistics has the highest value in terms of the actual numerical value in the distribution.\n\nGiven that, in a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, and the mode is higher than the median, it seems like the mode would be the highest.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose I have a dataset where most values are clustered at higher numbers, but there are a few extremely low values pulling the tail to the left.\n\nFor instance, consider this dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7.\n\nHere, the mode is 5 (since it appears three times), the median is 5 (the middle value), and the mean is (1+2+3+4+5+5+5+6+7)/9 = 38/9 \u2248 4.22.\n\nSo, mode = 5, median = 5, mean \u2248 4.22.\n\nWait, in this case, the mode and median are both 5, which is higher than the mean.\n\nBut in some left-skewed distributions, could the median be higher than the mode?\n\nLet me try another example: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.\n\nHere, the mode is 2 (appears twice), median is 3, and mean is (1+2+2+3+4+5+5)/7 = 22/7 \u2248 3.14.\n\nSo, mode = 2, median \u2248 3, mean \u2248 3.14.\n\nIn this case, the mode is still lower than the median and the mean.\n\nWait, no, in this second example, mode < median < mean, but according to my earlier understanding, in left-skewed distribution, mean < median < mode.\n\nWait, perhaps I have it backwards. Let me look it up.\n\nUpon checking, in a left (negatively) skewed distribution, the tail is to the left, which means there are extreme low values. So, the mean is pulled down by these low values, making it less than the median. The mode is the highest frequency, which is towards the right side, higher than both mean and median.\n\nSo, in left-skewed distribution: mean < median < mode.\n\nTherefore, the mode has the highest value.\n\nBut let's consider the standard deviation as well. Standard deviation measures the spread of the data points around the mean. In a left-skewed distribution, because of the extreme low values, the standard deviation could be relatively large, but it's not a measure of central tendency and doesn't directly compare in value to mean, median, or mode.\n\nSo, among the options given, the statistic with the highest value in a left-skewed distribution is the mode.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. mode.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
