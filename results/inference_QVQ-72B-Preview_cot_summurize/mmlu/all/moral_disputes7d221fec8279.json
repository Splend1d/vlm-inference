                    "text": "So I have this question about cognitive-behavioral therapy, and I need to figure out what its main goal is from the given options. The options are:\n\nA. Build grit.\n\nB. Minimize distorted thinking.\n\nC. Reward good behavior.\n\nD. Achieve stoic wisdom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is. From what I recall, CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It's often used to help people manage and overcome a wide range of psychological problems, from depression and anxiety to phobias and eating disorders.\n\nNow, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Build grit.\n\nGrit is a term that's been popularized in recent years, referring to perseverance and passion for long-term goals. While CBT might help someone develop resilience and perseverance indirectly by addressing their thought patterns and behaviors, its primary focus isn't specifically on building grit. So, this seems like a secondary benefit rather than the main goal of CBT.\n\nOption B: Minimize distorted thinking.\n\nThis sounds promising. CBT is well-known for its emphasis on identifying and challenging distorted or irrational thoughts, which are believed to contribute to negative emotions and maladaptive behaviors. Techniques like cognitive restructuring are used to help clients recognize and change these thought patterns. So, minimizing distorted thinking seems like a central goal of CBT.\n\nOption C: Reward good behavior.\n\nWhile behavior modification techniques might involve rewarding positive behaviors, CBT is more than just behaviorism. It combines cognitive and behavioral approaches, focusing not just on changing behaviors but also on changing the thoughts and beliefs that underlie those behaviors. So, while rewarding good behavior might be a part of CBT, it's not the primary or sole goal.\n\nOption D: Achieve stoic wisdom.\n\nStoicism is a philosophical school of thought that emphasizes rationality, self-control, and resilience in the face of life's challenges. While CBT does share some similarities with Stoicism, such as emphasizing control over one's thoughts and emotions, CBT is a therapeutic approach rooted in empirical evidence and psychological theory, not a philosophical system. Achieving stoic wisdom isn't a goal of CBT.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B\u2014minimize distorted thinking\u2014seems to be the most accurate description of the primary goal of cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about it differently. Maybe I should consider the underlying principles of CBT.\n\nCBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. Negative thoughts can lead to negative emotions and maladaptive behaviors, and vice versa. By identifying and challenging distorted thoughts, CBT aims to break this cycle, leading to improvements in both emotions and behaviors.\n\nSo, minimizing distorted thinking aligns closely with this approach. When someone in CBT learns to recognize and correct their distorted thinking, they're better equipped to manage their emotions and behaviors in a healthier way.\n\nAdditionally, CBT often involves setting specific, measurable goals for clients, such as reducing symptoms of anxiety or depression, improving interpersonal relationships, or enhancing problem-solving skills. However, these goals are typically achieved through the process of changing distorted thinking and maladaptive behaviors.\n\nTherefore, minimizing distorted thinking is a fundamental goal that underpins many of the specific outcomes CBT seeks to achieve.\n\nIn contrast, building grit, rewarding good behavior, or achieving stoic wisdom may be indirect benefits or complementary aspects of CBT, but they aren't the primary focus of the therapy.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary goal of cognitive-behavioral therapy is to minimize distorted thinking. So, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
