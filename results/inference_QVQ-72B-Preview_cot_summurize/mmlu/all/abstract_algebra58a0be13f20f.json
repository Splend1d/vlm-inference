                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these two statements about group theory. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H.\"\n\nOkay, so first off, I need to recall what aH represents. I think aH is the left coset of H in G with respect to a. So, aH is the set {ah | h \u2208 H}.\n\nNow, the statement says that aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about this. If a is in H, then aH is indeed a subgroup of G because H is a subgroup, and multiplying by an element of H just permutes the elements of H if a is in H. Wait, is that right?\n\nActually, I'm a bit confused. Let me look up what conditions a coset aH is a subgroup.\n\nI recall that in group theory, a subgroup H of G is normal if and only if for every a in G, the left coset aH is equal to the right coset Ha. But I don't think that's directly relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the definition of a subgroup. A subgroup must contain the identity element, be closed under the group operation, and contain inverses for all its elements.\n\nIf a is in H, and H is a subgroup, then aH is just H itself, because H is closed under multiplication by its elements. So, aH = H, which is a subgroup.\n\nBut what if a is not in H? Then aH is a left coset different from H. Is aH a subgroup in this case?\n\nLet me consider an example. Take G = Z, the integers under addition, and H = 2Z, the even integers, which is a subgroup.\n\nLet a = 1, which is not in H. Then a + H = {1 + 2k | k \u2208 Z} is the set of all odd integers.\n\nIs the set of all odd integers a subgroup of Z? Let's see: it doesn't contain the identity element, which is 0, so no, it's not a subgroup.\n\nSo, in this case, a is not in H, and aH is not a subgroup.\n\nTherefore, in this example, aH is a subgroup if and only if a is in H.\n\nWait, but is this always true for any group G and any subgroup H?\n\nLet me think about another example. Suppose G is the symmetric group S3, and H is a subgroup of order 2, say H = {e, (12)}.\n\nLet a be another element not in H, say a = (13).\n\nThen aH = {(13)e, (13)(12)} = {(13), (123)}.\n\nIs this a subgroup of S3? Let's check:\n\n1. It contains the identity? No, it has (13) and (123), but not e. So, no, it's not a subgroup.\n\nSo, again, aH is not a subgroup when a is not in H.\n\nNow, what if a is in H? Let's take a = (12), which is in H.\n\nThen aH = {(12)e, (12)(12)} = {(12), e}, which is H itself, a subgroup.\n\nSo, in this case, aH is a subgroup if and only if a is in H.\n\nBased on these examples, it seems that Statement 1 is true.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the general case.\n\nSuppose aH is a subgroup of G.\n\nWe need to show that a must be in H.\n\nSince aH is a subgroup, it contains the identity element of G.\n\nTherefore, there exists some h in H such that a * h = e, where e is the identity.\n\nSo, a = e * h^{-1} = h^{-1}, which is in H, since H is a subgroup and contains inverses.\n\nTherefore, if aH is a subgroup, then a must be in H.\n\nConversely, if a is in H, then aH = H, which is a subgroup.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky.\n\nSo, we have two left cosets aH and bH, and we're told they are equal if and only if ab is in H.\n\nFirst, I need to recall when two left cosets are equal.\n\nI think that aH = bH if and only if b^{-1}a is in H.\n\nLet me verify that.\n\nSuppose aH = bH.\n\nThen, for every element in aH, there is an element in bH, and vice versa.\n\nSo, a * h1 = b * h2 for some h1, h2 in H.\n\nTherefore, a = b * h2 * h1^{-1}.\n\nSince h2 * h1^{-1} is in H, this implies that a is in bH.\n\nSimilarly, b is in aH.\n\nTherefore, a and b are in the same coset.\n\nBut I think the standard result is that aH = bH if and only if b^{-1}a is in H.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nSuppose b^{-1}a is in H.\n\nThen, b^{-1}a = h for some h in H.\n\nTherefore, a = b * h.\n\nThen, aH = (b * h)H = b(hH) = bH, since H is a subgroup and hH = H.\n\nTherefore, if b^{-1}a is in H, then aH = bH.\n\nConversely, if aH = bH, then as we saw earlier, a is in bH, so a = b * h for some h in H, which implies b^{-1}a = h, so b^{-1}a is in H.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement should be: aH = bH if and only if b^{-1}a is in H.\n\nBut Statement 2 says: aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.\n\nThis is different because it says ab is in H, not b^{-1}a.\n\nSo, unless ab = b^{-1}a for all a and b in G, which is not generally true, Statement 2 is incorrect.\n\nLet me consider a counterexample.\n\nTake G = S3 again, H = {e, (12)}.\n\nLet a = (13), b = (23).\n\nThen aH = {(13)e, (13)(12)} = {(13), (123)}\n\nbH = {(23)e, (23)(12)} = {(23), (132)}\n\nNow, are aH and bH equal? Let's see:\n\naH = {(13), (123)}\n\nbH = {(23), (132)}\n\nIn S3, (123) = (132), because (123) = (132).\n\nSo, aH = {(13), (123)} and bH = {(23), (123)}.\n\nThese are not equal, so aH \u2260 bH.\n\nNow, according to Statement 2, aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.\n\nBut a = (13), b = (23), so ab = (13)(23) = (13)(23) = (132), which is in S3 but not in H, since H = {e, (12)}.\n\nSo, in this case, aH \u2260 bH and ab is not in H, which is consistent with the standard theorem.\n\nBut Statement 2 claims that aH = bH if and only if ab is in H, which is not what the standard theorem says.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nStatement 1: True\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
