                    "text": "So I have this problem about a call option and I need to find its intrinsic value at the time of initial investment. Let me see what information is given.\n\nSmythe Co. invested $200 in a call option for 100 shares of Gin Co. $.50 par common stock. The market price was $10 per share when they invested. The option expires in three months and has an exercise price of $9 per share.\n\nOkay, so a call option gives the holder the right to buy a stock at a specified price (the exercise price) by a certain date (the expiration date). The intrinsic value of a call option is the difference between the current market price of the stock and the exercise price, but only if that difference is positive. If the market price is below the exercise price, the intrinsic value is zero because there's no benefit to exercising the option.\n\nSo, intrinsic value of a call option = max (current stock price - exercise price, 0).\n\nGiven that, the current stock price is $10 per share, and the exercise price is $9 per share. So, $10 - $9 = $1 per share.\n\nBut wait, the option is for 100 shares, so the total intrinsic value would be $1 per share times 100 shares, which is $100.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $50\n\nB. $100\n\nC. $200\n\nD. $900\n\nSo, $100 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something else I need to consider.\n\nThe par value is $.50, but I don't think that affects the intrinsic value of the option. The investment amount is $200, but that's probably the premium paid for the option, not directly related to the intrinsic value.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the intrinsic value at the time of initial investment is $100.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the option is in the money, at the money, or out of the money. In this case, since the market price is higher than the exercise price, the option is in the money.\n\nYes, so the intrinsic value should indeed be the difference between the market price and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares.\n\nSo, intrinsic value = (market price - exercise price) * number of shares\n\n= ($10 - $9) * 100\n\n= $1 * 100\n\n= $100\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward.\n\nI think the answer is B. $100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
