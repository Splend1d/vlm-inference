                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about Mr. Thomas, a school psychologist, working with Ms. Riddle, a special education teacher, to support Mark, a student with autism spectrum disorder. The key point is that Mr. Thomas doesn't work directly with Mark; instead, Ms. Riddle is acting as the mediator between Mr. Thomas and Mark. And the question is asking what consultation model this collaboration represents from the given options: Systems, Resource, Triadic, or Adaptive learning environments.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each of these consultation models entails. Since I might not remember all the details off the top of my head, I'll have to recall or think through what each model involves.\n\nStarting with the Systems model, I think this approach views the school as a complex system with interconnected parts. Consultation in this model would involve addressing issues at the system level, maybe changing policies or practices that affect multiple students or the school as a whole. But in this scenario, it seems more focused on an individual student, Mark, rather than the entire school system. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nNext, the Resource model. I recall that this model involves the consultant providing resources, expertise, or support to the consultee, who then applies that to the situation at hand. In this case, Mr. Thomas is providing his psychological expertise to Ms. Riddle, who is then using that to better support Mark. This sounds a bit like the Resource model, but I should check the other options first.\n\nTriadic consultation is another option. From what I remember, the Triadic model involves three parties: the consultant, the consultee, and the client. Here, Mr. Thomas is the consultant, Ms. Riddle is the consultee, and Mark is the client. This seems to fit the description pretty well. But is this the best answer?\n\nLastly, Adaptive learning environments. I'm not as familiar with this term in the context of consultation models. Maybe it refers to adjusting the learning environment to meet the needs of the student. While that could be part of the process, it doesn't seem to directly describe the consultation model being used here.\n\nSo, comparing the options:\n\n- Systems: More about broader school changes, which doesn't seem to match.\n\n- Resource: Mr. Thomas is providing resources or expertise to Ms. Riddle, who then supports Mark. This could be a possibility.\n\n- Triadic: Clearly involves three parties: consultant, consultee, and client, which matches the scenario.\n\n- Adaptive learning environments: More about adjusting the environment, which might be an outcome but isn't directly a consultation model.\n\nGiven this, the Triadic model seems to be the most accurate description of the collaboration between Mr. Thomas and Ms. Riddle in supporting Mark.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think deeper about the Resource model. Is the Triadic model just a specific type of Resource model, or are they distinct? I need to make sure I'm not confusing the two.\n\nUpon a bit of reflection, I realize that the Resource model is more about the consultant providing resources or advice, but it doesn't necessarily specify the number of parties involved. The Triadic model, on the other hand, specifically involves three parties: consultant, consultee, and client. So, while the Resource model could be seen as a part of the Triadic model, the Triadic model is more precise in describing the relationship structure.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Triadic.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe the Systems model could be involved if the collaboration leads to changes in the school system that benefit Mark. However, the scenario doesn't indicate any systemic changes; it's specifically about Mr. Thomas and Ms. Riddle working together to support Mark individually.\n\nAdaptive learning environments might be relevant in the sense that Ms. Riddle could be adapting the learning environment for Mark based on Mr. Thomas's advice, but again, that seems more like an outcome of the consultation rather than the model itself.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the Triadic model is the most appropriate description of the consultation happening between Mr. Thomas and Ms. Riddle for Mark's benefit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Triadic}} \\]"
