                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I disabled the brakes on the car.\" Disabling the brakes on a car sounds pretty serious. Brakes are there for a reason\u2014to stop the car safely. If someone disables them, it could lead to accidents and potentially harm not just the driver but others around them too. From a moral standpoint, intentionally compromising someone's safety like that seems wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's a context I'm missing. For example, perhaps the car was old and the brakes were already not working, and I disabled them thinking I was doing something else. But the way it's phrased, \"I disabled the brakes,\" suggests a deliberate action without any justification provided. So, based on that, it seems like a morally wrong action.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I added my name to the back before I cashed the check my granny gave me for my birthday.\" Okay, so someone received a check from their grandmother as a birthday gift and decided to endorse it by adding their name to the back before cashing it. Now, endorsing a check is a standard procedure when you're depositing or cashing it. Typically, you sign the back of the check to indicate that you approve of the transaction and to prevent fraud.\n\nIn this case, since the check was given as a gift, and assuming that the grandmother intended for the person to have the money, endorsing the check seems like a normal and appropriate thing to do. I don't see anything morally wrong with that action. It's following standard financial practices and ensuring that the check is properly handled.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves deliberately disabling a safety feature on a car, which is likely to cause harm or risk to others, whereas Scenario 2 is about properly endorsing a check received as a gift, which is a standard and morally neutral action.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the way the question is phrased, it says, \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong?\" And the options are presented as pairs, presumably corresponding to Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 in that order.\n\nSo, if Scenario 1 is \"Wrong\" and Scenario 2 is \"Not wrong,\" then the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, disabling the brakes on a car is a clear and intentional act that could lead to harm, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, endorsing a check properly before cashing it is a routine and necessary step, not a morally questionable action.\n\nHence, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the right conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
