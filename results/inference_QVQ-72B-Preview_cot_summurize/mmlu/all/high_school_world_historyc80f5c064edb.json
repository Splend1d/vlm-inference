The options are:\n\nA. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe\n\nB. Refinement of gunpowder technologies\n\nC. The development and application of steam-powered technologies\n\nD. The implementation of joint-stock companies\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"global hegemony\" means in this context. Hegemony generally refers to the dominance of one state or power over others, often through cultural, economic, or political means, rather than just through military might. So, in this case, it's about Western Europe's rise to dominance on a global scale between 1450 and 1750.\n\nNow, let's consider each option one by one to see which one contributed the least to this dominance.\n\nOption A: The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe.\n\nThis is referring to something like the Columbian Exchange, right? After Columbus reached the Americas, there was a significant transfer of plants, animals, and diseases between the Old World and the New World. This exchange had profound impacts on both regions.\n\nFor example, crops from the Americas like potatoes, tomatoes, and maize (corn) were introduced to Europe and eventually became major parts of European diets. Similarly, European crops like wheat and livestock like cattle and horses were introduced to the Americas, changing the landscape and economies there.\n\nThis exchange led to increased food production and diversity in Europe, which could have supported population growth and economic development. So, it seems like this was pretty important for Western European hegemony.\n\nOption B: Refinement of gunpowder technologies.\n\nGunpowder was known in China before it spread to the Middle East and then to Europe. In Europe, gunpowder was used to make firearms and cannons, which revolutionized warfare.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, European powers refined gunpowder technologies, making their weapons more effective and reliable. This gave them a significant military advantage over many of the societies they encountered during their explorations and conquests.\n\nHaving superior military technology was crucial for establishing and maintaining colonies, controlling trade routes, and projecting power across the globe. So, this seems like a major contributor to Western European hegemony.\n\nOption C: The development and application of steam-powered technologies.\n\nSteam power is often associated with the Industrial Revolution, which is typically placed in the late 18th to the 19th century. The first practical steam engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, and James Watt improved it in the late 18th century.\n\nGiven that the time frame for this question is 1450 to 1750 C.E., steam-powered technologies were just beginning to emerge at the very end of this period. So, their impact on Western European hegemony during most of this time would have been minimal.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the Industrial Revolution, which was driven by steam power, really took off in the late 18th century, which is just beyond the end of this time frame. Therefore, while steam power would become incredibly important later on, during the 1450-1750 period, its role was limited.\n\nOption D: The implementation of joint-stock companies.\n\nJoint-stock companies are businesses where individuals can own shares of the company, allowing for the pooling of capital and the sharing of risks and profits. This innovation was crucial for financing large-scale ventures, such as overseas exploration and trade.\n\nCompanies like the Dutch East India Company and the English East India Company were established as joint-stock companies in the 17th century. These companies played a massive role in European imperial expansion, controlling trade routes, establishing colonies, and amassing wealth that fueled European economies.\n\nSo, joint-stock companies were instrumental in extending European influence and economic power globally during this period.\n\nPutting it all together, options A, B, and D were all significant contributors to Western European hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. The exchange of food sources, advancements in gunpowder technology, and the rise of joint-stock companies all played major roles in enhancing European power and influence worldwide.\n\nOn the other hand, option C, the development and application of steam-powered technologies, while enormously important in later centuries, was only just beginning to emerge at the very end of this period and had limited impact during the majority of the 1450-1750 timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. The development and application of steam-powered technologies contributed the least to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
