                    "text": "So I have this problem: \"What is the square root of 81 squared?\" And the options are A. 9, B. 27, C. 81, D. 729. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that squaring a number means multiplying it by itself. So, 81 squared would be 81 multiplied by itself, which is 81 \u00d7 81. Let me calculate that. 81 times 80 is 6,480, and 81 times 1 is 81. So, 6,480 plus 81 is 6,561. So, 81 squared is 6,561.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the square root of that result. So, square root of 6,561. I need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives me 6,561.\n\nLet me think about square roots. I know that the square root of 81 is 9, because 9 times 9 is 81. But here, we have 81 squared, which is 6,561, and then taking the square root of that.\n\nWait a minute, is there a property that can simplify this? Like, is there a way to combine the operations?\n\nI recall that exponents can be multiplied when you have nested exponents. For example, if you have (a^b)^c, that's equal to a^(b*c). But here, it's a bit different. It's like having (a^b)^c, and then taking the c-th root. Wait, no, actually, square root is like raising to the power of 1/2.\n\nSo, maybe I can think of it as (81^2)^(1/2), which should be 81^(2*(1/2)) = 81^1 = 81. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I square 81 and get 6,561, and then take the square root of 6,561, should I get back to 81? That makes sense, because square and square root are inverse operations.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Suppose I have a number, say x, and I square it, then take the square root of that. So, square root of x squared. That should just give me back x, assuming x is positive.\n\nIn this case, x is 81, which is positive, so square root of 81 squared should be 81.\n\nWait, but what if x is negative? Would square root of x squared be x? No, because square root gives the positive root. So, for negative x, it would be positive x. But in this problem, since 81 is positive, it should be fine.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to think about this. Maybe by factoring 6,561.\n\nI know that 81 is 9 times 9, and 9 is 3 squared, so 81 is 3^4. Then, 81 squared is (3^4)^2 = 3^8. The square root of that would be (3^8)^(1/2) = 3^4 = 81. So, again, I get 81.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the prime factorization of 6,561. Since 81 is 3^4, then 81 squared is (3^4)^2 = 3^8. The square root of that is 3^(8/2) = 3^4 = 81.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Maybe I should try to calculate the square root of 6,561 directly, without thinking about exponents.\n\nSo, I need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 6,561.\n\nLet me try 80 squared: 80 \u00d7 80 = 6,400. That's less than 6,561.\n\n81 squared: 81 \u00d7 81 = 6,561. Perfect.\n\n82 squared: 82 \u00d7 82 = 6,724, which is more than 6,561.\n\nSo, 81 is the exact square root of 6,561.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 81.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any other way this could be interpreted?\n\nMaybe if I consider the negative square root. But usually, square root refers to the principal (positive) square root.\n\nIn mathematics, the square root of a number is the non-negative number that, when squared, gives the original number. So, yes, it should be 81.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is C. 81.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 81} \\]"
