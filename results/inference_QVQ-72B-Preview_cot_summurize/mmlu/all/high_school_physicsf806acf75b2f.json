                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about measuring the wavelength of a sound wave produced by a guitar string. There are four options, and I need to figure out which one is the correct and practical method using a meterstick. I'm not super confident about sound waves, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about sound waves and wavelengths. I know that when a guitar string vibrates, it produces sound waves in the air at a certain frequency. The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of the wave, right? The relationship between frequency (f), wavelength (\u03bb), and the speed of sound (v) is v = f * \u03bb. So, if I know the frequency and the speed of sound, I can find the wavelength. But in this case, it's given that the frequency is known, and I need to find the wavelength using a meterstick.\n\nOption A says to lightly touch the guitar string in the middle to create a single node and then measure the length of the string, which would be the wavelength. Hmm, I remember that when you touch the string at the middle, you're essentially creating a node there, and the string vibrates in two separate pieces. But I'm not sure if the length of the string directly gives me the wavelength. Maybe I need to think about the standing waves on the string.\n\nIn a guitar string fixed at both ends, the possible wavelengths are those that fit into the length of the string as integer multiples. The fundamental frequency (the lowest frequency) corresponds to half the wavelength being equal to the length of the string. So, for the fundamental mode, \u03bb = 2L, where L is the length of the string. But if I touch the string in the middle, I'm introducing a node there, which might change the mode of vibration. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this isn't the best approach.\n\nOption B suggests measuring the length of the guitar string, and that should be half the wavelength. Wait, that sounds familiar. Like in the fundamental mode, the length of the string is indeed half the wavelength. So, if I have the frequency and I measure the length of the string, I can use the formula \u03bb = 2L to find the wavelength. But the question says that the frequency is known, so maybe this is a straightforward way. However, I need to make sure if this is practical and correct in this context.\n\nOption C mentions adjusting the length of a pipe placed near the string to hear resonances and then measuring the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances, which should be half the wavelength. This sounds interesting. I recall that in acoustics, resonances occur when the frequency of the sound matches the natural frequencies of the pipe. For an open pipe, the resonant frequencies correspond to wavelengths that fit into the pipe's length as integer multiples. For a closed pipe, it's similar but with different boundary conditions.\n\nIn this case, if I have a pipe that's open at one end and closed at the other, the resonant frequencies occur when the pipe length is equal to (2n + 1)\u03bb/4 for a closed pipe, or n\u03bb/2 for an open pipe, where n is an integer. If I adjust the pipe length and listen for resonances, the difference between consecutive resonant lengths should give me some multiple of the wavelength. Specifically, for a closed pipe, the difference between consecutive resonant lengths should be \u03bb/4, and for an open pipe, it should be \u03bb/2.\n\nSo, if I measure the difference between pipe lengths for consecutive resonances and find it's \u03bb/2, that could be a way to determine the wavelength. This seems like a practical method, but I need to confirm if it's the best option among the given choices.\n\nOption D says to measure the peak-to-peak distance of the wave as it passes, and that should be the wavelength. This seems straightforward. If I could observe the sound wave and measure the distance between two adjacent peaks, that should indeed be the wavelength. However, sound waves are longitudinal waves, and they're not directly visible. So, measuring the peak-to-peak distance with a meterstick might not be practical unless I have some way to visualize the sound wave, like with a oscilloscope or some other measurement instrument. But the question specifies a meterstick, which is just for measuring lengths directly, not for detecting sound waveforms.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most straightforward and practical method. If I know the frequency and measure the length of the guitar string, assuming it's vibrating in its fundamental mode, then \u03bb = 2L. So, measuring the string length and doubling it should give me the wavelength. This seems correct and practical, assuming that the string is vibrating in its fundamental mode.\n\nOption C is also plausible but might be more complicated. Adjusting the pipe length to find resonances requires careful listening and precise measurements, and the difference between consecutive resonant lengths would give me \u03bb/2, so I'd need to double that to get the wavelength. But this seems like an extra step compared to just measuring the string length.\n\nOption A seems a bit unclear to me. Touching the string in the middle creates a node, which changes the mode of vibration, and I'm not sure if measuring the length of the string in that case directly gives me the wavelength. It might give me a different multiple of the wavelength depending on the mode.\n\nOption D, as I said, seems impractical because measuring the peak-to-peak distance of a sound wave with a meterstick isn't straightforward unless there's a way to visualize the wave, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option B: measure the length of the guitar string; this is half the wavelength.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
