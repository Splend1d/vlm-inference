                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Abdul, who lost sight in his right eye due to an accident. He's driving now, and he needs to judge the distance of vehicles around him. The question is asking which cues he can rely on, and the options are labeled as I, II, and III, with choices A through D specifying combinations of these.\n\nFirst off, since the question is about judging distance while driving with one eye, it's about depth perception. Normally, with two eyes, we get stereoscopic vision, which helps in judging distances. But Abdul has only one eye now, so he can't rely on that stereo effect.\n\nLet's think about the cues that can help him perceive depth with just one eye. These are called monocular cues. There are several of them:\n\n1. **Motion Parallax**: When you move, objects at different distances move across your field of view at different speeds. Closer objects seem to move faster than farther ones.\n\n2. **Relative Size**: If you know the approximate size of objects, you can judge their distance based on how big they appear. Larger images mean closer objects.\n\n3. **Overlap or Occlusion**: When one object blocks another, the one that's blocking is closer.\n\n4. **Texture Gradient**: Surfaces appear to have a texture that gets finer as they recede into the distance.\n\n5. **Linear Perspective**: Parallel lines appear to converge in the distance.\n\n6. **Atmospheric Perspective**: Distant objects appear less distinct due to atmospheric scattering.\n\n7. **Shadow and Lighting**: The way shadows are cast can give clues about the position and distance of objects.\n\n8. **Familiar Objects**: Knowing the standard size of certain objects can help judge their distance.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it mentions cues I, II, and III, but doesn't specify what these cues are. That's a bit tricky. Usually, in such questions, they provide specific cues or describe scenarios, but here it's just referring to I, II, and III without explanation.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to infer what I, II, and III might refer to based on the context of driving and distance judgment.\n\nLet me consider possible cues that are particularly relevant to driving:\n\n- **I**: Maybe related to the size of vehicles. Since cars and trucks have standard sizes, their apparent size can indicate distance.\n\n- **II**: Could be related to motion parallax. As vehicles move, their position changes relative to the background, which can give a sense of their distance.\n\n- **III**: Possibly related to the clarity or detail visible on the vehicle. Farther vehicles appear less detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I is related to visual cues, II to auditory cues, and III to somatosensory cues, but that seems less likely in the context of driving and distance perception.\n\nGiven that the question is about visual distance perception, it's probably focusing on visual cues.\n\nLet me consider that I, II, and III are specific visual cues, and I need to determine which of these Abdul can still use with one eye.\n\nIf I think about stereoscopic vision, which requires two eyes, Abdul can't use that. So, any cue that depends on having two different perspectives is out.\n\nTherefore, he can rely on monocular cues.\n\nAssuming that I, II, and III are different types of cues, and some are monocular while others are binocular, I need to identify which ones he can still use.\n\nIf I is a monocular cue, II is another monocular cue, and III is a binocular cue, then he can use I and II but not III.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II only\n\nGiven that, if I and II are monocular cues and III is a binocular cue, then the answer should be D. I and II only.\n\nHowever, without knowing exactly what I, II, and III represent, it's hard to be precise.\n\nMaybe I need to consider specific cues.\n\nLet's suppose:\n\n- I: Relative size\n\n- II: Motion parallax\n\n- III: Stereoscopic depth\n\nIn this case, since Abdul has only one eye, he can't use stereoscopic depth (III), but he can use relative size (I) and motion parallax (II).\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. I and II only.\n\nAlternatively, if III is another monocular cue that he can use, then the answer might change.\n\nBut assuming that III is the binocular cue, and I and II are monocular, then yes, D is the correct choice.\n\nAnother possibility is that III is a cue that doesn't require binocular vision, in which case he might be able to use all three.\n\nBut generally, in the context of depth perception with one eye, monocular cues are utilized, and binocular cues aren't available.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is D. I and II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
