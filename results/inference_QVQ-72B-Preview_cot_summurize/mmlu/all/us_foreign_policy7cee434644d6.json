Between 8 and 15\n\nC. Between 16 and 25\n\nD. More than 25\n\nHmm, I'm not an expert on this topic, but I do remember some countries have nuclear weapons while others don't. Let me think about which countries definitely have them.\n\nFirst, there are the original nuclear powers: the United States and Russia (formerly the Soviet Union). They both have large nuclear arsenals, right? So that's two.\n\nThen there's the United Kingdom, France, and China. I think they also have nuclear weapons. They are all permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and they're known to have nuclear capabilities. That brings the count to five.\n\nNow, I recall that there are other countries that have developed nuclear weapons over the years. For example, India and Pakistan both have nuclear weapons. They tested their first nuclear devices in the 1970s and 1990s, respectively. So that's seven now.\n\nWait, but I think Israel is also believed to have nuclear weapons, although they never officially confirm or deny it. Many experts suspect that Israel has a nuclear arsenal, so if we include Israel, that makes eight.\n\nThen there's North Korea. They have been testing nuclear weapons for several years now, so they definitely have nuclear capabilities. That would make it nine.\n\nI also remember that South Africa had a nuclear weapons program at one point, but I think they abandoned it and dismantled their nuclear weapons in the early 1990s. So, they don't have nuclear weapons anymore. So, I don't think we should count them.\n\nWhat about other countries? Is there any evidence that, say, Iran has nuclear weapons? I know there's been a lot of controversy about Iran's nuclear program, but as far as I know, they haven't actually built or tested a nuclear weapon yet. So, probably not.\n\nWhat about Japan? They've been talked about having the capability to build nuclear weapons quickly if they wanted to, but they don't have them currently. So, no.\n\nGermany is another country that could probably build nuclear weapons, but they've chosen not to. So, they shouldn't be counted.\n\nLet me think about some smaller countries. There was a case of Libya having a nuclear program, but that was shut down by Muammar Gaddafi before he was overthrown. So, no nuclear weapons there.\n\nWhat about Brazil or Argentina? I think both countries had nuclear programs in the past, but they signed treaties not to pursue nuclear weapons. So, I don't think they have them.\n\nNigeria has been mentioned sometimes, but I don't think they have nuclear weapons.\n\nNow, are there any other countries that might have nuclear weapons that I'm not thinking of? Maybe some in the former Soviet states, but I think after the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan all gave up their nuclear weapons.\n\nWait, Ukraine had some nuclear weapons after the Soviet Union fell apart, but they signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty and gave them back to Russia. So, they don't have them anymore.\n\nBelarus and Kazakhstan also had some nuclear weapons, but similarly, they gave them up.\n\nSo, that leaves us with the original five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea.\n\nThat's a total of nine countries.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Fewer than 7\n\nB. Between 8 and 15\n\nC. Between 16 and 25\n\nD. More than 25\n\nNine is between 8 and 15, so the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit unsure about Israel. Some sources say that Israel has nuclear weapons, but they neither confirm nor deny it. So, maybe it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nHowever, most experts agree that Israel likely possesses nuclear weapons, so it's probably safe to include them in the count.\n\nTherefore, the total is nine, which falls into the category of between 8 and 15.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
