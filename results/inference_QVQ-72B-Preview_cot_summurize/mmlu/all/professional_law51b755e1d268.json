                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. There's a 17-year-old boy who was playfully jostling with his 12-year-old brother. A pedestrian saw the boy pushing his brother and thought they were fighting. The pedestrian stepped in to help, but in doing so, the boy stumbled and fell into the pedestrian, causing the pedestrian to fall and break his arm. Now, if the pedestrian sues the boy to recover damages for his injury, which option should I choose?\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says the pedestrian should prevail because the pedestrian reasonably believed that the boy was about to injure his brother. Hmm, but the pedestrian was mistaken; they thought it was a fight but it was just playful jostling. Does that matter? I think the pedestrian's intention was to help, but they were wrong about the situation. Not sure if that affects liability.\n\nOption B mentions the doctrine of transferred intent. I remember from law class that transferred intent is when someone intends to harm one person but ends up harming another. For example, if someone throws a rock at person A but hits person B instead, the intent to harm is transferred to person B. In this case, the boy was pushing his brother playfully, not intending to harm anyone else. The pedestrian got injured accidentally when the boy stumbled and fell into him. Does transferred intent apply here? I'm not sure.\n\nOption C says the pedestrian should not prevail because he assumed the risk. Assumption of risk usually applies when someone voluntarily engages in an activity knowing there are risks involved. Like, if someone goes bungee jumping and gets hurt, they assumed the risk by choosing to jump. In this scenario, the pedestrian intervened thinking there was a fight. Did he assume the risk of getting injured by intervening? Maybe, but I'm not entirely sure how that works legally.\n\nOption D says the pedestrian should not prevail unless the boy was negligent. Negligence involves failing to act with reasonable care, causing harm to others. The boy was playfully jostling with his brother, and it seems like an accident that he stumbled and fell into the pedestrian. Was he negligent in his play? Maybe if he should have been more careful, but it was with his brother in a non-threatening way. The pedestrian intervened based on a misunderstanding.\n\nI need to think about causation here. The boy's actions led to the pedestrian's injury indirectly. The pedestrian's intervention, based on a mistaken belief, contributed to the injury. So, is the boy liable for the pedestrian's injury?\n\nPerhaps I should consider the concept of foreseeability. Could the boy have foreseen that his playful pushing could lead to someone getting injured? Maybe not directly, since he was pushing his brother, not intending to hurt anyone else. The pedestrian's intervention was unforeseeable.\n\nWait, but if the boy was being reckless in his play, maybe he should have foreseen some risk of injury to others. But in this case, it was with his younger brother, and it was playful, so maybe not.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Is there any doctrine that might hold the boy liable even if he didn't intend to harm the pedestrian? Maybe strict liability, but I don't think that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pedestrian's actions broke the chain of causation. The boy was pushing his brother, the pedestrian intervened based on a mistake, and that led to the injury. So, maybe the pedestrian's own actions were the direct cause of the injury, not the boy's play.\n\nBut, the boy's actions were still a contributing factor. It's complicated.\n\nI think I need to look into case law or legal principles that deal with intervening causes and whether they sever the defendant's liability.\n\nI recall something about superseding causes. If an unforeseeable independent act intervenes and causes the injury, the original actor may not be liable. Here, the pedestrian's intervention was based on a mistake, which might be considered an independent act that the boy couldn't have foreseen.\n\nOn the other hand, the boy's play might be seen as creating a risk that led to the pedestrian's injury, even indirectly.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should consider the elements of negligence. To establish negligence, the pedestrian would need to show that the boy owed him a duty of care, breached that duty, and that the breach caused his injury.\n\nDid the boy owe the pedestrian a duty of care? Generally, yes, we all have a duty to act reasonably and not cause harm to others.\n\nDid the boy breach that duty? His play was with his brother and didn't directly involve the pedestrian. Was it unreasonable for him to play like that in a public place?\n\nMaybe it depends on the context. If they were playing in a way that could foreseeably harm others, then yes, it was negligent. But if it was harmless play, then maybe not.\n\nI need more information about the setting. Were they playing in a park, on a sidewalk, near traffic? The scenario doesn't specify.\n\nAssuming it was a public place, like a sidewalk, and they were just playfully jostling, I don't know if that's negligent. Brothers play like that all the time without intending to harm others.\n\nThen, the pedestrian intervened based on a mistaken belief. Was that reasonable? He thought they were fighting, but it was just play. So, his intervention was based on a mistake.\n\nDoes that make his actions contributory negligence? Contributory negligence is when the plaintiff's own negligence contributes to their injury.\n\nIf the pedestrian's mistaken intervention contributed to his injury, maybe that reduces or eliminates the boy's liability.\n\nWait, but in many jurisdictions, contributory negligence isn't a complete bar to recovery; it just reduces the damages.\n\nBut I need to choose between prevailing or not prevailing, not the degree of damages.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me see if there's a principle that directly applies.\n\nI think about the case of Collins v. Rochelle (1981), where a person intervened in what they thought was a fight but was actually a staged fight, and got injured. The court held that the intervenor assumed the risk of injury by choosing to intervene in what appeared to be a fight.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. In this scenario, it was playful jostling, not a fight, staged or otherwise.\n\nAnother relevant concept is the \"Good Samaritan\" defense. Sometimes, people who try to help in emergencies are protected from liability unless they act recklessly or with gross negligence.\n\nBut I don't know if that applies here, or if it protects the pedestrian or the boy.\n\nLet me consider the boy's actions again. He was playfully jostling with his brother. Was that negligent? Probably not, unless they were doing it in a dangerous manner or in a place where it could cause harm to others.\n\nIf it was just harmless play, then the boy shouldn't be liable for the pedestrian's injury, which was caused by the pedestrian's own intervention.\n\nBut the pedestrian was trying to help, thinking there was a fight. Is there any doctrine that protects intervenors in such situations?\n\nI'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look at it from the perspective of proximate cause.\n\nThe boy's play was a cause in fact of the pedestrian's injury, but was it the proximate cause? Proximate cause requires that the injury was a foreseeable result of the boy's actions.\n\nWas it foreseeable that the boy's playful pushing could lead to a pedestrian intervening and getting injured? Probably not.\n\nTherefore, the pedestrian's injury might be considered an unforeseeable consequence, breaking the chain of proximate cause.\n\nIn that case, the boy shouldn't be liable for the pedestrian's injury.\n\nBut I feel like there's more to it. Maybe the pedestrian's mistake in believing there was a fight is what led to his injury, and that shouldn't be attributed to the boy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the boy should have been more careful in his play to avoid any potential for injury to others, even if it was unintentional.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of \"negligence per se,\" where certain actions are considered negligent by law, but I don't think that applies here.\n\nI need to think differently. Maybe consider the rest of the options.\n\nOption A says the pedestrian should prevail because he reasonably believed the boy was about to injure his brother. But the belief was mistaken; it was playful jostling. So, I don't think that's a strong argument for the pedestrian's side.\n\nOption B, transferred intent, seems like it might not apply here because the boy wasn't intending to harm anyone.\n\nOption C says the pedestrian assumed the risk. Maybe, but I'm not sure how assumption of risk works in this context.\n\nOption D says the pedestrian should not prevail unless the boy was negligent. If I conclude that the boy wasn't negligent in his play, then the pedestrian shouldn't prevail.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards Option D.\n\nBut let me check again. If the boy was not negligent in his play, and the pedestrian's injury was caused by his own intervention based on a mistake, then perhaps the pedestrian shouldn't prevail.\n\nHowever, maybe the pedestrian's mistake doesn't completely absolve the boy of liability, especially if the boy's actions contributed to the situation.\n\nI'm still unsure. Maybe I should consider comparative negligence. If both parties contributed to the injury, their liability is apportioned based on their degree of fault.\n\nBut again, the question is phrased as whether the pedestrian should prevail or not, not about the degree of damages.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the pedestrian's mistake likely contributed significantly to the injury, I'm thinking that the pedestrian should not prevail, unless the boy was negligent.\n\nSince I don't think the boy was negligent in his playful jostling with his brother, then the pedestrian shouldn't prevail.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. not prevail, unless the boy was negligent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
