                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what kind of contract is being created based on Donna's statement to Sarah. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, some background: Sarah has her Primer Series MBE Review books stolen while she was on a break in the law library. She offers a $20 reward to anyone who can identify the person who took her books. Donna sees Terry taking the books but doesn't believe Sarah will actually pay the $20. So, Donna approaches Sarah and says, \"I know who the thief is and I promise to tell you, but I want the $20 in advance.\"\n\nOkay, so the question is, what's the effect of Donna's statement? The options are:\n\nA. Create a unilateral contract.\n\nB. Create a bilateral contract.\n\nC. Create no contract.\n\nD. Create a contract which is defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time.\n\nAlright, let's recall what these terms mean.\n\nA unilateral contract is one where there's only one party making a promise in exchange for an act by another party. Typically, it's a situation where one person makes an offer that can be accepted by performing the specified act. For example, \"I'll pay $100 to anyone who walks ten miles.\" The offer is accepted by walking ten miles.\n\nA bilateral contract, on the other hand, involves an exchange of promises between two parties. Each party is both a promisor and a promisee. For example, \"I promise to pay you $100 if you promise to walk ten miles.\"\n\nNow, in this scenario, Sarah initially makes an offer for a reward: she will pay $20 to anyone who identifies the thief. This sounds like a unilateral contract because she's offering to pay in exchange for the act of identification.\n\nBut then Donna comes along and says she wants the $20 in advance. So, Donna is essentially saying, \"I'll tell you who the thief is, but only if you pay me $20 first.\"\n\nThis seems like Donna is making a counteroffer. She's saying, \"I promise to disclose the identity of the thief if you promise to pay me $20 upfront.\"\n\nSo, in this case, it's an exchange of promises: Donna promises to disclose the identity, and Sarah promises to pay $20 in advance.\n\nWait a minute, but Sarah hasn't actually agreed to pay $20 in advance yet. She initially offered to pay $20 after the identification is made. Donna is proposing to change the terms to payment upfront.\n\nSo, Donna's statement is a counteroffer, proposing a bilateral contract where both sides exchange promises: Donna promises to disclose the identity if Sarah promises to pay $20 in advance.\n\nBut for a bilateral contract to be formed, both parties must agree to the terms. Sarah hasn't explicitly agreed to pay $20 in advance yet.\n\nSo, perhaps at this stage, there's no contract formed yet because Sarah hasn't accepted Donna's counteroffer.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the effect of Donna's statement. It's asking what the effect of Donna's statement is, not what the final outcome is.\n\nSo, Donna says, \"I know the identity of the thief and promise to tell you, but I want the $20 in advance.\"\n\nIs this creating a unilateral contract, a bilateral contract, no contract, or a defeasible contract?\n\nLet me think about this again.\n\nDonna is making a promise to disclose the identity in exchange for $20 paid in advance. This sounds like a bilateral contract because there's an exchange of promises: Donna's promise to disclose versus Sarah's promise to pay upfront.\n\nHowever, for a bilateral contract to be formed, there needs to be an offer and an acceptance. Donna is making an offer to Sarah: \"I'll tell you the identity if you pay me $20 in advance.\" Sarah would need to accept this offer for the bilateral contract to come into existence.\n\nSince the scenario doesn't specify that Sarah accepts Donna's offer, it seems that no contract has been formed yet.\n\nTherefore, the effect of Donna's statement is to create no contract, because Sarah hasn't accepted the terms of paying in advance.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's an implied acceptance or something.\n\nLet me consider option D: create a contract which is defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time.\n\nDefeasible means that the contract can be terminated or avoided under certain conditions. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nMoreover, without Sarah accepting Donna's offer, I don't think a contract is formed at this stage.\n\nSo, my inclination is that the correct answer is C. Create no contract.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose Sarah remains silent after Donna's statement. Does that silence constitute acceptance? Generally, silence is not acceptance in contract law unless there's a prior agreement or conduct that indicates acceptance.\n\nIn this scenario, there's no indication that Sarah has agreed to pay $20 in advance. Therefore, no contract is formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Donna's statement is merely a declaration of her willingness to disclose the information in exchange for payment, but it doesn't amount to a formal offer or acceptance.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Create no contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
