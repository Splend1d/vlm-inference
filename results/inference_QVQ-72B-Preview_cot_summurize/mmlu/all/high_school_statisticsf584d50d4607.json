It's a bit tricky, but if I break it down, I think I can figure it out.\n\nSo, we have an employment agency that places workers, and based on past experience, they know that:\n\n1. 20% of the workers they place will no longer be at their jobs after one year.\n\n2. However, of those who stay after the first year, only 5% leave in the next year.\n\nAlright, so let's consider the timeline here. We have two years: the first year and the second year. Each year, the employer hires 100 workers using this agency.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the first group of 100 workers hired at the start of the first year.\n\n- After one year, 20% of them will have left. So, 20% of 100 is 20 workers who leave.\n\n- That means 80 workers remain after the first year.\n\n- Now, of these 80 workers, only 5% are expected to leave in the next year. So, 5% of 80 is 4 workers who will leave in the second year.\n\n- Therefore, after the second year, from the original 100 hired at the start of the first year, we have 80 - 4 = 76 workers still on the job.\n\nOkay, now let's consider the second group of 100 workers hired at the start of the second year.\n\n- Since they were hired at the start of the second year, they've only been on the job for one year by the end of the second year.\n\n- According to the first point, 20% of them will leave after one year. So, 20% of 100 is 20 workers who leave.\n\n- That means 80 workers remain from this group by the end of the second year.\n\nNow, to find the total number of workers still on the job at the end of the second year, we add the remaining workers from both groups:\n\n- From the first group: 76 workers\n\n- From the second group: 80 workers\n\n- Total: 76 + 80 = 156 workers\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this reasoning to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nFirst, for the first group hired at the start of year one:\n\n- 100 workers\n\n- After one year: 20% leave, so 80 remain.\n\n- In the second year, 5% of these 80 leave, which is 4 workers.\n\n- So, by the end of the second year, 80 - 4 = 76 from the first group.\n\nFor the second group hired at the start of year two:\n\n- 100 workers\n\n- After one year: 20% leave, so 80 remain.\n\n- They've only been on the job for one year by the end of the second year, so no further attrition in the second year for them.\n\n- Wait, is that correct? The second group was hired at the start of the second year, so by the end of the second year, they've been on the job for one year, and 20% leave, leaving 80.\n\nBut let's make sure about the timing. The second group is hired at the start of the second year, and the employer hires 100 more workers. So, throughout the second year, these 100 workers are on the job, and at the end of the second year, 20% have left, leaving 80.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any overlap or additional considerations here, so the total should indeed be 76 + 80 = 156 workers.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 140\n\nB. 144\n\nC. 152\n\nD. 156\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 156.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of retention rates.\n\nFor the first group:\n\n- Retention after one year: 80% (since 20% leave)\n\n- Of those who stay after one year, 95% stay the second year (since 5% leave)\n\n- So, the retention rate for the first group after two years would be:\n\n- 80% * 95% = 0.8 * 0.95 = 0.76, meaning 76% of the original 100 remain, which matches our earlier calculation of 76 workers.\n\nFor the second group:\n\n- They've only been on the job for one year by the end of the second year, so retention is 80% of 100, which is 80 workers.\n\nAgain, total is 76 + 80 = 156.\n\nThis seems consistent, so I'm confident that 156 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{156} \\]"
