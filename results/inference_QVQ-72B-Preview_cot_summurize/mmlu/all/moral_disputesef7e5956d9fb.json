                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand Pogge's view on how affluent citizens are harming the poor. The options are:\n\nA. Imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes.\n\nB. Keeping them below welfare in the state-of-nature.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Pogge is and what his main arguments are regarding global justice and poverty.\n\nThomas Pogge is a philosopher known for his work on global justice, particularly on the responsibilities of affluent countries and citizens in addressing global poverty.\n\nNow, let's break down the options.\n\nOption A: Imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes.\n\nPogge has written about how historical injustices, such as colonialism and imperialism, have contributed to the current global distribution of wealth and poverty. He argues that these historical crimes have created structures and inequalities that continue to affect poor countries and their citizens today. So, in a way, affluent countries and their citizens are imposing the lasting effects of these historical crimes on the poor by not addressing and rectifying these inequalities.\n\nOption B: Keeping them below welfare in the state-of-nature.\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. I think it refers to a hypothetical state of nature, perhaps in the sense of John Rawls' original position, where no one knows their place in society. In such a state, what level of welfare would be considered acceptable? Pogge might argue that affluent citizens are keeping poor people below this acceptable level of welfare by not doing enough to alleviate poverty.\n\nBut I need to make sure I understand what \"welfare in the state-of-nature\" means in this context. Maybe it's about a minimal standard of living that, in an ideal state of nature, people should have, and affluent citizens are preventing poor people from reaching that standard through their actions or inactions.\n\nOption C: Both A and B.\n\nThis would mean that both historical responsibilities and current impacts are at play in Pogge's view.\n\nOption D: None of the above.\n\nThis seems unlikely, given that Pogge is known for arguing that affluent citizens have significant moral responsibilities regarding global poverty.\n\nNow, considering Pogge's work, especially his concept of \"institutional harm,\" where he argues that the global economic order is structured in a way that harms the poor, I think both historical and current factors are involved.\n\nHe often discusses how historical injustices continue to shape current inequalities, which aligns with option A. Additionally, he talks about how the current global order, maintained by affluent countries, keeps poor countries in poverty, which aligns with option B.\n\nHowever, I need to think about which one he emphasizes more or if he considers both equally.\n\nLooking back at his book \"World Poverty and Human Rights,\" Pogge discusses both historical responsibilities and the ongoing structural violence perpetuated by the current global order.\n\nHe argues that affluent countries benefit from a global order that exploits the poor and that their failure to reform this order makes them complicit in harming the poor.\n\nSo, it seems like both aspects are important in his view: the historical roots of inequality and the current maintenance of an unjust system.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Both A and B.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if Pogge focuses more on one than the other.\n\nIn his article \"The Global Order: Affluence-Related Harm to the Global Poor,\" Pogge discusses how the global order causes harm to the poor, primarily through the way intellectual property rights, resource use, and economic policies are structured.\n\nHe also mentions historical injustices but seems to place more emphasis on the current structures and practices that harm the poor.\n\nHowever, he does see historical injustices as contributing to the current situation, so it's not entirely separate.\n\nPerhaps the most accurate is C. Both A and B, but with a heavier emphasis on the current structures and practices.\n\nBut since the question is to choose among the given options, and C includes both A and B, I'll go with C.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to pick just one, I might lean towards B, as Pogge seems to focus more on the current global order and its impacts.\n\nBut I think a comprehensive understanding of his view includes both historical and current factors.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
