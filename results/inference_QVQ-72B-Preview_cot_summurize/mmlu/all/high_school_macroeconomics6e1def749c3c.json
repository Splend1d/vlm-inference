                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what would happen in the long run if taxes are cut in an economy that's already at full employment equilibrium. The options are:\n\nA. Raise real output and raise the price level.\n\nB. Lower real output and raise the price level.\n\nC. Raise real output and lower the price level.\n\nD. Raise the price level.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what full employment equilibrium means. Full employment means that everyone who wants a job has one, so there's no cyclical unemployment. Equilibrium suggests that the economy is in a steady state, where aggregate demand equals aggregate supply.\n\nNow, if taxes are cut, that should increase disposable income for households and possibly increase incentives for businesses to invest, depending on the type of tax cuts. Assuming the tax cuts are for households and businesses, this could lead to increased consumption and investment spending.\n\nBut wait, the economy is already at full employment. That means there's no spare capacity; all resources are being used efficiently. So, if aggregate demand increases due to the tax cuts, what happens to output and prices?\n\nIn the short run, if aggregate demand increases while aggregate supply is relatively fixed, prices tend to rise. But in the long run, the aggregate supply curve is vertical at the full employment level, assuming a classical model.\n\nSo, in the long run, since the economy is already at full employment, any increase in aggregate demand due to tax cuts would likely just lead to higher prices, because the quantity of goods and services produced can't increase beyond the full employment level.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not entirely accurate. If the tax cuts lead to increased investment in capital and technology, that could shift the aggregate supply curve to the right over time, allowing for higher potential output.\n\nBut the question specifies that the economy is already at full employment equilibrium, and it's asking about the long run.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe I should consider the AD-AS model.\n\nIn the short run, if AD increases due to tax cuts, and AS is upward sloping, then output would increase and prices would rise. But in the long run, if the economy is back to full employment, output should return to its potential level, and the only effect would be higher prices.\n\nHowever, some economists argue that tax cuts can lead to increased productivity and potential output in the long run, which could shift the AS curve to the right, allowing for higher output without increasing prices.\n\nBut in the standard classical model, in the long run, the AS curve is vertical at the full employment level, so increases in AD only affect prices, not output.\n\nGiven that, option D seems plausible: raise the price level.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any possibility of output increasing in the long run.\n\nIf tax cuts encourage savings and investment, leading to capital accumulation and technological progress, that could shift the production possibilities frontier outward, increasing potential output.\n\nHowever, this process takes time and is more of a long-term phenomenon. In the immediate long run, the economy might still be constrained by its full employment level.\n\nMoreover, in the classical model, wages and prices are flexible, so any increase in demand would be met with higher prices, not higher output in the long run.\n\nAlternatively, in a Keynesian model, even in the long run, there might be some unemployment, and output could increase without inflationary pressures.\n\nBut the question specifies full employment equilibrium, which aligns more with the classical model's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, in the long run, with the economy already at full employment, a tax cut would likely lead to higher prices but no increase in real output.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: raise the price level.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: raise real output and raise the price level. This seems more like a short-run effect where output can temporarily increase above potential.\n\nOption B: lower real output and raise the price level. Why would output decrease? If the economy is at full employment, and demand increases, output shouldn't decrease; it should stay the same, with prices rising.\n\nOption C: raise real output and lower the price level. This doesn't make sense because increasing demand typically leads to higher prices, not lower.\n\nOption D: raise the price level. This seems the most accurate in the long run, given the economy is already at full employment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
