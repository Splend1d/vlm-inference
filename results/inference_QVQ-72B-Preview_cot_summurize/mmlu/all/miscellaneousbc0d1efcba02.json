                    "text": "So I have this question about Beethoven, the famous composer. It's asking about his only completed opera, and there are four options: A. Faust', B. The Silence', C. Immortal Beloved', and D. Fidelio'. I need to pick the correct title.\n\nFirst off, I know that Beethoven was a prolific composer, but apparently, he only completed one opera. That makes this question pretty straightforward once I figure out the right answer.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Faust': I know that Faust is a famous literary character, often associated with Goethe's play. But I don't recall Beethoven composing an opera based on Faust. I think there might be other compositions related to Faust by different composers, but not Beethoven's opera.\n\nB. The Silence': This title doesn't ring a bell. It sounds like it might be a translation or a less-known work. But since Beethoven is known for his symphonies and piano sonatas, and only one opera, I doubt this is the correct answer.\n\nC. Immortal Beloved': This phrase is often associated with Beethoven's letter to his unknown lover, but I don't think it's the title of his opera. It's more of a personal reference rather than a public work.\n\nD. Fidelio': Now, this sounds familiar. I've heard of \"Fidelio\" in connection with Beethoven. I think it's his only completed opera. Let me double-check that.\n\nI remember that Beethoven worked on several projects throughout his life, including operas, but many of them were left unfinished. \"Fidelio\" stands out as the one he saw through to completion.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another option could be correct.\n\nFaust': No, that's not Beethoven's opera. I think it's more related to works by composers like Charles Gounod.\n\nThe Silence': I can't recall any opera by Beethoven with this title. It might be a mistranslation or a lesser-known piece, but not his main opera.\n\nImmortal Beloved': This is a term of endearment Beethoven used in a letter to his lover, and it's not related to his opera.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that D. Fidelio' is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should check if there are any other operas that Beethoven started but didn't complete. If one of the other titles is a fragmentary work, perhaps it could be considered partially completed, but the question specifies his only completed opera.\n\nUpon a quick search in my memory, I recall that Beethoven did work on other operatic projects, but none of them came to fruition. For example, he considered setting Goethe's \"Faust,\" but it never materialized into a completed work.\n\nSimilarly, \"The Silence'\" doesn't ring any bells as a Beethoven opera, and \"Immortal Beloved'\" is clearly a personal reference, not a musical work.\n\nTherefore, the only opera that Beethoven completed and had performed during his lifetime is \"Fidelio.\"\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about the plot of \"Fidelio.\" It's based on a French play about a wife disguising herself as a man to rescue her husband from prison. It's a theme of love and political intrigue, which was popular at the time.\n\nMoreover, I know that Beethoven revised \"Fidelio\" several times, changing its title initially to \"Leonore,\" but it's now commonly known as \"Fidelio.\"\n\nGiven all this information, I'm certain that D. Fidelio' is the correct answer to the question.\n\nIn conclusion, Beethoven's only completed opera is \"Fidelio.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Fidelio'}} \\]"
