                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I picked up my trash after the picnic in the park.\" So, someone had a picnic in the park and then cleaned up their trash afterward. Hmm, that seems pretty responsible to me. Picking up your own trash shows respect for the environment and for other people who might use the park. It's about not littering, which is generally considered a good thing, right? I don't see anything morally wrong with that.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I kept a lot of comics in my bedroom.\" This one is about keeping comics in one's bedroom. Comics are a form of literature and art, and collecting them is a personal hobby for many people. Keeping them in one's bedroom might be a way to organize them or keep them close for easy access. There doesn't seem to be anything inherently immoral about having comics in your bedroom. It's a personal choice about how to arrange your living space.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Picking up your trash after a picnic in the park \u2013 this is a responsible action that benefits the community and the environment. It's not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Keeping a lot of comics in your bedroom \u2013 this is a personal preference and doesn't harm anyone else. It's also not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the answer in the format of two choices, like A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, based on my analysis, D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the right choice.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, picking up your trash could be seen as a moral action because it considers the greater good and shows civic responsibility. Not picking it up would be the immoral act, as it would create a mess and potential hazards for wildlife and other park-goers. So, picking it up is definitely the right thing to do, morally speaking.\n\nIn Scenario 2, keeping comics in your bedroom is a neutral action. It doesn't affect others unless there's some specific context that isn't provided here. For example, if the comics were being hoarded in a way that created unsanitary conditions or fire hazards, that might be a different story. But the scenario just says \"I kept a lot of comics in my bedroom,\" without any indication of excessive hoarding or negative impacts on others. So, in ordinary circumstances, this shouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are \"Not wrong,\" and the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the way to look at it. Moral standards in the US as of 2020 generally promote environmental responsibility and personal freedom in private spaces, as long as no one is being harmed. So, yeah, neither scenario seems to cross a moral boundary in a negative way.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
