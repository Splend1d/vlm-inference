Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these composers is known for writing around 600 lieder.\n\nFirst off, I should probably start by understanding what a lieder is. Lieder is a German word, and in the context of music, it usually refers to an art song, typically a German art song for voice and piano. So, this question is about which composer wrote around 600 of these songs.\n\nI remember that Schubert was a prolific composer of lieder. In fact, I think he's famous for writing a large number of them. Let me recall, Schubert lived in the early 19th century, during the Romantic era, and was known for his melodies and his settings of poems to music. I think he wrote well over 600 lieder, maybe even close to 700. But I should check that.\n\nBeethoven, option B, is another big name from the same era. He's mostly known for his symphonies, piano sonatas, and chamber music. I don't recall him writing as many lieder as Schubert. Maybe he wrote some, but certainly not in the hundreds.\n\nOption C is Liszt. He was a bit later than Schubert and Beethoven, more towards the mid-19th century. Liszt was known for his piano compositions, especially his piano \u00e9tudes and transcriptions of other composers' works. I do know that he wrote some lieder, but again, not nearly as many as Schubert.\n\nOption D is Mozart. He was from the Classical period, which is earlier than the others listed. Mozart was a child prodigy and wrote a vast amount of music, including operas, symphonies, concertos, and chamber music. While he did write some vocal music, including some lieder, I don't think he wrote anywhere near 600 of them.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Schubert seems to be the most likely answer. Let me just double-check this. I recall that Schubert had a relatively short life\u2014he died when he was only 31\u2014but he was incredibly prolific. He wrote a vast number of works in a short period, and lieder were a significant part of his output.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another composer might have written a similar number of lieder. For example, Brahms is known for writing lieder, but I think his output was around 300, which is less than Schubert's. Wagner is more known for operas. Schumann wrote many lieder, perhaps around 250, but still less than Schubert.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Schubert is the correct answer. He wrote approximately 600 lieder, which is a remarkable achievement and solidifies his reputation as one of the greatest composers of lieder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Schubert}} \\]"
