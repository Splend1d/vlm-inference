                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I saw the squirrel trapped and set it free.\" So, someone sees a squirrel that's trapped and decides to set it free. Now, in general, helping animals in distress is considered a good thing, right? Like, it's seen as compassionate and kind. So, setting a trapped squirrel free would probably be seen as a positive action, not morally wrong.\n\nBut, I should think about it more deeply. Is there any way that setting the squirrel free could be considered wrong? Well, maybe if the squirrel was trapped for a reason, like it was dangerous or something, but that seems unlikely. Squirrels are generally not dangerous to people. Also, if the person who set it free didn't own the squirrel or wasn't authorized to handle it, but again, in the case of wildlife, I think it's acceptable to help them if they're in trouble.\n\nSo, based on that, I think Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I saved the child who was about to fall into a hole.\" This seems straightforward. Saving a child from potential harm is definitely a good deed, right? It's heroic, even. So, this should be \"Not wrong\" as well.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any way this could be considered wrong. Maybe if the child wasn't actually in danger, and the person overreacted, but the scenario says the child was about to fall into a hole, which implies danger. Assuming the person acted appropriately to prevent harm, it's hard to see how this would be morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be \"Not wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be \"D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, the options are labeled as A, B, C, D, but they're written as \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" So, D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which fits my conclusion.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. In Scenario 1, setting a trapped squirrel free is helpful and compassionate. In Scenario 2, saving a child from potential injury is brave and morally praiseworthy. There doesn't seem to be any moral wrongdoing in either case.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
