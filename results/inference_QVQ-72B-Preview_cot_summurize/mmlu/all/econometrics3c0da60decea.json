                    "text": "So I have this AR(2) process: yt = 1.5 yt-1 - 0.5 yt-2 + ut. And I need to figure out what kind of process this is from the options given: stationary, unit root, explosive, or a combination of stationary and unit root.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an AR(2) process is. AR stands for autoregressive, and the 2 means it depends on two past lags. The general form is yt = \u03c61 yt-1 + \u03c62 yt-2 + ut, where \u03c61 and \u03c62 are the parameters, and ut is the error term.\n\nIn this case, \u03c61 = 1.5 and \u03c62 = -0.5.\n\nNow, to determine the nature of this process, I should check the characteristic equation's roots. The characteristic equation for an AR(2) process is: \u03bb\u00b2 - \u03c61 \u03bb - \u03c62 = 0.\n\nPlugging in the values: \u03bb\u00b2 - 1.5 \u03bb - 0.5 = 0.\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation for \u03bb. Let's use the quadratic formula:\n\n\u03bb = [1.5 \u00b1 \u221a(1.5\u00b2 - 4*1*(-0.5))]/(2*1)\n\nCalculate the discriminant: 1.5\u00b2 = 2.25, 4*1*(-0.5) = -2, so 2.25 - (-2) = 2.25 + 2 = 4.25.\n\nSquare root of 4.25 is approximately 2.061678.\n\nSo, \u03bb1 = [1.5 + 2.061678]/2 \u2248 1.780839\n\nAnd \u03bb2 = [1.5 - 2.061678]/2 \u2248 -0.280839\n\nNow, for the process to be stationary, the modulus of both roots should be greater than 1. That is, |\u03bb1| > 1 and |\u03bb2| > 1.\n\nLooking at \u03bb1 \u2248 1.780839, which is greater than 1, and \u03bb2 \u2248 -0.280839, which is less than 1 in magnitude (since 0.280839 < 1).\n\nSo, one root is outside the unit circle, and one is inside. Does this mean it's stationary or non-stationary?\n\nWait, I think I need to be careful here. The condition for stationarity in an AR(p) process is that all roots of the characteristic equation lie outside the unit circle. That means |\u03bb1| > 1 and |\u03bb2| > 1.\n\nIn this case, |\u03bb1| \u2248 1.78 > 1 and |\u03bb2| \u2248 0.28 < 1. So, one root is outside and one is inside the unit circle. Does this make the process stationary or non-stationary?\n\nI recall that if all roots are outside the unit circle, the process is stationary. Since one root is inside, the process is non-stationary.\n\nBut wait, I also remember something about processes being explosive if the roots are outside the unit circle, and stationary if they are inside.\n\nLet me double-check this.\n\nIn time series analysis, for an AR(p) process, the process is stationary if all roots of the characteristic equation lie outside the unit circle. If any root lies inside the unit circle, the process is non-stationary.\n\nSo, in this case, since one root is inside the unit circle, the process is non-stationary.\n\nBut option A says it's a stationary process, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption B is a unit root process. A unit root process typically refers to a process that has a root equal to 1 in the characteristic equation. Does this process have a root equal to 1?\n\nLooking at \u03bb1 \u2248 1.78 and \u03bb2 \u2248 -0.28, neither seems to be equal to 1. So, it's not a unit root process.\n\nOption C is an explosive process. I think explosive processes are those where the roots are outside the unit circle, leading to growing oscillations over time. Since both roots are outside the unit circle in such processes, and in this case, one root is inside, I'm not sure if it qualifies as explosive.\n\nOption D says stationary and unit root process, which seems contradictory because a stationary process doesn't have a unit root.\n\nGiven this, neither option seems to perfectly fit the description of the process. But perhaps I need to consider which option is closest.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. If one root is outside and one is inside the unit circle, does that make it a combination of stationary and non-stationary components?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mixture of both, but in practice, having any root inside the unit circle makes the entire process non-stationary.\n\nLet me consider the long-run behavior. If the process has a root inside the unit circle, it will have a component that doesn't die out over time, making it non-stationary.\n\nTherefore, it can't be a stationary process, so option A is incorrect.\n\nIt doesn't have a unit root, so option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C is explosive process. Typically, explosive processes have roots outside the unit circle, meaning they grow over time without bound. In this case, since one root is inside, it might not be purely explosive.\n\nOption D combines stationary and unit root, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, none of the options seem to perfectly describe the process. However, since it's not stationary and doesn't have a unit root, perhaps the closest description is an explosive process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considered a unit root process if it has at least one unit root, but in this case, there are no roots equal to one.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up the definition of an explosive process more carefully.\n\nAn explosive process is one where the absolute value of the roots is greater than one, leading to increasing amplitudes over time. In this case, since one root is greater than one in magnitude and one is less, it might exhibit explosive behavior due to the root outside the unit circle.\n\nGiven that, option C, explosive process, might be the best choice.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because of the presence of a root inside the unit circle. Maybe it's a mixture of both explosive and stable components, but in practice, the explosive component would dominate the behavior over time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps such a process is considered explosive because of the root outside the unit circle, even if there's another root inside.\n\nGiven the confusion, maybe I should consider the properties of the AR(2) process more carefully.\n\nThe characteristic equation is \u03bb\u00b2 - \u03c61 \u03bb - \u03c62 = 0, with \u03c61 = 1.5 and \u03c62 = -0.5.\n\nWait, actually, for an AR(2), the characteristic equation should be written as \u03c6(B) = 1 - \u03c61 B - \u03c62 B\u00b2 = 0, where B is the backshift operator.\n\nBut in the standard form, it's often written as \u03bb\u00b2 - \u03c61 \u03bb - \u03c62 = 0.\n\nSolving this, as I did earlier, gives \u03bb1 \u2248 1.78 and \u03bb2 \u2248 -0.28.\n\nNow, for stationarity, all roots must satisfy |\u03bb| > 1.\n\nHere, one root is greater than 1 and one is less than 1, so the process is non-stationary.\n\nIn such cases, the process may exhibit explosive behavior due to the root outside the unit circle.\n\nGiven the options, option C, explosive process, seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nOption B, unit root process, would require at least one root to be exactly equal to 1, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption A, stationary process, is incorrect because of the root inside the unit circle.\n\nOption D combines stationary and unit root, which again doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Explosive process.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
