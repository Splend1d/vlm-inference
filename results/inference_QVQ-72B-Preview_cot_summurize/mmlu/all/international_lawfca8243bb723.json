Let's see, the question is asking about the meaning of international legal personality, and there are four options provided. I need to pick the correct one.\n\nOption A says that only States are considered subjects of international law. Hmm, that seems familiar, but I think things have changed over time. In the past, maybe only states were subjects, but nowadays, there are other entities like international organizations that also have some rights and duties under international law. So, maybe this isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption B says that it means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor. This sounds plausible. If something has international legal personality, it should have certain rights and obligations under international law, and it should be able to enforce them or have them enforced against it. That makes sense.\n\nOption C says that it means an entity may challenge the authority of States. Well, that seems a bit strong. I don't think having international legal personality allows an entity to challenge the authority of States. States are still the primary subjects of international law, and their authority is generally respected. Maybe this is a bit of an overstatement.\n\nOption D says that it is a term meant to denote legal, as opposed to physical persons, under international law. Okay, so this is suggesting that international legal personality refers to entities that are considered legal persons under international law, distinct from physical persons like individuals. While this might be part of the concept, it seems a bit too narrow. International legal personality encompasses more than just being a legal person; it involves having specific rights and obligations under international law.\n\nLet me think about this again. International legal personality is about being a subject of international law, right? Traditionally, only states were considered subjects, but over time, international organizations, and in some cases, other entities like individuals or corporations have gained some aspects of international legal personality.\n\nBut in the context of this question, option B seems to capture the essence of international legal personality. It's about having rights and duties under international law and the capacity to enforce them. That aligns with what I understand about the concept.\n\nOption A is too restrictive because it excludes non-state actors who now commonly have international legal personality in certain contexts. Option C seems misleading because having international legal personality doesn't give an entity the right to challenge state authority; rather, it allows them to have certain legal standings and responsibilities.\n\nOption D is somewhat correct but doesn't fully capture the significance of international legal personality. It's more about the nature of the entity rather than the implications of having international legal personality.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is Option B: It means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. International legal personality grants an entity the status to be a subject of international law, which includes having legal rights and obligations, and the ability to engage in legal relations with other subjects of international law. Yes, that matches with what option B is saying.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
