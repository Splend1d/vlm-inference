                    "text": "So I've got this case about a 17-year-old girl who hasn't had her period in six months. Her mom's worried, but the girl herself isn't too concerned. She started having periods when she was 12, and they were regular every 28 days until about a year ago when they started to become irregular. Now, she's on the high school gymnastics team and she looks really thin\u2014like, emaciated. Her height is 163 cm (that's about 5 feet 4 inches) and she weighs 40 kg (88 pounds), which gives her a BMI of 15 kg/m\u00b2. Her pulse is quite slow at 54 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is low at 80/50 mm Hg.\n\nOkay, so the question is asking for the most likely cause of her amenorrhea. Amenorrhea means no menstrual periods, and in this case, it's secondary amenorrhea because she's had periods before but now they've stopped for six months.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the normal menstrual cycle and what could be causing it to stop. The menstrual cycle is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries. So, anything that disrupts this balance could lead to amenorrhea.\n\nLet's look at her history. She's been athletic, part of a gymnastics team, and she's emaciated, which suggests she might be underweight. Her BMI is 15, which is significantly below the healthy range. Being underweight can affect hormone levels, particularly estrogen, which is important for menstruation.\n\nHer periods started at 12, which is normal, and were regular until about a year ago. So, something happened around that time that could be related. Maybe she started intense training for gymnastics around then, which can lead to changes in body composition and hormone levels.\n\nNow, let's consider the options given:\n\nA. Hyperthyroidism: This is when the thyroid gland is overactive and produces too much thyroid hormone. Symptoms can include weight loss, increased appetite, nervousness, tremors, and sometimes irregular periods. But in hyperthyroidism, you might expect a faster pulse rate, not a slower one. Her pulse is 54/min, which is bradycardic (slow), and blood pressure is low. Hyperthyroidism typically causes tachycardia (fast heart rate) and hypertension. So, this doesn't seem to fit well.\n\nB. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: This sounds complicated, but it's a condition where the pituitary gland doesn't produce enough gonadotropin hormones (LH and FSH), which are necessary to stimulate the ovaries to produce estrogen and ovulate. This can lead to amenorrhea. Causes can include nutritional deficiencies, extreme weight loss, or intense physical training, which all fit with her situation as a gymnast who is emaciated.\n\nC. Hypothyroidism: This is the opposite of hyperthyroidism; the thyroid gland is underactive and produces too little thyroid hormone. Symptoms can include weight gain, fatigue, cold intolerance, and sometimes amenorrhea or heavy periods. But again, her weight is actually very low, not high. Hypothyroidism is more commonly associated with weight gain, not loss. Also, hypothyroidism would be expected to cause bradycardia and low blood pressure, which matches her symptoms, but the weight loss doesn't align well.\n\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS): This is a common endocrine disorder in women, characterized by high levels of androgens (male hormones), cysts on the ovaries, and often insulin resistance. Symptoms can include irregular periods, weight gain, acne, and hirsutism (excessive hair growth). But in this case, the patient is emaciated and doesn't seem to have signs of excessive hair growth or acne. So, this doesn't seem to fit her presentation.\n\nGiven her history of being an athlete, her significant weight loss, and her emaciated appearance, it seems most likely that her amenorrhea is due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism caused by her low body weight and possibly the stress of intense physical training.\n\nI should also consider other possible causes of amenorrhea, like pregnancy, but given her age and the fact that she's emaciated, that seems unlikely unless there are other factors involved. Also, conditions like pituitary tumors or adrenal gland disorders could cause amenorrhea, but there's no indication of those in her history.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, option B. hypogonadotropic hypogonadism seems to be the most likely cause of her amenorrhea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
