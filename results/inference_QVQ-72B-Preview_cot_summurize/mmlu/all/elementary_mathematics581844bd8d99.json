                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"Which ratio can form a proportion with 6 over 9?\" And the options are A. 8 over 12, B. 9 over 6, C. 2 over 6, and D. 24 over 27. Okay, I need to find which of these ratios is proportional to 6/9.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a proportion is. A proportion is when two ratios are equal. So, if I have two fractions that are equal, like a/b = c/d, then they are in proportion.\n\nSo, I need to find which of the given ratios equals 6/9.\n\nLet me first simplify 6/9 to make it easier to compare. Both 6 and 9 can be divided by 3, so 6 \u00f7 3 = 2 and 9 \u00f7 3 = 3, so 6/9 simplifies to 2/3. So, the ratio I'm looking for is 2/3.\n\nNow, I'll check each option:\n\nA. 8 over 12: That's 8/12. Let's see if that simplifies to 2/3. Both 8 and 12 can be divided by 4. 8 \u00f7 4 = 2 and 12 \u00f7 4 = 3, so 8/12 simplifies to 2/3. So, this matches.\n\nB. 9 over 6: That's 9/6. Both 9 and 6 can be divided by 3. 9 \u00f7 3 = 3 and 6 \u00f7 3 = 2, so 9/6 simplifies to 3/2. That's not equal to 2/3. So, this doesn't match.\n\nC. 2 over 6: That's 2/6. Both 2 and 6 can be divided by 2. 2 \u00f7 2 = 1 and 6 \u00f7 2 = 3, so 2/6 simplifies to 1/3. That's not equal to 2/3. So, this doesn't match.\n\nD. 24 over 27: That's 24/27. Both 24 and 27 can be divided by 3. 24 \u00f7 3 = 8 and 27 \u00f7 3 = 9, so 24/27 simplifies to 8/9. That's not equal to 2/3. So, this doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute, when I simplified 24/27, I got 8/9, but maybe there's another way to check if it's proportional to 2/3. Maybe I can cross-multiply to see if the proportions are equal.\n\nSo, for 24/27 and 2/3, cross-multiplying means: 24 * 3 should equal 2 * 27.\n\nCalculating: 24 * 3 = 72 and 2 * 27 = 54. Since 72 \u2260 54, they are not proportional. So, option D is out.\n\nSimilarly, for option A, 8/12 and 2/3, cross-multiplying: 8 * 3 should equal 2 * 12.\n\nCalculating: 8 * 3 = 24 and 2 * 12 = 24. Since 24 = 24, they are proportional. Which matches what I found earlier when simplifying both.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option A: 8 over 12.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps checking if the ratios are equivalent by scaling.\n\nStarting with 6/9, simplified to 2/3.\n\nFor option A: 8/12. To see if this is equivalent to 2/3, I can check if multiplying the numerator and denominator of 2/3 by the same number gives me 8/12.\n\nSo, 2 * 4 = 8 and 3 * 4 = 12. Yes, 2/3 = 8/12.\n\nFor option B: 9/6. Similarly, 2 * 4.5 = 9 and 3 * 4.5 = 13.5, which isn't 6, so not equal.\n\nFor option C: 2/6. 2/3 is not equal to 1/3.\n\nFor option D: 24/27. 2 * 12 = 24 and 3 * 12 = 36, which isn't 27, so not equal.\n\nTherefore, again, only option A is proportional to 6/9.\n\nI think that's solid. But maybe I should consider if any of these ratios could be equivalent in a different context, like units or something, but the problem seems to be strictly about numerical proportions.\n\nSo, final answer is option A: 8 over 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
