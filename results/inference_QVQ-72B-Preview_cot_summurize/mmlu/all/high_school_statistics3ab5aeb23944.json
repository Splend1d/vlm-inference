                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about resistors and their resistances. It says that the average resistance is 200 ohms with a standard deviation of 5 ohms, and the resistances are normally distributed. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance under 194 ohms, given that it's greater than 188 ohms. Wait, no, actually, the question says \"under 194 ohms\" but then asks for the probability that its resistance is greater than 188 ohms. Hmm, I think there might be some confusion in how the question is phrased.\n\nLet me read it again carefully: \"Suppose a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance under 194 ohms. What is the probability that its resistance is greater than 188 ohms?\" Oh, I see. So, it's conditional probability. We're supposed to find the probability that the resistance is greater than 188 ohms, given that it's under 194 ohms.\n\nAlright, so this is a conditional probability problem. I need to find P(resistance > 188 ohms | resistance < 194 ohms). Okay, that makes sense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the normal distribution here. The resistances are normally distributed with a mean (\u03bc) of 200 ohms and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 5 ohms.\n\nTo solve this, I should probably standardize the values to z-scores to use the standard normal distribution table or functions in software.\n\nSo, for resistance under 194 ohms, I need to find P(X < 194). Similarly, for resistance greater than 188 ohms, I need P(X > 188).\n\nBut since it's conditional probability, I need P(X > 188 | X < 194).\n\nI recall that conditional probability is defined as:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nSo in this case, A is X > 188 and B is X < 194.\n\nTherefore, P(X > 188 | X < 194) = P(188 < X < 194) / P(X < 194)\n\nBecause P(A and B) is the same as P(188 < X < 194), since A and B overlapping is X being greater than 188 and less than 194.\n\nSo, I need to find P(188 < X < 194) divided by P(X < 194).\n\nNow, to find these probabilities, I need to standardize X to Z-scores.\n\nFirst, find P(X < 194):\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = (194 - 200)/5 = (-6)/5 = -1.2\n\nSo, P(X < 194) = P(Z < -1.2)\n\nSimilarly, P(X > 188):\n\nZ = (188 - 200)/5 = (-12)/5 = -2.4\n\nSo, P(X > 188) = 1 - P(Z < -2.4)\n\nAnd P(188 < X < 194) = P(X < 194) - P(X < 188) = P(Z < -1.2) - P(Z < -2.4)\n\nNow, I need to find the values of P(Z < -1.2) and P(Z < -2.4).\n\nUsing standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, I can find these values.\n\nAlternatively, since the normal distribution is symmetric, P(Z < -a) = P(Z > a)\n\nSo, P(Z < -1.2) = P(Z > 1.2)\n\nAnd P(Z < -2.4) = P(Z > 2.4)\n\nI can look up the values in the standard normal table or use a function in software to find these probabilities.\n\nLet me try to find these values.\n\nFirst, P(Z < -1.2):\n\nThis is equal to 1 - P(Z < 1.2)\n\nFrom a standard normal table, P(Z < 1.2) \u2248 0.8849\n\nTherefore, P(Z < -1.2) = 1 - 0.8849 = 0.1151\n\nSimilarly, P(Z < -2.4) = 1 - P(Z < 2.4)\n\nP(Z < 2.4) \u2248 0.9918\n\nTherefore, P(Z < -2.4) = 1 - 0.9918 = 0.0082\n\nNow, P(188 < X < 194) = P(Z < -1.2) - P(Z < -2.4) = 0.1151 - 0.0082 = 0.1069\n\nAnd P(X < 194) = P(Z < -1.2) = 0.1151\n\nTherefore, P(X > 188 | X < 194) = P(188 < X < 194) / P(X < 194) = 0.1069 / 0.1151 \u2248 0.9287\n\nSo, approximately 0.9287, which is about 0.93.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.07\n\nB. 0.12\n\nC. 0.50\n\nD. 0.93\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 0.93.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, standardizing X=194:\n\nZ = (194 - 200)/5 = -6/5 = -1.2\n\nP(X < 194) = P(Z < -1.2)\n\nSimilarly, X=188:\n\nZ = (188 - 200)/5 = -12/5 = -2.4\n\nP(X > 188) = 1 - P(Z < -2.4)\n\nP(188 < X < 194) = P(X < 194) - P(X < 188) = P(Z < -1.2) - P(Z < -2.4)\n\nFrom standard normal tables:\n\nP(Z < -1.2) = 1 - P(Z < 1.2) = 1 - 0.8849 = 0.1151\n\nP(Z < -2.4) = 1 - P(Z < 2.4) = 1 - 0.9918 = 0.0082\n\nTherefore, P(188 < X < 194) = 0.1151 - 0.0082 = 0.1069\n\nAnd P(X < 194) = 0.1151\n\nSo, P(X > 188 | X < 194) = 0.1069 / 0.1151 \u2248 0.9287, which rounds to 0.93.\n\nYes, I think the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
