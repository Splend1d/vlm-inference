                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about auditing and statistical sampling. It's about the tolerable rate of deviations in a test of controls. Let me see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says that deviations from pertinent controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. If controls are deviated from, that usually means there's a higher risk that errors or frauds could occur, which could lead to material misstatements. So, I think this is incorrect.\n\nOption B says that deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate. Wait, is that always the case? I think it depends on the nature of the deviations and how they relate to misstatements. Sometimes, a single deviation could lead to a significant misstatement, so I'm not sure about this one. Maybe it's not always true.\n\nOption C says that when the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high, the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk. Okay, so if you want high assurance, you'd typically want lower sampling risk, right? Because if you allow for high sampling risk, you might not be as confident in your conclusions. So, this seems counterintuitive. Maybe this is incorrect.\n\nOption D says that increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations. Let me think about this. Tolerable rate is kind of like the maximum deviation rate the auditor is willing to accept. If you test more items, might you allow for a higher tolerable rate? I'm not entirely sure about this one either.\n\nLet me try to recall what tolerable rate of deviations is in the context of audit sampling. Tolerable rate is the highest deviation rate that the auditor is willing to accept and still rely on the control. It's like a threshold. The auditor sets this rate based on various factors, including the acceptable risk of material misstatement.\n\nNow, considering that, let's look back at the options.\n\nOption A suggests that deviations don't affect the risk of material misstatement. But that's not true; deviations from controls can increase the risk of material misstatement. So, this is likely incorrect.\n\nOption B says that deviations at a given rate result in misstatements at a lower rate. Well, the relationship between deviations and misstatements isn't necessarily direct or proportional. It depends on the specific controls and how deviations can lead to misstatements. So, this seems too general and may not be always true.\n\nOption C says that for high assurance, you should allow for high sampling risk. But actually, if you want higher assurance, you should allow for lower sampling risk because you need to be more confident in your sample results. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says that increasing the sample size increases the tolerable rate of deviations. Wait, I thought that with a larger sample size, you might be able to detect smaller deviation rates, so perhaps you could set a lower tolerable rate. But the option says it increases the tolerable rate, which seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to consider the relationship between sample size and tolerable rate. In attribute sampling, which is commonly used for tests of controls, the sample size is inversely proportional to the tolerable rate. That is, if you set a higher tolerable rate, you can have a smaller sample size, and vice versa. So, if you increase the sample size, you can set a lower tolerable rate, not higher. Therefore, option D seems incorrect.\n\nSo, based on this, none of the options seem correct. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider the concept again.\n\nIn audit sampling for tests of controls, the auditor is trying to estimate the population deviation rate based on the sample deviation rate. The tolerable rate is set based on how much deviation the auditor can accept and still consider the control effective.\n\nNow, considering that, perhaps the correct answer is none of the above. But since it's a multiple-choice question, there must be one correct option.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at it from a different perspective. Perhaps the question is testing understanding of sampling risk and how it relates to tolerable rate.\n\nSampling risk is the risk that the auditor's conclusion is different from what it would be if the entire population were examined. In tests of controls, sampling risk affects the auditor's assessment of the control's effectiveness.\n\nSo, if the auditor allows for a higher sampling risk, they might set a higher tolerable rate because they're willing to accept a wider confidence interval around the sample deviation rate.\n\nWait, that might be it. If you allow for higher sampling risk, you might set a higher tolerable rate because you're willing to accept a less precise estimate of the population deviation rate.\n\nSimilarly, if you want higher assurance, you'd set lower sampling risk, which would lead to a lower tolerable rate.\n\nSo, option C says that when the degree of assurance desired is high, the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk. But based on what I just thought, that seems incorrect. Higher assurance should correspond to lower sampling risk.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says that increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations. But actually, increasing the sample size allows for a more precise estimate, so you might set a lower tolerable rate. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption A is clearly incorrect because deviations do affect the risk of material misstatement.\n\nOption B suggests that deviations at a given rate result in misstatements at a lower rate. But this seems too broad and not necessarily true in all cases. The relationship between deviations and misstatements can vary based on the specific control and the nature of the deviation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that in some cases, multiple deviations might be needed to lead to a misstatement, so the misstatement rate might be lower than the deviation rate. For example, if two controls need to fail simultaneously to cause a misstatement, then the misstatement rate would be lower than the deviation rate for each control.\n\nSo, in that case, option B could be correct. Deviations at a certain rate could lead to misstatements at a lower rate because multiple deviations might be required to cause a misstatement.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, option B seems plausible.\n\nLet me check again. If deviations from controls occur at a certain rate, and each deviation has a certain probability of leading to a misstatement, then the overall misstatement rate might indeed be lower than the deviation rate, especially if multiple deviations are required to cause a misstatement.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose a company has a control that requires two people to approve expenses above $1,000. If one person fails to review the expense (a deviation), but the other person reviews it correctly, there might not be a misstatement. Only if both fail to review would there be a misstatement. So, even if deviations occur at a certain rate, misstatements might occur at a lower rate because not all deviations lead to misstatements.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
