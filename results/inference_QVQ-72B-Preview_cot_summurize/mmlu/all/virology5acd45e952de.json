                    "text": "So I have this question about the basic code of ethical research, and it's asking which one first established the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The options are the Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, CIOMS, or the Belmont Report. I need to figure out which one of these introduced these three specific ethical principles.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these is. Starting with the Nuremberg Code, I recall that it was developed after World War II in response to the horrific medical experiments conducted by the Nazis. It's mainly about informed consent and the voluntary participation of human subjects in research. So, while it touches on respect for persons through informed consent, I don't think it explicitly covers beneficence and justice in the same way that the question is referring to.\n\nNext, the Declaration of Helsinki. I believe this is a set of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, adopted by the World Medical Association. It has been revised several times and expands on the Nuremberg Code. It emphasizes informed consent, the well-being of the patient, and the importance of balancing research objectives with the rights and welfare of participants. It seems to cover respect for persons and beneficence, but I'm not sure if it explicitly uses the term \"justice\" in the same way the Belmont Report does.\n\nThen there's CIOMS, which I think stands for the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. It works in collaboration with the World Health Organization to develop guidelines on research ethics. Their guidelines likely build upon the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, but again, I don't recall if they were the first to articulate the principles of respect, beneficence, and justice.\n\nFinally, the Belmont Report. This rings a bell because it's often mentioned in research ethics classes. It was produced in the United States by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in the 1970s, following the revelation of ethical abuses in studies like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. The Belmont Report outlines three fundamental ethical principles for the treatment of human subjects in research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. These principles have become the cornerstone of ethical research regulations in the U.S. and have influenced international standards.\n\nSo, based on this recall, it seems like the Belmont Report was the first to explicitly define these three principles. But just to be sure, let me double-check.\n\nThe Nuremberg Code was established in 1947, focusing on informed consent and voluntary participation. The Declaration of Helsinki was first adopted in 1964 and has been revised multiple times, expanding on the Nuremberg Code but not specifically using the terms beneficence and justice as the Belmont Report does.\n\nCIOMS guidelines, which began in the 1980s, likely built upon the previous frameworks but again, don't seem to be the originators of these principles.\n\nThe Belmont Report, published in 1979, clearly lays out the three principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, which align perfectly with the question's mention.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be the Belmont Report.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the basic code of ethical research (respect for persons, beneficence, and justice) was first established by the...\" and gives options A. Nuremberg Code, B. Declaration of Helsinki, C. CIOMS, D. Belmont Report.\n\nGiven that the Belmont Report is the one that specifically outlines these three principles, it should be the answer. However, I should consider if any of the others might have included similar principles earlier.\n\nUpon further thought, I remember that the Declaration of Helsinki does emphasize the welfare of the subject and the importance of balancing risks and benefits, which aligns with beneficence. It also touches on fairness in selecting subjects, which relates to justice. But it doesn't explicitly use the terms beneficence and justice as the Belmont Report does.\n\nSimilarly, the Nuremberg Code focuses primarily on informed consent and voluntary participation, which is related to respect for persons, but again, doesn't explicitly mention beneficence and justice.\n\nCIOMS guidelines, being developed later, likely incorporated these principles but didn't originate them.\n\nTherefore, the Belmont Report is indeed the first to explicitly establish the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in ethical research.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check the timing again. The Belmont Report was in 1979, and the Declaration of Helsinki was revised multiple times, with the first version in 1964. Did any of the early revisions of the Declaration of Helsinki include the exact three principles as stated in the Belmont Report?\n\nI think not, as the Belmont Report was a direct response to ethical issues in research in the U.S. and was intended to provide clear ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects, particularly in the context of protecting vulnerable populations.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is the Belmont Report.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Belmont Report}} \\]"
