Sender\u2019s Public key\n\nC. Receiver\u2019s Private key\n\nD. Receiver\u2019s Public key\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step. I remember that in digital signature schemes, like RSA or ECDSA, the signature is created using the sender's private key. But what about verifying it? Let's recall the basic principles.\n\nIn public key cryptography, each entity has a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The private key is supposed to be kept secret, while the public key can be freely distributed.\n\nWhen someone wants to send a signed message, they use their own private key to sign it. Then, anyone who has the sender's public key can verify the signature to ensure that it was indeed signed by the sender and that the message hasn't been tampered with during transmission.\n\nSo, in this context, to verify a digital signature, you would need the sender's public key. That makes sense because the signature was created with the sender's private key, and the public key is mathematically related to the private key, allowing anyone to verify the signature without needing to know the private key.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose I receive a message with a digital signature, and I want to verify that signature. What do I need?\n\n1. The signature itself.\n\n2. The original message.\n\n3. The sender's public key.\n\nWith these three pieces, I can run the verification algorithm. If the verification succeeds, it means that the signature matches the message and was signed with the corresponding private key.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the sender's public key is not available or is compromised? In that case, the verification would fail, but assuming everything is set up correctly, the sender's public key is what's needed for verification.\n\nLet me also think about the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A is the sender's private key. If I had the sender's private key, I could sign messages on their behalf, but for verification, typically, the public key is used. Plus, the private key is supposed to be secret, so it shouldn't be used for verification by others.\n\nOption C is the receiver's private key. Why would I need the receiver's private key to verify a signature? The receiver's private key is used for decrypting messages intended for them, not for verifying signatures created by someone else.\n\nOption D is the receiver's public key. Similar to the previous point, the receiver's public key is used for encrypting messages intended for them, not for verifying signatures.\n\nTherefore, by elimination, option B, the sender's public key, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the process in more detail. Take RSA signatures, for example. To sign a message, the sender computes the hash of the message and then encrypts the hash with their private key to create the signature. To verify, the receiver decrypts the signature using the sender's public key to recover the hash and then compares it with the hash of the received message. If they match, the signature is valid.\n\nThis seems to confirm that the sender's public key is indeed used for verification.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about the properties of public-key cryptography. The private key is used for signing (and decryption in some cases), while the public key is used for verification (and encryption). So, in the context of digital signatures, the public key is used for verification.\n\nI should also consider elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA), which work similarly. The signature is created with the private key and verified with the public key.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific algorithm used, the general principle remains that the sender's public key is used to verify their digital signature.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about a real-world scenario. Suppose Alice wants to send a signed email to Bob. She signs the email with her private key. When Bob receives the email, he uses Alice's public key to verify the signature. If everything checks out, he can be confident that the email is from Alice and hasn't been altered.\n\nThis reinforces the idea that the sender's public key is necessary for verification.\n\nIs there any case where another key might be involved in the verification process? Well, in some advanced cryptographic protocols, there might be additional steps or keys involved, but in the context of standard digital signatures, it's the sender's public key that's used.\n\nAnother thing to consider is key certification. Sometimes, you need to ensure that you have the correct public key for the sender, which might involve a certificate authority or another method to verify the key's authenticity. But again, that's more about ensuring you have the right public key for verification, not about using a different key for the verification process itself.\n\nIn summary, based on the principles of public key cryptography and digital signatures, the sender's public key is used to verify a digital signature. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Sender\u2019s Public key.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
