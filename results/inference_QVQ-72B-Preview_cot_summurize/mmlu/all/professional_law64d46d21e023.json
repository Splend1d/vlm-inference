The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: \"2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery.\" The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?\n\nA. No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.\nB. No, because the agreement was completely integrated.\nC. Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.\nD. Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this contract dispute between a ceramics studio and an artist. The studio was hired to produce cups and saucers designed by the artist. The contract says \"2,000 sets of cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery.\" Now, the studio delivered the goods and sent a bill for $20,000, which they calculated as 4,000 pieces at $5 each. But the artist only wants to pay $10,000, thinking \"each\" refers to each set, not each piece.\n\nAt trial, the studio wants to introduce evidence that in the ceramics industry, it's common practice to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece basis, not per set. The question is whether this evidence is admissible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the contract terms. The contract says \"2,000 sets of cups and saucers at $5 each.\" The key here is what \"each\" refers to. Does \"each\" mean each set or each piece?\n\nThe studio is arguing that \"each\" refers to each piece, so 4,000 pieces at $5 each equals $20,000. The artist thinks \"each\" refers to each set, so 2,000 sets at $5 each is $10,000.\n\nNow, there's a merger clause in the contract, which probably means that the written contract is the final and complete agreement between the parties. This means that any prior negotiations or agreements are superseded by the written contract.\n\nGiven that, the studio is trying to introduce evidence of industry practice to interpret the term \"each.\" Is this allowed?\n\nOption A says no, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract. But is the term \"each\" ambiguous? If it's unambiguous, then generally, external evidence isn't allowed to contradict the clear meaning of the contract.\n\nOption B says no, because the agreement was completely integrated. That's related to the merger clause. If the contract is completely integrated, then no outside evidence is allowed to add to or modify the terms of the contract.\n\nOption C says yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible. But that seems too broad. Not all evidence is always admissible; there must be rules governing its admissibility.\n\nOption D says yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract. This suggests that the industry practice can help interpret the meaning of the term \"each\" in the context of the ceramics industry.\n\nI think the key here is whether the term \"each\" is ambiguous. If it's ambiguous, then evidence of trade usage can be introduced to clarify its meaning.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine if \"each\" is ambiguous in this context. \"Each\" could refer to each set or each piece. Without further context, it seems ambiguous.\n\nIn contract interpretation, when a term is ambiguous, courts may look to external evidence to determine the parties' intent. This can include industry customs and practices.\n\nThe merger clause indicates that the written contract is the final expression of the parties' agreement, but it doesn't necessarily preclude the introduction of evidence to interpret ambiguous terms in the contract.\n\nTherefore, if \"each\" is ambiguous, evidence of trade usage can be admitted to give meaning to the term.\n\nSo, between options A and B, which say no, and C and D, which say yes, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think again. Option C says evidence of trade usage is always admissible. Is that true? I don't think so. There must be some limits on when such evidence can be introduced.\n\nOption D specifies that it's being offered to give meaning to the contract, which makes sense. If the term \"each\" is ambiguous, and there's an industry standard that clarifies what \"each\" refers to in this context, then that evidence can help interpret the contract.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that there's a merger clause might make it harder to introduce external evidence, but in cases where the contract terms are ambiguous, courts often allow such evidence to interpret the meaning.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other perspective.\n\nPerhaps the artist could argue that the term \"each\" clearly refers to each set, based on the way the contract is phrased. If that's the case, then the studio's evidence might be seen as an attempt to vary the clear terms of the contract, which wouldn't be allowed due to the merger clause.\n\nHowever, if \"each\" is ambiguous, then the studio can introduce evidence of trade usage to clarify its meaning.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the contract specifies the quantity as \"2,000 sets,\" and the price is \"$5 each.\" If \"each\" refers to each piece, then there are 4,000 pieces (2,000 cups and 2,000 saucers), but the contract refers to \"sets.\" So, does \"each\" apply to the set or to the individual pieces within the set?\n\nThis gets a bit confusing. Perhaps the studio is arguing that in the industry, sets are priced per piece, meaning that within a set, each piece is priced separately.\n\nIn that case, the total would be 2,000 sets times 2 pieces per set times $5 each, equaling $20,000.\n\nAlternatively, the artist might argue that the price is per set, meaning $5 for both the cup and the saucer combined.\n\nGiven that, the trade usage evidence would be relevant to determine which pricing approach is standard in the industry.\n\nTherefore, I think the studio's evidence is admissible to give meaning to the ambiguous term \"each\" in the context of the contract.\n\nSo, my final answer is D: yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
