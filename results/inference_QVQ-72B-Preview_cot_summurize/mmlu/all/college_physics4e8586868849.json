                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a coin on a turntable. The coefficient of static friction is 0.30, and the turntable is rotating at 33.3 revolutions per minute. I need to find the maximum distance from the center of the turntable where the coin won't slide. The options are A. 0.024 m, B. 0.048 m, C. 0.121 m, and D. 0.242 m.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the forces acting on the coin. Since the turntable is rotating, the coin is moving in a circle, which means there's a centripetal force acting towards the center. This centripetal force is provided by the friction between the coin and the turntable.\n\nThe formula for centripetal force is:\n\n\\[F_c = m \\omega^2 r\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the coin,\n\n- \\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity in radians per second,\n\n- \\(r\\) is the radius from the center.\n\nThe maximum static friction force that can be provided is:\n\n\\[f_{max} = \\mu_s n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\mu_s\\) is the coefficient of static friction (0.30),\n\n- \\(n\\) is the normal force.\n\nSince the coin is on a horizontal surface, the normal force equals the weight of the coin, so \\(n = mg\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the coin and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTherefore, the maximum friction force is:\n\n\\[f_{max} = \\mu_s mg\\]\n\nFor the coin not to slide, the centripetal force required must be less than or equal to the maximum friction force provided:\n\n\\[m \\omega^2 r \\leq \\mu_s mg\\]\n\nI can cancel out \\(m\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\\omega^2 r \\leq \\mu_s g\\]\n\nSolving for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[r \\leq \\frac{\\mu_s g}{\\omega^2}\\]\n\nSo, the maximum distance \\(r\\) from the center where the coin won't slide is:\n\n\\[r = \\frac{\\mu_s g}{\\omega^2}\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \\(\\omega\\), the angular velocity, in radians per second.\n\nGiven that the turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute, I can convert this to radians per second.\n\nFirst, convert revolutions per minute to radians per minute:\n\n\\[33.3 \\text{ rev/min} \\times 2\\pi \\text{ rad/rev} = 66.6\\pi \\text{ rad/min}\\]\n\nThen, convert radians per minute to radians per second:\n\n\\[\\frac{66.6\\pi \\text{ rad}}{60 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{66.6\\pi}{60} \\text{ rad/s} = 3.41 \\text{ rad/s}\\]\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation.\n\n33.3 rev/min is indeed 33.3 * 2\u03c0 rad/min = 66.6\u03c0 rad/min.\n\nThen, to convert to rad/s, divide by 60:\n\n\\[\\omega = \\frac{66.6\\pi}{60} = \\frac{66.6 \\times 3.1416}{60} \\approx \\frac{209.02}{60} \\approx 3.4837 \\text{ rad/s}\\]\n\nOkay, so \\(\\omega \\approx 3.484\\) rad/s.\n\nNow, plug in the values into the equation for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[r = \\frac{\\mu_s g}{\\omega^2} = \\frac{0.30 \\times 9.8}{(3.484)^2}\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\omega^2\\):\n\n\\[(3.484)^2 \\approx 12.13 \\text{ rad}^2/\\text{s}^2\\]\n\nThen, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[0.30 \\times 9.8 = 2.94\\]\n\nNow, divide:\n\n\\[r = \\frac{2.94}{12.13} \\approx 0.242 \\text{ m}\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 0.242 m seems to match this result.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, confirm the angular velocity conversion:\n\n33.3 rev/min = 33.3 * 2\u03c0 rad/min = 66.6\u03c0 rad/min.\n\nConvert to rad/s: 66.6\u03c0 / 60 \u2248 3.4837 rad/s. That seems correct.\n\nThen, \\(r = \\frac{0.30 \\times 9.8}{(3.484)^2}\\):\n\n0.30 * 9.8 = 2.94\n\n(3.484)^2 \u2248 12.13\n\n2.94 / 12.13 \u2248 0.242 m\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.242 m.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there are any other factors I might have missed. Since the turntable is horizontal, and assuming no other forces are acting on the coin besides gravity and the normal force, and the friction is the only horizontal force, my calculation should be accurate.\n\nAlso, confirming the units: since g is in m/s\u00b2 and \\(\\omega\\) is in rad/s, the units for r come out to meters, which is consistent.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is D. 0.242 m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
