                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options would increase the aggregate demand function. I'm a bit rusty on macroeconomics, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what aggregate demand is. It's the total demand for goods and services in an economy at a given price level. The aggregate demand function is usually represented as AD = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, X is exports, and M is imports.\n\nSo, anything that increases C, I, G, or X, or decreases M, should shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, meaning an increase in aggregate demand.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Higher levels of imported goods.\n\nImports are part of the aggregate demand function as M, and they subtract from aggregate demand because they represent leakage from the domestic economy. If imports increase, that means more money is being spent on foreign goods rather than domestic goods, which would decrease domestic aggregate demand. So, higher imports would decrease aggregate demand, not increase it.\n\nOption B: Lower levels of consumer wealth.\n\nConsumer wealth affects consumption (C). If consumers have less wealth, they might spend less, which would decrease consumption and thus aggregate demand. So, lower consumer wealth would lead to decreased aggregate demand.\n\nOption C: A higher real interest rate.\n\nInterest rates affect investment (I). Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which typically leads to decreased investment spending. So, a higher real interest rate would likely decrease aggregate demand.\n\nOption D: Lower taxes on personal income.\n\nTaxes affect disposable income, which in turn affects consumption (C). If taxes are lowered, disposable income increases, and consumers might spend more, increasing consumption and thus aggregate demand.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option D seems like the one that would increase aggregate demand.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that lower taxes could lead to increased savings rather than increased consumption? Yeah, that's possible. If people feel more secure with higher disposable income, they might save more and not necessarily spend it all. But generally, in the short term, lower taxes are expected to stimulate consumption.\n\nAlso, lower taxes might affect investment as well, depending on how they're structured. If lower taxes apply to corporations or investors, that might increase investment spending. But in this question, it's specified as \"lower taxes on personal income,\" which directly affects consumers' disposable income.\n\nI think, all things considered, lower taxes on personal income would tend to increase aggregate demand, primarily through increased consumption.\n\nSo, my answer is D. Lower taxes on personal income.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
