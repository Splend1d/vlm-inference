                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Cohen's view on animals. The options are:\n\nA. Moral agents.\n\nB. Amoral.\n\nC. Abstract reasoners.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nAnd the question is, according to Cohen, animals are...\n\nFirst off, I need to understand who Cohen is and what his stance on animals is. Since the question doesn't specify which Cohen, I'm going to assume it's either Bernard Cohen or some other philosopher named Cohen. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure, so I might need to do a bit of digging here.\n\nLet me start by considering what each term means:\n\n1. **Moral agents:** These are beings capable of making moral choices and being held responsible for their actions. Typically, this includes humans, but in some philosophical traditions, it might include other animals as well.\n\n2. **Amoral:** This term generally refers to something that is neither moral nor immoral; it's outside the realm of morality. So, an amoral being wouldn't be subject to moral judgment.\n\n3. **Abstract reasoners:** This seems to refer to beings capable of abstract thought and reasoning. Again, traditionally, this is attributed to humans, but some animals might possess limited abilities in this area.\n\nGiven that, the question is asking whether, according to Cohen, animals fit into any of these categories.\n\nI should probably look up Cohen's writings or see if there's a specific theory he has about animals. Since I don't have direct access to his works right now, I'll need to recall or infer based on general philosophical positions.\n\nLet me consider different possible Cohens:\n\n- **Bernard Cohen:** Known for his work in American history and politics. Doesn't seem directly relevant to animal ethics.\n\n- **Thomas Nagel:** Wait, that's not Cohen. Nagel has written about what it's like to be a bat, which touches on animal consciousness, but again, not directly about moral agency or abstract reasoning.\n\n- **G.A. Cohen:** He was a political philosopher known for his work on socialism and distributive justice. Not sure if he wrote extensively about animals.\n\n- **Joshua Cohen:** Another political philosopher, known for his work on democracy and political theory. Again, no direct connection to animal ethics.\n\nHmm, maybe it's a different Cohen. Perhaps J. Cohen or S. Cohen? I'm starting to think that the reference might be to Marc Cohen, who has written about animal rights.\n\nWait a minute, there's Marc Bekoff, who writes about animal emotions and consciousness, but that's not Cohen. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's referring to Andrew Cohen, a philosopher who might have written about animals, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm drawing a blank on a specific Cohen who focuses on animal ethics, maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps the question is testing general knowledge about how animals are viewed in ethics.\n\nIn general philosophy, animals are often considered:\n\n- **Not moral agents:** Because they lack the capacity for moral reasoning and understanding of moral rules.\n\n- **Amoral beings:** Their actions are not subject to moral judgment in the same way human actions are.\n\n- **Capable of some reasoning:** Some animals can solve problems and learn from their environment, which suggests a degree of reasoning ability, though not necessarily abstract reasoning.\n\nBut again, this is too general. I need to find out what specifically Cohen argues.\n\nLet me consider that the answer might be B. Amoral. That seems to align with common philosophical views about animals not being subject to moral blame or praise in the same way humans are.\n\nHowever, I should consider if Cohen might have a different view. For instance, some philosophers argue that animals can be moral patients (beings that can be harmed or benefited morally) but not moral agents.\n\nIf Cohen is one of those philosophers, then he might consider animals as moral patients but not moral agents, which would make option A incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, regarding abstract reasoners, unless animals have been shown to engage in abstract thought, which is debated, they might not qualify as abstract reasoners.\n\nGiven that, option C might also be incorrect.\n\nSo, if Cohen views animals as amoral, meaning their actions don't fall under moral scrutiny in the same way human actions do, then option B could be correct.\n\nBut I have a nagging feeling that the answer might be D. All of the above, which seems contradictory. Can animals be moral agents, amoral, and abstract reasoners all at once?\n\nThat doesn't make much sense to me. It's unlikely that animals can be both moral agents and amoral simultaneously. Maybe the question is trying to trick me into choosing D without thinking carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Cohen has a unique view that categorizes animals differently.\n\nLet me try another angle. Suppose the question is about a specific theory by Cohen that classifies animals into these categories. If that's the case, then I need to recall or research Cohen's specific classifications.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether Cohen considers animals to be moral agents, amoral, or abstract reasoners, and the answer is that he considers them amoral, meaning they are not subject to moral judgment.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards option B. Amoral.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any evidence that Cohen views animals as moral agents or abstract reasoners.\n\nIf animals are moral agents, they would be capable of making moral choices and being held responsible for them, which seems implausible given our understanding of animal cognition.\n\nSimilarly, for abstract reasoners, while some animals show signs of advanced cognition and problem-solving, it's debatable whether they engage in abstract reasoning comparable to humans.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, option B. Amoral, seems the most plausible answer.\n\nHowever, to ensure I'm not missing something, I should consider if there's any specific Cohen who argues that animals are moral agents or abstract reasoners.\n\nAfter a quick search in my memory, I can't recall any philosopher named Cohen who holds such a view. Most philosophical positions I'm familiar with do not consider animals to be moral agents or abstract reasoners in the same way humans are.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with my initial inclination and choose option B. Amoral.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
