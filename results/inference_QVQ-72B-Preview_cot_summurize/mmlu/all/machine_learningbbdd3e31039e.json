                    "text": "Alright, I've got two statements here about neural networks and I need to figure out which ones are true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\nFirst statement: \"Industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs.\"\n\nHmm, I thought GPUs were great for training neural networks because they can handle parallel computations really well. CPUs are good for general-purpose computing, but for something as computationally intensive as training big neural networks, I would imagine that GPUs are more efficient. Maybe there's something I'm missing about industrial-scale training.\n\nLet me think about this. In industry, they deal with massive datasets and very large models. GPUs are designed to process large matrices quickly, which is perfect for neural network operations like matrix multiplications. CPUs, on the other hand, are better at handling branchy code and smaller data sets.\n\nBut maybe in some specific use cases, CPUs are still preferred for training. Perhaps for certain types of models or when power consumption is a big concern, CPUs might be more cost-effective. However, I think the general trend is towards using GPUs for training neural networks, especially at scale.\n\nI should also consider that some industries might still be using older technology or have specific requirements that make CPU training more feasible. But overall, I would say that GPUs are the norm for training large neural networks in industry.\n\nSo, based on that, I think this first statement is false.\n\nSecond statement: \"The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.\"\n\nResNet-50 is a well-known deep learning model, specifically a convolutional neural network, developed by Microsoft. It's part of the ResNet family, which introduced skip connections to help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.\n\nI recall that ResNet-50 has 50 layers, and it's a relatively large model, but I don't remember it having a billion parameters. Let me try to recall the approximate number of parameters.\n\nIf I remember correctly, ResNet-50 has around 25 million parameters. Yeah, that sounds familiar. Definitely not over a billion. For comparison, some larger models like GPT-3 have over 175 billion parameters, but ResNet-50 is much smaller.\n\nSo, this second statement seems false as well.\n\nTherefore, both statements are false. That would make the correct answer B. False, False.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any chance that either statement could be true.\n\nFor the first statement, maybe in some specific industrial applications, CPUs are still preferred for training neural networks. Perhaps for real-time training or in environments where GPUs aren't available or are too expensive. However, in most modern industrial settings, especially with the rise of cloud computing and GPU instances, I think GPUs are predominantly used for training large neural networks.\n\nFor the second statement, maybe there's a variant of ResNet-50 with additional layers or modifications that increase the number of parameters to over a billion. But that doesn't sound right. The standard ResNet-50 architecture should have a consistent number of parameters across implementations, give or take some variations in specific layers.\n\nI think I'm confident with my assessment. Both statements are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
