                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Who is the woman mystic who exemplified the all-consuming love of the divine?\" And the options are Rumi, Rabi'a, Fatimah, and Khadija. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these figures is known for exemplifying an all-consuming love of the divine, especially from a mystical perspective.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what a mystic is. A mystic is someone who seeks direct knowledge of the divine through intuitive insight and spiritual experience, often going beyond ordinary sensory perception. So, in this context, a woman mystic would be someone who has deepened her connection with the divine through such experiences and whose life exemplifies this profound love.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Rumi. I know that Rumi is a famous poet and philosopher, often associated with Sufism, which is a mystical tradition in Islam. He wrote beautiful poems about love and divinity, and his teachings emphasize the importance of love in connecting with the divine. However, Rumi was a man, so even though he's a prominent mystic, he doesn't fit the criteria of being a woman.\n\nNext is Rabi'a. I've heard of Rabi'a al-Adawiyya; she was a Sufi saint and poet. She's known for her intense love and devotion to God, often expressed through her poetry. Rabi'a is celebrated for her pure love of God, not just for fear of hell or hope of paradise, but for the sake of love itself. This sounds a lot like the concept of all-consuming love of the divine.\n\nFatimah is another option. Fatimah was the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad and is highly revered in Islam, particularly in Shia Islam. She's known for her piety and closeness to her father, but I'm not sure if she's primarily known for mysticism in the same way that Rumi or Rabi'a are. She was certainly a significant figure, but maybe not specifically as a mystic who exemplified all-consuming divine love.\n\nLastly, Khadija. Khadija was the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad and is known for being the first person to convert to Islam. She was a successful businesswoman and a strong supporter of her husband's mission. While she was a prominent figure in early Islam, I don't recall her being associated with mysticism or all-consuming divine love in the same manner as Rabi'a.\n\nSo, based on this, Rabi'a seems to be the most fitting choice. She was a woman mystic who is famous for her intense and all-consuming love of the divine, as expressed through her poetry and teachings.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. I remember that Rumi was a man, so he's out. Fatimah and Khadija were important figures in Islam but aren't primarily known as mystics. Rabi'a, on the other hand, is well-known for her mystical poetry and her emphasis on divine love.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can think about some other female mystics in Islamic history. For example, there's Lalla D\u00e9d\u00e9, who was another Sufi saint, or H\u0101fezeh Khanom, but they might not be as well-known as Rabi'a.\n\nGiven the options provided, Rabi'a is the most appropriate choice for the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Rabi'a}} \\]"
