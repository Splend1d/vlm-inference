                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is asking which language feature requires stack-based storage allocation instead of static allocation. The options are recursive procedures, arbitrary gotos, two-dimensional arrays, and integer-valued functions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what stack-based storage allocation and static allocation mean. Stack-based allocation typically refers to the allocation of memory on the call stack, which is managed automatically by the runtime system during function calls. Static allocation, on the other hand, refers to memory that's allocated at compile time and remains allocated throughout the program's execution.\n\nSo, the question is, which of these features necessitates the use of the stack rather than static memory allocation?\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Recursive procedures: Recursive procedures are functions that call themselves, either directly or indirectly. When a function calls itself, the runtime needs to keep track of the state of each invocation, including the values of local variables and the return address. This kind of bookkeeping is naturally handled by the call stack. If we were to use static allocation, it would be challenging to manage the multiple invocations and their respective states because static memory doesn't grow or shrink dynamically. Therefore, recursive procedures typically require stack-based allocation.\n\nB. Arbitrary gotos: Gotos are jump statements that can transfer control to any labeled statement in the program. In terms of memory allocation, gotos don't inherently require stack-based allocation. They primarily affect the program flow rather than memory management. The use of gotos might lead to more complex control flow, but they don't directly dictate the need for stack-based allocation. The stack is mainly used for function calls and local variables, not for managing jumps via gotos.\n\nC. Two-dimensional arrays: Two-dimensional arrays are essentially arrays of arrays. In some programming languages, they are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, either in row-major or column-major order. This kind of storage can be handled statically if the sizes are known at compile time. However, if the sizes are determined at runtime, dynamic allocation might be necessary, but this doesn't necessarily mean it has to be stack-based. In many languages, two-dimensional arrays can be allocated on the heap using dynamic memory allocation functions.\n\nD. Integer-valued functions: These are functions that return an integer value. The return value of a function is usually stored in a register or in the stack frame, depending on the calling convention of the language and the platform. However, the storage for the return value itself doesn't inherently require stack-based allocation. In most languages, the return value is handled separately from stack allocation, and static allocation could be sufficient for storing return values.\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems that recursive procedures are the most straightforward choice for requiring stack-based storage allocation. The call stack is designed to handle the multiple invocations and their local variables efficiently, whereas static allocation wouldn't scale well for recursive functions, especially those with potential for deep recursion.\n\nLet me think about this a bit more. Is there any scenario where static allocation could be used for recursive procedures? Well, in theory, if the maximum recursion depth is known at compile time and is limited, some compilers might allocate stack space statically for local variables, but this is more of an optimization and not generally applicable for arbitrary recursion depths.\n\nIn contrast, arbitrary gotos don't directly influence memory allocation types; two-dimensional arrays can be statically allocated if their sizes are known at compile time; and integer-valued functions' return values are handled outside of stack or static allocation mechanisms directly related to their execution.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Recursive procedures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
