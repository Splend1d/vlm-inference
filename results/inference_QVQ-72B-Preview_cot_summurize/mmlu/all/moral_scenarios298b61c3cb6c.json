                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I sometimes try to tell the truth, unless it gets me in trouble.\" So, they attempt to be honest, but if telling the truth would cause them trouble, they might not do it. In Scenario 2, the person says, \"I kissed my girlfriend at the magic show.\" That seems straightforward\u2014they kissed their significant other at a public event.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each scenario in terms of moral wrongness. The question is asking whether these actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: Sometimes trying to tell the truth, unless it gets me in trouble.\n\nHmm, honesty is generally considered a virtue, right? But in this case, the person is qualifying it by saying they might not tell the truth if it gets them in trouble. So, they're being honest when it's convenient, but not when it could lead to negative consequences for themselves.\n\nI need to think about whether this is morally wrong. Well, honesty is important, and avoiding trouble by lying could be seen as dishonesty. But is it always wrong to avoid trouble by not telling the truth? What if the \"trouble\" is something really serious?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider some examples to make this more concrete. Suppose someone is asked if they took something that wasn't theirs, and they know that admitting it would get them in trouble, so they lie. Is that wrong? According to ordinary moral standards, yes, because lying is generally considered wrong, especially when it's to avoid personal consequence.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there are situations where telling the truth could lead to unjustified punishment or where the truth might harm someone unnecessarily. In those cases, perhaps withholding the truth or lying could be seen as less wrong, or even justifiable.\n\nBut the scenario is general\u2014it doesn't specify the context or the nature of the trouble. So, I have to consider it in a general sense.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty is a key principle, and lying for personal gain is considered morally wrong. So, if someone is lying to avoid trouble, that could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions, like if telling the truth would lead to unjust harm or danger. But again, without specific context, it's hard to say.\n\nMaybe I should consider the principle of utilitarianism, which suggests that actions are moral if they maximize happiness or well-being for the greatest number of people. In this case, lying to avoid personal trouble might not maximize overall happiness, especially if others find out and lose trust in the person.\n\nAlternatively, deontological ethics, like Kant's categorical imperative, would say that one should always tell the truth, regardless of the consequences, because lying is inherently wrong.\n\nSo, from both these perspectives, the act of lying to avoid trouble seems morally wrong.\n\nBut the scenario says, \"I sometimes try to tell the truth, unless it gets me in trouble.\" So, it's not that they always lie when trouble is involved; it's that they might choose not to tell the truth in those situations.\n\nPerhaps they find alternative ways to avoid trouble without lying, like staying silent or changing the subject. But even then, withholding the truth can be seen as a form of dishonesty.\n\nI think, in general, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, choosing not to tell the truth to avoid personal trouble is considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Kissing one's girlfriend at the magic show.\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. The person is in a relationship and expresses affection publicly by kissing their partner.\n\nIn the US, public displays of affection between consenting adults are generally accepted and not considered morally wrong. Kissing in public is a common way of showing affection and love.\n\nUnless there's some specific context that makes this kiss inappropriate\u2014like if the girlfriend didn't consent to it, or if it was in a place where such behavior is not allowed\u2014but the scenario doesn't indicate any of that.\n\nSo, based on the information given, kissing one's girlfriend at the magic show doesn't seem like a morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 1, it's considered morally wrong, and for Scenario 2, it's not.\n\nSo, according to the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a second, but the question says \"the main character (who uses I/me/my) does something clearly morally wrong.\" So, in Scenario 1, it's about the person's intention to sometimes not tell the truth to avoid trouble, and in Scenario 2, it's about kissing one's girlfriend at a magic show.\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is admitting to a pattern of behavior where they might not tell the truth to avoid trouble. This is a general statement about their behavior, not a specific instance of lying. So, is the act of sometimes choosing not to tell the truth morally wrong? I think, in general, yes, because it involves dishonesty.\n\nIn Scenario 2, kissing one's girlfriend at the magic show is a benign act of affection, and there's nothing inherently morally wrong with it, assuming it's consensual and appropriate for the setting.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps, in Scenario 1, the person is being honest about their tendency to lie when it's inconvenient, which could be seen as self-awareness, but the behavior itself is still morally questionable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Scenario 2, kissing in public could be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful to others, but that seems like a stretch. In the US, kissing in public is widely accepted, especially in places like magic shows where people are relaxed and enjoying themselves.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment stands. Scenario 1 is morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
