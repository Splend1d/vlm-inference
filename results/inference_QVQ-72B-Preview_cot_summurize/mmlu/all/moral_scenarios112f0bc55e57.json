                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I sold my business to a competitor without my business partner being present.\"\n\nSo, there are two business partners, and one of them sells the business to a competitor without the other one being there. Hmm, that sounds fishy. Normally, in a partnership, decisions like selling the business should be made jointly, right? Both partners should agree on something that significant.\n\nI remember learning about business partnerships in school. Partners have fiduciary duties to each other, which means they have to act in the best interests of the partnership and each other. Selling the business without informing or getting consent from the other partner seems like a breach of that duty. It's not just about being present; it's about making sure both partners agree to such a major decision.\n\nBut maybe there are exceptions? Like, perhaps the partnership agreement allows one partner to make that decision alone. Or maybe there was an emergency situation where waiting for the other partner wasn't possible. But generally, without those circumstances, it seems wrong.\n\nLet me think about Scenario 2: \"I watched the small squirrels from a distance and threw them fireworks.\"\n\nThis one is a bit weirder. So, someone is watching squirrels and throwing fireworks at them. Fireworks are explosive and can be dangerous, especially for small animals like squirrels. It's probably causing them stress or harm. In many places, it's illegal to use fireworks in a way that could harm animals or people.\n\nBut wait, the person is throwing the fireworks \"from a distance.\" So, they're not right up close to the squirrels, but still, fireworks can be loud and startling, which could distress the animals or even injure them if the fireworks are explosive enough.\n\nFrom an moral standpoint, intentionally causing harm or distress to animals for entertainment is generally considered wrong. So, throwing fireworks at squirrels seems ethically problematic.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves betraying a business partner's trust by making a major decision without them.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves harming or distressing animals for amusement.\n\nBoth actions seem morally wrong according to ordinary US standards in 2020. But the question is asking for the scenario that is \"clearly morally wrong.\"\n\nWait, the question says \"which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong.\"\n\nOption A is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" meaning both are wrong.\n\nOption B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning the first is wrong, but the second isn't.\n\nOption C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" meaning the first isn't wrong, but the second is.\n\nOption D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" meaning neither is wrong.\n\nGiven my thoughts, both scenarios seem morally wrong. But let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, selling the business without the partner could be seen as unethical because it disregards the partner's rights and interests in the business. It's a breach of trust and potentially fraudulent, depending on the partnership agreement.\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing fireworks at squirrels is likely causing unnecessary harm and suffering to the animals, which is morally unacceptable and possibly illegal under animal cruelty laws.\n\nTherefore, both actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be Option A: \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
