                    "text": "So I have this question about \"Charlie's Angels.\" It's asking which actress starred on the show for its entire run. The options are Cheryl Ladd, Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, and Kate Jackson. Hmm, I need to think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"Charlie's Angels\" was a popular TV show in the 1970s. It featured a group of female detectives who worked for a mysterious character named Charles Townsend, or Charlie for short. The show was known for its action-packed episodes and the iconic cast of angels.\n\nNow, the question is about the actress who was there from start to finish. Let me recall how long the show ran. I think it was on air from 1976 to 1981, so that's five years, or maybe it's six seasons? Wait, actually, I should check that. Upon a quick check, \"Charlie's Angels\" aired from September 22, 1976, to May 24, 1981, spanning five seasons. Okay, got it.\n\nSo, during those five seasons, which actress was present throughout the entire run? Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Farrah Fawcett. She was one of the original three angels, along with Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith. I remember that she had a lot of fame and popularity during the show's early days, especially known for her hairstyle. But I think she left the show after the first season. Let me confirm that. Yes, Farrah Fawcett left \"Charlie's Angels\" after the first season, in 1977. She was replaced by Cheryl Ladd in the second season. So, she wasn't there for the entire run.\n\nNext is Kate Jackson. She was also one of the original angels. I think she stayed for more than one season, but I'm not sure if she was there till the end. Let me see. Kate Jackson played Jill Danko in the first three seasons, from 1976 to 1979. Then she left the show, and her character was written off. So, she wasn't there for the entire five seasons. Therefore, she's not the correct answer.\n\nNow, Cheryl Ladd. She joined the show in the second season as Kris Monroe, replacing Farrah Fawcett. I believe she was in the show for several seasons. Let me recall: she started in 1977 and was in the show until 1981, which would cover seasons 2 through 5. Wait, but I think she might have left before the final season. Let me check. Actually, Cheryl Ladd was in seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5, but I think she might have left partway through the fifth season. Hmm, maybe not the entire run. Let me confirm. Upon checking, Cheryl Ladd was indeed in the show from season 2 to season 5, but she didn't appear in all episodes of the fifth season. So, perhaps she wasn't there for the entire run either.\n\nFinally, there's Jaclyn Smith. She was another original angel, playing Kelly Garrett. I have a feeling that she was the only one who stayed for all five seasons. Let me verify that. Yes, Jaclyn Smith was present in all five seasons of \"Charlie's Angels,\" from 1976 to 1981. She was the only original angel to remain throughout the entire series. Her character, Kelly Garrett, adapted to various changes in the cast and storylines over the years.\n\nSo, based on this information, the correct answer should be Jaclyn Smith. She starred on \"Charlie's Angels\" for the show's entire run of five seasons.\n\nJust to make sure, let me summarize:\n\n- Farrah Fawcett: season 1 only\n\n- Kate Jackson: seasons 1-3\n\n- Cheryl Ladd: seasons 2-5, but possibly not all of season 5\n\n- Jaclyn Smith: seasons 1-5\n\nTherefore, Jaclyn Smith is the actress who starred on \"Charlie's Angels\" for the entire duration of the show.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Jaclyn Smith}} \\]"
