                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have the equation:\n\n\\[(a + b + c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 150\\]\n\nAnd we're told that \\(a, b, c\\) are positive integers. We need to find the value of \\(a + b + c\\). The options provided are 16, 6, 12, and 150. Hmm, 150 seems too big compared to the others, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nFirst, I recall that expanding \\((a + b + c)^3\\) involves binomial coefficients. Let's write out the expansion:\n\n\\[(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 + 6abc\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't look right. Actually, no, that's correct. Now, if I subtract \\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\\) from both sides, I get:\n\n\\[(a + b + c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 + 6abc\\]\n\nAnd we know that this equals 150:\n\n\\[3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 + 6abc = 150\\]\n\nThis looks a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for three variables, there's an identity involving symmetric sums. Let me think about that. There's an identity that says:\n\n\\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz)\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that \\(a, b, c\\) are positive integers, so their values are at least 1. That means \\(a + b + c \\geq 3\\), since the smallest possible values are 1, 1, and 1.\n\nNow, let's try plugging in some small values for \\(a + b + c\\) and see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nOption B is 6. So, suppose \\(a + b + c = 6\\). Let's see if there are positive integers \\(a, b, c\\) that add up to 6 and satisfy the equation.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- 1, 1, 4\n\n- 1, 2, 3\n\n- 2, 2, 2\n\nLet's compute the left side for each of these.\n\nFirst, 1, 1, 4:\n\n\\[(1 + 1 + 4)^3 - 1^3 - 1^3 - 4^3 = 6^3 - 1 - 1 - 64 = 216 - 1 - 1 - 64 = 216 - 66 = 150\\]\n\nWow, that works! So, \\(a + b + c = 6\\) satisfies the equation when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 4\\). Let me check if there are other combinations with \\(a + b + c = 6\\).\n\nNext, 1, 2, 3:\n\n\\[(1 + 2 + 3)^3 - 1^3 - 2^3 - 3^3 = 6^3 - 1 - 8 - 27 = 216 - 36 = 180\\]\n\nThat's not 150.\n\nNext, 2, 2, 2:\n\n\\[(2 + 2 + 2)^3 - 2^3 - 2^3 - 2^3 = 6^3 - 8 - 8 - 8 = 216 - 24 = 192\\]\n\nNot 150.\n\nSo, only the combination 1, 1, 4 works among the possibilities where \\(a + b + c = 6\\).\n\nNow, let's check option C: 12.\n\nSuppose \\(a + b + c = 12\\). Let's pick some values, say \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = 5\\):\n\n\\[(3 + 4 + 5)^3 - 3^3 - 4^3 - 5^3 = 12^3 - 27 - 64 - 125 = 1728 - 216 = 1512\\]\n\nThat's way bigger than 150.\n\nAnother combination: \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 5\\), \\(c = 6\\):\n\n\\[(1 + 5 + 6)^3 - 1^3 - 5^3 - 6^3 = 12^3 - 1 - 125 - 216 = 1728 - 342 = 1386\\]\n\nStill not 150.\n\nIt seems unlikely that \\(a + b + c = 12\\) would work, given the large discrepancy.\n\nOption A: 16.\n\nIf \\(a + b + c = 16\\), let's pick \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 7\\), \\(c = 8\\):\n\n\\[(1 + 7 + 8)^3 - 1^3 - 7^3 - 8^3 = 16^3 - 1 - 343 - 512 = 4096 - 856 = 3240\\]\n\nWay bigger than 150.\n\nOption D: 150.\n\nWell, that seems excessive for small positive integers, but let's check just to be thorough.\n\nSuppose \\(a + b + c = 150\\), and let's say \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 148\\):\n\n\\[(1 + 1 + 148)^3 - 1^3 - 1^3 - 148^3 = 150^3 - 1 - 1 - 3,144,328 = 3,375,000 - 3,144,330 = 230,670\\]\n\nNot even close to 150.\n\nSo, among the given options, only \\(a + b + c = 6\\) works with the combination \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 4\\).\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other combinations where \\(a + b + c\\) is different. Let's consider if there are other possible sums that could work.\n\nSuppose \\(a + b + c = 5\\). Possible combinations:\n\n- 1, 1, 3\n\n- 1, 2, 2\n\nLet's check 1, 1, 3:\n\n\\[(1 + 1 + 3)^3 - 1^3 - 1^3 - 3^3 = 5^3 - 1 - 1 - 27 = 125 - 29 = 96\\]\n\nNot 150.\n\nNext, 1, 2, 2:\n\n\\[(1 + 2 + 2)^3 - 1^3 - 2^3 - 2^3 = 5^3 - 1 - 8 - 8 = 125 - 17 = 108\\]\n\nStill not 150.\n\nSo, \\(a + b + c = 5\\) doesn't work.\n\nWhat about \\(a + b + c = 7\\)? Let's try \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 5\\):\n\n\\[(1 + 1 + 5)^3 - 1^3 - 1^3 - 5^3 = 7^3 - 1 - 1 - 125 = 343 - 127 = 216\\]\n\nNot 150.\n\nAnother combination: \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), \\(c = 4\\):\n\n\\[(1 + 2 + 4)^3 - 1^3 - 2^3 - 4^3 = 7^3 - 1 - 8 - 64 = 343 - 73 = 270\\]\n\nStill not 150.\n\nIt seems like \\(a + b + c = 6\\) is the only one that works among the small integer sums.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are other possible combinations where \\(a + b + c\\) is different but still satisfies the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more algebraic approach to this problem.\n\nLet me go back to the original equation:\n\n\\[(a + b + c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 150\\]\n\nI recall that there's an identity for \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz\\), but in this case, it's \\((x + y + z)^3 - x^3 - y^3 - z^3\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this expression.\n\nLet me consider expanding \\((a + b + c)^3\\):\n\n\\[(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 + 6abc\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[(a + b + c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 + 6abc = 150\\]\n\nThis seems complicated to solve directly for \\(a, b, c\\), especially since they are positive integers.\n\nMaybe I can look for symmetry or try to factor this expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\(a + b + c = s\\), and express everything in terms of \\(s\\).\n\nBut that might not simplify things.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that \\(a + b + c = s\\), and then express \\(a, b, c\\) in terms of \\(s\\), but since they are positive integers, that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that \\(a + b + c = s\\), and then look for possible values of \\(s\\) such that the equation holds.\n\nGiven that \\(a, b, c\\) are positive integers, \\(s \\geq 3\\), and from earlier trials, \\(s = 6\\) works with \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 4\\).\n\nLet me see if there are other possible values of \\(s\\) that satisfy the equation.\n\nSuppose \\(s = 6\\), and we have \\(a + b + c = 6\\). We already found one solution: \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 4\\).\n\nAre there other combinations with \\(s = 6\\) that satisfy the equation?\n\nLet's try \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 2\\), \\(c = 2\\):\n\n\\[(2 + 2 + 2)^3 - 2^3 - 2^3 - 2^3 = 6^3 - 8 - 8 - 8 = 216 - 24 = 192\\]\n\nNot 150.\n\nNext, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), \\(c = 3\\):\n\n\\[(1 + 2 + 3)^3 - 1^3 - 2^3 - 3^3 = 6^3 - 1 - 8 - 27 = 216 - 36 = 180\\]\n\nStill not 150.\n\nAnother combination: \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 4\\), which we already saw works.\n\nWhat about \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = 2\\):\n\n\\[(1 + 3 + 2)^3 - 1^3 - 3^3 - 2^3 = 6^3 - 1 - 27 - 8 = 216 - 36 = 180\\]\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, it seems like \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 4\\) is the only combination with \\(s = 6\\) that satisfies the equation.\n\nNow, let's consider \\(s = 7\\).
