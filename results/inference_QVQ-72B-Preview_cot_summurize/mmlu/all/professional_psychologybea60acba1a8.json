The options are controlling variables, moderator variables, dependent variables, and organismic variables. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what a functional analysis is. From what I recall, functional analysis is a method used in behavior analysis to understand the relationship between behaviors and the environmental conditions that influence them. It's often used to identify what factors are controlling a particular behavior.\n\nSo, if functional analysis is about understanding what controls a behavior, it's probably trying to identify the variables that are controlling the behavior. That sounds like option A, controlling variables.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption B is moderator variables. I know that in some research contexts, moderator variables affect the strength or direction of the relationship between two other variables. But in the context of functional analysis in behavior analysis, I don't think moderator variables are the primary focus. So, maybe not B.\n\nOption C is dependent variables. In any experimental design, dependent variables are the outcomes being measured. In functional analysis, we're typically measuring the frequency, duration, or intensity of a behavior. So, while dependent variables are involved, the main goal isn't just to identify them but to understand what's controlling them. So, probably not C.\n\nOption D is organismic variables. This one sounds interesting. Organismic variables refer to characteristics of the organism itself, like age, health status, or previous experiences. While these can influence behavior, in functional analysis, the primary focus is usually on the environmental variables that immediately control the behavior. So, perhaps organismic variables are less central to the purpose of functional analysis.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best answer is A, controlling variables. Functional analysis is primarily conducted to identify what in the environment is controlling the behavior of interest.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me think about an example. Suppose a teacher wants to reduce disruptive behavior in a classroom. A functional analysis might involve setting up different conditions to see when the disruptive behavior increases or decreases. For example, does the behavior occur more often when the student is given difficult work, or when they're ignored? By identifying these conditions, the analysis is trying to pinpoint the controlling variables\u2014that is, the environmental factors that trigger or maintain the disruptive behavior.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is A, controlling variables.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
