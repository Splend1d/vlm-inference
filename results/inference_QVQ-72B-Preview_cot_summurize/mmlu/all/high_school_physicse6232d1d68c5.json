                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two traveling waves superimposing in a medium. The waves have the same frequency, one has an amplitude of 4 cm, and the other has an amplitude of 6 cm. I need to figure out which of the given options best describes the displacement, D, of the resultant wave.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what happens when waves superimpose. Superposition is when two or more waves overlap, and their displacements add up at each point in the medium. Since these waves have the same frequency, they should interact in a straightforward way.\n\nNow, the displacements of the individual waves are given by their amplitudes. So, one wave has an amplitude of 4 cm, and the other has 6 cm. When they superimpose, the resultant displacement, D, should be the sum of their individual displacements at any given point and time.\n\nBut wait, the actual displacement at any point depends on the phase difference between the two waves at that point. If the waves are in phase, meaning their peaks align, the amplitudes add up directly. If they are out of phase, especially if they are completely out of phase, the amplitudes could subtract.\n\nSo, in the best-case scenario where they are perfectly in phase, the resultant amplitude would be 4 cm + 6 cm = 10 cm. In the worst-case scenario where they are perfectly out of phase, the resultant amplitude would be 6 cm - 4 cm = 2 cm.\n\nTherefore, the resultant displacement, D, should range between 2 cm and 10 cm, depending on the phase difference between the two waves.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 2 cm \u2264 D \u2264 10 cm\n\nB. D = 5 cm\n\nC. D = 10 cm\n\nD. 10 cm \u2264 D \u2264 12 cm\n\nOption A seems to match my calculation, as it covers the entire possible range from 2 cm to 10 cm.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is it possible for the resultant displacement to be exactly 2 cm or 10 cm?\n\nYes, as I thought earlier, if the waves are completely out of phase, D would be 2 cm, and if they are completely in phase, D would be 10 cm.\n\nOption B suggests a fixed displacement of 5 cm, which is the average of 4 cm and 6 cm. But in reality, unless the waves are always exactly half in phase and half out of phase, which isn't typically the case, the resultant displacement wouldn't just be the average.\n\nOption C suggests D = 10 cm, which is only true if the waves are perfectly in phase. But without knowing the phase difference, it's not accurate to assume they are always in phase.\n\nOption D suggests 10 cm \u2264 D \u2264 12 cm, which doesn't make sense because if the amplitudes are 4 cm and 6 cm, the maximum resultant amplitude can't be more than 6 cm + 4 cm = 10 cm. So, D can't be 12 cm.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. 2 cm \u2264 D \u2264 10 cm.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider an example. Suppose the two waves are represented by:\n\nWave 1: y1 = 4 sin(kx - \u03c9t)\n\nWave 2: y2 = 6 sin(kx - \u03c9t + \u03c6)\n\nWhere \u03c6 is the phase difference between the two waves.\n\nThe resultant displacement, y = y1 + y2 = 4 sin(kx - \u03c9t) + 6 sin(kx - \u03c9t + \u03c6)\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity for sine addition:\n\nsin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b\n\nSo, y = 4 sin(kx - \u03c9t) + 6 [sin(kx - \u03c9t) cos \u03c6 + cos(kx - \u03c9t) sin \u03c6]\n\ny = [4 + 6 cos \u03c6] sin(kx - \u03c9t) + [6 sin \u03c6] cos(kx - \u03c9t)\n\nThis can be written in the form:\n\ny = A sin(kx - \u03c9t + \u03b4)\n\nWhere A is the resultant amplitude, and \u03b4 is the phase angle.\n\nThe amplitude A can be found using the formula for amplitude in the general sine addition:\n\nA = sqrt[(a)^2 + (b)^2]\n\nWhere a = 4 + 6 cos \u03c6 and b = 6 sin \u03c6\n\nSo, A = sqrt[(4 + 6 cos \u03c6)^2 + (6 sin \u03c6)^2]\n\nExpanding this:\n\nA = sqrt[16 + 48 cos \u03c6 + 36 cos\u00b2\u03c6 + 36 sin\u00b2\u03c6]\n\nUsing the identity sin\u00b2\u03c6 + cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1:\n\nA = sqrt[16 + 48 cos \u03c6 + 36(1)]\n\nA = sqrt[52 + 48 cos \u03c6]\n\nThe minimum value occurs when cos \u03c6 = -1:\n\nA_min = sqrt[52 - 48] = sqrt[4] = 2 cm\n\nThe maximum value occurs when cos \u03c6 = 1:\n\nA_max = sqrt[52 + 48] = sqrt[100] = 10 cm\n\nSo again, this confirms that D ranges from 2 cm to 10 cm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
