                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following molecules is a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water?\" And the options are A. CH3COOH, B. HC2H3O2, C. PCl5, and D. HBr. Okay, first things first, I need to recall what a strong electrolyte is. From my chemistry classes, I remember that an electrolyte is a substance that, when dissolved in water, conducts electricity by producing ions. Strong electrolytes are those that completely dissociate into their ions in solution, whereas weak electrolytes only partially dissociate.\n\nSo, to answer this question, I need to identify which of these substances completely dissociates into ions when dissolved in water.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: CH3COOH. Hmm, that looks familiar. I think it's acetic acid. Let me confirm: CH3COOH is indeed acetic acid, which is a weak acid. I recall that weak acids are weak electrolytes because they don't completely dissociate in water. So, acetic acid only partially dissociates into H+ ions and acetate ions. Therefore, it's not a strong electrolyte.\n\nOption B: HC2H3O2. Wait, this looks similar to acetic acid's formula. Let me see: HC2H3O2 is actually the chemical formula for acetic acid as well. It seems like there might be a typo here, but assuming it's acetic acid, the same reasoning applies as above\u2014it's a weak electrolyte.\n\nOption C: PCl5. This is phosphorus pentachloride. I need to think about how it behaves in water. PCl5 can react with water to form phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid. Phosphoric acid is a weak acid, but hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. However, since PCl5 reacts to form both strong and weak acids, its behavior as an electrolyte might be a bit complex. Maybe I should look it up, but since I don't have external resources, I'll have to think based on what I know. Generally, when PCl5 dissolves in water, it forms H3PO4 and HCl. HCl is a strong acid and completely dissociates, while H3PO4 is a weak acid. So, in solution, there would be a mixture of strong and weak electrolytes. But is PCl5 considered a strong electrolyte overall? I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption D: HBr. This is hydrogen bromide. I know that HBr is a strong acid when dissolved in water. Strong acids are strong electrolytes because they completely dissociate into their ions. So, HBr would dissociate completely into H+ and Br- ions in water, making it a strong electrolyte.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that option D, HBr, is the strong electrolyte among the provided options.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Maybe there's something tricky about PCl5. Let me think again. PCl5 dissolves in water and reacts to form H3PO4 and HCl. H3PO4 is a weak acid, and HCl is a strong acid. So, in the solution, there would be both weak and strong electrolytes. But since HCl is a strong electrolyte and completely dissociates, part of the solution is a strong electrolyte. However, because of the presence of H3PO4, which is a weak electrolyte, the overall solution isn't entirely composed of strong electrolytes. Therefore, perhaps PCl5 isn't considered a strong electrolyte due to the presence of the weak electrolyte H3PO4.\n\nOn the other hand, HBr clearly and completely dissociates into its ions, making it a strong electrolyte.\n\nSo, my final answer would be D. HBr.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
