After the dishwasher had been installed in the buyer's home, it functioned properly for the first month. Then it began to make a loud rattling noise whenever it was in use. The buyer called the appliance store, and a manager there assured her that it was not uncommon for the dishwasher to make such a noise. Moreover, he indicated that the machine's clamorous sound would eventually disappear with continued use. One week later, after a dinner party, the buyer placed her most expensive china set in the dishwasher and turned on the machine. After the dishwasher had been in operation for a few minutes, the buyer heard the rattling noise followed by the sound of breaking china. She immediately stopped the machine. Upon looking inside, she saw that a blade from the dishwasher had broken, destroying her entire china set. If the buyer asserts a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a buyer who purchased a dishwasher, and now there's some issue with it damaging her china set. The question is whether she can successfully claim strict products liability against the appliance company. The options are pretty straightforward, but I need to understand what strict products liability means and how it applies in this situation.\n\nFirst off, strict products liability is a legal doctrine that holds manufacturers liable for defective products that cause injuries or damages, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. So, the buyer doesn't have to prove that the company was careless; she just has to show that the product was defective and caused her harm.\n\nIn this case, the buyer bought a dishwasher that initially worked fine but started making a loud rattling noise after a month. She called the appliance store, and a manager told her that this noise was normal and would go away with time. However, a week later, after a dinner party, she used the dishwasher again and heard the rattling noise, followed by the sound of breaking china. It turned out that a blade had broken and destroyed her entire china set.\n\nSo, the main question is, does this scenario constitute a defective product under strict products liability?\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\n\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\n\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\n\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n\nStarting with option A: Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\n\nWell, strict products liability requires that the product be defective and that the defect caused the injury or damage. In this case, the dishwasher had a blade that broke, which then caused damage to the china set. So, it seems like the dishwasher was indeed defective, and that defect caused damage to the buyer's property.\n\nBut wait, the buyer was aware of the rattling noise before the incident. Does that affect whether the dishwasher is considered defective? The store manager told her that the noise was normal and would go away, so perhaps she reasonably believed that it was safe to continue using the dishwasher.\n\nOption B: Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\n\nHmm, being the purchaser might be relevant, but it's not the primary factor in strict products liability. Usually, anyone who is injured or suffers damage due to a defective product can bring a claim, not just the purchaser. So, while she is the purchaser, that in itself isn't the deciding factor.\n\nOption C: No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\n\nStrict products liability typically covers both personal injuries and property damage. In this case, the dishwasher caused damage to the buyer's china set, which is property damage. So, even though there was no personal injury, strict products liability can still apply if the product caused property damage.\n\nOption D: No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n\nThis seems like a defense based on the idea that the buyer assumed the risk or didn't use the product reasonably after noticing a potential issue.\n\nBut in strict products liability, the focus is on the defectiveness of the product and the causation of damage, not necessarily on the user's behavior. However, the manufacturer might argue that the buyer continued to use the product despite knowing there was an issue, which could be seen as contributory negligence or assumption of risk.\n\nBut in many jurisdictions, contributory negligence doesn't completely bar recovery in strict products liability cases; it might just reduce the damages awarded.\n\nAlso, the buyer was assured by the store manager that the noise was normal and would go away with use. So, she might have reasonably relied on that information and continued to use the dishwasher.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to decide which option is correct.\n\nOption A seems strong because the dishwasher was indeed defective, and that defect caused damage to the buyer's property.\n\nOption B isn't sufficient on its own because being the purchaser isn't the determining factor in strict products liability.\n\nOption C is incorrect because property damage is covered under strict products liability.\n\nOption D suggests that the buyer should have stopped using the dishwasher after hearing the rattling noise, but given that she was told by the store manager that it was normal, she might not be expected to have known that the dishwasher was defective.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option A: Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\n\nBut I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect this.\n\nFor example, was the dishwasher manufactured defectively, or was it damaged during installation or use?\n\nThe problem states that the dishwasher functioned properly for the first month and then started making noise. So, it's possible that the defect developed over time, perhaps due to normal wear and tear, or it could have been a design defect or a manufacturing defect.\n\nHowever, since it's a new appliance and it started malfunctioning shortly after installation, it's reasonable to assume that it was defective from the start or developed a defect early on.\n\nAlso, the buyer called the appliance store, and the manager assured her that the noise was normal. If the store is authorized to make such statements, or if the buyer reasonably relied on that advice, it might further strengthen her claim.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the blade broke and caused damage suggests a clear defect in the dishwasher's design or manufacturing.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the buyer would prevail in a strict products liability claim against the appliance company.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective."
