                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"All of the following are specifically mentioned in the Constitution EXCEPT A. judicial review, B. the national census, C. rules of impeachment, D. the State of the Union address.\" Hmm, okay, I need to recall what's actually in the Constitution and what isn't.\n\nFirst off, the Constitution is the founding document of the United States, right? It outlines the structure of the government and the basic rules for how it operates. So, it should mention the main branches of government and some of their functions.\n\nOption A is judicial review. I remember that judicial review is the power of the courts to declare laws unconstitutional. But is that explicitly mentioned in the Constitution? Let me think. I think the Constitution talks about the Supreme Court having the power to interpret laws, but does it specifically say they can invalidate laws that go against the Constitution? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Maybe it's implied rather than explicitly stated.\n\nOption B is the national census. I'm pretty sure the Constitution does mention the census. It's about counting the population, right? I think it's there to apportion representatives to Congress based on population. So, that should be in the Constitution.\n\nOption C is rules of impeachment. Impeachment is a process to remove officials from office, like the president or other federal officials. I recall that the Constitution outlines the process for impeachment, involving the House of Representatives and the Senate. So, that should be mentioned.\n\nOption D is the State of the Union address. That's the speech the president gives to Congress each year, usually outlining their agenda and the state of the nation. But is that specifically mentioned in the Constitution? I think the Constitution might mention that the president should give occasional addresses to Congress, but does it specifically call it the \"State of the Union\" address? I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look this up. But since I'm supposed to be answering based on what's in the Constitution, let me try to recall.\n\nStarting with judicial review: I think the Constitution doesn't explicitly mention judicial review. It was established by the Supreme Court in the case of Marbury v. Madison in 1803, which interpreted the Constitution to give the courts the power to strike down laws that violate it. So, it's a power derived from the Constitution but not explicitly stated in the text.\n\nThe national census: Yes, the Constitution does require a census to be taken every ten years to determine the number of representatives each state gets in Congress. It's in Article I, Section 2, I believe.\n\nRules of impeachment: Also in the Constitution. The House of Representatives has the power to impeach, and the Senate tries the impeachment. It's outlined in Article I, Sections 2 and 3.\n\nState of the Union address: I think the Constitution requires the president to give \"from time to time\" information of the state of the union to Congress. But the exact term \"State of the Union\" might not be in the Constitution itself; it might have been popularized later, perhaps during Woodrow Wilson's presidency.\n\nSo, based on this, judicial review isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, whereas the census, impeachment, and the State of the Union address are all referenced, at least in some form.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. For instance, the term \"State of the Union\" might not be in the original Constitution, but perhaps it was added later through an amendment or something. Let me see.\n\nI think the phrase \"State of the Union\" first appeared in a presidential address in the 19th century, but the requirement for the president to report to Congress is indeed in the Constitution. However, the exact term might not be there.\n\nOn the other hand, judicial review is a power exercised by the courts based on their interpretive role, but it's not explicitly stated in the Constitution's text.\n\nSo, between these options, A seems to be the one that isn't specifically mentioned in the Constitution.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other option that might not be mentioned.\n\nIs the national census mentioned? Yes, definitely.\n\nImpeachment rules? Yes.\n\nState of the Union address\u2014well, it's required that the president gives information to Congress, but maybe not under that exact name.\n\nJudicial review\u2014no, not explicitly.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. judicial review.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
