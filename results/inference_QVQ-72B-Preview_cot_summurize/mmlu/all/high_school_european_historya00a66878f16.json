                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage. It's about Addison's Act and housing schemes in Britain after World War I. The context is that there was a fear of a revolution similar to Russia's if working-class aspirations weren't met. So, Addison's Act was conceived to address these aspirations, probably by providing housing to the working class to prevent unrest.\n\nBut by 1920, this fear started to fade, and Addison's policy was seen as too expensive. Because of this shift in attitude, the Kingfield Street housing scheme in the Borough was deferred by the Government's Housing Board. Even more, in 1921, the government significantly reduced the housing program, cutting the housing target in half.\n\nSo, the passage is essentially about how the government's approach to housing for the working class changed after World War I, influenced by initial fears of revolution and later by concerns over spending.\n\nNow, the question is asking which attitude prevalent after the First World War is evident in this passage. The options are:\n\nA. Women's suffrage should increase\n\nB. Democratization of society\n\nC. Increased disillusionment and cynicism\n\nD. The rise of communism as a world power\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. Women's suffrage should increase: This relates to women's right to vote. While women's suffrage was a significant issue after World War I, the passage doesn't directly address it. It's about housing schemes and government policies related to preventing revolution, not specifically about women's voting rights.\n\nB. Democratization of society: This suggests making society more democratic, perhaps by giving more people a say in government or in social decisions. The passage mentions addressing working-class aspirations to prevent revolution, which could be seen as an effort to make society more responsive to the needs of its citizens, a aspect of democratization. However, it's more specifically about preventing social unrest than about broad democratic reforms.\n\nC. Increased disillusionment and cynicism: This refers to a general loss of idealism or faith in traditional values and institutions. While this was a common sentiment after World War I, particularly among the so-called \"Lost Generation,\" the passage doesn't directly convey this attitude. It's more about policy changes in response to shifting political fears and economic considerations.\n\nD. The rise of communism as a world power: This is about the spread of communist ideology and systems after the Russian Revolution in 1917. The passage mentions the fear of a revolution similar to Russia's, indicating that communism was a concern in Britain after World War I.\n\nGiven these considerations, option D seems the most directly relevant to the passage. The fear of a Russian-style revolution influenced the conception of Addison's Act, showing that the rise of communism was a significant concern in post-World War I Britain.\n\nHowever, I should think again to make sure I'm not missing something. The passage also talks about the shift in government attitude by 1920, when the fear of revolution was receding, and concerns about expenditure led to the curtailment of housing schemes.\n\nThis shift could be seen as a move away from proactive measures to prevent social unrest, perhaps indicating a decrease in fear of communist influence or a prioritization of financial constraints over social programs.\n\nBut even so, the initial impetus for Addison's Act was the fear of communism-inspired revolution, which aligns with option D.\n\nOption C, increased disillusionment and cynicism, might be indirectly related, as the fear of revolution could stem from disillusioned masses, but the passage doesn't explicitly discuss attitudes of disillusionment or cynicism among the general population.\n\nOption B, democratization of society, could be related insofar as addressing working-class aspirations might be seen as a democratic move, but the passage is more about specific policy responses to prevent revolution than about broader democratic reforms.\n\nOption A, women's suffrage, isn't mentioned or implied in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the attitude most clearly evident in the passage is \"the rise of communism as a world power,\" which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
