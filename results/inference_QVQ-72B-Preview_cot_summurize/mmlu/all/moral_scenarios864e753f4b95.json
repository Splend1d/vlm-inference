                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, someone is expressing an opinion about sending astronauts into space without checking their suits for holes. The statement is, \"I don't think we should send astronauts into space without checking their suits for holes.\" So, this person is saying that it's not okay to send astronauts into space without ensuring their suits are free from holes. It seems like they're advocating for safety measures before sending people into space.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone says, \"I asked a little girl to come over and cuddle.\" Here, the person is admitting to having asked a young child to come over and engage in a physical affectionate act, which is cuddling.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1, the person is expressing a concern for safety in space missions. It's a precautionary measure to make sure astronauts' suits don't have holes before they go into the harsh environment of space. Not checking for holes could potentially endanger the astronauts' lives, as even a small hole in a spacesuit could lead to catastrophic decompression. So, advocating for checking the suits seems like a responsible and morally sound decision. Not doing so would be reckless and could be considered morally wrong because it puts human lives at risk unnecessarily. But since the person is saying we shouldn't send astronauts without checking, they're actually promoting safety. So, their stance seems morally right.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, the action is asking a little girl to come over and cuddle. This involves a child and an adult interacting in a way that involves physical touch and affection. In general, cuddling is a form of physical intimacy that is usually reserved for close relationships, like between family members or romantic partners. When an adult asks a child, especially a young girl, to cuddle, it can be seen as inappropriate because it might cross personal boundaries and could be interpreted as a form of unwanted physical contact or even sexualization of the child.\n\nGiven that, in the US, there is a strong emphasis on respecting children's autonomy and ensuring that adults do not engage in behavior that could be harmful or make children feel uncomfortable, asking a little girl to cuddle could be considered morally wrong. It's important to note that intentions matter here; if the adult had purely innocent intentions, perhaps seeing the child as needing comfort or affection, it might be seen differently. However, without knowing the context or the relationship between the adult and the child, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. But generally speaking, such a request could be seen as inappropriate and potentially morally wrong, especially if it makes the child feel uncomfortable or if there is any suggestion of impropriety.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, in Scenario 1, the person is advocating for safety measures, which seems morally right. In Scenario 2, asking a little girl to come over and cuddle could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential for inappropriate behavior and the importance of respecting children's boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but the question is phrased as \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character do something clearly morally wrong?\" So, in Scenario 1, the person is expressing an opinion, not actually sending astronauts into space without checking their suits. They're saying we shouldn't do it, which is the opposite of doing something wrong; they're advocating for safety. So, in Scenario 1, the main character is not doing anything morally wrong; in fact, they're trying to prevent a morally wrong action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is admitting to asking a little girl to come over and cuddle, which, as I discussed, could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential for inappropriate behavior and the importance of respecting children's boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is expressing an opinion about safety protocols. They're not making a decision to send astronauts without checking; they're just stating what they think should happen. So, their action here is merely expressing an opinion, not performing an action that could be morally evaluated directly. Therefore, it's not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is describing an action they took: asking a little girl to come over and cuddle. As I thought earlier, this could be seen as inappropriate and morally wrong, depending on the context and the relationship between the adult and the child. Without additional context, it's reasonable to consider it as potentially morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Not wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nWait, but the options are labeled as A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to fit.\n\nI think that's the correct assessment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
