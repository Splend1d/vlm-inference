                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following refers to the systematic study of the earth's layers? A. primatology, B. stratigraphy, C. weathering, D. archaeology.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one is about studying the Earth's layers. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst up, primatology. I think primatology is the study of primates, like monkeys and apes, right? So, that's more about biology and animal behavior, not really about the Earth's layers. Maybe I can eliminate that one.\n\nNext is stratigraphy. I've heard this term before, maybe in geography or geology classes. Stratigraphy sounds like it has something to do with layers, because \"strata\" means layers in Latin, I think. So, maybe this is the answer. But I should check the others just to be sure.\n\nWeathering\u2014that sounds familiar too. I remember learning about weathering in science class. It's when rocks break down over time due to exposure to the elements, like wind, water, and temperature changes. So, weathering is more about the process that breaks down rocks, not really about studying the layers of the Earth. Maybe it's not the right choice here.\n\nLastly, archaeology. Archaeology is the study of human history and culture through the excavation of ancient artifacts and sites. While archaeologists might deal with layers of soil and ruins, their primary focus is on understanding past human civilizations, not necessarily studying the Earth's layers in a geological sense.\n\nSo, comparing all four options: primatology is about primates, weathering is about rock breakdown, archaeology is about human history, and stratigraphy seems to be about the layers of the Earth. It looks like stratigraphy is the one that specifically refers to the systematic study of the Earth's layers.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should recall what stratigraphy involves. Stratigraphy is a branch of geology that studies rock layers (strata) and layering processes. It helps in understanding the sequence of geological events and the history of the Earth. So, yeah, that fits perfectly with the description in the question.\n\nI don't think the other options come close to describing the systematic study of the Earth's layers. Primatology is more about biology, weathering is about physical and chemical processes that break down rocks, and archaeology is about human history using material remains.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. stratigraphy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. stratigraphy}} \\]"
