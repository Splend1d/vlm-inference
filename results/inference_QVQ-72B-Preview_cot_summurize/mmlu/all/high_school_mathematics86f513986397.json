                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about planets X, Y, and Z rotating around the sun. They take 360, 450, and 540 days, respectively, to complete one rotation. The question is, if they're all lined up in a straight line with the sun at one point in time, how many days will pass before they're all back in the same positions relative to the sun again?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the planets to be in the exact same locations again. I think it means that each planet should have completed an integer number of rotations so that they end up back in the same positions as they started.\n\nSo, planet X takes 360 days to make one full rotation. That means every 360 days, it's back where it started. Similarly, planet Y takes 450 days, and planet Z takes 540 days.\n\nBut we have three planets, and we need them all to be back in their starting positions at the same time. That sounds like we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods. The LCM would be the smallest number of days that is a multiple of each of the three rotation periods.\n\nSo, I need to find the LCM of 360, 450, and 540.\n\nFirst, let's factor each number into its prime factors.\n\n360: 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1\n\n450: 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^2\n\n540: 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^1\n\nTo find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations.\n\nSo, for 2: max(3,1,2) = 3\n\nFor 3: max(2,2,3) = 3\n\nFor 5: max(1,2,1) = 2\n\nTherefore, LCM = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^2\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n5^2 = 25\n\nNow, multiply them together: 8 * 27 = 216, then 216 * 25.\n\nTo calculate 216 * 25, I can think of it as 216 * 25 = 216 * 25 = (200 * 25) + (16 * 25) = 5000 + 400 = 5400 days.\n\nSo, the LCM is 5400 days.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 5400 is one of them.\n\nBut wait, is there a smaller number of days where they all align?\n\nLet me double-check my understanding. The LCM seems like the right approach because it ensures that all planets have completed an integer number of rotations at that time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nPerhaps considering the angular velocities of the planets.\n\nPlanet X rotates every 360 days, so its angular velocity is 360 degrees per 360 days = 1 degree per day.\n\nWait, no, if it takes 360 days to make one full rotation (360 degrees), then its angular velocity is 360 degrees per 360 days = 1 degree per day.\n\nSimilarly, planet Y takes 450 days for 360 degrees, so its angular velocity is 360/450 = 0.8 degrees per day.\n\nPlanet Z takes 540 days for 360 degrees, so its angular velocity is 360/540 \u2248 0.6667 degrees per day.\n\nNow, if they start aligned, I need to find the time t such that:\n\nPlanet X has rotated an integer number of rotations, planet Y has rotated an integer number of rotations, and planet Z has rotated an integer number of rotations.\n\nThat is:\n\nt * 1 degree per day = 360 * n degrees\n\nt * 0.8 = 360 * m degrees\n\nt * 0.6667 = 360 * p degrees\n\nWhere n, m, and p are integers.\n\nFrom the first equation: t = 360n\n\nFrom the second: t = 360m / 0.8 = 450m\n\nFrom the third: t = 360p / 0.6667 = 540p\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n360n = 450m = 540p\n\nI need to find the smallest t that satisfies this.\n\nThis again points to finding the LCM of 360, 450, and 540.\n\nSo, t = LCM(360, 450, 540) = 5400 days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the pairwise least common multiples.\n\nFirst, find LCM of 360 and 450.\n\n360: 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1\n\n450: 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^2\n\nLCM(360,450) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 8 * 9 * 25 = 1800 days.\n\nThen, LCM of 1800 and 540.\n\n540: 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^1\n\nLCM(1800,540) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^2 = 8 * 27 * 25 = 5400 days.\n\nSo, both methods lead me back to 5400 days.\n\nBut let's see if there's a smaller number of days where they all align.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about alignment in their orbits, meaning they are in the same relative positions, not necessarily having completed integer numbers of rotations.\n\nBut no, the problem says \"in the exact same locations again,\" which I interpret as each planet having completed an integer number of rotations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the synodic period or something similar, but I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 360\n\nB. 5400\n\nC. 900\n\nD. 1200\n\n360 is smaller than the LCM, so that can't be right.\n\n900 is less than the LCM.\n\n1200 is less than the LCM.\n\n5400 matches the LCM, so that seems plausible.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if 900 or 1200 could be possible.\n\nCheck if 900 is a multiple of 360: 900 / 360 = 2.5, not an integer.\n\nSo, planet X wouldn't be back in the same position after 900 days.\n\n1200 divided by 360 is approximately 3.333, not an integer.\n\nSimilarly, 1200 / 450 = 2.666, not an integer.\n\nSo, 1200 days don't work.\n\n5400 divided by 360 = 15, integer.\n\n5400 / 450 = 12, integer.\n\n5400 / 540 = 10, integer.\n\nSo, all planets are back in their starting positions after 5400 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 5400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 5400} \\]"
