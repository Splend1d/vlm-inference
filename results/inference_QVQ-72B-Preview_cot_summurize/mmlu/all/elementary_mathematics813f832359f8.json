                    "text": "Let's see. Carl baked a total of 18 pies last year. He baked 6 pies for his family and p pies for each of the 4 school fund-raisers. I need to find out which number sentence can be used to find the number of pies, p, he baked for each school fund-raiser.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. Carl baked pies for his family and for school fund-raisers. The total pies baked are 18. He baked 6 pies for his family, so the remaining pies must be the ones he baked for the school fund-raisers.\n\nSo, total pies = pies for family + pies for fund-raisers.\n\nGiven that he baked p pies for each of the 4 fund-raisers, the pies for fund-raisers would be 4 times p, right? Because there are 4 fund-raisers.\n\nSo, pies for fund-raisers = 4p.\n\nTherefore, the equation would be:\n\n6 (for family) + 4p (for fund-raisers) = 18 (total pies).\n\nSo, 6 + 4p = 18.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 \u00d7 p \u2013 18 = 4\n\nB. 18 \u2013 6 \u00d7 p = 4\n\nC. 4 + 6 \u00d7 p = 18\n\nD. 6 + 4 \u00d7 p = 18\n\nOption D matches the equation I came up with.\n\nBut let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: 6 \u00d7 p \u2013 18 = 4\n\nThis seems different. It looks like it's multiplying the family pies by p and then subtracting the total pies to equal 4. That doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nOption B: 18 \u2013 6 \u00d7 p = 4\n\nThis seems to subtract the product of 6 and p from the total pies to equal 4. Again, not fitting the scenario.\n\nOption C: 4 + 6 \u00d7 p = 18\n\nThis adds 4 to the product of 6 and p to equal 18. That doesn't align with the total pies being the sum of family pies and fund-raiser pies.\n\nOption D: 6 + 4 \u00d7 p = 18\n\nThis is exactly the equation that represents the total pies as the sum of family pies and fund-raiser pies.\n\nTherefore, the correct number sentence is D: 6 + 4 \u00d7 p = 18.\n\nWait a minute, but in mathematical terms, it's important to use the correct variables and operations.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal pies = 18\n\nPies for family = 6\n\nPies for fund-raisers = p (per fund-raiser) \u00d7 number of fund-raisers = p \u00d7 4 = 4p\n\nSo, total pies = pies for family + pies for fund-raisers = 6 + 4p = 18\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to solve for p in that equation:\n\n6 + 4p = 18\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n4p = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\np = 3\n\nSo, Carl baked 3 pies for each school fund-raiser.\n\nLet me see if this makes sense.\n\nHe baked 6 pies for family and 3 pies for each of the 4 fund-raisers: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nTotal pies: 6 + 12 = 18, which matches the total.\n\nTherefore, the number sentence is indeed 6 + 4 \u00d7 p = 18.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility of misinterpretation?\n\nFor example, does \"p pies for each of the 4 school fund-raisers\" mean something else?\n\nNo, it seems straightforward: p pies per fund-raiser, and there are 4 fund-raisers, so total fund-raiser pies are 4p.\n\nAdding the family pies, which are 6, gives 6 + 4p = 18.\n\nYes, that's the correct equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 6 + 4 \u00d7 p = 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
