                    "text": "So I have this problem here about vector spaces and their intersections. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nWe have a 7-dimensional vector space X, and inside it, there are two subspaces, V and W, each of dimension 4. The question is asking which of the given dimensions\u20140, 1, 2, or 3\u2014cannot be the dimension of the intersection of V and W.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula that relates the dimensions of two subspaces and their intersection. I think it's something like the dimension of the sum of two subspaces plus the dimension of their intersection equals the sum of their individual dimensions. Or something along those lines.\n\nLet me look this up in my linear algebra notes. Ah, here it is: the dimension theorem, also known as the dimension formula, which states that for any two subspaces U and W of a vector space V:\n\ndim(U + W) = dim(U) + dim(W) - dim(U \u2229 W)\n\nWhere U + W is the subspace spanned by the union of U and W.\n\nIn this problem, U and W are V and W, both of dimension 4, and the ambient space X is 7-dimensional. So, dim(V) = dim(W) = 4, and dim(X) = 7.\n\nNow, V and W are subspaces of X, so their sum V + W is also a subspace of X, and its dimension can't exceed 7.\n\nUsing the dimension formula:\n\ndim(V + W) = dim(V) + dim(W) - dim(V \u2229 W)\n\nPlugging in the known dimensions:\n\ndim(V + W) = 4 + 4 - dim(V \u2229 W) = 8 - dim(V \u2229 W)\n\nBut since V + W is a subspace of X, its dimension can't be more than 7. So:\n\n8 - dim(V \u2229 W) \u2264 7\n\nWhich implies:\n\ndim(V \u2229 W) \u2265 8 - 7 = 1\n\nTherefore, the dimension of V \u2229 W must be at least 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1\n\nC. 2\n\nD. 3\n\nSince dim(V \u2229 W) must be at least 1, it cannot be 0.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure that dimensions 1, 2, and 3 are possible.\n\nIs it possible for V \u2229 W to have dimension 1? Yeah, that seems plausible.\n\nWhat about dimension 2? Should be possible as well.\n\nAnd dimension 3? Yeah, that should be okay too.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking which of the following cannot be the dimension of V \u2229 W. So based on my earlier reasoning, it's 0, since dim(V \u2229 W) \u2265 1.\n\nBut let me double-check if dimensions 1, 2, and 3 are possible.\n\nConsider the extreme case where V and W are equal. Then V \u2229 W = V = W, and dim(V \u2229 W) = 4.\n\nBut that's not among the options, which makes sense because 4 is not listed.\n\nWhat if V and W are as independent as possible? Well, their sum V + W could be of dimension up to 7, but since X is 7-dimensional, V + W can be X itself if they span the whole space.\n\nIn that case, dim(V + W) = 7, so plugging into the formula:\n\n7 = 4 + 4 - dim(V \u2229 W)\n\n7 = 8 - dim(V \u2229 W)\n\ndim(V \u2229 W) = 1\n\nSo, yes, dim(V \u2229 W) can be 1.\n\nCan it be 2? Let's see.\n\nSuppose dim(V \u2229 W) = 2. Then dim(V + W) = 4 + 4 - 2 = 6\n\nSince 6 \u2264 7, that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, dim(V \u2229 W) = 3 would give dim(V + W) = 4 + 4 - 3 = 5, which is also \u2264 7.\n\nSo, dimensions 1, 2, and 3 are all possible.\n\nTherefore, the only impossible dimension among the options is 0.\n\nJust to be thorough, what if V and W have trivial intersection, i.e., {0}? Would that be possible?\n\nWell, in general, it's possible for two subspaces to have only the zero vector in common, but in this specific case, with both being 4-dimensional in a 7-dimensional space, the dimension formula tells us that their intersection must have at least dimension 1.\n\nSo, no, dim(V \u2229 W) cannot be 0.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0} \\]"
