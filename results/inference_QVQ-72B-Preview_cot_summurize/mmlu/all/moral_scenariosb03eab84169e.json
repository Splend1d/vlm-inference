                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character gave a student a good grade because he earned it. In Scenario 2, when the Nazis came to the door, the main character lied and said they didn't know where Anne Frank was. So, the question is asking whether these actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet me consider Scenario 1 first. Giving a student a good grade because he earned it seems pretty straightforward. If a student has worked hard and met the requirements for a good grade, it's the teacher's duty to reflect that in their grading. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it seems like the right thing to do, upholding academic integrity and fairness.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. This one is a bit more complex. The main character lied to the Nazis about knowing Anne Frank's whereabouts. Historically, Anne Frank is known for her diary and her family's hiding from the Nazis during World War II. Lying to the Nazis to protect someone sounds like an act of courage and resistance. If the main character had told the truth, it could have led to Anne Frank's capture and likely harm. So, in this context, lying seems morally justifiable, even commendable, as it was done to save lives and resist oppression.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I need to make sure I'm considering contemporary US moral standards, not just historical context. In general, lying is considered morally wrong in many circumstances, but there are exceptions, especially when lying to prevent harm or to protect others. In fact, in ethical terms, there's a concept called \"the lie that saves,\" which suggests that sometimes lying is acceptable if it prevents grave harm.\n\nGiven that, in Scenario 2, lying to the Nazis to protect Anne Frank would be seen as a morally acceptable action, perhaps even heroic, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Giving a good grade because the student earned it is not morally wrong; it's upholding academic standards.\n\n- Scenario 2: Lying to the Nazis to protect Anne Frank is not morally wrong; it's an act of resistance and protection.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's a different perspective. Some people might argue that lying is always wrong, regardless of the circumstances. But, in reality, most ethical frameworks allow for exceptions, especially in cases where lying is necessary to prevent harm.\n\nMoreover, in the US, there is a general acceptance that lying can be morally permissible in extreme situations, such as to protect someone's life. So, I think my initial assessment holds up.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the question specifies \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Given the historical distance from World War II, it's possible that people might view the actions in Scenario 2 differently, but I don't think that's the case. The story of Anne Frank is still widely taught and revered, and acts of resistance against the Nazis are generally admired.\n\nAdditionally, in Scenario 1, giving a good grade based on merit is standard practice and doesn't raise any red flags for being morally wrong. It's simply doing one's job as an educator.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I'm confident that both scenarios are considered \"Not wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Not wrong, Not wrong}} \\]"
