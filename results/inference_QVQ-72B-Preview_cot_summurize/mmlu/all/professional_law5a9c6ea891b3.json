                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a police search and an arrest, and now there's a motion to suppress evidence of cocaine found during that search. I need to figure out whether the court should grant that motion. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the police had probable cause to believe that this man was involved in armed bank robberies with an accomplice. They obtained a valid arrest warrant for him and went to his house to arrest him. When they got there, the front door was open, and they could hear a radio playing inside. They knocked on the door, identified themselves as police officers, and announced that they had a warrant. There was no response, so they entered the house.\n\nAfter entering, they called out the man's name several times and again identified themselves as police officers. Eventually, the man emerged from the basement and was arrested. Then, the officers went into the basement to look for the accomplice. While searching for the accomplice, they opened a closet door and found cocaine in plain view. They didn't find the accomplice, but they did find the cocaine.\n\nNow, the man has been indicted for cocaine possession and is trying to suppress the cocaine as evidence, claiming it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. I need to decide whether the court should grant that motion.\n\nOption A says no, because the officers discovered the cocaine during a lawful protective sweep of the house looking for the man's accomplice. Hmm, a protective sweep is something I've heard of, usually in the context of ensuring officer safety during an arrest. I think it's allowed under certain circumstances to ensure that there are no hidden threats or dangers.\n\nBut in this case, they were looking for the accomplice, not necessarily for safety reasons, but because they believed the accomplice might be there. Is that the same thing? Maybe not entirely. I need to think about whether the search for the accomplice falls under the protective sweep doctrine or if it's something else.\n\nOption B says no, because the search was incident to the man's arrest. I know that when someone is arrested, the police can search them and the area within their immediate control without a warrant. But in this case, the cocaine was found in a closet in the basement, which might not be considered within the arrestee's immediate control, especially if he was already in custody when the closet was searched.\n\nSo, maybe searching incident to arrest doesn't cover the closet in the basement. Unless, perhaps, they had reason to believe that the man could access that area even after being arrested, but that seems unlikely.\n\nOption C says yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant. This seems like a straightforward point. They had an arrest warrant, but not a search warrant. Generally, searches require a warrant unless there's an exception that applies.\n\nIn this scenario, the arrest warrant allowed them to enter the house to arrest the man, but it doesn't automatically give them the right to search the entire house for other things unless certain exceptions apply, like plain view or exigent circumstances.\n\nOption D says yes, because the officers did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet. This relates to whether they had a valid reason to search the closet specifically for cocaine.\n\nBut wait, they weren't searching the closet for cocaine; they were searching for the accomplice and just happened to find the cocaine in plain view. So, perhaps they didn't need probable cause to search for cocaine specifically, as long as they had a valid reason to be in the closet looking for the accomplice.\n\nBut did they have a valid reason to search for the accomplice? That brings me back to the protective sweep idea.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. When the police have an arrest warrant and go to execute it, they can enter the house to arrest the suspect. In the process, they can conduct a limited protective sweep to ensure their safety, meaning they can check areas where someone might be hiding who could pose a danger.\n\nHowever, in this case, they were specifically looking for the accomplice, not just checking for safety reasons. Does that change things?\n\nMaybe not entirely. If they had reasonable suspicion that the accomplice was in the house, they might be able to search for him. But I'm not sure if that extends to searching a closet in the basement.\n\nAlso, once they arrested the man, their primary reason for entering the house was fulfilled. They had the man in custody, so the need for a protective sweep might no longer be present unless they had reason to believe that the accomplice was still in the house and could pose a danger.\n\nWait, but they went into the basement specifically to look for the accomplice after arresting the man. So, was that still part of the arrest operation, or was it a separate search?\n\nI think it's important to consider whether the search for the accomplice was reasonably related to the arrest and ensuring officer safety, or if it was a separate investigative step that required its own justification, like a search warrant.\n\nIf it was part of a protective sweep incident to the arrest for officer safety, then finding the cocaine in plain view during that sweep might be permissible. However, if the search for the accomplice was more extensive than what's allowed for a protective sweep, then the cocaine might have been found in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the plain view doctrine. If the officers were lawfully present in the basement and the closet, and the cocaine was in plain view, then they can seize it without a warrant. But the key here is whether they were lawfully present in the closet.\n\nThey entered the house lawfully with an arrest warrant, and when they called out and the man emerged from the basement, they arrested him. Then, they went into the basement to look for the accomplice.\n\nWas entering the basement and opening the closet reasonable under the circumstances?\n\nIf they had reasonable suspicion that the accomplice was hiding in the basement, perhaps they could enter the basement as part of the arrest operation to secure the scene and ensure there were no additional dangers.\n\nHowever, opening the closet might be a step further. Was it necessary for officer safety, or was it more of an investigative act to find evidence?\n\nI think it's a close call. On one hand, if they had reasonable suspicion that the accomplice was in the basement and could pose a danger, they might be justified in checking areas where someone could be hiding, like a closet.\n\nOn the other hand, once they determined that there was no one in the basement, perhaps the search should have stopped there, and opening the closet was beyond what was necessary for officer safety.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's not entirely clear whether they had reasonable suspicion that the accomplice was in the basement or just somewhere in the house.\n\nWait, the problem says that they had probable cause to believe that the man had committed bank robberies with an accomplice. Does that necessarily mean that the accomplice was present in the house? Probably not, unless there's specific information suggesting that.\n\nIf there's no specific information suggesting that the accomplice was in the house, then searching for him might not be justified beyond a limited protective sweep incident to the arrest.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the officers were only justified in conducting a limited search for their safety during the arrest, not an extensive search of the house for the accomplice.\n\nIf that's the case, then entering the basement and opening the closet might have been beyond what's allowed for a protective sweep, making the discovery of the cocaine unlawful.\n\nHowever, maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps the search for the accomplice was part of the arrest operation, given that the accomplice was involved in the same crimes and might have been a flight risk or a danger to the officers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the officers had a separate basis for believing that the accomplice was in the house, which would justify a more extensive search.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any such basis. It just says they had probable cause to believe the man had committed bank robberies with an accomplice, but doesn't say anything about where the accomplice was.\n\nGiven that, I think the search of the basement and the closet was not sufficiently justified to allow the cocaine to be admissible evidence.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the court should grant the motion to suppress.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another angle I'm missing.\n\nCould the search be justified under the plain view doctrine alone? Well, the plain view doctrine allows officers to seize evidence without a warrant if they are already lawfully present in the place where the evidence is found and the evidence is immediately apparent as contraband or evidence of a crime.\n\nIn this case, the officers were in the basement looking for the accomplice and opened the closet, where they saw the cocaine. If their presence in the basement and the closet was lawful, then the seizure would be valid under plain view.\n\nHowever, the question is whether their presence in the basement and the closet was lawful. As I thought earlier, if the search for the accomplice was not justified, then their presence there was not lawful, and thus the plain view doctrine doesn't apply.\n\nSo, it comes down to whether the search for the accomplice was justified under the circumstances.\n\nGiven that they had an arrest warrant for the man and probable cause to believe he had committed crimes with an accomplice, but no specific information that the accomplice was in the house, I don't think the search for the accomplice was justified beyond a limited protective sweep for officer safety.\n\nTherefore, I still lean towards granting the motion to suppress.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. No, because the officers discovered the cocaine during a lawful protective sweep looking for the man's accomplice.\n\nI don't think this was a lawful protective sweep beyond what's necessary for officer safety during the arrest. Searching for the accomplice may have been beyond that scope.\n\nB. No, because the search was incident to the man's arrest.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, searching incident to arrest is limited to the arrestee and the area within their immediate control. The closet in the basement likely isn't within the man's immediate control once he's been arrested.\n\nC. Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.\n\nThis seems like a strong argument. They had an arrest warrant, not a search warrant, and the search wasn't justified under any recognized exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nD. Yes, because the officers did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet.\n\nThis is related to whether they had a valid basis for searching the closet specifically for cocaine, but as I thought, they were searching for the accomplice and just happened to find the cocaine.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best answer is C: Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.\n\nBut wait, option A also suggests that the search was lawful as a protective sweep, but I don't think that holds up based on my earlier analysis.\n\nOption B is unlikely because searching incident to arrest doesn't cover the entire house or areas not within the arrestee's immediate control.\n\nOption D is somewhat related, but the main issue is the lack of a search warrant, not the absence of probable cause for cocaine specifically.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct choice is C: Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
