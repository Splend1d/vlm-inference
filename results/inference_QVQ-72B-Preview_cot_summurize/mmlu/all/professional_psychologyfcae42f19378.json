                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Dr. Lykowski should do in this situation. He's been seeing a therapy client for three sessions, and now he's feeling hostile towards her because she reminds him of his wife, who he's currently divorcing. That sounds really tricky. I need to think about the best course of action for him.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what's going on here. Dr. Lykowski is experiencing feelings towards his client that are influenced by his own personal experiences and emotions, specifically his feelings about his wife. I think this is called countertransference. It's when a therapist's emotions interfere with their professional relationship with a client.\n\nSo, countertransference is kind of like the therapist projecting their own stuff onto the client. It's important because it can affect the therapy process and potentially harm the client if not handled properly.\n\nNow, Dr. Lykowski has realized this. He's aware that his feelings are due to countertransference. That's a good start because awareness is key in therapy. But now he needs to decide what to do next.\n\nOption A is to refer the client to another therapist without telling the client the reason for the referral. Hmm, that seems a bit abrupt. The client might feel confused or upset if they're suddenly told to see someone else without an explanation. Transparency is important in therapy, and trust is a big part of the therapeutic relationship. Not telling the client why could damage that trust.\n\nOption B suggests referring the client to another therapist but discussing the reason with her. This seems better than option A because it involves communication. If Dr. Lykowski explains that his personal situation is affecting his ability to be objective and helpful, the client might understand and appreciate his honesty. However, I wonder if discussing his personal issues with the client is appropriate. Boundaries are important in therapy, and sharing too much personal information could be crossing a line.\n\nOption C says he should recognize that his feelings are due to countertransference and continue to work with the client. This could be acceptable if Dr. Lykowski is able to manage his countertransference effectively. But that's a big if. If he doesn't handle it well, it could lead to problems in the therapy sessions. For example, his hostility could come across in subtle ways, making the client feel uncomfortable or defensive.\n\nOption D is to consult with another psychologist to determine whether or not to continue seeing the client in therapy. This seems like a really responsible approach. Seeking supervision or consultation from a colleague can provide an objective perspective and help Dr. Lykowski navigate his feelings and the situation more effectively. It shows that he's prioritizing the client's well-being and recognizing his own limitations.\n\nLet me think more deeply about option D. If he consults with another psychologist, they could help him understand how his countertransference is impacting the therapy and offer strategies to manage it. Maybe he could continue seeing the client with some adjustments, or perhaps it's best to refer her out. The consultant could help him make that decision.\n\nComparing option B and option D, I think option D is better because it involves getting professional input before making a decision. Discussing the reason with the client without first seeking guidance could be premature and might not be in the client's best interest.\n\nOption A, referring without explanation, seems like the least favorable choice because it lacks transparency and could harm the therapeutic alliance.\n\nOption C, continuing to work with the client while recognizing the countertransference, might be feasible if Dr. Lykowski has a strong support system and is experienced in managing countertransference. However, given that he's going through a divorce and seems to be struggling with strong emotions, it might be too much for him to handle on his own.\n\nOverall, I think option D is the best course of action. Consulting with another psychologist will allow Dr. Lykowski to get a professional opinion on how to proceed, ensuring that the client's needs are being prioritized and that he's handling his own emotions appropriately.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider some possible drawbacks of option D. One potential issue is that consulting another psychologist might take time, and in the meantime, Dr. Lykowski still has to see the client. If his hostility is already affecting the sessions, waiting for consultation could be problematic. However, he could take steps to minimize the impact of his feelings in the interim, such as being extra mindful of his reactions and avoiding any confrontational or negative interactions.\n\nAnother consideration is that the consultant might not be immediately available, or Dr. Lykowski might not feel comfortable sharing his personal situation with a colleague. But these are logistical issues that can be managed, and they don't outweigh the importance of seeking professional guidance in this situation.\n\nIn summary, I believe that Dr. Lykowski's best course of action is to consult with another psychologist to determine whether or not to continue seeing the client in therapy. This approach ensures that he's making an informed decision that prioritizes both his own well-being and that of his client.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
