                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about the 1960s 'Batman' TV series. It asks who was not a guest villain, and the options are The Minstrel, The Archer, The Bookworm, and The Squeegee Guy. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the guest villains in that series, but I'll try to work this out.\n\nFirst off, I know that the 1960s 'Batman' show was known for its campy style and featured a lot of guest stars playing villains. Some of the more famous ones were The Joker, The Penguin, The Riddler, and Catwoman, but those aren't listed here. So, this question is about some lesser-known or maybe more obscure villains from the series.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with The Minstrel. I have a vague recollection of a character called The Minstrel appearing in the show. I think he was a villain who used musical instruments or something like that to commit crimes. If I remember correctly, he was played by an actor named Henry Darrow. So, that seems to be a real guest villain.\n\nNext is The Archer. Hmm, I'm not as sure about this one. I know that archers can be cool villains, like Green Arrow in DC Comics, but I don't recall The Archer being a specific villain in the 'Batman' series. Maybe he's from another show or comic book series. Perhaps he wasn't a guest villain in this particular show.\n\nThen there's The Bookworm. This one sounds familiar. I think The Bookworm was a villain who loved books and used them in his crimes. I believe he was played by an actor named George Dzundza. Again, that seems to be a correct guest villain from the show.\n\nLastly, there's The Squeegee Guy. This one sounds a bit odd. I'm not sure if this was actually a villain in the 'Batman' series. A squeegee is like a tool used for cleaning windows, right? So, maybe a villain who cleans windows or something? That seems a bit far-fetched for a 'Batman' villain, but maybe the show was that creative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reference to a different show or a made-up name.\n\nGiven that I recall The Minstrel and The Bookworm being actual villains in the 'Batman' series, and I'm unsure about The Archer and The Squeegee Guy, I need to do a bit more thinking.\n\nLet me consider the possibilities:\n\n- If The Minstrel and The Bookworm were both in the show, and The Archer and The Squeegee Guy were not, then the answer would be D. The Squeegee Guy.\n\n- Alternatively, maybe only one of them wasn't in the show, and I need to figure out which one.\n\nI think the best approach is to eliminate the ones I know were in the show and see which one is left.\n\nSo, The Minstrel \u2013 definitely in the show.\n\nThe Bookworm \u2013 also in the show.\n\nThe Archer \u2013 I'm not sure, but maybe he was in another show or comic.\n\nThe Squeegee Guy \u2013 sounds made up, but maybe the show had such a character.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think about the names. The Minstrel, The Archer, and The Bookworm all have a certain thematic ring to them, suggesting they're part of the same universe. The Squeegee Guy sounds more like a janitor or window cleaner and doesn't fit as well with the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps The Archer was a villain in a different superhero show from the same era, like 'The Green Hornet', which was also produced by the same company, 20th Century Fox.\n\nBut no, 'The Green Hornet' had its own set of villains, like Kato and others, but I don't remember The Archer being part of that series.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that The Archer could be a different character named The Archer who appeared in 'Batman', but I'm still not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps The Archer was a villain in another comic book series, like Archie Comics or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me try another angle. Maybe I can recall specific episodes where these villains appeared.\n\nFor The Minstrel, I think there was an episode where he used music to control people or something like that.\n\nFor The Bookworm, I recall an episode where he stole valuable books and used his knowledge to outsmart Batman and Robin.\n\nAs for The Archer, I'm drawing a blank. I can't remember any specific episode featuring a villain called The Archer.\n\nSimilarly, The Squeegee Guy seems even less familiar. It just doesn't ring a bell in the context of the 'Batman' series.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that The Squeegee Guy was a one-time villain or maybe a reference to a real-life person or another media franchise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a reference to a character from the comics, but not the TV show.\n\nGiven that, I think the most plausible answer is that The Squeegee Guy was not a guest villain in the 1960s 'Batman' TV series.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. The Squeegee Guy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
