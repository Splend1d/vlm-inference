                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this problem here. Charlotte recorded the heights of all 28 students in her class and did some statistical analysis. But she made a mistake with the tallest student's height\u2014she needs to add two inches to correct it. Now, the question is asking which measure of spread won't change because of this correction.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Mean absolute deviation\n\nB. Standard deviation\n\nC. Variance\n\nD. Interquartile range\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these measures represents and how they might be affected by changing just one value in the dataset.\n\nLet's start by recalling what each measure is:\n\n1. **Mean absolute deviation (MAD):** This is the average of the absolute differences between each data point and the mean. It gives us an idea of the average distance of each data point from the mean.\n\n2. **Standard deviation:** This is the square root of the variance. It measures the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.\n\n3. **Variance:** This is the average of the squared differences from the mean. It's another measure of how spread out the data is.\n\n4. **Interquartile range (IQR):** This is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile). It tells us about the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n\nNow, the problem is that Charlotte has to add two inches to the tallest student's height. Since this is the tallest height, it's likely an outlier or at least an extreme value in the dataset.\n\nI need to think about how this change affects each of these measures.\n\n**Starting with the mean:**\n\nBefore correction, the mean height is calculated using all 28 heights, including the incorrect tallest height.\n\nAfter correction, the tallest height increases by two inches, so the total sum of heights increases by two inches. Therefore, the new mean will be slightly higher than the old mean.\n\nSince the mean is changing, any measure that depends directly on the mean might also change.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- MAD, standard deviation, and variance all depend directly on the mean.\n\n- IQR is based on quartiles, which are positional measures and may not be directly affected by changes in the mean.\n\nSo, perhaps the IQR is a candidate to remain unchanged.\n\nBut let's think deeper.\n\n**Mean absolute deviation (MAD):**\n\nMAD is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between each data point and the mean.\n\nSince the mean is changing when we correct the tallest height, the differences between each data point and the new mean will change accordingly.\n\nEven though only one height is being corrected, the mean shifts, which affects all the absolute differences.\n\nTherefore, MAD is likely to change.\n\n**Standard deviation and variance:**\n\nSimilar to MAD, both standard deviation and variance are based on the differences from the mean.\n\nVariance is the average of the squared differences from the mean, and standard deviation is the square root of variance.\n\nSince the mean is changing, the squared differences for all data points will be affected, leading to a change in variance and standard deviation.\n\nSo, these are probably going to change as well.\n\n**Interquartile range (IQR):**\n\nIQR is based on the first and third quartiles, which are measures of position.\n\nQuartiles divide the data into quarters, so Q1 is the median of the lower half, and Q3 is the median of the upper half.\n\nSince the data set has 28 students, the positions of Q1 and Q3 would typically be at specific positions in the ordered data set.\n\nWhen we increase the tallest height by two inches, which is the highest value, it might affect the overall ordering slightly, but only in the upper tail of the distribution.\n\nHowever, since quartiles are based on the positions in the ordered data, and especially since Q1 and Q3 are based on the lower and middle parts of the data, a change in the single highest value might not necessarily affect these positions.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nSuppose the data are ordered from smallest to largest: \\( x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq x_{28} \\).\n\nThe positions for quartiles are:\n\n- Q1 is at position \\( (28 + 1) \\times 0.25 = 7.25 \\), so it's the average of the 7th and 8th values.\n\n- Q3 is at position \\( (28 + 1) \\times 0.75 = 21.75 \\), so it's the average of the 21st and 22nd values.\n\nWhen we increase \\( x_{28} \\) by two inches, it's still the largest value, so the ordering of the first 27 values remains the same.\n\nTherefore, Q1, which is based on the first 7 or 8 values, and Q3, based on the 21st and 22nd values, should remain unchanged.\n\nHence, the IQR, which is Q3 - Q1, should also remain the same.\n\nSo, among the given options, the interquartile range is the measure that must remain unchanged after correcting the tallest student's height.\n\n**Final answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Interquartile range}} \\]"
