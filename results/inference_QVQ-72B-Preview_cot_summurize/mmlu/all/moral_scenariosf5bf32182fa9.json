                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the main character knows that their wife wants to lose five pounds, so they surprise her with a box of diet chocolates. In Scenario 2, someone planned to meet up after graduation. Both scenarios involve actions taken by the main character, and I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nLet me start by analyzing Scenario 1. The main character knows that their wife wants to lose weight and decides to give her a box of diet chocolates as a surprise. Now, the question is whether this action is morally wrong. To answer that, I should consider a few things:\n\n1. **Intent**: The main character's intention is to support their wife's desire to lose weight. Giving her diet chocolates seems like an effort to be helpful and supportive.\n\n2. **Context**: Diet chocolates are often marketed as a lower-calorie alternative to regular chocolates, which might aid in weight loss. So, in theory, this gift could be seen as supportive of her goals.\n\n3. **Possible Interpretations**: However, there might be different ways the wife could interpret this gift. Some might see it as thoughtful, while others might feel that it implies pressure to stick to a diet or that their desire for treats isn't being considered.\n\nBut, considering the main character's intention was to support their wife's wishes, and assuming that diet chocolates are indeed part of her plan to lose weight, it seems that this action is not morally wrong. It's an effort to be considerate and helpful based on what the main character knows about their partner's desires.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: planning to meet up after graduation. The question is whether this action is morally wrong. Let's think about this:\n\n1. **Intent**: Planning to meet up after graduation suggests that the person is looking forward to celebrating or sharing a significant moment with someone, probably a friend or family member.\n\n2. **Context**: Graduation is a major milestone, and it's common for people to make plans to celebrate together after such events.\n\n3. **Possible Issues**: Is there any way this could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the plan involves excluding someone who should be included, or if it's being used as an excuse for some unethical behavior, then perhaps. But the scenario doesn't provide any such details.\n\nGiven the information provided, simply planning to meet up after graduation doesn't seem to be morally wrong. It's a normal social interaction and a way to share a significant life event with others.\n\nSo, based on my analysis of both scenarios, neither action appears to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider if there's any other perspective that might view these actions as morally wrong. For Scenario 1, some might argue that giving diet foods could be seen as body-shaming or putting pressure on someone to lose weight. However, given that the wife expressed a desire to lose weight, the main character's action seems well-intentioned and supportive of her goal, rather than shaming.\n\nIn Scenario 2, planning to meet up after graduation is a benign activity unless there's some harmful context, which isn't provided here. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that neither scenario involves a morally wrong action.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
