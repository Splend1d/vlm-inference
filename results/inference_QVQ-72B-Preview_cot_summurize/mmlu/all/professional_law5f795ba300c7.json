No, because intoxication is never a defense to the commission of a felony.\nC. No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\nD.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a burglary case where two guys, after drinking in a bar, decide to break into a house that's dark and take some jewelry. They get caught, and the passenger is trying to use intoxication as a defense, saying he was too drunk to form the specific intent needed for burglary. I need to figure out which option is correct based on the facts provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what burglary is. From what I recall, burglary involves entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a felony inside. So, in this case, they broke into a house and took jewelry, which is theft, a felony. The key part here is that they had the intent to commit that felony when they entered the home.\n\nNow, the passenger is claiming that he was too intoxicated to form that specific intent. I need to think about how intoxication affects criminal responsibility, especially in the context of specific intent crimes like burglary.\n\nI remember that in criminal law, intoxication can sometimes be used as a defense if it prevents the defendant from forming the necessary mental state, or mens rea, required for the crime. However, this isn't always the case, and it depends on the jurisdiction and the type of crime.\n\nIn some places, voluntary intoxication isn't a valid defense for general intent crimes, but it might be considered for specific intent crimes. Burglary is often considered a specific intent crime because it requires the additional intent to commit a felony upon entry.\n\nSo, in this scenario, if the passenger was so intoxicated that he couldn't form the specific intent to commit a felony inside the house, then maybe the defense could succeed.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says that they were feeling drunk and aggressive from the drinks and discussed breaking into the house. They thought it was a safe bet because the lights were out. This suggests that they had some level of planning and awareness of what they were doing, even if they were intoxicated.\n\nMoreover, the fact that they pulled over, discussed it, and decided to go through with it indicates that they weren't completely incapacitated by their intoxication. They were able to make a decision, however impaired their judgment might have been.\n\nI think this is important because it shows that despite being intoxicated, they still had the capacity to form the intent to enter the house and steal something.\n\nLet me consider the legal perspective. In many legal systems, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense to specific intent crimes unless it negates the required mental state. However, if the intoxication was involuntary, like if someone was drugged without their knowledge, that might be different.\n\nIn this case, it's clear that the intoxication was voluntary since they were drinking in a bar. So, that might work against the passenger's defense.\n\nAlso, the fact that they had a discussion and made a decision to break in suggests that they had some level of rational thought, even if their inhibitions were lowered by alcohol.\n\nAnother point to consider is that intoxication might affect the credibility of the defendant's claim about their state of mind. If the passenger is claiming he didn't have the specific intent because he was too drunk, but his actions suggest otherwise, the jury might not believe him.\n\nFurthermore, in some jurisdictions, the law presumes that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of their actions, regardless of their state of intoxication.\n\nSo, if breaking into a house while intoxicated leads to the commission of a felony, the law might impute the intent to the defendant.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should consider the options provided.\n\nOption A says \"Yes, because he was in fact too intoxicated to form the intent needed to prove burglary.\"\n\nBut based on the facts, it seems like he was able to form that intent. He discussed it with his friend, decided it was safe, and went through with it. So, this doesn't seem to align with the scenario.\n\nOption B says \"No, because intoxication is never a defense to the commission of a felony.\"\n\nThis is a bit too broad. Intoxication can sometimes be a defense in specific circumstances, especially for specific intent crimes. So, this seems overly categorical and probably incorrect.\n\nOption C says \"No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\"\n\nThis seems to align with my earlier thoughts. The fact that he was able to discuss and decide to break in suggests that he had the capacity to form the specific intent required for burglary.\n\nOption D says \"Yes, because the feeling of being drunk and aggressive were not his natural mental state and therefore mens rea was defeated.\"\n\nThis seems to suggest that because his intoxication altered his mental state, he couldn't form the required intent. However, as I thought earlier, his actions indicate that he was able to form the intent despite being intoxicated.\n\nSo, based on the facts provided and my understanding of intoxication as a defense, I think Option C is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nSuppose that in this particular jurisdiction, intoxication can be used as a defense to specific intent crimes if the defendant can prove that it prevented them from forming the specific intent.\n\nIn that case, the passenger would need to provide evidence or testimony that his intoxication was so severe that he couldn't possibly have formed the intent to commit a felony upon entering the house.\n\nHowever, given that he was able to discuss the plan and agree to it, it's hard to see how he could argue that he lacked the capacity to form such an intent.\n\nAdditionally, if the prosecution can show that he had the capacity to form the intent, perhaps through his actions or statements, that would undermine his defense.\n\nMoreover, in many legal systems, the burden of proof for the defense is quite high when claiming intoxication as a defense. The defendant would need to prove, usually by a preponderance of evidence, that his intoxication was so severe that it negated the specific intent.\n\nGiven that, and considering the facts that he was able to make a decision to break in, it seems unlikely that his defense would prevail.\n\nAnother angle to consider is that even if he was intoxicated, if he had the intent before becoming intoxicated or if the intoxication didn't affect his ability to form the intent, the defense wouldn't hold up.\n\nBut in this scenario, the intent seems to have been formed while he was intoxicated, after drinking in the bar.\n\nStill, his ability to discuss and decide to break in suggests that he had some level of cognitive function intact, including the ability to form the specific intent.\n\nI should also consider whether there's any possibility that his intoxication could be considered involuntary, but given that he was drinking in a bar, it's clearly voluntary intoxication.\n\nIn summary, based on the facts presented, it appears that the passenger was not so intoxicated that he couldn't form the specific intent required for burglary. Therefore, his intoxication defense is unlikely to succeed at trial.\n\nSo, the correct answer is Option C: No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
