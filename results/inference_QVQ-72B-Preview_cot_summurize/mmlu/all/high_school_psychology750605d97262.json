He found that college juniors who work part-time (15 hours a week) have higher grades compared to those who don't work or work full-time. The question is, which research method did he use?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Experimental\n\nIn experimental research, the researcher manipulates one variable to see its effect on another variable. There's usually a control group and an experimental group. In this scenario, Adeel didn't manipulate the variables; he just collected data on existing conditions. So, this doesn't seem like an experimental study.\n\nB. Naturalistic Observation\n\nThis involves observing subjects in their natural environment without any interference. Adeel collected data from participants, but it's not clear if he observed them directly in their natural settings or if he gathered information through surveys or other means. Maybe this could be a possibility, but let's consider the other options.\n\nC. Case Study\n\nA case study is an in-depth analysis of a particular individual or a small group. Given that Adeel collected data from 2,000 participants, this seems too large a sample size for a case study, which typically focuses on a single case or a few cases in detail.\n\nD. Survey\n\nA survey involves collecting data from a sample of individuals, often through questionnaires or interviews, to describe or infer characteristics of a larger population. Adeel collected responses from 2,000 randomly selected participants, which sounds like a survey method.\n\nConsidering these options, the most fitting research method Adeel used is likely a survey. He collected data from a large number of participants through some form of response or answer, which is characteristic of surveys.\n\nBut let's double-check. Did he just collect responses or did he observe behavior directly?\n\nThe statement says he \"collected and analyzed the responses of 2,000 randomly selected study participants.\" This suggests that he gathered information through some form of response, like answers to questions about their work hours and grades. This aligns more with a survey approach rather than naturalistic observation, where the researcher would directly observe behavior in natural settings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Survey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
