                    "text": "So I've got this pretty involved property law scenario here, and I need to figure out which option is correct regarding a title issue. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a farmer who owns a tract of land with two farms: one on the eastern half and one on the western half. The state has a notice recording statute and follows the title theory of mortgages. That's important because it affects how interests in property are protected.\n\nThe farmer records a general warranty deed conveying the entire property to his son. So, the son now owns both farms. Two years later, the son gets a mortgage on the property in favor of his friend, and the friend records the mortgage promptly. That means that the mortgage is part of the public record.\n\nTwenty years pass, and the son sells the property to an investor using another general warranty deed, but the investor assumes the friend's mortgage. So, the mortgage stays with the property.\n\nThe investor then subdivides the property and sells the western farm to a developer, keeping the eastern farm. Importantly, the deed from the investor to the developer doesn't mention the mortgage.\n\nThe developer tries to rezone the property to build houses but can't, so he sells the western farm to a florist. Again, the deed to the florist doesn't mention the mortgage.\n\nThree years later, the florist agrees to sell the western farm to a rancher for $75,000, with a closing date on January 15. But on January 10, the rancher does a title search and finds the friend's mortgage still attached to the property.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what this means for the rancher. The options are:\n\nA. The rancher can cancel the real estate contract right away.\n\nB. The encumbrance makes the title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nC. The mortgage only affects the eastern farm because the investor's partition created a joint tenancy.\n\nD. The rancher can't cancel the contract until after closing on January 15.\n\nAlright, let's tackle this one point at a time.\n\nFirst, what does a notice recording statute mean? In such states, a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who records their deed first is protected against prior unrecorded interests, provided they didn't have notice of those interests.\n\nBut in this case, the friend's mortgage was recorded promptly, so it's part of the public record.\n\nNow, the investor bought the whole property from the son, assuming the mortgage. Then, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to the developer, without mentioning the mortgage in the deed.\n\nUnder the title theory of mortgages, the mortgagor (the son) retains title to the property, and the mortgage is a lien against the property. So, even if the property is sold, the mortgage remains attached unless it's paid off or assumed.\n\nBut in this case, when the investor bought the property, he assumed the mortgage. That means he agreed to pay the mortgage debt. However, the mortgage was already recorded, so the developer and subsequent buyers should have been aware of it through a title search.\n\nWait, but the deeds from the investor to the developer and from the developer to the florist didn't mention the mortgage. Does that matter?\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a recorded mortgage is part of the chain of title, and subsequent buyers are bound by it unless they can show they didn't have notice of it.\n\nBut here, the rancher did a title search and found the mortgage. So, he has actual knowledge of it now.\n\nNow, the question is whether this mortgage makes the title unmarketable, and what rights the rancher has to cancel the contract.\n\nLet's consider option B: the encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nAn encumbrance like a mortgage can indeed affect the marketability of the title. Generally, a marketable title is one that is free from defects or reasonable doubts that would make a prudent person unwilling to rely on it.\n\nA recorded mortgage is a definite defect because it represents a lien on the property, meaning someone else has a claim to be paid from the proceeds of the property's sale.\n\nSo, having a mortgage on the property could make the title unmarketable because a buyer would either have to assume the mortgage (if allowed) or require the seller to pay it off at closing.\n\nBut in this scenario, the florist sold the western farm to the rancher without mentioning the mortgage, and now the rancher has discovered it.\n\nOption A says the rancher can cancel the contract immediately.\n\nIn real estate contracts, if the seller doesn't have clear title, the buyer may have the right to cancel the contract. However, typically, there's a process for this, and it might not be instantaneous.\n\nOption D says the rancher can't cancel until after closing.\n\nThat seems counterintuitive because typically, if a title defect is discovered before closing, the buyer can back out or require the seller to cure the defect.\n\nOption C is interesting: it suggests that the mortgage only encumbers the eastern farm because the investor's partition created a joint tenancy.\n\nFirst, joint tenancy is a form of ownership where multiple parties own the property equally, with rights of survivorship. But in this case, the investor subdivided the property and sold one part, which suggests that the property was split into separate parcels, not held in joint tenancy.\n\nMoreover, the mortgage was on the entire property when the son mortgaged it, and it was recorded. When the investor bought the whole property and then subdivided it, the mortgage would likely attach to both parts unless it was satisfied or released.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when a mortgaged property is subdivided, the mortgage lien attaches to each of the subdivided parts proportionally unless there's an agreement to allocate the lien differently.\n\nBut without such an agreement, the mortgage would probably attach to both the eastern and western farms.\n\nSo, option C seems unlikely.\n\nNow, between options A and B, I need to decide whether the title is unmarketable and whether the rancher can cancel the contract immediately.\n\nFirst, regarding marketability: a recorded mortgage is indeed a defect in the title, which could make it unmarketable. So, option B seems plausible.\n\nAs for option A, whether the rancher can cancel the contract immediately depends on the terms of the contract and applicable law.\n\nIn many real estate contracts, there's a title contingency that allows the buyer to cancel if clear title cannot be provided, typically within a certain period after discovery of the defect.\n\nBut whether the cancellation can be immediate or whether there's a cure period for the seller to fix the defect varies.\n\nGiven that, and without specific contract terms, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nHowever, generally, if a title defect is discovered before closing, the buyer can elect to cancel the contract, but there might be procedures to follow, such as providing notice to the seller and allowing them an opportunity to cure the defect.\n\nSo, option A might be too hasty in assuming immediate cancellation without following proper procedures.\n\nOption D suggests that cancellation can't happen until after closing, which seems incorrect because typically, discovering a title defect before closing allows the buyer to back out.\n\nTherefore, option D is probably wrong.\n\nOption C is unlikely because the mortgage likely affects both farms unless there's a specific agreement to the contrary.\n\nSo, that leaves option B: the encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nThis seems the most straightforward and accurate statement based on the information provided.\n\nA recorded mortgage is a significant lien on the property, and it would generally make the title unmarketable unless the lien is satisfied or the buyer agrees to assume it.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
