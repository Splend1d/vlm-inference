                    "text": "Let's dive into this property law problem. So, the uncle deeds his property with the granting clause: \"To my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener.\" I need to figure out which statement accurately describes the ownership rights based on this grant.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a \"life estate\" is. A life estate is an interest in property that lasts for the duration of a person's life. So, in this case, the property is being given to the nephew and niece \"for the life of my nephew.\" That suggests that their interest is tied to the nephew's lifespan.\n\nNow, option B says the nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. Hmm, life estate pur autre vie is a specific type of life estate that depends on the life of someone else, not the owner themselves. So, if the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, it would be dependent on the life of another person, presumably the nephew since the estate is for \"the life of my nephew.\"\n\nWait a minute, the clause says \"for the life of my nephew,\" which seems to indicate that both the nephew and niece's interest is tied to the nephew's life, not necessarily that the niece's interest is dependent on someone else's life beyond the nephew.\n\nOption D says both the nephew and niece have a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder. This seems plausible because if the property is given to them for the life of the nephew, then to the gardener, it might be that the nephew and niece both have life estates concurrent with the nephew's life, and then the gardener gets it afterward.\n\nBut I need to be careful. The clause says \"for the life of my nephew,\" which could imply that the nephew has a life estate, and the niece's interest is also for the life of the nephew, not her own life. But that seems a bit odd because typically, when you say \"for the life of X,\" it's specifying the duration based on X's life.\n\nLet me consider option A: the nephew and niece are joint tenants in fee simple defeasible, and the gardener has an executory interest. Joint tenancy with right of survivorship is a type of co-ownership where, upon one owner's death, their interest passes to the surviving owner(s). Fee simple defeasible is a fee simple estate that can be terminated under certain conditions. Executory interest is a future interest that can become possessory upon the occurrence of a specified event.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted for the granting clause provided. The clause explicitly mentions \"for the life of my nephew,\" which sounds more like a life estate, not a joint tenancy with fee simple defeasible.\n\nOption C says the nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first of them to die, the nephew and niece have contingent remainders in fee simple defeasible, and the gardener has an executory interest. Tenants in common is another form of co-ownership where each owner has a distinct share that can be inherited separately. Fee simple defeasible again implies conditions that could terminate the estate. Executory interest is similar to option A.\n\nThis also seems complicated and doesn't directly align with the straightforward granting clause.\n\nOption D seems more straightforward: both the nephew and niece have life estates, and the gardener has a vested remainder. But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, but the clause says \"to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener.\" Does this mean that both the nephew and niece have a life estate concurrent with the nephew's life, or does it mean that the nephew has a life estate, and the niece has a life estate pur autre vie based on the nephew's life?\n\nI think it's the former. Both have a life estate that ends upon the nephew's death, and then the gardener gets the property. So, both the nephew and niece have life estates that terminate upon the nephew's death, after which the gardener takes over.\n\nBut in that case, the gardener would have a vested remainder because the interest is certain to vest in them upon the nephew's death, assuming there are no other conditions.\n\nOption B mentions that the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, which is based on someone else's life, i.e., the nephew's life. That could be possible if the niece's interest is dependent on the nephew's life, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If the property is given \"to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener,\" it seems like a joint life estate in both the nephew and niece, with the life tenure based on the nephew's life, and a remainder to the gardener.\n\nIn property law, when multiple people are granted a life estate \"for the life of X,\" it typically means their joint life estate is measured by X's life, not their individual lives.\n\nSo, in this scenario, both the nephew and niece have a life estate that is contingent on the nephew's life. Upon the nephew's death, their joint interest terminates, and the property passes to the gardener.\n\nTherefore, the gardener has a vested remainder because the transfer to them is certain upon the nephew's death.\n\nOption D says the nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder. This seems accurate.\n\nOption B says the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, which is based on the life of another person, which in this case is the nephew. But I think it's more accurate to say that both have a life estate measured by the nephew's life.\n\nSo, between options B and D, D seems more precise because it specifies that both the nephew and niece have life estates based on the nephew's life, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\nOption A and C seem to involve more complex estate structures that don't directly align with the straightforward granting clause.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is option D: the nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
