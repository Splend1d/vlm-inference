                    "text": "Alright, so I'm trying to understand this argument by Ashford about worries regarding dependency on aid agencies among people in extreme poverty. The question is saying that these worries don't mean we should do a certain thing, and it gives four options. I need to figure out which one Ashford is arguing against.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the context. Aid agencies are organizations that provide assistance to people in need, especially those in extreme poverty. The concern is that if we keep giving aid, people might become dependent on it and not try to improve their situation on their own. This is a common debate in development circles.\n\nNow, the question is saying that Ashford argues that these worries about causing dependency don't mean we should do a particular thing. So, it's not about whether dependency is a good or bad thing, but rather that even if there is a risk of dependency, it doesn't justify a certain course of action.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: Abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament.\n\nThis sounds pretty extreme. Abandoning the poor would mean not helping them at all, which seems harsh, especially if they're in extreme poverty through no fault of their own. Ashford might be saying that even if there's a risk of dependency, it's not a reason to completely walk away and leave people suffering.\n\nOption B: Legally abolish aid agencies.\n\nThis is different from just not helping; it's actively shutting down the organizations that provide aid. This seems even more extreme than option A. Aid agencies do a lot of good work, and abolishing them would cut off help to many people who rely on it. Ashford is probably not suggesting this.\n\nOption C: Adopt a social contract approach to the problem of global economic justice.\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. A social contract is an idea from political philosophy where people agree to certain rules and arrangements for the common good. Applying this to global economic justice might involve creating international agreements or frameworks to ensure fair distribution of resources. Ashford might be arguing that worries about dependency don't mean we should adopt this approach, perhaps because it's too idealistic or not practical in the current global political climate.\n\nOption D: Accept the view that we have no negative duties to the poor.\n\nNegative duties are typically understood as obligations to refrain from harming others. So, accepting that we have no negative duties to the poor would mean that we don't have an obligation to avoid harming them, which seems morally questionable. This option seems quite radical and unlikely to be Ashford's position.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the most plausible answer is Option A: abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament. Ashford is likely arguing that even if there are concerns about dependency, it doesn't justify walking away from helping those in need. The other options seem too extreme or not directly related to the issue of providing aid.\n\nBut to be sure, let me think about it differently. Maybe Ashford is arguing that dependency concerns don't justify not helping, but perhaps there's a better way to help that addresses the dependency issue. For example, instead of just giving aid, maybe focusing on sustainable development projects that help build local capacity and reduce long-term dependence.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about what it doesn't mean we should do, based on Ashford's argument. So, if Ashford is saying that dependency worries don't mean we should abandon the poor, then Option A is still the best fit.\n\nOption B, abolishing aid agencies, seems too extreme and not directly related to the argument. Ashford might be critical of certain practices of aid agencies, but not necessarily advocating for their abolition.\n\nOption C, adopting a social contract approach, could be a separate argument, but it doesn't directly follow from the concern about dependency. It's more about the broader structure of global economic justice, which is a different issue.\n\nOption D, accepting no negative duties to the poor, seems ethically problematic and unlikely to be Ashford's position.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that Ashford is arguing that worries about causing dependency on aid agencies among those in extreme poverty do not mean that we should abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament. So, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
