                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that Pat bounces a basketball 25 times in 30 seconds, and I need to find out approximately how many times Pat will bounce the ball in 150 seconds at that same rate. The options are A. 120, B. 125, C. 144, and D. 145.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a rate at which Pat bounces the ball, and we need to scale that up to a different time period. So, it's a problem about proportions or ratios.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- 25 bounces in 30 seconds.\n\n- We need to find out how many bounces in 150 seconds at the same rate.\n\nSo, the rate is bounces per second. If I can find out how many bounces per second, I can then multiply that by 150 seconds to get the answer.\n\nLet me calculate the bounces per second:\n\nBounces per second = 25 bounces / 30 seconds\n\nSimplifying that, 25 divided by 30 is 0.8333... bounces per second.\n\nNow, to find out how many bounces in 150 seconds:\n\nBounces = bounces per second * time in seconds\n\nSo, bounces = 0.8333... * 150\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 0.8333 times 150.\n\nWell, 0.8 times 150 is 120\n\nAnd 0.0333 times 150 is approximately 5\n\nSo, total bounces \u2248 120 + 5 = 125\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 125 seems to be the closest answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a simpler way to think about it. Since 30 seconds to 150 seconds is a factor of 5 increase (because 150 / 30 = 5), and if the rate is constant, then the bounces should also increase by the same factor.\n\nSo, 25 bounces \u00d7 5 = 125 bounces.\n\nThat matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion:\n\n25 bounces / 30 seconds = x bounces / 150 seconds\n\nSo, x = (25 / 30) \u00d7 150\n\nSimplifying 25/30, that's 25 \u00f7 30 = 5/6\n\nSo, x = (5/6) \u00d7 150\n\nNow, 5/6 times 150. Let's see, 5/6 of 150.\n\nFirst, 1/6 of 150 is 25, because 6 \u00d7 25 = 150.\n\nSo, 5/6 of 150 is 5 \u00d7 25 = 125.\n\nAgain, that gives me 125 bounces.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says \"at that rate, approximately how many times will Pat bounce the ball in 150 seconds?\"\n\nI think I've approached it correctly by finding the rate and then scaling it up to 150 seconds.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can think about it in terms of direct variation.\n\nIf bounces are directly proportional to time, then:\n\nBounces1 / Time1 = Bounces2 / Time2\n\nSo, 25 / 30 = x / 150\n\nCross-multiplying: 25 * 150 = 30 * x\n\nSo, 3750 = 30x\n\nThen, x = 3750 / 30 = 125\n\nAgain, confirming that the answer is 125.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break down the time into smaller parts.\n\n30 seconds to 150 seconds:\n\n150 \u00f7 30 = 5\n\nSo, 5 times the original period.\n\nTherefore, bounces should be 5 times 25, which is 125.\n\nAll these methods point to the same answer, 125.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 120\n\nB. 125\n\nC. 144\n\nD. 145\n\nSo, clearly, B. 125 is the correct choice.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{125} \\]"
