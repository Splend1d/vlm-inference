                    "text": "Let's dive into this tax problem. So, Acre contributes land to the AQR partnership in exchange for a one-third interest. The land has a fair market value of $100,000 and a tax basis of $60,000. Then, in the first year, the partnership sells the land for $160,000. We need to figure out how to treat the gain from this sale tax-wise.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening here. Acre contributes land to the partnership, and the partnership sells it later at a profit. Normally, when a partner contributes property to a partnership, there's a carryover basis for the partnership. That means the partnership takes the contributor's basis in the property.\n\nSo, the partnership's basis in the land should be $60,000, which is Acre's adjusted basis. The sale price is $160,000, so the total gain is $100,000 ($160,000 - $60,000).\n\nNow, the question is, how is this gain allocated among the partners? The partnership agreement says that profits and losses are shared equally among the partners. But there's a twist because Acre contributed the land.\n\nI recall that generally, gains and losses from the sale of contributed property are allocated to the contributing partner to the extent of their unrealized gain or loss at the time of contribution. This is to prevent partners from shifting built-in gains or losses to other partners.\n\nIn this case, Acre contributed the land with a fair market value of $100,000 and a tax basis of $60,000, so there was a built-in gain of $40,000 at the time of contribution ($100,000 - $60,000).\n\nWhen the land is sold for $160,000, the gain is $100,000. According to tax rules, the built-in gain at the time of contribution, which is $40,000, should be allocated to Acre. The remaining gain, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000, should then be shared equally among all partners.\n\nWait a minute, the problem mentions that Acre has a one-third interest in the partnership. So, there are three partners in total, each with a one-third share in profits and losses.\n\nBut, the allocation of the built-in gain is specific to Acre because it's related to the property they contributed. So, the first $40,000 of the gain should go to Acre, and the remaining $60,000 should be shared equally among all three partners.\n\nLet me double-check that. According to IRS regulations, gains and losses from the sale of contributed property are generally allocated to the contributing partner to the extent of any gain or loss recognized that is attributable to the contributed property's value in excess of its adjusted basis at the contribution date.\n\nSo, in this case, the land was contributed with a fair market value of $100,000 and a basis of $60,000, so there was a built-in gain of $40,000. When the land is sold for $160,000, the total gain is $100,000. The first $40,000 of that gain should be allocated to Acre, and the remaining $60,000 should be allocated according to the profit-sharing ratios of the partners.\n\nSince all partners share profits and losses equally, the remaining $60,000 would be divided into three equal parts, with each partner getting $20,000.\n\nSo, the proper tax treatment would be:\n\n- Acre gets $40,000 (built-in gain) + $20,000 (share of remaining gain) = $60,000\n\n- Each of the other two partners gets $20,000\n\nBut wait, option C says: \"The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners.\"\n\nThat would mean each of the other two partners gets $30,000 ($60,000 / 2).\n\nBut according to the profit-sharing ratio, all partners share equally, so all three should get $20,000 each from the remaining gain.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect because it suggests that the remaining $60,000 is shared only between the other two partners, which would give each $30,000. But since Acre also has a one-third interest, Acre should also get a share of that remaining gain.\n\nOption D says: \"The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.\"\n\nThat sounds correct. So, Acre gets $40,000 plus $20,000, and each of the other two partners gets $20,000.\n\nOption B says: \"The entire gain of $100,000 must be specifically allocated to Acre.\"\n\nThat's not right because only the built-in gain at contribution should be allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain should be shared according to the profit-sharing ratio.\n\nOption A says: \"Each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333.\"\n\nThat would mean the entire $100,000 gain is divided equally among the three partners, each getting $33,333.33. But this doesn't account for the built-in gain that should be allocated specifically to Acre.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's think about it again. The built-in gain is $40,000, which should go to Acre. Then, the remaining $60,000 is shared equally among all three partners, each getting $20,000.\n\nSo, Acre gets $40,000 + $20,000 = $60,000\n\nEach of the other two partners gets $20,000.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the proper tax treatment is that the first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
