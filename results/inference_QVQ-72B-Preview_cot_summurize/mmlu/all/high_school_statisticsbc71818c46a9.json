                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the expected gain or loss per game for this dice rolling scenario. Let me read it carefully.\n\nTwo dice are rolled simultaneously. If both dice show 6, the player wins $20; otherwise, the player loses the game. It costs $2.00 to play the game. And I need to find out which of these options is correct:\n\nA. The player will gain about $0.55.\n\nB. The player will gain about $1.44.\n\nC. The player will lose about $0.55.\n\nD. The player will lose about $1.44.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand the game mechanics. There are two dice being rolled, and I need to find the probability of both showing a 6, because that's the winning condition.\n\nI remember that when you roll two dice, there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes because each die has 6 faces.\n\nNow, the winning condition is both dice showing 6. So, how many ways can that happen? Well, only one way: both dice show 6.\n\nSo, the probability of winning is 1 out of 36, right?\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Each die is independent, so the probability that die 1 shows 6 is 1/6, and the same for die 2. Since they are independent, the probability that both show 6 is (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/36. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, if both show 6, the player wins $20. Otherwise, they lose the game, which probably means they lose the $2 they paid to play.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, \"otherwise the player loses the game.\" It doesn't specify any additional loss beyond the $2. So, I think it's safe to assume that the only cost is the $2 to play, and if they don't win, they just lose that $2.\n\nSo, the possible outcomes are:\n\n- Win $20 with probability 1/36.\n\n- Lose $2 with probability 35/36.\n\nNow, to find the expected value, I need to calculate the expected gain or loss per game.\n\nExpected value (E) is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability.\n\nSo, E = (probability of winning) x (amount won) + (probability of losing) x (amount lost).\n\nHere, amount won is $20, and amount lost is -$2 (since it's a loss).\n\nSo, E = (1/36) * 20 + (35/36) * (-2)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, (1/36) * 20 = 20/36 = 5/9 \u2248 0.5556\n\nThen, (35/36) * (-2) = -70/36 \u2248 -1.9444\n\nNow, E \u2248 0.5556 - 1.9444 = -1.3888\n\nSo, the expected loss is approximately $1.3888 per game.\n\nWait, but the options are in terms of gain or loss per game.\n\nOption C says lose about $0.55, which is not matching.\n\nOption D says lose about $1.44, which is closer to my calculation.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\n(1/36)*20 = 20/36 = 5/9 \u2248 0.5556\n\n(35/36)*(-2) = -70/36 \u2248 -1.9444\n\nE \u2248 0.5556 - 1.9444 = -1.3888\n\nSo, that's approximately - $1.39, which is closer to $1.44 loss.\n\nBut the options are in terms of gain or loss per game. Since the expected value is negative, it means the player is expected to lose money in the long run.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be D. The player will lose about $1.44.\n\nBut let me see if there's a more precise calculation.\n\nLet me calculate it exactly.\n\nE = (1/36)*20 + (35/36)*(-2)\n\n= (20/36) + (-70/36)\n\n= (20 - 70)/36\n\n= (-50)/36\n\n= -25/18\n\nWhich is approximately -1.3889, yes, about $1.44 loss.\n\nSo, the answer is D. The player will lose about $1.44.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
