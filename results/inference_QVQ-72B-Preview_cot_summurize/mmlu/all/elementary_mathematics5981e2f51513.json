                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Mark's stamp collection. He has stamps from three different countries: Japan, Canada, and Mexico. Specifically, he has 22 stamps from Japan, 34 from Canada, and 17 from Mexico. The question is asking for the total number of stamps he has in all. The options provided are A. 53, B. 63, C. 73, and D. 83.\n\nAlright, to find the total number of stamps, I need to add up the number of stamps from each country. So, it's a simple addition problem: 22 + 34 + 17.\n\nFirst, I'll add 22 and 34. Let's see, 22 plus 34. I can break it down: 22 plus 30 is 52, and then adding the remaining 4 makes it 56. So, 22 + 34 = 56.\n\nNow, I'll add 17 to that sum. So, 56 plus 17. Again, I can break it down: 56 plus 10 is 66, and then adding the remaining 7 makes it 73. Therefore, 56 + 17 = 73.\n\nSo, the total number of stamps Mark has is 73. Looking back at the options, C. 73 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to approach this? Maybe I can add them all together at once, but since I'm just starting out, maybe sticking to step-by-step addition is safer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a number line to visualize the addition. Starting at 22, then adding 34: 22 plus 30 is 52, and then plus 4 is 56. Then, adding 17: 56 plus 10 is 66, and plus 7 is 73. That matches what I did before.\n\nAnother way could be to add the largest numbers first. So, 34 plus 22. 34 + 22 is 56, and then add 17 to make 73. Same result.\n\nOr, I could add 22 plus 17 first. 22 + 17 is 39, and then add 34 to make 73. Again, the same answer.\n\nIt seems consistent across different addition methods, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can use the counting strategy. Starting from zero, I add each stamp one by one. But that would be time-consuming, especially with 73 stamps. It's better to stick with the addition method I've used.\n\nI think I've confirmed that the correct total is 73 stamps. So, the answer should be C. 73.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there's any trick to this question. Is there something I'm missing?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Mark has a stamp collection. He has 22 stamps from Japan, 34 from Canada, and 17 from Mexico. How many stamps does he have in all?\"\n\nNo, it seems straightforward. No tricks here, just a simple addition problem.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that the answer is C. 73.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 73} \\]"
