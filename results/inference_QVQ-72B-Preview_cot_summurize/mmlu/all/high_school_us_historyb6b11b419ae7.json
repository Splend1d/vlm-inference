Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's about Federalist #15. The question is asking which specific development contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15. But before I dive into the options, I need to make sure I understand what Federalist #15 is about.\n\nI remember that the Federalist Papers were written to support the ratification of the United States Constitution. Federalist #15, written by James Madison, likely builds on the arguments for a stronger federal government. The title of Federalist #15 is \"The Same Continued. To What Causes It Ought to Be Attributed\" or something along those lines. I think it continues the discussion from Federalist #14, which probably discussed the need for a stronger central government to handle issues like taxation and commerce.\n\nBut to be honest, I don't recall the exact content of Federalist #15 off the top of my head. Maybe I should look it up to get a better understanding. Wait, but since this is a hypothetical scenario, I'll have to rely on my memory and general knowledge.\n\nThe question provides four options:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\n\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\n\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the general sentiment of Federalist #15 might be. Since it's part of the Federalist Papers, it's advocating for a stronger federal government under the new Constitution. So, the sentiment is likely centered around the idea that the existing government under the Articles of Confederation is insufficient for various reasons, and that a more robust federal structure is necessary to address those shortcomings.\n\nGiven that context, the specific developments listed in the options are likely related to weaknesses or problems that arose under the Articles of Confederation, problems that the Constitution was designed to fix.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n\nI recall that after the American Revolution, there were issues with Great Britain not vacating some forts in the Northwest Territory, which is around the Great Lakes region. This was a point of contention because these forts were on American soil, and the British presence there was seen as a violation of American sovereignty. Under the Articles of Confederation, the national government had limited ability to handle such diplomatic or military challenges effectively. This kind of issue would have been used as an argument for a stronger national government that could better manage foreign relations and defend the nation's borders.\n\nSo, this seems like a plausible choice.\n\nOption B: Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\n\nHmm, I thought Florida was still under Spanish control during the time of the American Revolution and the early years of the United States. In fact, Spain held Florida until the early 19th century, with some interruptions. But I don't recall any specific instance where Spanish forces \"retook\" Florida from the United States during the Confederation period. Maybe I'm misremembering, but this seems a bit off.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a period when the United States claimed Florida and then lost it back to Spain, but I'm not sure. Let me think carefully.\n\nActually, the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which ended the American Revolution, recognized American independence and defined the boundaries of the new nation. It also addressed the issue of Florida, which had been under British control before being returned to Spain in 1783. So, Florida wasn't part of the United States at that time; it was Spanish territory.\n\nGiven that, it's unlikely that the retook of Florida by Spanish forces would have been a development contributing to the sentiment in Federalist #15, because Florida wasn't American soil to begin with during that period.\n\nThis makes me think that option B might not be the correct choice.\n\nOption C: French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\n\nThis option suggests that the French were supporting Native American tribes in raids against New England colonies. I know that there was a history of conflict between European powers and Native Americans in North America, and alliances shifted over time.\n\nHowever, by the time of the American Revolution and the Confederation period, the French had already been defeated in the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War), and Canada had been ceded to Britain. So, it's unclear what the French involvement would have been in aiding Native American raids in New England during this period.\n\nMoreover, New England was more towards the eastern part of the continent, while French influence was more concentrated in the northern and midwestern regions after the war.\n\nI need to verify if there were any significant French-supported Native American raids in New England during the 1780s or 1790s.\n\nLet me think about it. After the American Revolution, there were certainly conflicts between settlers and Native American tribes, particularly in the Ohio Valley and other frontier areas. However, I don't recall any major involvement of French forces in these conflicts, especially in New England.\n\nIt's possible that there was some support from the French to Native Americans elsewhere, perhaps as a way to weaken British influence or to settle old scores, but in New England, it seems less likely.\n\nTherefore, this option also seems less plausible compared to option A.\n\nOption D: Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n\nThis option touches on maritime trade and relations with the Dutch. The Dutch had significant trading interests, particularly in the Caribbean and Europe, and they were known for their naval power and commercial activities.\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the United States had limited ability to regulate commerce with foreign nations effectively. This often led to situations where other countries imposed unfavorable terms on American traders.\n\nIf Dutch traders were forcing American ships to pay tribute to dock in Holland, this would be an example of how the young nation was unable to negotiate better terms or protect its merchants' interests on the international stage.\n\nThis kind of issue would have been used as an argument for a stronger central government with the authority to regulate foreign commerce and ensure that American interests were respected abroad.\n\nSo, this also seems like a plausible choice.\n\nNow, I have to decide between options A and D.\n\nOption A involves a territorial dispute with Great Britain, highlighting the need for a stronger national defense and diplomatic standing.\n\nOption D involves economic and maritime issues, emphasizing the need for better management of foreign commerce and protection of American ships and merchants.\n\nBoth seem relevant to the arguments made in the Federalist Papers for a stronger federal government.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider which of these issues was more prominent in Federalist #15.\n\nSince I don't recall the exact content of Federalist #15, I need to make an educated guess based on the general themes of the Federalist Papers.\n\nI know that the Federalist Papers covered a wide range of topics, including the structure of the government, the separation of powers, and the need for a strong central authority to address various national issues.\n\nGiven that, both options A and D fit into the broader theme of needing a stronger federal government to handle external threats and economic challenges.\n\nHowever, I recall that one of the key arguments for a stronger federal government was the ability to manage foreign relations and defend the country's sovereignty effectively.\n\nOption A directly relates to a territorial dispute with Great Britain, which was a significant power at the time and had a history of conflict with the United States.\n\nOption D, while important, seems more related to economic pressures and commercial regulations, which, while crucial, might not carry the same weight as a direct territorial challenge.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards option A as the development that contributed to the sentiment in Federalist #15.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that Federalist #15 might have focused on multiple issues, not just territorial disputes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to test my knowledge of specific historical events that influenced the arguments in the Federalist Papers.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the timing.\n\nFederalist #15 was written in late 1787 or early 1788, during the debates over the ratification of the Constitution. So, I need to think about what specific developments around that time contributed to the arguments made in the papers.\n\nOption A mentions Great Britain refusing to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region. I know that after the American Revolution, the British did occupy some forts in the Northwest Territory, which was a point of tension between the United States and Great Britain.\n\nThis issue was not fully resolved until the Jay Treaty in 1794, which was after the Constitution was ratified. However, the persistence of British forces in American territory was certainly a concern during the Confederation period and was used as an argument for a stronger national government that could handle such diplomatic and military challenges more effectively.\n\nOption D talks about Dutch traders forcing American ships to extend tribute payments to dock in Holland. I'm not sure about the specifics of this situation, but it's plausible that European powers were imposing unfair terms on American merchants during this period.\n\nThis would highlight the need for a stronger federal government that could regulate foreign commerce and protect American economic interests abroad.\n\nBut again, comparing the two, the territorial dispute with Great Britain seems more directly related to national sovereignty and defense, which were major concerns leading up to the Constitution's ratification.\n\nMoreover, the relationship with Great Britain was particularly sensitive due to the recent war of independence, and any provocations from the British would have been met with significant outrage and calls for a stronger national defense.\n\nOn the other hand, while economic issues were important, they might not have carried the same emotional and political weight as the territorial disputes.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the most appropriate choice here.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there's any specific reference in Federalist #15 to any of these options.\n\nUnfortunately, without being able to look up the exact content of Federalist #15, I have to rely on my general knowledge.\n\nHowever, I do recall that Federalist #15 was part of a series that discussed the need for a stronger federal government to handle issues related to national defense and foreign affairs.\n\nGiven that, the British refusal to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region aligns closely with the themes of national defense and territorial integrity.\n\nOption D, while related to foreign commerce, might be more aligned with economic arguments, which were also important but perhaps not as directly connected to the core issues of sovereignty and defense.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option A is the correct answer.\n\nTo sum it up, the specific development that contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15 is that Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n\nThis development highlighted the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation in handling foreign threats and defending American territory, thereby supporting the argument for a stronger federal government under the new Constitution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
