The options are Matrix, Divisional, Multi-divisional, and Functional. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these structures entails and how specialization fits into them.\n\nLet me start by remembering what specialization means in an organizational context. Specialization typically refers to dividing work into specific tasks and assigning them to individuals or departments based on their expertise or focus. So, it's about narrowing down roles and responsibilities to specialized areas.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nFirst, the Matrix structure. I know that in a matrix organization, employees have dual reporting lines\u2014usually to both a functional manager and a project manager. This structure is designed to combine the benefits of functional and project-based structures. It's flexible and good for integrating different specialties, but I'm not sure if it's primarily known for specialization.\n\nNext, the Divisional structure. This type of structure groups activities based on divisions, which could be products, services, markets, or regions. Each division has its own set of functions, almost like a separate business within the larger organization. While divisions might have their own specialized departments, the structure itself is more about segmentation by business units rather than specialization of functions.\n\nThen there's the Multi-divisional structure. From what I recall, this is similar to the divisional structure but on a larger scale, often seen in conglomerates where each division operates semi-independently. Again, within each division, there might be specialization, but the overall structure is about managing multiple distinct business units.\n\nFinally, the Functional structure. This is the one that seems to fit best with specialization. In a functional structure, the organization is divided into departments based on specific functions or areas of expertise, such as marketing, finance, operations, and human resources. Each department specializes in its particular area, and employees within those departments develop deep knowledge and skills in their field.\n\nThinking back to my understanding of organizational behavior, I remember that specialization is a key feature of the functional structure. It allows for efficiency and expertise development within each function. However, it can also lead to silos and less collaboration across functions.\n\nComparing this with the other structures, the matrix structure does involve multiple functions working together on projects, but specialization is still present within the functional departments. The divisional and multi-divisional structures focus more on grouping related activities into self-contained units, each of which may have their own functional departments, but again, specialization is more of a byproduct rather than a defining characteristic.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would say that the Functional structure is the one that is primarily characterized by specialization.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that specialization could be more associated with another structure? For example, in a matrix structure, even though there are project teams, the underlying functional departments still maintain specialization. Similarly, in divisional and multi-divisional structures, specialization exists within the divisions' functional departments.\n\nBut the question is asking for the structure that features specialization as one of its main characteristics. The functional structure is literally defined by the specialization into functions. Therefore, it seems the most appropriate answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer should be D. Functional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
