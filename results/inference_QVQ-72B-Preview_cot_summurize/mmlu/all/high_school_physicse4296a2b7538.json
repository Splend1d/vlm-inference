                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the Doppler effect, and I need to figure out in which scenario there would be no perceived Doppler shift. The options are:\n\nA. The source travels toward the stationary detector.\n\nB. The detector travels toward the stationary source.\n\nC. Both the source and detector travel in the same direction.\n\nD. Both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source and detector moving away from each other.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Doppler effect is. It's when there's a change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. So, if there's relative motion between the source and the observer, there should be a Doppler shift.\n\nBut the question is asking for a situation where there is no perceived Doppler shift. So, maybe in some cases, even if both are moving, the relative motion is such that the frequency doesn't change.\n\nLet's think about option A: the source travels toward the stationary detector.\n\nI know that if the source is moving towards the detector, the frequency detected will be higher than the actual frequency because the waves are being compressed as the source approaches. So, in this case, there should be a positive Doppler shift. So, this doesn't fit the \"no perceived Doppler shift\" scenario.\n\nOption B: the detector travels toward the stationary source.\n\nSimilarly, if the detector is moving towards the source, it's moving towards the incoming waves, so it will detect a higher frequency. So, again, a positive Doppler shift. Not what we're looking for.\n\nOption C: both the source and detector travel in the same direction.\n\nHmm, this one is interesting. If both are moving in the same direction, but what matters is their relative motion. If they are moving at the same speed, then their relative velocity is zero. In that case, there should be no Doppler shift because there's no relative motion between them.\n\nWait, but is that always true? Let's think carefully. Suppose both are moving in the same direction, but the source is moving faster than the detector. Then, the distance between them is decreasing, so the detector should perceive a higher frequency. Conversely, if the detector is moving faster than the source, the distance between them is increasing, so the detector should perceive a lower frequency.\n\nSo, in this option, unless their speeds are exactly the same, there will be a Doppler shift. Only when their speeds are equal and they're moving in the same direction will there be no Doppler shift.\n\nOption D: both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source and detector moving away from each other.\n\nIf both are moving in opposite directions and moving away from each other, then their relative velocity is the sum of their velocities, right? So, in this case, the detector is moving away from the source, which should result in a lower perceived frequency. So, again, not no Doppler shift.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about the formulas for the Doppler effect to be more precise.\n\nThe general formula for the Doppler effect when both source and observer are moving is:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) f \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( f' \\) is the observed frequency,\n\n- \\( f \\) is the emitted frequency,\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound in the medium,\n\n- \\( v_o \\) is the speed of the observer relative to the medium,\n\n- \\( v_s \\) is the speed of the source relative to the medium.\n\nIf there is no Doppler shift, then \\( f' = f \\), which implies that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} = 1 \\]\n\nSo, solving for \\( v_o \\) and \\( v_s \\):\n\n\\[ v + v_o = v - v_s \\]\n\n\\[ v_o + v_s = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ v_o = -v_s \\]\n\nThis means that the observer's velocity relative to the medium is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the source's velocity relative to the medium. In other words, their velocities are equal and they are moving in opposite directions.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: source toward stationary detector \u2192 \\( v_s \\) is towards, \\( v_o = 0 \\) \u2192 not equal and opposite.\n\nOption B: detector toward stationary source \u2192 \\( v_o \\) toward, \\( v_s = 0 \\) \u2192 not equal and opposite.\n\nOption C: both travel in the same direction \u2192 if \\( v_o = v_s \\), then \\( v_o = -v_s \\) only if \\( v_o + v_s = 0 \\), which would mean they are moving in opposite directions. But option C says they travel in the same direction, so unless their speeds are equal and they're moving towards each other, which doesn't make sense, this doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: both travel in opposite directions, moving away from each other \u2192 this matches \\( v_o = -v_s \\), so their velocities are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nWait, but option D says they are moving away from each other, which implies that both are moving in opposite directions with velocities of equal magnitude, so \\( v_o = -v_s \\), which satisfies the condition for no Doppler shift.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that if both are moving in the same direction at the same speed, there would be no Doppler shift. However, according to the formula, \\( v_o = -v_s \\) is the condition for no Doppler shift.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the medium's frame of reference. Assuming both the source and the detector are moving relative to the medium, their velocities affect the observed frequency.\n\nLet me consider specific examples.\n\nSuppose the source is moving towards the detector at speed \\( v_s \\), and the detector is stationary (\\( v_o = 0 \\)). Then:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{v + 0}{v - v_s} \\right) f = \\frac{v}{v - v_s} f \\]\n\nWhich is greater than \\( f \\) if \\( v_s > 0 \\), meaning the frequency increases.\n\nNow, if the detector is moving towards the source at speed \\( v_o \\), and the source is stationary (\\( v_s = 0 \\)):\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - 0} \\right) f = \\frac{v + v_o}{v} f \\]\n\nAgain, greater than \\( f \\) if \\( v_o > 0 \\).\n\nIf both are moving in the same direction, say both moving away from the detector's initial position at speeds \\( v_s \\) and \\( v_o \\), respectively:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{v + (v_o - v_s)}{v - v_s} \\right) f \\]\n\nWait, I need to be careful with the relative velocities.\n\nActually, in the general Doppler effect formula, \\( v_o \\) is the velocity of the observer relative to the medium, and \\( v_s \\) is the velocity of the source relative to the medium.\n\nIf both are moving in the same direction, say both moving away from the detector's initial position at speeds \\( v_s \\) and \\( v_o \\), then the relative velocity between observer and source is \\( v_o - v_s \\), but in the formula, it's \\( v + v_o \\) in the numerator and \\( v - v_s \\) in the denominator.\n\nTo have \\( f' = f \\), as before, \\( v + v_o = v - v_s \\), which implies \\( v_o = -v_s \\), meaning they are moving in opposite directions with equal speeds.\n\nSo, in option C, if both are moving in the same direction, unless \\( v_o = v_s \\), there will be a Doppler shift. Even if \\( v_o = v_s \\), there would still be a Doppler shift unless they are moving in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no. If \\( v_o = v_s \\), and they are moving in the same direction, then their relative velocity is zero, and there should be no Doppler shift.\n\nBut according to the formula, \\( v_o = -v_s \\) is the condition for no Doppler shift.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to plug in some numbers to see.\n\nLet's say \\( v_s = 30 \\) m/s towards the detector, \\( v_o = 0 \\) m/s. Then:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{340 + 0}{340 - 30} \\right) f = \\frac{340}{310} f \\approx 1.0967 f \\]\n\nSo, frequency increases.\n\nIf \\( v_o = 30 \\) m/s towards the source, \\( v_s = 0 \\) m/s:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{340 + 30}{340 - 0} \\right) f = \\frac{370}{340} f \\approx 1.0882 f \\]\n\nAgain, frequency increases.\n\nNow, if both are moving in the same direction, say both moving away from the detector's initial position at \\( v_s = 30 \\) m/s and \\( v_o = 30 \\) m/s:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{340 + (30 - 30)}{340 - 30} \\right) f = \\left( \\frac{340 + 0}{310} \\right) f = \\frac{340}{310} f \\approx 1.0967 f \\]\n\nWait, that's still higher than \\( f \\). So, even if both are moving at the same speed in the same direction, there's still a Doppler shift.\n\nBut according to the formula, to have \\( f' = f \\), \\( v + v_o = v - v_s \\), which implies \\( v_o = -v_s \\).\n\nSo, in the case where both are moving in opposite directions with equal speeds, \\( v_o = -v_s \\), then \\( f' = f \\).\n\nLet me test that.\n\nIf \\( v_s = 30 \\) m/s away from the detector, and \\( v_o = 30 \\) m/s towards the source:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{340 + 30}{340 - (-30)} \\right) f = \\left( \\frac{370}{370} \\right) f = 1 \\times f \\]\n\nSo, indeed, \\( f' = f \\). No Doppler shift.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct scenario where there is no perceived Doppler shift.\n\nOption C, where both are moving in the same direction, even if at the same speed, still results in a Doppler shift unless their velocities are equal and opposite, which would be moving in opposite directions.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but option D says \"both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source and detector moving away from each other.\"\n\nIn the example I just did, both were moving in opposite directions with equal speeds, and there was no Doppler shift.\n\nIn contrast, if both are moving in the same direction at the same speed, there is a Doppler shift, as shown earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
