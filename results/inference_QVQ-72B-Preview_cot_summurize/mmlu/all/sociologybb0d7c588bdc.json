                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept of \"social facts\" as defined by Durkheim. Let me see, Durkheim was a sociologist, right? I think he was one of the pioneers in the field of sociology. He studied society and social structures. So, social facts must be related to how society influences individual behavior and thoughts.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that are collective and social in origin.\n\nThis seems plausible. If social facts are about society influencing how people act, think, and feel, then this makes sense. It's about collective behaviors and thoughts that originate from social interactions and norms.\n\nB. the way scientists construct knowledge in a social context.\n\nHmm, this seems more related to the philosophy of science or science and technology studies. Durkheim was interested in society more broadly, not specifically in how scientists construct knowledge. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nC. data collected about social phenomena that are proven to be correct.\n\nThis sounds like empirical data or statistics about social phenomena. While Durkheim did use empirical data in his research, I don't think he defined social facts solely as data that are proven to be correct. Social facts are more about the norms and structures that govern social behavior, not just the data collected about them.\n\nD. ideas and theories that have no basis in the external, physical world.\n\nThis seems more related to abstract concepts or perhaps idealism in philosophy. Durkheim was interested in the real-world impacts of social structures, so this doesn't seem to align with his perspective. Social facts have real effects on people's lives; they're not just ideas without basis in reality.\n\nLet me think again. Social facts are supposed to be external to individuals but impose themselves upon them. They're like the rules of the game in society that people have to follow, whether they like it or not. So, they shape how people act, think, and feel in a collective manner.\n\nOption A seems to capture that idea well. It's about ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that are collective and social in origin. That fits with the concept of social facts being these collective norms and behaviors that influence individual actions.\n\nI don't think option B is correct because it's focusing on scientists and knowledge construction, which isn't the main focus of Durkheim's work on social facts.\n\nOption C is about data that's proven to be correct, which is more related to empirical research methods, not the definition of social facts themselves.\n\nOption D suggests that social facts are ideas without basis in the external world, but that contradicts Durkheim's view. Social facts have real, tangible impacts on people's lives; they're not just abstract ideas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that are collective and social in origin.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check. Durkheim defined social facts as \"modes of existence, of conduct, or of thought capable of exercising over the individual an external constraint, or which are at least endowed with a coercive power if this is not always actually exercised.\"\n\nSo, this aligns with option A because it talks about modes of conduct and thought that are collective and social in origin. These modes can exert external constraint or coercive power over individuals.\n\nYes, that confirms it. Social facts are these collective ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that originate from social interactions and norms and can influence individual behavior and thoughts.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
