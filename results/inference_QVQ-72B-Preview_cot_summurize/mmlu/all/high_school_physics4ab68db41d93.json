                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about vectors. It says that if two non-zero vectors are added together and the resultant vector is zero, what must be true of the two vectors? There are four options:\n\nA. They have equal magnitude and are pointed in the same direction.\n\nB. They have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions.\n\nC. They have different magnitudes and are pointed in opposite directions.\n\nD. It is not possible for the sum of two non-zero vectors to be zero.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall what vectors are and how they add up. Vectors have both magnitude and direction, right? When you add two vectors, you add their corresponding components, and the resultant vector's magnitude and direction depend on the individual vectors' magnitudes and directions.\n\nSo, if two vectors add up to zero, that means their sum is the zero vector. That can only happen if one vector is the negative of the other. Like, if you have vector A and vector B, and A + B = 0, then B = -A.\n\nNow, what does it mean for a vector to be the negative of another? It means that they have the same magnitude but opposite directions. So, if A has a certain magnitude and direction, then -A has the same magnitude but points in the opposite direction.\n\nLet me think about this with an example. Suppose I have a vector A that is pointing to the right with a magnitude of, say, 5 units. Then, -A would point to the left with the same magnitude of 5 units. Adding them together, 5 units to the right plus 5 units to the left would give zero.\n\nWhat if the magnitudes were different? Let's say I have A with a magnitude of 3 units to the right and -A with a magnitude of 3 units to the left. They still add up to zero. But if I change the magnitudes, say A has 4 units to the right and -A has 4 units to the left, they still add up to zero.\n\nWait, but option C says they have different magnitudes and are pointed in opposite directions. If I take A with 5 units to the right and -A with, say, 4 units to the left, their sum would be 1 unit to the right, not zero. So, that can't be right. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says it's not possible for the sum of two non-zero vectors to be zero. But I just thought of examples where two vectors add up to zero, so this can't be right.\n\nOption A says they have equal magnitude and are pointed in the same direction. If two vectors are in the same direction and have equal magnitude, their sum would be twice the magnitude in that direction, not zero. For example, A is 5 units to the right, and B is also 5 units to the right; their sum is 10 units to the right, not zero. So, that's not correct.\n\nOption B says they have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions. That matches my earlier thought: B = -A, so they have the same magnitude but opposite directions.\n\nLet me double-check this concept. In vector addition, when two vectors are added, their components in each direction are added separately. For the sum to be zero, each component must cancel out.\n\nSo, if one vector has a component in a certain direction, the other must have an equal component in the opposite direction. This can only happen if the two vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: They have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the properties of vectors and vector addition. Vectors can be represented geometrically as arrows, where the length represents the magnitude and the direction is indicated by the arrowhead.\n\nWhen you add two vectors graphically, you place the tail of one vector at the head of the other and draw the resultant vector from the tail of the first to the head of the second. If the two vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, their heads and tails will align in such a way that the resultant vector starts and ends at the same point, effectively being the zero vector.\n\nAlternatively, using components, if one vector is (a, b) and the other is (-a, -b), their sum will be (0, 0), which is the zero vector.\n\nSo, this confirms that for two non-zero vectors to add up to zero, they must have equal magnitudes and be pointed in opposite directions.\n\nI think I've covered all the possibilities here. It's clear that option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
