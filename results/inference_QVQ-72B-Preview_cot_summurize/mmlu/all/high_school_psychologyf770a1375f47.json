                    "text": "So Brittany used some address stickers that were sent to her by a charity. And because she used them, she felt like she should donate to that charity. The question is asking what this behavior illustrates, and there are a few options: stereotyping, the fundamental attribution error, the mere exposure effect, or the reciprocity norm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with stereotyping: I think stereotyping is when someone holds a generalized belief about a particular group of people, often without much basis in reality. It's like putting people into categories and assuming they all share the same characteristics. But in this case, Brittany is just using stickers and feeling obligated to donate. That doesn't seem directly related to grouping people or making assumptions about them based on their group. So, maybe stereotyping isn't the best fit here.\n\nNext, the fundamental attribution error. I recall that this is when people tend to overemphasize personal characteristics as the cause of someone's behavior, while underestimating the influence of situational factors. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a bad person rather than considering that they might be in a hurry because of an emergency. But in Brittany's situation, it's about her feeling obligated to donate after using the stickers. That seems more about her response to a specific situation rather than attributing someone else's behavior to their personality. So, maybe not the fundamental attribution error.\n\nThen there's the mere exposure effect. This is the idea that people tend to develop a preference for things they've been exposed to repeatedly. Like, the more you see or hear something, the more familiar and likable it becomes. In this scenario, Brittany received the stickers, which might have made her more familiar with the charity, but her action was more about feeling obligated to reciprocate rather than developing a preference for the charity because she was exposed to it. So, perhaps not the mere exposure effect.\n\nThat leaves the reciprocity norm. I've heard about reciprocity in social psychology; it's about the expectation that when someone does something for you, you should do something in return. It's a fundamental principle in many societies, promoting cooperation and fairness. In this case, Brittany received something from the charity (the stickers) and felt obligated to give something back (a donation). That sounds a lot like the reciproality norm in action.\n\nLet me double-check. The reciprocity norm is the social norm that dictates that people should respond to a positive action with another positive action in return. So, if someone helps you, you feel compelled to help them back. Similarly, if someone gives you a gift, you might feel like you need to give one back.\n\nIn this situation, the charity sent Brittany the stickers, which could be seen as a small gift or a courtesy, and in response, Brittany felt she should donate. That seems like a direct application of the reciprocity norm.\n\nComparing it back to the other options:\n\n- Stereotyping: Not really relevant here.\n\n- Fundamental attribution error: Doesn't fit because it's about attributing behavior to personal characteristics versus situational factors.\n\n- Mere exposure effect: While familiarity might play a role, the key here is the sense of obligation to reciprocate, which is more directly related to the reciprocity norm.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D. the reciprocity norm.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about another example. Suppose someone gives you a free sample at a store, and you feel like you should buy something, even if it's just a small purchase. That's similar to Brittany's situation\u2014receiving something and feeling obligated to give something in return. It's reciprocity in action.\n\nAnother example: If a friend helps you move into a new apartment, you might feel like you need to help them in return at some point, or at least treat them to dinner as a thank you. Again, that's reciprocity.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the reciprocity norm is the best explanation for Brittany's behavior in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
