I have this statement: \"David teaches Chris.\" And I need to translate it into predicate logic using the given symbols: c for Chris, d for David, and Txy for \"x teaches y.\" So, I need to match the correct symbols in the right order to represent this relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who is teaching whom. The statement says David teaches Chris. So, David is the teacher, and Chris is the student in this case.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Tdc\n\nB. Tcd\n\nC. Tcc\n\nD. dTc\n\nI need to figure out which of these correctly represents \"David teaches Chris.\"\n\nLet's break down the symbols:\n\n- Txy means x teaches y.\n\n- c is Chris.\n\n- d is David.\n\nSo, Txy becomes Td c when replacing x with David and y with Chris. But I need to make sure about the order.\n\nWait, in the options, there are no spaces, so Tdc might be T followed by d and then c, or T with two arguments.\n\nActually, in predicate logic, the general form is T(x, y), where T is the relation, and x and y are the variables or constants.\n\nBut here, it's written as Txy, assuming it's a two-place predicate T with arguments x and y.\n\nSo, Txy is equivalent to T(x, y).\n\nGiven that, I need to plug in d for x and c for y, since David teaches Chris.\n\nSo, T(d, c) would be written as Tdc without spaces.\n\nTherefore, Tdc should be David teaches Chris.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nOption A is Tdc, which should be T(d, c), meaning David teaches Chris.\n\nOption B is Tcd, which would be T(c, d), meaning Chris teaches David.\n\nOption C is Tcc, which is T(c, c), meaning Chris teaches Chris.\n\nOption D is dTc, which seems like d followed by T followed by c, which doesn't fit the standard form.\n\nSo, according to this, option A, Tdc, should be the correct translation for \"David teaches Chris.\"\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there's no trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that the letters could be interpreted differently? For example, if Txy is defined differently, or if there's a different convention being used.\n\nBut based on the standard convention, Txy should be T(x, y), with x and y in that order.\n\nMoreover, the question specifies that c is Chris and d is David, and Txy is \"x teaches y.\"\n\nSo, plugging in d for x and c for y, we get Tdc.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other context that might change this interpretation.\n\nSuppose if the relation was symmetric or if there was any inversion, but no, the problem states clearly that Txy means x teaches y, which is a directional relationship.\n\nTherefore, Tdc is the correct representation of \"David teaches Chris.\"\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
