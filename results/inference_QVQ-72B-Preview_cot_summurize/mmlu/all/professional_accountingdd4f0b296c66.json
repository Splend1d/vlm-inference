                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which financial statements require a statement of cash flows for a government entity. The options are:\n\nA. Governmental fund financial statements.\n\nB. Government-wide financial statements.\n\nC. Proprietary fund financial statements.\n\nD. Fiduciary fund financial statements.\n\nI need to pick which one of these must include a statement of cash flows.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these financial statements represents.\n\nStarting with governmental fund financial statements (option A). I recall that governmental funds are used to account for activities that are primarily financed with taxes and other revenues. These funds are typically used for things like police, fire protection, and public works. Now, for these funds, what kind of financial statements are required? I think they have a balance sheet, a statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances, and a statement of cash flows. Wait, is that right? I need to confirm.\n\nLet me think about the GASB (Governmental Accounting Standards Board) standards. They require certain components in financial reports for government entities. For governmental funds, they do require a statement of cash flows, don't they? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should look at the structure of the financial reports.\n\nNext, government-wide financial statements (option B). These are meant to provide a broad overview of the government's financial position and operations. They include a balance sheet and a statement of activities. But do they include a statement of cash flows? I think not directly, but maybe cash flows are considered somewhere. I need to double-check that.\n\nThen, proprietary fund financial statements (option C). Proprietary funds are used to account for operations that are similar to private businesses, like utilities or airports. For these funds, what financial statements are required? I believe they follow more business-like accounting principles. So, they would have balance sheets, income statements, and statements of cash flows. That sounds familiar. So, in this case, statements of cash flows are required for proprietary funds.\n\nLastly, fiduciary fund financial statements (option D). Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held by the government as a trustee or agent for others. This includes pension trusts, investment trusts, and agency funds. What financial statements do they prepare? I think they prepare balance sheets, statements of changes in fiduciary net position, and statements of changes in fiduciary assets, liabilities, and net position. Again, not directly a statement of cash flows, but perhaps cash flows are considered in those statements.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should recall the GASB Statement No. 34, which is the main standard for government financial reporting. It requires that for governmental funds, a statement of cash flows is indeed required. So, that would point to option A.\n\nBut, I also remember that proprietary funds are required to prepare statements of cash flows as part of their financial statements, similar to business entities. So, that would point to option C as well.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Maybe both A and C are correct. But the question asks to select which of the following must include a statement of cash flows, implying a single answer.\n\nPerhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the question is referring to a specific type of financial statement where a statement of cash flows is required.\n\nLet me consider that government-wide financial statements are a consolidation of all the funds and other activities of the government, presented in a single set of statements. So, do these government-wide statements include a statement of cash flows? I don't think so. They typically include a balance sheet and a statement of activities.\n\nSimilarly, for fiduciary funds, while they have their own financial statements, I don't recall a statement of cash flows being part of their required reporting.\n\nSo, narrowing it down, it seems that both governmental funds and proprietary funds require a statement of cash flows.\n\nBut the question is to choose one option, so perhaps I need to prioritize between A and C.\n\nWait, maybe the key is understanding the context of the question. It says \"a government entity is required to include a statement of cash flows in which of the following financial statements?\" It might be testing knowledge of where cash flow statements are mandated.\n\nGiven that, and considering that proprietary funds are essentially operated like businesses and follow similar accounting standards, it makes sense that they would have a statement of cash flows.\n\nHowever, governmental funds also have a statement of cash flows as part of their financial reporting requirements.\n\nBut perhaps the primary requirement for a statement of cash flows is at the governmental fund level, which would be option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the government-wide financial statements incorporate the cash flows from all funds, but they don't present a separate statement of cash flows.\n\nI need to think about the hierarchy of financial statements for a government entity.\n\nAccording to GASB 34, the basic financial statements for a government include:\n\n1. Government-wide financial statements:\n\n- Statement of net position\n\n- Statement of activities\n\n2. Fund financial statements:\n\n- Governmental funds:\n\n- Balance sheet\n\n- Statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances\n\n- Statement of cash flows\n\n- Proprietary funds:\n\n- Balance sheet\n\n- Statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in fund net position\n\n- Statement of cash flows\n\n- Fiduciary funds:\n\n- Statement of fiduciary net position\n\n- Statement of changes in fiduciary net position\n\nFrom this, it's clear that both governmental funds and proprietary funds are required to present a statement of cash flows.\n\nHowever, the question seems to suggest selecting one option, so perhaps there's a specific answer expected.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to test knowledge of where cash flow statements are required, and perhaps governmental funds are the primary focus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the government-wide financial statements do not include a separate statement of cash flows, even though they consolidate the cash flows of all funds.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the government-wide statements provide a broader perspective, and cash flows are incorporated into the statement of activities or elsewhere, but not as a separate statement.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, if I recall correctly, the government-wide statements don't have a separate statement of cash flows.\n\nTherefore, the correct options would be A (governmental fund financial statements) and C (proprietary fund financial statements).\n\nBut since the question asks to choose one option, perhaps there's a specific emphasis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that governmental funds are required to have a statement of cash flows, whereas government-wide statements do not separately require one.\n\nIn that case, option A would be correct.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, I should confirm the GASB requirements.\n\nAccording to GASB 34, for governmental funds, the required statements are:\n\n- Balance sheet\n\n- Statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances\n\n- Statement of cash flows\n\nFor proprietary funds:\n\n- Balance sheet\n\n- Statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in fund net position\n\n- Statement of cash flows\n\nFor fiduciary funds:\n\n- Statement of fiduciary net position\n\n- Statement of changes in fiduciary net position\n\nAnd for government-wide statements:\n\n- Statement of net position\n\n- Statement of activities\n\nSo, indeed, both governmental funds and proprietary funds require a statement of cash flows.\n\nBut the question is to choose one option, so perhaps the answer is A, since governmental funds are a broader category that includes many of the core government services.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether one knows that proprietary funds also require a statement of cash flows.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, perhaps the best answer is C, proprietary fund financial statements, because they are specifically mentioned and follow business-like accounting practices.\n\nBut I'm still unsure, as both A and C seem applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that governmental funds are required to have a statement of cash flows, whereas proprietary funds' requirement might be inferred from business-like practices, but not directly from GASB standards for governments.\n\nNo, actually, GASB 34 explicitly requires proprietary funds to present a statement of cash flows.\n\nSo, both A and C are correct, but since the question asks to choose one option, perhaps the answer is A, governmental fund financial statements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test knowledge that government-wide statements do not include a statement of cash flows, thereby eliminating option B, and fiduciary funds do not have a statement of cash flows, eliminating option D, leaving A and C as possible answers.\n\nBut again, both A and C are correct, so perhaps the answer is A.\n\nIn the end, I think the most straightforward answer is A, governmental fund financial statements, because they are required to include a statement of cash flows according to GASB standards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
