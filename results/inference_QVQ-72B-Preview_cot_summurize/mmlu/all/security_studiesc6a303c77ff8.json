                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand what \"cyber-crime\" really means. I've got these four options here, and I need to pick the one that best defines cyber-crime. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that cyber-crime is any crime that uses computers to jeopardise or attempt to jeopardise national security. Hmm, that sounds pretty serious. But is that the only definition of cyber-crime? What about smaller crimes that don't involve national security but still use computers? I think cyber-crime encompasses a lot more than just threats to national security.\n\nOption B defines cyber-crime as the use of computer networks to commit financial or identity fraud. This seems more specific and focuses on financial aspects and identity theft. While these are certainly types of cyber-crimes, I wonder if this definition is too narrow. Cyber-crime should probably include a wider range of activities beyond just financial fraud and identity theft.\n\nOption C says that cyber-crime is the theft of digital information. This is another specific type of cyber-crime, focusing on the theft aspect. But again, cyber-crime is broader than just theft; it can include things like hacking, spreading malware, online harassment, and more.\n\nOption D states that cyber-crime is any crime that involves computers and networks. This seems the most comprehensive of the options. It doesn't limit the definition to specific types of crimes or targets but includes any criminal activity that involves the use of computers and networks.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best definition of cyber-crime is Option D: any crime that involves computers and networks. This broad definition ensures that it covers a wide range of illegal activities that utilize technology, from hacking and malware to online fraud and identity theft, without excluding any specific type of crime that might emerge in the future as technology advances.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about some examples. If someone uses a computer to steal someone's credit card information, that's cyber-crime. If they spread a virus that locks people out of their own computers unless they pay a ransom, that's also cyber-crime. Even activities like distributing illegal content online or engaging in cyberstalking would fall under this definition.\n\nAll of these examples involve computers and networks in some way, so Option D seems to cover them all. The other options are more specific and might not encompass the full spectrum of activities that are considered cyber-crimes.\n\nI think I'm confident with this choice. Cyber-crime is indeed any crime that involves computers and networks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
