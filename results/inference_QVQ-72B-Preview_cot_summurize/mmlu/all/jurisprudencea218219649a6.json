Jeremy Valdon, B. Jeremy Bentham, C. Salmond, D. Paton.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit rusty on my legal theorists, but I recognize some of these names. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the quote. It says, \"right with me is a child of law... a natural right is a son that never had a father.\" This seems to be talking about the nature of rights, particularly the difference between legal rights and natural rights.\n\nI recall that natural rights are those that are believed to exist regardless of law or society, maybe something like inherent human rights, while legal rights are those established by law.\n\nSo, the quote is likely referring to the idea that legal rights derive from law, hence \"right with me is a child of law,\" meaning that rights are created and defined by legal systems. On the other hand, \"a natural right is a son that never had a father\" suggests that natural rights exist independently, without needing a legal system to give them birth.\n\nNow, I need to figure out who said this. The options are Jeremy Valdon, Jeremy Bentham, Salmond, and Paton.\n\nLet me start by eliminating the ones I'm less familiar with. I've never heard of Jeremy Valdon, so maybe that's a typo or an obscure reference. Maybe it's supposed to be Jeremy Waldron, who is a contemporary legal theorist, but I don't remember him saying this particular quote.\n\nNext is Jeremy Bentham. I know Bentham was a prominent figure in legal philosophy, especially known for his utilitarianism and his work on codifying laws. He was very much focused on the idea that laws should aim to maximize happiness and minimize suffering. But I don't recall him specifically using this phrasing about rights being children of law or anything similar.\n\nThen there's Salmond. I believe John Salmond was an influential legal theorist, particularly known for his work on jurisprudence and legal theory in the early 20th century. I think he had a lot to say about the nature of rights and obligations. Maybe this quote is from him.\n\nLastly, Paton. I'm not as familiar with Paton in the context of legal theory. I think there was a H.L.A. Hart, who was a significant legal philosopher, but that's not one of the options.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards Salmond. His work often delved into the definitions and nature of legal concepts like rights and obligations, and this quote seems to fit into that realm.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if any of the others might have said something similar. Bentham was more focused on utility and the consequences of laws, rather than on the intrinsic nature of rights. Paton, again, I'm not sure about, but I don't recall him being associated with this particular phrase.\n\nAs for Jeremy Valdon, if it's a mistake and was meant to be Jeremy Waldron, I still don't remember Waldron using this specific analogy.\n\nTherefore, my best guess is that the quote is from Salmond.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Salmond}} \\]"
