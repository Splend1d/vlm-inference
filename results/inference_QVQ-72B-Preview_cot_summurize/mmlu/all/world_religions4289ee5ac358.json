                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which elephant-headed Hindu deity is often described as the most beloved?\" And the options are Parvati, Ganesha, Vishnu, and Sita. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the elephant-headed deity.\n\nFirst off, I know that in Hinduism, there are many gods and goddesses, each with their own unique characteristics and forms. The term \"elephant-headed\" immediately makes me think of Ganesha, because he's famously depicted with the head of an elephant and the body of a human. That's a pretty distinctive feature.\n\nLet me just double-check what each of these deities represents and see if any of them have an elephant head.\n\nStarting with Parvati: She's the Hindu goddess of fertility, love, and devotion. She's also known as Shakti and is considered the consort of Shiva. But I don't recall Parvati having an elephant head. In fact, she's usually depicted as a beautiful woman, not with any animal features. So, probably not her.\n\nNext is Ganesha. He's widely revered in Hinduism and is known as the remover of obstacles. His elephant head is a central part of his iconography, and he's one of the best-known and most worshipped deities in the Hindu pantheon. People often pray to Ganesha before starting new ventures or projects, seeking his blessings for success and the removal of obstacles. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the elephant-headed deity.\n\nThen there's Vishnu. He's one of the principal deities in Hinduism and is part of the Trimurti, which includes Brahma and Shiva. Vishnu is the preserver of the universe, and he's typically depicted with a human form, sometimes with four arms holding various symbols like a conch shell, a discus, a mace, and a lotus flower. No elephant head there, so I can probably eliminate him from consideration.\n\nLastly, there's Sita. She's a central figure in the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. Sita is known for her devotion to her husband, Rama, and is a symbol of purity and fidelity. She's also depicted as a human, without any animal characteristics. So, again, no elephant head here.\n\nPutting all this together, it seems pretty clear that Ganesha is the elephant-headed Hindu deity being referred to in the question. He's not only known for his elephant head but is also widely beloved and worshipped across Hindu communities worldwide.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about whether there are any other Hindu deities who might also be associated with an elephant head. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any. Ganesha is the primary one, and he's indeed very popular and revered.\n\nSo, my answer to the question is B. Ganesha.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Ganesha}} \\]"
