                    "text": "So I have this question about Coulomb's law. It says that according to Coulomb, a pair of charged particles placed twice as close to each other experience a force, and I need to choose whether that force is twice as strong, four times as strong, half as strong, or one-fourth as strong. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Coulomb's law. I think Coulomb's law is about the force between two point charges. The equation is something like F equals k times q1 times q2 divided by r squared. Yeah, that sounds right. So, F = k * q1 * q2 / r^2, where F is the force, k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges, and r is the distance between them.\n\nNow, the question is about changing the distance between the charges. It says the particles are placed twice as close to each other. So, if the original distance is r, then the new distance is r/2.\n\nI need to see how this change in distance affects the force. According to the formula, force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. So, if I halve the distance (which is the same as multiplying it by 1/2), the force should be inversely proportional to (1/2)^2, which is 1/4.\n\nWait, but that would mean the force increases by a factor of 4, right? Because if you divide by 1/4, it's the same as multiplying by 4. So, if the distance is halved, the force should be four times stronger.\n\nLet me double-check that. If F is proportional to 1/r^2, then decreasing r by a factor of 2 should make F increase by a factor of (2)^2, which is 4. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the force would be four times as strong when the distance is halved.\n\nWait a minute, let's consider the options again. The question says \"twice as close,\" which I interpret as the distance being halved. So, if the distance is halved, force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, so force increases by a factor of four.\n\nBut let's make sure there's no trick here. Is \"twice as close\" the same as halving the distance? Yeah, I think so. Like, if something is twice as close, it's half the original distance.\n\nSo, according to Coulomb's law, F = k * q1 * q2 / r^2.\n\nIf we keep q1 and q2 constant and only change r to r/2, then the new force F' would be k * q1 * q2 / (r/2)^2 = k * q1 * q2 / (r^2 / 4) = 4 * k * q1 * q2 / r^2.\n\nSo, F' = 4 * F.\n\nTherefore, the force is four times as strong when the distance is halved.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. twice as strong\n\nB. four times as strong\n\nC. half as strong\n\nD. one-fourth as strong\n\nThe correct answer should be B. four times as strong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret \"twice as close.\" Maybe it could be understood as the distance being reduced to one over twice the original distance, but that seems convoluted. I think the straightforward interpretation is that if something is twice as close, it's half the distance.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes language can be tricky, but in this case, it seems pretty clear.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider numerical values. Suppose the original distance is r = 1 meter, and the charges are both 1 coulomb. Then, F = k * 1 * 1 / 1^2 = k newtons.\n\nIf the distance is halved to 0.5 meters, then F' = k * 1 * 1 / (0.5)^2 = k / 0.25 = 4k newtons.\n\nSo, indeed, the force is four times stronger.\n\nI don't see any other factor that would affect this relationship. Assuming the charges remain constant, and only the distance between them changes, the force should vary inversely as the square of the distance.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. four times as strong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
