                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, there are only two life jackets on a boat, and the person has two kids. So, the person makes sure that each of their kids has one. That sounds like a responsible parental action, ensuring the safety of their children. But is there any moral wrong here? Well, maybe I should consider if there were other people on the boat who might need a life jacket. If the person only ensured their kids had jackets without considering others, is that wrong?\n\nWait a minute, the scenario only says there were only two life jackets on the boat, and the person had two kids, so they made sure each had one. It doesn't mention any other people on the boat. So, based on the information given, it seems like the person is just taking care of their own children's safety with the available resources. That doesn't sound morally wrong; it sounds like a parent doing their duty.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, someone found a wallet in the park and returned it to the owner. Returning lost property to its owner is generally considered the right thing to do. It's honest and shows integrity. So, in this case, it's clearly not morally wrong; in fact, it's morally praiseworthy.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong. Both actions seem morally acceptable or even commendable.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that neither scenario appears to be morally wrong, the correct choice should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, ensuring one's own children have life jackets when there are only two available seems reasonable, especially if no other people are present on the boat. If there were other people, perhaps the person should consider their needs as well, but since they're not mentioned, it's safe to assume that the person is only responsible for their own children.\n\nIn Scenario 2, returning a lost wallet is unmistakably the right thing to do, as it involves returning someone else's property without keeping it for oneself.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios depict actions that are not morally wrong, making D. Not wrong, Not wrong the correct answer.\n\nI think that's the way to go. No need to overcomplicate things here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
