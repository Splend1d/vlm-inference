                    "text": "So I'm looking at these two statements about ideals in rings, and I need to figure out which ones are true. I'm not super confident with ring theory yet, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal.\"\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what a maximal ideal and a prime ideal are.\n\nA maximal ideal in a ring R is an ideal M that is proper (meaning it's not equal to R itself) and there are no other proper ideals of R that contain M. So, if you have an ideal N such that M is a subset of N and N is a subset of R, then either N equals M or N equals R.\n\nA prime ideal P in a ring R is a proper ideal with the property that if the product of two elements is in P, then at least one of the elements is in P. In other words, if a and b are elements of R and a*b is in P, then either a is in P or b is in P.\n\nSo, the question is, does every maximal ideal have this prime property?\n\nLet me think about this. Is there any maximal ideal that isn't prime?\n\nWell, in commutative rings with unity, I think maximal ideals are always prime. But let's confirm that.\n\nSuppose M is a maximal ideal in a commutative ring R with unity.\n\nWe need to show that if a*b is in M, then either a is in M or b is in M.\n\nSuppose a is not in M. Then the ideal generated by a and M, which is (a) + M, is an ideal that contains M and is strictly larger than M because a is not in M.\n\nBut M is maximal, so the only ideal containing M is M itself or R.\n\nSince (a) + M is larger than M, it must be R.\n\nTherefore, (a) + M = R, which means there exist elements r in R and m in M such that r*a + m = 1 (since 1 is the unity of R).\n\nThen, for any b in R, multiplying both sides by b: r*a*b + m*b = b.\n\nBut a*b is in M because a*b is a product with a not in M and b arbitrary.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since a*b is in M, and m*b is in M (because M is an ideal), then r*a*b + m*b = b is in M.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If b is arbitrary, then M would contain every element of R, which isn't necessarily true.\n\nI must have messed up that step.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nWe have that (a) + M = R, so there exists r in R and m in M such that r*a + m = 1.\n\nThen, for any b in R, b = b*(1) = b*(r*a + m) = r*a*b + m*b.\n\nNow, since M is an ideal, m*b is in M.\n\nAlso, since a*b is in M (which is our assumption), r*a*b is in M because M is an ideal.\n\nTherefore, b = r*a*b + m*b is a sum of elements in M, so b is in M.\n\nBut b was arbitrary, so every element of R is in M, which means M = R.\n\nBut M is a proper ideal, so this can't be.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to recall that if R is a commutative ring with unity, and M is a maximal ideal, then R/M is a field.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up a standard result.\n\nIn a commutative ring with unity, every maximal ideal is prime.\n\nSo, yes, Statement 1 is true in this context.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nLet me try to correct that.\n\nSuppose R is a commutative ring with unity, M is a maximal ideal.\n\nWe need to show that if a*b is in M, then either a is in M or b is in M.\n\nAssume a is not in M.\n\nThen, since M is maximal, (a) + M = R, as previously stated.\n\nSo, there exists r in R and m in M such that r*a + m = 1.\n\nThen, for any b in R, b = b*(1) = b*(r*a + m) = r*a*b + m*b.\n\nNow, since m*b is in M (because M is an ideal), and r*a*b is in M (because a*b is in M, and M is an ideal), their sum is in M.\n\nTherefore, b is in M.\n\nBut b was arbitrary, so every element of R is in M, which implies M = R, contradicting that M is proper.\n\nThis contradiction arises from assuming that a is not in M.\n\nTherefore, if a*b is in M and a is not in M, then b must be in M.\n\nHence, M is a prime ideal.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true for commutative rings with unity.\n\nNow, what if the ring is not commutative or doesn't have a unity?\n\nI need to check if the statement holds in those cases.\n\nFor rings without unity, the definition of maximal and prime ideals needs to be adjusted, so maybe the statement isn't necessarily true.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify the type of ring, and in most standard contexts, we consider commutative rings with unity, I'll assume that's the case.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field.\"\n\nAgain, assuming R is commutative with unity.\n\nI recall that in a commutative ring with unity, if I is a maximal ideal, then R/I is a field.\n\nLet me try to prove this.\n\nFirst, I know that R/I is a commutative ring with unity [since R has unity and I is an ideal].\n\nNext, I need to show that every nonzero element of R/I has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nLet's take a nonzero element in R/I, which is of the form a + I, where a is not in I.\n\nI need to find an element b + I such that (a + I)*(b + I) = 1 + I.\n\nThat is, I need to find b in R such that a*b is congruent to 1 modulo I.\n\nIn other words, a*b - 1 is in I.\n\nSo, a*b - 1 \u2208 I.\n\nThen, a*b \u2208 1 + I.\n\nNow, consider the ideal generated by a and I, which is (a) + I.\n\nSince I is maximal and a is not in I, (a) + I is an ideal containing I and a, which is not in I.\n\nTherefore, (a) + I must be equal to R, because I is maximal.\n\nSo, (a) + I = R.\n\nTherefore, there exists r in R and i in I such that r*a + i = 1.\n\nThen, r*a = 1 - i.\n\nSince i is in I, 1 - i is congruent to 1 modulo I.\n\nTherefore, r*a + I = 1 + I.\n\nSo, r + I is the inverse of a + I in R/I.\n\nHence, every nonzero element of R/I has an inverse, meaning R/I is a field.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nWait a second, is this only true for commutative rings with unity?\n\nI think so, because in non-commutative rings, maximal ideals may not correspond to division rings, and without unity, the quotient may not have the properties of a field.\n\nBut again, assuming the standard context of commutative rings with unity, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true in this context.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases that might make one of the statements false.\n\nFor Statement 1: In commutative rings with unity, maximal ideals are prime. If the ring doesn't have unity, things get more complicated, but since we're assuming unity, Statement 1 is true.\n\nFor Statement 2: Again, in commutative rings with unity, the quotient by a maximal ideal is a field. So, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
