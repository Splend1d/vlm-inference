                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Frederick Douglass and Chief Justice Roger Taney's opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford. The question is trying to connect Douglass's views from 1857 with Taney's stance in that case. Let me see if I can make sense of this.\n\nFirst off, the passage from Frederick Douglass is pretty strong. He's talking about the advantages slaveholders had because of the organization of the state governments and the church in slaveholding states being fully supportive of slavery. He also mentions that the Federal Government, including the army, navy, and the Supreme Court, was pledged to support and defend slavery, even to propagate it. He contrasts this with the \"simple truth\" being preached by humble people in obscure places, probably abolitionists.\n\nNow, Dred Scott v. Sandford was a landmark case in 1857, right around the time Douglass was writing this. In that case, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court. The main issue in Dred Scott was whether enslaved people could sue for their freedom in federal court, and whether the Missouri Compromise, which restricted slavery in certain territories, was constitutional.\n\nTaney's decision was that enslaved people were not citizens and therefore could not sue in federal court. Moreover, he said that Congress did not have the authority to prohibit slavery in U.S. territories. This was a huge blow to abolitionists and those who wanted to limit the expansion of slavery into new territories.\n\nLooking back at Douglass's words, he criticizes the Federal Government for supporting slavery, including through the Supreme Court. So, Taney's opinion in Dred Scott would definitely align with what Douglass is describing here.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Separate but equal facilities for people of different races was constitutional.\n\nThis is Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), not Dred Scott. Dred Scott was in 1857, and Plessy v. Ferguson came much later. So, this isn't matching.\n\nB. Corporations were entitled to the same protections guaranteed to individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis sounds like a more recent case, maybe Citizens United or something similar, but definitely not Dred Scott.\n\nC. School prayer violated the principle of \"separation of church and state.\"\n\nThis is another different case, likely Engel v. Vitale or something along those lines. Again, not related to Dred Scott.\n\nD. Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories.\n\nThis seems to align with Taney's opinion in Dred Scott. As I recalled, Taney declared that Congress did not have the power to ban slavery in the territories, which was a key part of the Dred Scott decision.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct choice. Taney's opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford upheld the sentiment from Douglass's statement by asserting that Congress had no right to regulate slavery in U.S. territories.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. Dred Scott was decided in 1857, and one of its main points was indeed that Congress could not exclude slavery from the territories. This was a significant escalation in the debate over slavery's expansion and was met with a lot of controversy at the time.\n\nFrederick Douglass, in his speech from 1857, was criticizing the pro-slavery stance of the Federal Government, including the Supreme Court. So, Taney's decision in Dred Scott would have been a prime example of what Douglass was decrying.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer. Taney upheld the sentiment that Congress had no right to regulate slavery in U.S. territories, which aligned with Douglass's criticism of the Federal Government's support for slavery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
