                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these statements about groups in abstract algebra. It's been a while since I've looked at group theory, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a solvable group is. From what I recall, a solvable group is one where you can construct a subnormal series of subgroups, each with abelian factor groups. Basically, you can keep taking normal subgroups and quotienting them out until you get to the trivial group, and at each step, the quotient group is abelian.\n\nNow, a group of prime-power order is a group whose order is \\(p^n\\) for some prime number \\(p\\) and some positive integer \\(n\\). So, for example, a group of order 8 would be of prime-power order because \\(8 = 2^3\\).\n\nStatement 1 says: Every solvable group is of prime-power order.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit strong. Let's think about this. If a group is solvable, does that mean its order must be a prime power?\n\nWell, I know that cyclic groups are solvable. For instance, any cyclic group is abelian, and abelian groups are solvable. So, take a cyclic group of order 6, which is not a prime power (since \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\)). But 6 isn't a prime power; it's the product of two primes. So, here we have a solvable group that isn't of prime-power order. Therefore, statement 1 must be false because there are solvable groups that aren't of prime-power order.\n\nWait, but maybe there are more sophisticated examples. Let's see. Consider the symmetric group \\(S_3\\), which has order 6. Is \\(S_3\\) solvable? Well, \\(S_3\\) is isomorphic to the dihedral group \\(D_6\\), which is known to be solvable. Again, its order is 6, which isn't a prime power. So, another counterexample to statement 1.\n\nAlternatively, think about \\(S_4\\), the symmetric group on 4 letters. Its order is 24, which is \\(2^3 \\times 3\\), not a prime power. Is \\(S_4\\) solvable? I think \\(S_4\\) is solvable because its commutator subgroup is \\(A_4\\), which is of index 2, and \\(A_4\\) has a non-trivial normal subgroup, so the series can be continued to the trivial group with abelian factors. So, yes, \\(S_4\\) is solvable but not of prime-power order.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false because there are solvable groups that are not of prime-power order.\n\nNow, statement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable.\n\nThis seems more plausible. I recall a theorem that says that all \\(p\\)-groups are solvable. A \\(p\\)-group is a group where the order is a power of a prime number, which matches the description of prime-power order.\n\nLet me recall the proof for this. If \\(G\\) is a \\(p\\)-group, then it has a non-trivial center (because the class equation shows that the center cannot be trivial). So, we can take the center \\(Z(G)\\), which is a normal subgroup, and quotient by it. The quotient group \\(G/Z(G)\\) has order less than that of \\(G\\), and since \\(G\\) is a \\(p\\)-group, \\(G/Z(G)\\) is also a \\(p\\)-group.\n\nWe can continue this process, taking centers and quotienting, until we reach the trivial group. At each step, the factor groups are abelian because the center is composed of elements that commute with everything in the group. Therefore, this gives us a subnormal series where all the factor groups are abelian, which means \\(G\\) is solvable.\n\nSo, statement 2 is true: every group of prime-power order is solvable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. True, False, but wait, that doesn't match because statement 1 is false, and statement 2 is true. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: True, True\n\nOption B: False, False\n\nOption C: True, False\n\nOption D: False, True\n\nGiven that statement 1 is false and statement 2 is true, the correct choice should be D. False, True.\n\nI must have misread option C earlier. So, D is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another example for statement 1. Take the Klein four-group, which has order 4 (\\(2^2\\)), so it's of prime-power order. Is it solvable? Well, it's abelian, so yes, it's solvable. But this doesn't contradict statement 1 because statement 1 claims that every solvable group is of prime-power order, not that only groups of prime-power order are solvable.\n\nWe already saw that there are solvable groups not of prime-power order, like \\(S_3\\) and \\(S_4\\), so statement 1 is indeed false.\n\nFor statement 2, we've established that all \\(p\\)-groups are solvable, so it's true.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
