The options are A, E, I, O.\" Okay, so I need to look at each of these letters and determine if they have a vertical line of symmetry.\n\nFirst up, A. If I imagine the letter A, it has a shape that looks like this: it's triangular with a base at the bottom and two lines coming up and meeting at the top. Now, if I draw a vertical line down the middle, does both sides match perfectly? Hmm. Actually, no, because the right side would be the mirror image of the left side only if the top point is exactly in the middle. But in standard lettering, the A might not be perfectly symmetrical like that. Maybe it's not perfectly symmetrical. But I need to think carefully.\n\nNext, E. The letter E has three horizontal lines and two vertical lines. If I draw a vertical line down the middle, do both sides match? Let's see, the left side has one horizontal line at the top, one in the middle, and one at the bottom, and the right side has the same arrangement. So, yes, it seems like E has a vertical axis of symmetry.\n\nI, the third option. The letter I is just a straight vertical line with a horizontal line at the top, I believe. Wait, actually, in standard typography, the letter I has a stem and sometimes serifs at the top and bottom. But generally, it's a vertical line. If I draw a vertical line down the middle, both sides are the same\u2014nothing there except the line. So, yes, it has a vertical axis of symmetry.\n\nNow, O. The letter O is a circle or an oval shape. If I draw a vertical line through the middle of O, both sides would be identical, so it definitely has a vertical axis of symmetry.\n\nSo, based on this, E, I, and O all have a vertical axis of symmetry. A seems to be the one that doesn't, at least in standard lettering. But I'm a bit unsure about A because sometimes it can be symmetrical depending on the font. But in general, I think A doesn't have a vertical axis of symmetry.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Let me try to visualize it again. The letter A typically has a base line, then two lines that ascend from the base and meet at the top. Unless the two ascending lines are exactly mirror images, which they might not be in all fonts, A might not have perfect vertical symmetry.\n\nWhereas E, I, and O consistently have vertical symmetry regardless of the font style.\n\nSo, my final answer would be A. E, I, and O have a vertical axis of symmetry, but A does not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
