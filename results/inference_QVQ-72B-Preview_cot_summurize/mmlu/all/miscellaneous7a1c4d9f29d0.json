                    "text": "So I've got this question about xeriscaping, and I need to pick which option best exemplifies the principles of xeriscaping. Let me first make sure I understand what xeriscaping is. From what I recall, xeriscaping is a type of landscaping that uses techniques to reduce water use, especially in regions where water is scarce. It involves using plants that are drought-tolerant and requires less maintenance in terms of watering.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Installs an in-ground sprinkler system that operates on a timer.\n\nHmm, a sprinkler system might seem efficient at first glance because it can water the plants evenly and on a schedule. But even with a timer, it's still using water, and if the plants don't need that much water, it might be overwatering. Xeriscaping is more about minimizing water use, so maybe this isn't the best example.\n\nB. Lowers the cutting height on the lawn mower to reduce the surface area in contact with the cutting blade.\n\nWait, lowering the cutting height. I thought that in general, it's better to keep grass a bit longer, especially in hotter climates, because longer grass can shade the soil and reduce water evaporation. So, cutting it shorter might actually increase water needs because the soil dries out faster. That doesn't sound like xeriscaping.\n\nC. Increases the use of fertilizer on the turfgrass to promote growth.\n\nMore fertilizer for more growth. But faster growth might mean the plants need more water to sustain that growth. Xeriscaping is about reducing water use, so if using more fertilizer leads to increased water needs, that contradicts xeriscaping principles.\n\nD. Replaces nonnative ornamentals with native shrubs that do not require irrigation.\n\nThis sounds promising. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, which often means they require less water than nonnative species. So, replacing plants that need irrigation with ones that don't sounds like it aligns perfectly with xeriscaping goals.\n\nLet me double-check. Xeriscaping involves using drought-tolerant plants and reducing water usage in landscaping. Option D suggests replacing nonnative plants with native shrubs that don't require irrigation. That definitely seems to fit the bill.\n\nOption A might be considered efficient but isn't necessarily xeriscaping because it still involves watering, even if it's done smartly with a timer. Option B seems counterintuitive for water conservation, and option C might actually increase water needs.\n\nSo, my best answer is D. Replaces nonnative ornamentals with native shrubs that do not require irrigation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
