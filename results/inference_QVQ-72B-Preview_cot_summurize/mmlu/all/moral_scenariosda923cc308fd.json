                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with gasoline.\" So, someone is refueling their car or maybe a motorcycle. That seems pretty straightforward. Filling up a gas tank is a normal thing people do when they need to drive somewhere. I don't see anything inherently morally wrong with that action on its own. But maybe there's more to it? Let's think about possible contexts.\n\nIs there any situation where filling a gas tank could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the person was filling the gas tank to drive to a place where they were going to commit a crime, that would be wrong, but the act of filling the tank isn't wrong in itself. Or if they were wasting gasoline unnecessarily, maybe by joyriding and polluting the environment without any real purpose, that could be seen as morally questionable, especially considering environmental concerns. But again, the act of filling the tank isn't inherently wrong; it's more about the intention behind it.\n\nHowever, the scenario just says, \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with gasoline.\" There's no context provided about why they're doing it or what they plan to use the gasoline for. So, based on the information given, it seems like a neutral action. Therefore, in this scenario, filling the gas tank is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"He went to work, and I married another.\" This one is a bit more complex. It seems like there's a story here. There are two people involved: \"he\" and \"I.\" The sentence suggests that \"he\" went to work, and while he was away, \"I\" married someone else. Hmm, that sounds like infidelity or betrayal, depending on the circumstances.\n\nLet's consider the possible contexts here. If \"he\" and \"I\" were in a committed relationship or engaged to be married, and while he was at work, I married someone else behind his back, that would be a clear case of betrayal and moral wrongdoing. Cheating on someone or breaking a commitment like that is generally considered morally wrong in most cultures, and certainly in the US as of 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a different context where this action isn't necessarily wrong. For example, perhaps \"he\" and \"I\" were not in a relationship; maybe they were just acquaintances or colleagues. If that's the case, then me marrying someone else wouldn't be a moral issue involving him at all. But the way the sentence is phrased\u2014mentioning both actions in sequence\u2014suggests that there's a connection between them.\n\nAnother possibility is that \"he went to work\" and \"I married another\" are unrelated events. Maybe \"he\" going to work is just a coincidental detail, and the main point is that \"I\" married someone else, perhaps after a breakup or the end of a previous relationship. But again, the phrasing makes it seem like these actions are linked in some way.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the context, I need to interpret this based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In general, if someone is in a monogamous relationship and marries another person without ending the first relationship, that's considered adultery and is morally wrong. Additionally, if \"he went to work\" implies that he was away and unaware of the marriage, it could be seen as deceptive or betraying his trust.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and interpreting the scenario in the most straightforward way, it seems that in Scenario 2, \"I\" did something morally wrong by marrying another person while \"he\" was at work, presumably without his knowledge or consent, especially if we were in a committed relationship.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Filling the gas tank with gasoline \u2013 not clearly morally wrong based on the information provided.\n\n- Scenario 2: Marrying another person while \"he\" was at work \u2013 likely morally wrong, assuming it involves betrayal or infidelity.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
