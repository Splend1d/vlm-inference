                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about phosphorus-31 NMR spectroscopy. It says that in a solution of sodium phosphate, only one line is seen in the 31P spectrum, and it gives me the chemical shifts for H2PO4- and HPO42-. The pH of the solution is equal to the pKa of H2PO4-, and I need to find the chemical shift under these conditions. The options are 3.41 ppm, 3.98 ppm, 4.33 ppm, and 4.62 ppm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Sodium phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH of the solution. The two main forms mentioned are H2PO4- and HPO42-. The pKa of H2PO4- is the negative log of the acid dissociation constant for the dissociation of H2PO4- into H+ and HPO42-. So, when the pH equals the pKa, the concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO42- should be equal. That's a fundamental property of buffers.\n\nSo, at pH = pKa, [H2PO4-] = [HPO42-].\n\nNow, in NMR spectroscopy, the chemical shift you observe is a weighted average of the chemical shifts of the individual species present, weighted by their concentrations.\n\nTherefore, the observed chemical shift (\u03b4_obs) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03b4_obs = (\u03b41 * [species1] + \u03b42 * [species2]) / ([species1] + [species2])\n\nIn this case, \u03b41 is 3.42 ppm for H2PO4- and \u03b42 is 5.82 ppm for HPO42-. Since at pH = pKa, [H2PO4-] = [HPO42-], let's assume [H2PO4-] = [HPO42-] = 1 for simplicity.\n\nSo, \u03b4_obs = (3.42 * 1 + 5.82 * 1) / (1 + 1) = (3.42 + 5.82) / 2 = 9.24 / 2 = 4.62 ppm\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but looking back at the options, 4.62 ppm is one of them, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe I need to consider the exact concentrations or some other factors.\n\nLet me think again. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates pH and pKa:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nWhere [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n\nIf pH = pKa, then log([A-]/[HA]) = 0, which means [A-] = [HA].\n\nSo, in this case, [HPO42-] = [H2PO4-].\n\nNow, for the chemical shift, since both species are present in equal concentrations, the observed chemical shift should indeed be the average of their individual chemical shifts.\n\nSo, \u03b4_obs = (\u03b4_H2PO4- + \u03b4_HPO42-) / 2 = (3.42 + 5.82) / 2 = 4.62 ppm\n\nBut let's see if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nIs there any possibility of rapid chemical exchange on the NMR timescale? If the interconversion between H2PO4- and HPO42- is fast enough, the NMR will see an average chemical shift, which is what I've calculated.\n\nAlso, is there any contribution from other species? For example, if there's some H3PO4 present, but given that the pH is equal to pKa, and assuming that pKa is around 7 for H2PO4-, which I believe it is, then at pH 7, H3PO4 would be minimally present, so I can probably neglect it.\n\nWait, actually, I should recall that phosphoric acid has three pKa values:\n\npKa1 \u2248 2.12 for H3PO4 \u21cc H2PO4-\n\npKa2 \u2248 7.21 for H2PO4- \u21cc HPO42-\n\npKa3 \u2248 12.32 for HPO42- \u21cc PO43-\n\nSo, at pH = pKa2 = 7.21, [H2PO4-] = [HPO42-], and [H3PO4] and [PO43-] should be negligible.\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculation should hold.\n\nBut let's double-check using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for both directions.\n\nFirst, for H2PO4- and HPO42-:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO42-]/[H2PO4-])\n\nAt pH = pKa2, log([HPO42-]/[H2PO4-]) = 0, so [HPO42-] = [H2PO4-]\n\nSimilarly, for H3PO4 and H2PO4-:\n\npH = pKa1 + log([H2PO4-]/[H3PO4])\n\nAt pH = pKa2, since pKa2 > pKa1, [H2PO4-] >> [H3PO4], so [H3PO4] is negligible.\n\nSimilarly, for HPO42- and PO43-:\n\npH = pKa3 + log([PO43-]/[HPO42-])\n\nAt pH = pKa2, since pKa3 > pKa2, [HPO42-] >> [PO43-], so [PO43-] is negligible.\n\nTherefore, at pH = pKa2, only H2PO4- and HPO42- are present in equal concentrations, and the observed chemical shift should be their average.\n\nSo, \u03b4_obs = (3.42 + 5.82)/2 = 4.62 ppm\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the exact fraction of each species at pH = pKa.\n\nThe fraction of H2PO4- at pH = pKa is equal to the fraction of HPO42-.\n\nThe fraction of H2PO4- is \u03b11 = [H2PO4-]/([H3PO4] + [H2PO4-] + [HPO42-])\n\nBut at pH = pKa2, [HPO42-] = [H2PO4-], and [H3PO4] is negligible, so \u03b11 \u2248 0.5\n\nSimilarly, \u03b12 = [HPO42-]/([H3PO4] + [H2PO4-] + [HPO42-]) \u2248 0.5\n\nTherefore, \u03b4_obs = (\u03b4_H2PO4- * \u03b11 + \u03b4_HPO42- * \u03b12) \u2248 (3.42 * 0.5 + 5.82 * 0.5) = 4.62 ppm\n\nThis reinforces my earlier calculation.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the exact pH and pKa values.\n\nGiven that pKa2 for H2PO4- is approximately 7.21, and pH = pKa2, then [H2PO4-] = [HPO42-]\n\nTherefore, \u03b4_obs = (3.42 + 5.82)/2 = 4.62 ppm\n\nBut looking back at the options, 4.62 ppm is one of them, but there are others: 3.41 ppm, 3.98 ppm, and 4.33 ppm.\n\nIs there any possibility that the observed chemical shift isn't simply the average?\n\nMaybe there's a factor I'm missing, like the activity coefficients or something, but in a basic solution like sodium phosphate, I don't think that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a correction factor due to the ionic strength or something, but that seems unlikely for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me by making me think that at pH = pKa, the chemical shift is simply the average, but perhaps there's more to it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the exact relationship between pH and pKa in the context of the NMR timescale.\n\nIf the proton exchange between H2PO4- and HPO42- is fast on the NMR timescale, which it likely is, then the observed chemical shift will indeed be the population-weighted average of the individual chemical shifts.\n\nSo, my initial calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, if the exchange were slow, I might see two peaks, but the problem states that only one line is seen, so the exchange is fast, and the average chemical shift is observed.\n\nTherefore, \u03b4_obs = (3.42 + 5.82)/2 = 4.62 ppm\n\nBut perhaps there's a more precise way to calculate this, considering the exact pH and pKa values.\n\nLet me recall that the relationship between pH and pKa is given by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nAt pH = pKa, log([A-]/[HA]) = 0, so [A-] = [HA]\n\nTherefore, [HPO42-] = [H2PO4-]\n\nThen, the observed chemical shift is:\n\n\u03b4_obs = (\u03b4_H2PO4- * [H2PO4-] + \u03b4_HPO42- * [HPO42-]) / ([H2PO4-] + [HPO42-]) = (3.42 * 1 + 5.82 * 1)/(1 + 1) = 4.62 ppm\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the fraction of each species, as I did earlier, it still leads to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 4.62 ppm.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of a weighted average based on different protonation states.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the protonation equilibrium constants.\n\nThe equilibrium between H2PO4- and HPO42- is:\n\nH2PO4- \u21cc H+ + HPO42- with Ka2 = [H+][HPO42-]/[H2PO4-]\n\nAt pH = pKa2, [H+ ]= 10^-pKa2, so [HPO42-]/[H2PO4-] = [H+]/Ka2 = 1 (since pH = pKa2)\n\nTherefore, [HPO42-] = [H2PO4-], and again, \u03b4_obs = (3.42 + 5.82)/2 = 4.62 ppm\n\nI can't see any other factor that would affect this calculation.\n\nPerhaps the confusion comes from the fact that in reality, the chemical shift might be affected by other factors like ionic strength, temperature, or specific interactions in the solution, but in this problem, it seems we're to assume ideal behavior.\n\nTherefore, the chemical shift at pH = pKa should be the average of the chemical shifts of H2PO4- and HPO42-, which is 4.62 ppm.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 4.62 ppm\n\n**Final
