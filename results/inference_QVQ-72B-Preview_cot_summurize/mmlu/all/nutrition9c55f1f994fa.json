                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Anorexia Nervosa epidemiology. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that females are three times more affected than males. Hmm, I remember that Anorexia Nervosa is more common in females, but is it exactly three times? I think the ratio might be higher than that. Maybe it's more like ten times higher in females. Let me double-check that.\n\nOption B states that it never happens in children or post-menopausal women. That seems pretty absolute. I know that eating disorders can occur across a wide age range, so saying \"never\" seems too strong. I recall cases of children as young as eight being diagnosed with anorexia, and even older adults can develop eating disorders. So, this probably isn't correct.\n\nOption C says that males from any socioeconomic background can be affected. I know that Anorexia Nervosa is often associated with females, but males can indeed be affected too. As for socioeconomic status, I think it's more common in higher socioeconomic groups, but that doesn't mean it can't affect anyone. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D mentions that prevalence rates are 2% for female adolescents. Prevalence rates can vary, but I think the lifetime prevalence of Anorexia Nervosa in females is around 0.9%, but that might be outdated. Maybe it's higher now, especially with increasing pressures in society. But 2% seems a bit high. I need to look this up.\n\nOkay, let's see. First, for option A, the male-to-female ratio in Anorexia Nervosa. I found that approximately 10-20% of cases occur in males, which means females are about five to ten times more likely to be affected. So, three times might be a bit low. Maybe it's closer to five times.\n\nFor option B, Anorexia Nervosa can definitely occur in children and post-menopausal women, although it's less common. So, saying it never happens is incorrect.\n\nOption C seems accurate. Males from any socioeconomic background can indeed be affected by Anorexia Nervosa.\n\nOption D, the prevalence rate for female adolescents being 2%. I found that the lifetime prevalence of Anorexia Nervosa in females is around 0.9% to 2.0%, so 2% is within that range, but it depends on the specific study and the population being considered.\n\nGiven that, I think the most accurate statement is option C: Males from any socioeconomic background can be affected. This is because while Anorexia Nervosa is more common in females, males are also susceptible, and socioeconomic status doesn't preclude anyone from developing the disorder.\n\nI should make sure there isn't a better option. Option A is close, but the ratio might not be exactly three times. Option B is definitely incorrect because Anorexia Nervosa can occur at any age. Option D might be somewhat accurate, but it's a bit iffy regarding the exact prevalence rate.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option C as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
