                    "text": "Let's see what's going on here. So, there's this kiosk at the Atlanta airport that sells souvenirs, and the prices range from $3.99 to $29.99, with an average price of $14.75. Now, the airport is increasing the rent by 5%, and to compensate for that, the kiosk owner is planning to raise all item prices by 50 cents. The question is asking what will happen as a result of this price increase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what mean, range, and standard deviation are. The mean is just the average price, the range is the difference between the highest and lowest prices, and the standard deviation measures how spread out the prices are from the average.\n\nSo, currently, the lowest price is $3.99, the highest is $29.99, and the mean is $14.75.\n\nIf the owner increases each price by $0.50, let's see what the new prices will be.\n\nThe new lowest price would be $3.99 + $0.50 = $4.49.\n\nThe new highest price would be $29.99 + $0.50 = $30.49.\n\nAnd the new mean would be $14.75 + $0.50 = $15.25.\n\nSo, the mean price increases by $0.50.\n\nNow, the range is the difference between the highest and lowest prices. Originally, it's $29.99 - $3.99 = $26.00.\n\nAfter the increase, it's $30.49 - $4.49 = $26.00. So, the range stays the same.\n\nAs for the standard deviation, since every price is increased by the same amount, $0.50, the spread of the prices relative to the new mean remains the same. So, the standard deviation shouldn't change.\n\nLet me double-check that. Standard deviation measures the dispersion of the data points relative to the mean. If you add a constant to all data points, the dispersion doesn't change; it's just shifted by that constant.\n\nSo, in this case, since every price is increased by exactly $0.50, the standard deviation should remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the mean increases by $0.50, the range stays the same, and the standard deviation stays the same.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the range stays the same, so this is incorrect.\n\nB. The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\n\nNo, the mean increases by $0.50, and the range stays the same. So this is incorrect.\n\nC. The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.\n\nWait, but the standard deviation shouldn't change if we add a constant to each data point. So this seems incorrect.\n\nD. The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.\n\nYes, this matches my understanding. The mean increases by $0.50, and the standard deviation remains the same.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider what happens to the standard deviation in more detail. Suppose we have a set of prices: $3.99, $4.99, $14.75, $24.99, $29.99.\n\nAdding $0.50 to each:\n\nNew prices: $4.49, $5.49, $15.25, $25.49, $30.49.\n\nLet's calculate the original standard deviation and the new one.\n\nFirst, original mean: $14.75.\n\nDifferences from mean:\n\n$3.99 - $14.75 = -$10.76\n\n$4.99 - $14.75 = -$9.76\n\n$14.75 - $14.75 = $0.00\n\n$24.99 - $14.75 = $10.24\n\n$29.99 - $14.75 = $15.24\n\nSquares of differences:\n\n($10.76)^2 = 115.7876\n\n($9.76)^2 = 95.2576\n\n($0.00)^2 = 0.0000\n\n($10.24)^2 = 104.8576\n\n($15.24)^2 = 232.2576\n\nSum of squares: 115.7876 + 95.2576 + 0.0000 + 104.8576 + 232.2576 = 548.1604\n\nNumber of data points, n = 5\n\nStandard deviation, \u03c3 = sqrt(sum of squares / n) = sqrt(548.1604 / 5) = sqrt(109.63208) \u2248 10.47\n\nNow, new mean: $15.25\n\nDifferences from new mean:\n\n$4.49 - $15.25 = -$10.76\n\n$5.49 - $15.25 = -$9.76\n\n$15.25 - $15.25 = $0.00\n\n$25.49 - $15.25 = $10.24\n\n$30.49 - $15.25 = $15.24\n\nSquares of differences:\n\nSame as before: 115.7876, 95.2576, 0.0000, 104.8576, 232.2576\n\nSum of squares: 548.1604\n\nStandard deviation: sqrt(548.1604 / 5) \u2248 10.47\n\nSo, the standard deviation remains the same, confirming that adding a constant to each data point doesn't change the standard deviation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
