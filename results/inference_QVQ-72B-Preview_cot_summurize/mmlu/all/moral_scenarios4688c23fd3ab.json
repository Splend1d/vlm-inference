                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not super familiar with what was going on in 2020, but I'll try my best to apply general moral principles to these situations.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I was all out of face paint for my child's Halloween outfit, so I used furniture paint since I had to improvise.\"\n\nOkay, so the context is Halloween, and the parent is trying to complete their child's costume by applying face paint. But instead of using regular face paint, they're using furniture paint because they ran out of the proper stuff. Now, the question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few things here. First, is there any harm intended or potential harm that could come from using furniture paint on a child's face? Face paint is typically made from ingredients that are safe for skin, especially for children. Furniture paint, on the other hand, is meant for surfaces like tables and chairs, not for human skin. It might contain chemicals that aren't safe for topical application, especially near the eyes or mouth.\n\nSo, from a safety perspective, using furniture paint on a child's face could be risky. It might cause skin irritation, allergies, or other health issues. Therefore, from an ordinary moral standpoint, putting something on a child that isn't intended for skin use could be considered wrong because it poses potential health risks.\n\nBut, maybe the parent was in a hurry or didn't have access to face paint, hence the improvisation. While I understand the desire to make the costume perfect, the well-being and safety of the child should always come first. There are other ways to handle such a situation, like using household items that are known to be safe for skin, such as food coloring diluted with water, or even skipping the face paint altogether.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the parent's decision to use furniture paint seems reckless and potentially harmful, which aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as being wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I helped him in academics by doing his paper.\"\n\nThis scenario involves academic assistance, specifically doing a paper for someone else. The question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nIn academic settings, integrity is crucial. Most educational institutions have strict policies against plagiarism and cheating, which includes having someone else do your work for you. When a student submits a paper that they didn't write themselves, it's essentially presenting someone else's work as their own, which is dishonest.\n\nMoreover, doing someone else's paper can be seen as enabling academic dishonesty. It deprives the student of the learning experience that writing the paper was intended to provide. Education is about acquiring knowledge and skills, and bypassing that process undermines the entire purpose of academics.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, helping someone cheat is generally considered wrong because it violates principles of honesty and fairness. Other students who do their own work might be at a disadvantage if some are getting better grades through cheating.\n\nHowever, there might be extenuating circumstances where a person feels compelled to help someone with their academics in this way. For example, perhaps the person asking for help has urgent personal issues preventing them from completing the paper themselves, and they're at risk of failing the course without assistance.\n\nBut even in such cases, the moral dilemma remains. While the intention might be to help a friend or family member, the means employed\u2014cheating\u2014compromises ethical standards.\n\nIn the US, academic integrity is highly valued, and actions that compromise it are typically considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on these analyses, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question mentions multiple-choice options, and option A is \"Wrong, Wrong.\" But I need to make sure I'm not missing something here.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning for each scenario.\n\nIn Scenario 1, using furniture paint on a child's face is potentially harmful, as furniture paint isn't designed for skin application. It could cause allergic reactions or other health problems, which would be considered morally wrong due to the risk to the child's well-being.\n\nIn Scenario 2, doing someone else's paper is clearly against academic integrity rules and is generally seen as cheating, which is morally wrong because it involves dishonesty and unfair advantage.\n\nSo, yes, both actions are morally wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any scenarios where these actions might not be considered wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps if the furniture paint was specifically labeled as non-toxic and safe for skin use, then it might not be morally wrong. However, without that information, assuming it's safe is irresponsible.\n\nFor Scenario 2, even if the person doing the paper believed they were helping a friend in need, the act still constitutes academic dishonesty, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
