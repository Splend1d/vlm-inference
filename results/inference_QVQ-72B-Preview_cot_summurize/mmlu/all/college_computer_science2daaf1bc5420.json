                    "text": "So I have this recurrence relation: T(1) = 7 and T(n + 1) = 3n + T(n) for all integers n \u2265 1. I need to find out the order of growth of T(n), which means I need to determine how T(n) grows as n gets larger. The options are \u0398(n), \u0398(n log n), \u0398(n\u00b2), and \u0398(n\u00b2 log n).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this recurrence relation is saying. It defines T(n + 1) in terms of T(n) and n. Specifically, each step, T(n + 1) is equal to T(n) plus 3n. So, it's like building up T(n) step by step, adding 3n each time.\n\nTo find T(n), maybe I can try to expand this recurrence relation. Let's see:\n\nStart with T(1) = 7.\n\nThen, T(2) = 3*1 + T(1) = 3 + 7 = 10.\n\nT(3) = 3*2 + T(2) = 6 + 10 = 16.\n\nT(4) = 3*3 + T(3) = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nT(5) = 3*4 + T(4) = 12 + 25 = 37.\n\nHmm, let's look at these values:\n\nn | T(n)\n---|------\n1 | 7\n2 | 10\n3 | 16\n4 | 25\n5 | 37\n\nIt seems like T(n) is increasing, but not as fast as n\u00b2. For example, at n=5, n\u00b2 is 25, and T(5) is 37, which is bigger than 25, but n\u00b2 grows faster as n increases. Wait, no, at n=5, n\u00b2=25, but T(5)=37, which is bigger than 25. But at n=10, n\u00b2=100, and T(10) would be 3*9 + T(9), and T(9)=3*8 + T(8), and so on, back to T(1)=7.\n\nMaybe I should try to express T(n) in terms of n directly.\n\nLet me try to write T(n) in terms of T(1):\n\nT(2) = 3*1 + T(1)\n\nT(3) = 3*2 + T(2) = 3*2 + 3*1 + T(1)\n\nT(4) = 3*3 + T(3) = 3*3 + 3*2 + 3*1 + T(1)\n\nSo, in general, T(n) = 3*(n-1) + 3*(n-2) + ... + 3*1 + T(1)\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me try to generalize this pattern.\n\nActually, from the recurrence:\n\nT(n) = 3*(n-1) + T(n-1)\n\nT(n-1) = 3*(n-2) + T(n-2)\n\n...\n\nT(2) = 3*1 + T(1)\n\nT(1) = 7\n\nSo, if I substitute back:\n\nT(n) = 3*(n-1) + [3*(n-2) + T(n-2)]\n\n= 3*(n-1) + 3*(n-2) + [3*(n-3) + T(n-3)]\n\n...\n\nContinuing this way, I get:\n\nT(n) = 3*(n-1) + 3*(n-2) + 3*(n-3) + ... + 3*1 + T(1)\n\nSo, T(n) = sum from k=1 to n-1 of 3k + 7\n\nWait, no, it's T(n) = sum from k=1 to n-1 of 3k + T(1)\n\nWait, but in the expansion above, it's 3*(n-1) + 3*(n-2) + ... + 3*1 + T(1)\n\nSo, T(n) = 3*(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) + T(1)\n\nI know that the sum of the first m integers is m(m+1)/2, so sum from 1 to n-1 is (n-1)n/2\n\nTherefore, T(n) = 3*(n-1)*n/2 + 7\n\nWait, but T(1)=7, T(2)=10, T(3)=16, T(4)=25, T(5)=37\n\nLet's plug in n=2: 3*(2-1)*2/2 + 7 = 3*1*2/2 +7 = 3*1 +7 = 10, which matches.\n\nn=3: 3*2*3/2 +7 = 9 +7 =16, matches.\n\nn=4: 3*3*4/2 +7 = 18 +7 =25, matches.\n\nn=5: 3*4*5/2 +7 = 30 +7 =37, matches.\n\nSo, T(n) = 3*(n-1)*n/2 + 7 = (3/2)n\u00b2 - (3/2)n +7\n\nSo, T(n) = (3/2)n\u00b2 - (3/2)n +7\n\nNow, I need to find the order of growth, which is the highest degree term's order.\n\nHere, the highest degree term is (3/2)n\u00b2, so the order should be \u0398(n\u00b2)\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the (3/2)n\u00b2 term dominates over the linear term and the constant.\n\nTherefore, T(n) is \u0398(n\u00b2)\n\nSo, the answer should be C. \u0398(n\u00b2)\n\nLet me check again to make sure.\n\nAlternative approach: using generating functions or solving the recurrence directly.\n\nThe recurrence is T(n+1) = 3n + T(n)\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: T(n+1) - T(n) = 0\n\nThis gives T(n) = constant.\n\nThen, find a particular solution for T(n+1) - T(n) = 3n\n\nTry T_p(n) = An + B\n\nThen, T_p(n+1) = A(n+1) + B = An + A + B\n\nSet T_p(n+1) - T_p(n) = 3n\n\nSo, An + A + B - An - B = A = 3n\n\nThis implies A = 3n, but A is a constant, so this doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my guess.\n\nLet me try T_p(n) = An\u00b2 + Bn + C\n\nThen, T_p(n+1) = A(n+1)\u00b2 + B(n+1) + C = An\u00b2 + 2An + A + Bn + B + C\n\nSo, T_p(n+1) - T_p(n) = An\u00b2 + 2An + A + Bn + B + C - (An\u00b2 + Bn + C) = 2An + A + B\n\nSet this equal to 3n:\n\n2An + A + B = 3n + 0\n\nSo, 2A = 3 \u21d2 A = 3/2\n\nAnd A + B = 0 \u21d2 3/2 + B = 0 \u21d2 B = -3/2\n\nSo, T_p(n) = (3/2)n\u00b2 - (3/2)n + C\n\nNow, the general solution is T(n) = T_h(n) + T_p(n) = C + (3/2)n\u00b2 - (3/2)n + C\n\nBut from the initial condition, T(1) = 7\n\nSo, T(1) = C + (3/2)(1)\u00b2 - (3/2)(1) + C = C + 3/2 - 3/2 + C = 2C = 7 \u21d2 C = 7/2\n\nTherefore, T(n) = (3/2)n\u00b2 - (3/2)n + 7/2\n\nWhich matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, T(n) = (3/2)n\u00b2 - (3/2)n + 7/2\n\nThus, the dominant term is (3/2)n\u00b2, so T(n) is \u0398(n\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \u0398(n\u00b2)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
