                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Nussbaum and Aristotle's view on virtue terms. The question is: \"Nussbaum claims that for Aristotle the reference of each virtue term is fixed by:\n\nA. conventional use.\n\nB. grounding experiences.\n\nC. a thick description of the virtue.\n\nD. tradition.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to recall who Nussbaum is and what she says about Aristotle's virtues.\n\nMartha Nussbaum is a contemporary philosopher who has written extensively on ancient philosophy, including Aristotle's ethics. She's known for her interpretations of Aristotelian virtues and their application to modern ethical issues.\n\nNow, Aristotle's virtue ethics is centered around the concept of virtues being mean between extremes, but that's a bit simplistic. He talks about moral virtues and intellectual virtues, and how they are developed through practice and habituation.\n\nThe question is about the \"reference\" of each virtue term. In philosophy, the reference of a term is what it denotes or points to in the world. So, how does Aristotle determine what counts as a virtue, and how is that concept fixed or defined?\n\nOption A is \"conventional use.\" This might suggest that the meaning of virtue terms is determined by how people commonly use them in language. But Aristotle's view is more substantive than that. He doesn't think that virtues are just whatever society says they are at a given time. Instead, he believes in objective virtues based on reason and human nature.\n\nOption B is \"grounding experiences.\" This sounds a bit vague, but it might refer to the experiences that form the basis of our understanding of virtues. Aristotle does emphasize the role of experience and practice in developing virtues. He says that we become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, and so on. So, perhaps our understanding of virtues is grounded in our experiences of practicing them.\n\nOption C is \"a thick description of the virtue.\" Thick description is a term used in philosophy and anthropology to refer to a detailed, context-rich account of a concept or practice. It involves not just defining something but providing a rich understanding that includes its social, cultural, and moral significance. Aristotle's approach to virtues is quite detailed and context-dependent. He doesn't offer a one-size-fits-all definition of courage or temperance; rather, he discusses how these virtues manifest differently in different situations and for different people.\n\nOption D is \"tradition.\" Tradition can play a role in shaping our understanding of virtues, as many virtues have been passed down through generations. However, Aristotle's approach isn't solely based on tradition. He uses reason and observation to determine what virtues are excellent and worthwhile.\n\nSo, considering these options, I need to think about which one best captures Nussbaum's view on how Aristotle fixes the reference of virtue terms.\n\nLet me consider Nussbaum's writings. She often emphasizes the importance of particular contexts and the role of phronesis or practical wisdom in Aristotle's ethics. Phronesis is the ability to discern the right course of action in a given situation, which involves a deep understanding of human emotions, motivations, and social contexts.\n\nGiven that, it seems that Nussbaum would argue that the reference of virtue terms is fixed by a rich, contextually informed understanding\u2014i.e., a thick description of the virtue. This aligns with Aristotle's emphasis on particularity and practical wisdom.\n\nMoreover, while experience is important in Aristotle's ethics, it's not just any experience that grounds our understanding of virtues. It's through reflecting on our experiences, guided by reason and practical wisdom, that we come to grasp what virtues truly are.\n\nConventional use and tradition, while they may influence our understanding, don't capture the active, reflective process that Aristotle emphasizes in cultivating and understanding virtues.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: a thick description of the virtue.\n\nBut to make sure, let me see if there's any specific text from Nussbaum that supports this interpretation.\n\nI recall that in her book \"Upheavals of Thought: The Intelligence of Emotions,\" Nussbaum discusses the importance of thick descriptions in understanding emotional life, which is closely tied to virtues in Aristotle's ethics. She argues that thick descriptions help us grasp the full significance of emotions and their roles in human flourishing.\n\nSimilarly, in \"The Fragility of Goodness,\" she explores the concept of virtue in Greek tragedy and philosophy, emphasizing the complexity and contextuality of virtuous actions.\n\nGiven this, it seems consistent that Nussbaum would view Aristotle's virtue terms as referenced by thick descriptions, rather than by mere convention or tradition.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
