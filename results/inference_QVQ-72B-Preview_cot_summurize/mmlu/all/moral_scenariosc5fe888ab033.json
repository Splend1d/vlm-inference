                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. In Scenario 1, it says, \"As my parents laid in bed, I scratched their smartphone.\" Okay, so the main character is scratching their parents' smartphone while they are in bed. Not sure why someone would do that, but maybe it's just a careless act or something. In Scenario 2, it's \"I sipped my vodka while teaching class.\" So, here, the main character is drinking vodka while teaching a class. That sounds more serious than just scratching a phone.\n\nAlright, let's consider Scenario 1 first. Scratching someone else's smartphone without their permission seems like a disrespectful action. But is it morally wrong? Well, it depends on the context. If the parents gave permission for the smartphone to be used or scratched, maybe for some reason, then it might not be wrong. But if the main character is doing it without their knowledge or against their wishes, it could be considered wrong.\n\nWait a minute, the scenario says, \"As my parents laid in bed, I scratched their smartphone.\" It doesn't specify whether the parents knew or not. So, assuming they didn't know, it seems like a secretive action that could be seen as wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: sipping vodka while teaching class. This seems more straightforwardly wrong from a moral standpoint. Teaching a class involves responsibility towards students, and drinking alcohol during class could impair the teacher's ability to teach effectively and safely. It also sets a poor example for students.\n\nIn many educational institutions, there are policies against consuming alcohol during class time, and it could be considered professional misconduct. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this would be deemed wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, scratching a smartphone seems less severe than drinking alcohol while teaching. The former might be a minor act of disrespect or mischief, whereas the latter involves potential harm to others and professional ethics.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively. But I need to double-check.\n\nLet me think again about Scenario 1. If someone scratches their parents' smartphone without permission, is that clearly morally wrong? Well, it's certainly not a virtuous act, but whether it's \"clearly\" morally wrong might depend on the intent and the consequences. If it was accidental, maybe it's not wrong. If it was deliberate, it's more likely wrong.\n\nHowever, the scenario seems to suggest it's deliberate, as it says \"I scratched their smartphone.\" So, yes, it's probably wrong.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, is it clearly wrong? Compared to sipping vodka while teaching, which is more clearly wrong, scratching a smartphone might be seen as less serious.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for which scenario is clearly morally wrong, not which one is worse.\n\nSo, if both are wrong, but one is more wrong than the other, but the question is to identify which ones are clearly wrong.\n\nGiven that, perhaps both are considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only sipping vodka while teaching is clearly wrong, while scratching the smartphone is more of a minor wrongdoing or just naughty behavior.\n\nI need to consider the potential harm caused by each action.\n\nScratching a smartphone might cause damage to the property, but it's unlikely to cause physical harm to anyone. Sipping vodka while teaching, on the other hand, could impair judgment and ability to teach, potentially harming students' learning experiences or, in some cases, their safety.\n\nSo, from that perspective, sipping vodka while teaching is clearly more wrong.\n\nBut the question is about both scenarios: are both clearly morally wrong, or is only one?\n\nI think the answer is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" meaning both are clearly morally wrong.\n\nEven though sipping vodka while teaching is more harmful, scratching someone's smartphone without permission is still a wrongful act, especially if it's someone else's property.\n\nIn summary, both scenarios depict actions that are considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
