                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find the pH of a solution made by dissolving 0.0300 moles of sodium ethanoate in enough water to make 50 milliliters of solution. The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for ethanoic acid is 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5. The options are A. 7, B. 9.26, C. 4.74, and D. 11.02.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Sodium ethanoate is the salt of a weak acid (ethanoic acid) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide). When you dissolve sodium ethanoate in water, it will dissociate into sodium ions (Na+) and ethanoate ions (CH3COO-). The ethanoate ions can react with water to form ethanoic acid and hydroxide ions, which will make the solution basic. So, I expect the pH to be greater than 7.\n\nNow, to calculate the pH, I can use the relationship between the concentration of the salt and the Ka of the weak acid. There's a formula that relates the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base to the Ka of the weak acid and the concentration of the salt.\n\nThe formula is:\n\npH = 14 + pKa + log([salt]/[acid])\n\nWait, but in this case, there's no acid present initially; only the salt is dissolved in water. So, maybe I should use the formula for the pH of a solution containing the conjugate base of a weak acid.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, I can use the formula:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nBut I think the more accurate formula is:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nLet me confirm that.\n\nFirst, find the pKa of ethanoic acid. The Ka is given as 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5, so pKa = -log(1.8 \u00d7 10^-5) = 4.74.\n\nNext, find the concentration of the salt. The problem says 0.0300 moles dissolved in 50 milliliters of solution. So, the molarity [salt] = moles per liter = 0.0300 mol / 0.050 L = 0.60 M.\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\npH = 7 + (4.74 - log 0.60)\n\nFirst, calculate log 0.60. Log 0.60 is approximately -0.22.\n\nSo, pH = 7 + (4.74 - (-0.22)) = 7 + (4.74 + 0.22) = 7 + 4.96 = 11.96\n\nHmm, but this isn't matching any of the options. The closest option is D. 11.02, but that's not the same as 11.96.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the formula I used.\n\nUpon checking, I realize that the correct formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base is:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nBut actually, the standard Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nWhere [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nIn this case, since only the salt is dissolved, there's no weak acid present initially, so [HA] = 0. That might be why my previous approach isn't working.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the hydrolysis of the ethanoate ion.\n\nThe ethanoate ion (CH3COO-) will react with water to form ethanoic acid and hydroxide ions:\n\nCH3COO- + H2O \u21cc CH3COOH + OH-\n\nThe base dissociation constant (Kb) for ethanoate can be calculated from Ka of ethanoic acid.\n\nWe know that Kw = Ka * Kb for water at 25\u00b0C, where Kw = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14.\n\nSo, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 = 5.56 \u00d7 10^-10.\n\nNow, the concentration of ethanoate ions is 0.60 M.\n\nThe Kb expression is:\n\nKb = [OH-]^2 / [CH3COO-]\n\nAssuming that the concentration of OH- produced is 'x', then:\n\n5.56 \u00d7 10^-10 = x^2 / 0.60\n\nSo, x^2 = 5.56 \u00d7 10^-10 * 0.60 = 3.336 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nThus, x = [OH-] = sqrt(3.336 \u00d7 10^-10) \u2248 5.77 \u00d7 10^-6 M\n\nNow, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - (-log [OH-]) = 14 - (-log(5.77 \u00d7 10^-6))\n\nCalculate -log(5.77 \u00d7 10^-6) \u2248 5.24\n\nTherefore, pH \u2248 14 - 5.24 = 8.76\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options either.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb.\n\nLet me recalculate Kb.\n\nKw = Ka * Kb\n\nSo, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nThen, Kb = [OH-]^2 / [CH3COO-]\n\nLet\u2019s set up the ICE table for the hydrolysis:\n\nInitial: [CH3COO-] = 0.60 M, [OH-] = 0 M\n\nChange: -x M, +x M\n\nEquilibrium: (0.60 - x) M, x M\n\nSo, Kb = x^2 / (0.60 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.60 (assuming x is small compared to 0.60)\n\nThen, x^2 / 0.60 = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nSo, x^2 = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10 * 0.60 = 3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nThus, x = [OH-] \u2248 5.77 \u00d7 10^-6 M\n\nThen, pOH = -log(5.77 \u00d7 10^-6) \u2248 5.24\n\nTherefore, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.24 = 8.76\n\nBut this still doesn't match the options. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me try using the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nGiven that, pKa = 4.74, [salt] = 0.60 M\n\nSo, pH = 7 + (4.74 - log 0.60)\n\nLog 0.60 \u2248 -0.22\n\nThus, pH = 7 + (4.74 - (-0.22)) = 7 + 4.96 = 11.96\n\nBut earlier, using the Kb approach, I got pH \u2248 8.76, which is quite different from 11.96.\n\nThere must be something wrong with one of these approaches.\n\nLet me check the assumptions. In the Kb approach, I assumed that x is much smaller than 0.60 M, so that (0.60 - x) \u2248 0.60.\n\nBut x = [OH-] \u2248 5.77 \u00d7 10^-6 M, which is indeed much smaller than 0.60 M, so that approximation should be valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the autoionization of water, but since the salt is producing OH-, the solution is basic, and the contribution from water's autoionization might be negligible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider the concentration units properly.\n\nThe concentration of the salt is 0.60 M, but in the formula, [salt] should be in moles per liter, which it is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I used initially is incorrect. Maybe I should use the formula for the pH of a buffer, but this isn't a buffer because there's no weak acid present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nBut I think that's for a salt of a weak acid and strong base, where the conjugate base is present and will hydrolyze to produce OH-, making the solution basic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nBut according to my textbook, the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and strong base is:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nWait, actually, I think that's not correct. Let me look it up.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base is:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nBut according to some sources, it's:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nHowever, I'm starting to doubt this formula because it's not giving me the expected result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nBut in that case, as I calculated earlier, pH \u2248 11.96, which doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula should be:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nBut that seems similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a solution containing only the conjugate base:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nBut in this case, [HA] = 0, since there's no ethanoic acid present initially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that when the salt dissolves, it completely dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO-, and the CH3COO- ions hydrolyze to form CH3COOH and OH-, establishing an equilibrium.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nCH3COO- + H2O \u21cc CH3COOH + OH-\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nLet\u2019s denote the concentration of OH- produced as 'x'. Then, the concentration of CH3COO- decreases by 'x', and the concentration of CH3COOH increases by 'x'.\n\nSo, the equilibrium expression is:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.60 M, we can approximate [CH3COO-] as 0.60 M.\n\nThus, Kb \u2248 x^2 / 0.60\n\nSo, x^2 = Kb * 0.60 = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10 * 0.60 = 3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nThen, x = [OH-] \u2248 sqrt(3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10) \u2248 5.77 \u00d7 10^-6 M\n\nThen, pOH = -log(5.77 \u00d7 10^-6) \u2248 5.24\n\nTherefore, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.24 = 8.76\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nOption D is 11.02, which is close to what I got earlier using the incorrect formula.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, but I have the wrong formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula:\n\npH = 14 + pKa + log([salt]/[acid])\n\nBut in this case, there's no acid present, so [acid] = 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is:\n\npH = 7 + (pKa - log [salt])\n\nBut as I calculated, that gives pH \u2248 11.96, which isn't matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the concentration of the salt in moles per liter, which is 0.60 M, and use that directly in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the activity coefficients or other corrections, but that seems unlikely for this level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the salt is sodium ethanoate, and ethanoate is the conjugate base of ethanoic acid, so in solution, it will hydrolyze to produce OH-, making the solution basic.\n\nGiven that, the pH should be greater than 7, which aligns with options B and D.\n\nGiven that my calculations using both the Kb approach and the incorrect formula give pH values around 8.76 and 11.96, respectively, and the options are B. 9.26 and D. 11.02, perhaps the correct answer is D. 11.02.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the Kb calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate Kb.\n\nKb = Kw / Ka = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nThen, Kb = [OH-]^2 / [CH3COO-]\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of OH- produced, then:\n\n5.556 \u00d7 10^-10 = x^2 / 0.60\n\nSo, x^2 = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10 * 0.60 = 3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nThus, x = sqrt(3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10) \u2248 5.77 \u00d7 10^-6 M\n\nThen, pOH = -log(5.77 \u00d7 10^-6) \u2248 5.24\n\nTherefore, pH = 14 - 5.24 = 8.76\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the salt is sodium ethanoate, and ethanoate is the conjugate base of ethanoic acid, so the pH should be basic, but 8.76 seems too low compared to the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the concentration of the salt more carefully.\n\nGiven that the concentration is 0.60 M, which is relatively high, maybe the approximation that x is negligible compared to 0.60 M isn't valid.\n\nIn that case, I need to solve the quadratic equation.\n\nSo, Kb = x^2 / (0.60 - x) = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nLet\u2019s set up the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 + (5.556 \u00d7 10^-10)x - (5.556 \u00d7 10^-10 * 0.60) = 0\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, Kb = x^2 / (0.60 - x)\n\nSo, x^2 = Kb * (0.60 - x)\n\nThus, x^2 = (5.556 \u00d7 10^-10)(0.60 - x)\n\nThen, x^2 = 3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10 - (5.556 \u00d7 10^-10)x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx^2 + (5.556 \u00d7 10^-10)x - 3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nWhere a = 1, b = 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10, and c = -3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nD = b^2 - 4ac = (5.556 \u00d7 10^-10)^2 - 4(1)(-3.3336 \u00d7 10^-10)\n\nD = 3.087 \u00d7 10^-19 + 1.33344 \u00d7 10^-9 = 1.33344 \u00d7 10^-9\n\nThus, x = [-5.556 \u00d7 10^-10 \u00b1 sqrt(1.33344 \u00d7 10^-9)] / 2\n\nsqrt(1.33344 \u00d7 10^-9) \u2248 1.1547 \u00d7 10^-5\n\nSo, x = [-5.556 \u00d7 10^-10 \u00b1 1.1547 \u00d7 10^-5] / 2\n\nThe positive root is x \u2248 (1.1547 \u00d7 10^-5 - 5.556 \u00d7 10^-10) / 2 \u2248 1.1547 \u00d7 10^-5 / 2 \u2248 5.77 \u00d7 10^-6 M\n\nWhich is the same as what I got earlier using the approximation.\n\nTherefore, pOH = -log(5.77 \u00d7 10^-6) \u2248 5.24\n\nThus, pH = 14 - 5.24 = 8.76\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the problem or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to"
