                    "text": " So I'm reading this article, and it's about how colleges and universities in America are supposedly encouraging a certain type of reasoning among students. The authors, Lukianoff and Haidt, seem to be making a point about emotional reasoning being promoted on campus. Let me see if I can understand their argument properly.\n\nFirst off, the question is asking what Lukianoff and Haidt argue that American colleges and universities now encourage. The options are:\n\nA. emotional reasoning.\n\nB. critical reasoning.\n\nC. reflective reasoning.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nFrom what I recall, emotional reasoning is when someone makes decisions or interpretations based primarily on their feelings or emotions rather than on facts or logic. Critical reasoning involves analyzing information and making judgments based on evidence and logical thinking. Reflective reasoning is about thinking deeply about one's own thoughts and experiences, often to gain insight or understanding.\n\nSo, based on the names, it seems like critical and reflective reasoning are more about thoughtful, logical analysis, while emotional reasoning is more about feelings overriding logical thought.\n\nNow, Lukianoff and Haidt are known for their views on campus culture, particularly in their book \"The Coddling of the American Mind.\" They argue that there has been a shift in how universities approach student well-being and education, sometimes prioritizing safety and comfort over exposure to challenging ideas.\n\nIn this context, they might be suggesting that universities are encouraging students to base their responses more on emotions rather than on critical or reflective thinking.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If universities are creating an environment where students are shielded from views that make them uncomfortable, where trigger warnings are common, and where safe spaces are provided to protect students from distressing ideas, then perhaps they are fostering an environment where emotional responses are valued over engaging with difficult or opposing viewpoints.\n\nIn such an environment, students might be more likely to rely on their emotions to guide their thinking and actions, rather than learning to critically evaluate different perspectives or reflect on their own biases and assumptions.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe universities are still promoting critical and reflective thinking in classrooms, while also providing emotional support services to help students manage the stresses of academic life.\n\nBut Lukianoff and Haidt seem to be critical of certain trends in higher education, suggesting that by prioritizing students' emotional comfort, universities are inadvertently teaching them to see the world through an emotional lens rather than developing their ability to think critically and reflectively.\n\nThey might also be referring to the concept of \"microaggressions,\" where even seemingly small insensitivities are seen as harmful and require intervention. This could lead to an environment where people are encouraged to interpret actions through the lens of how they make them feel, rather than considering the intent or broader context.\n\nSo, in this framework, emotional reasoning is being elevated, perhaps at the expense of critical and reflective thinking.\n\nBut wait, couldn't one argue that reflective thinking also involves considering one's emotions? After all, reflecting on one's own thoughts and experiences might include acknowledging and understanding one's emotions as part of that process.\n\nYes, that's a good point. Reflective thinking can involve emotional intelligence, where one recognizes and manages their emotions as part of the reflection process.\n\nHowever, Lukianoff and Haidt seem to be critiquing a specific kind of emotional reasoning where emotions override rational thought, leading to oversensitivity and a lack of resilience.\n\nIn their view, perhaps, universities are encouraging students to base their reactions too heavily on their emotions, without sufficiently teaching them to think critically about the validity of those emotions or to reflect on them in a way that promotes growth and open-mindedness.\n\nSo, in this context, it seems like they're suggesting that emotional reasoning is being promoted over critical and reflective reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. emotional reasoning.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any indication that they're advocating for all of the above.\n\nIf they're criticizing universities for coddling students and not exposing them to challenging ideas, then it's likely that they believe critical reasoning is being suppressed, not encouraged.\n\nSimilarly, if students are encouraged to base their responses on emotions rather than on logical analysis, then critical reasoning is probably being downplayed.\n\nAs for reflective reasoning, it's possible that universities are encouraging reflection, but in a way that reinforces emotional responses rather than challenging them.\n\nFor example, reflecting on how a certain idea makes one feel, without also critically evaluating the idea itself or considering alternative perspectives.\n\nSo, in that case, reflective reasoning might still be occurring, but it's being directed towards reinforcing emotional responses rather than fostering deeper understanding or open-mindedness.\n\nGiven that, it seems that Lukianoff and Haidt are primarily arguing that emotional reasoning is being unduly emphasized in universities, potentially at the expense of critical and reflective thinking.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. emotional reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
