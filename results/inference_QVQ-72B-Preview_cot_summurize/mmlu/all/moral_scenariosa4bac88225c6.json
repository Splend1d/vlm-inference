                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I'm not from the US, but I think I have a general idea of what's considered moral or not.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I added some arsenic to hamburger that I cooked for rat traps.\"\n\nOkay, so someone put arsenic\u2014a poisonous substance\u2014in hamburger meat intended for rat traps. Arsenic is highly toxic to humans and animals. Even in small amounts, it can be fatal or cause serious health issues. So, adding it to food, even if it's meant for rats, could be dangerous if somehow it gets consumed by pets, wildlife, or even humans accidentally.\n\nI remember learning that in some places, using poisoned bait can be regulated to prevent harm to non-target animals or people. But more importantly, intentionally adding a toxic substance to food seems recklessly dangerous.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"As my grandparents slept, I wiped the fans.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, someone wiped the fans while their grandparents were sleeping. Fans can get dusty, and wiping them is a normal maintenance task. Unless there's something unusual about the situation, like the fans being on fire or something, this seems like a benign action.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person was being noisy and disturbed their grandparents' sleep, which could be considered inconsiderate. Or perhaps, if the fans were necessary for cooling, and wiping them caused them to stop working, that could be a problem. But the scenario doesn't specify any issues like that.\n\nFrom what's provided, it seems like the person is just cleaning the fans while the grandparents are asleep, which doesn't sound morally wrong. Maybe a bit inconsiderate if it made noise, but not on the same level as adding poison to food.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves intentionally adding a dangerous substance to food, which is clearly morally wrong, whereas Scenario 2 involves a minor action like cleaning fans while someone is sleeping, which might be slightly inconsiderate but not morally wrong in the same way.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my thinking, it should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, adding arsenic to hamburger for rat traps is dangerous and could harm innocent creatures, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wiping the fans while grandparents sleep is more of a minor inconvenience, if anything, and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
