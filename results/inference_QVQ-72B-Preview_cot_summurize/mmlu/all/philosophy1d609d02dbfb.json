                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Cicero's views on morality and expediency. The options are all about whether these concepts are \"repugnant to Nature\" or \"in accord with Nature.\" I need to figure out which one fits for immorality and which for expediency.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what Cicero thought about morality and nature. Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who lived in the 1st century BC. He was influenced by Greek philosophy, especially Stoicism, which emphasized living in accordance with nature.\n\nSo, Stoics believed that living in accord with nature is the highest good, and virtue is the only good. Vice or immorality would be against nature, right? Because vice goes against the natural order and the rationality that Stoics valued.\n\nNow, expediency often refers to acting in a way that is convenient or advantageous in the short term, sometimes at the expense of principle or morality. So, if something is expedient, it might be practical or beneficial, but not necessarily moral.\n\nGiven that, if immorality is against nature, as Stoics would suggest, then it would be \"repugnant to Nature.\" Similarly, if expediency involves acting against nature for short-term gain, it would also be against nature.\n\nWait, but one of the options might suggest that expediency is in accord with nature. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider Cicero's specific views. He was a proponent of virtue ethics, emphasizing the importance of virtue and moral character. He also believed in the idea of \"natural law,\" which holds that there are universal moral principles derived from human nature and reason.\n\nIn his work \"On Duties,\" Cicero discusses the relationship between morality and expediency. He argues that true expediency cannot conflict with morality because what is truly beneficial in the long run aligns with moral duties.\n\nSo, perhaps immorality is repugnant to nature, while expediency, when properly understood, is in accord with nature.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people act expediently in a way that seems to go against moral principles. For example, sacrificing someone else's interests for personal gain. Would Cicero consider that kind of expediency as against nature?\n\nI think so, because he would argue that such actions are not truly expedient in the long run, as they go against the natural law and moral duties.\n\nTherefore, both immorality and expediency that conflicts with morality would be repugnant to nature.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A says both are repugnant to nature, which seems to align with my thinking.\n\nOption B says immorality is repugnant to nature and expediency is in accord with nature. But based on what I just thought, expediency that conflicts with morality would also be against nature.\n\nOption C says immorality is in accord with nature and expediency is repugnant to nature. That doesn't seem right, because Stoics would consider immorality against nature.\n\nOption D says both are in accord with nature, which contradicts Stoic philosophy.\n\nSo, option A seems correct: both immorality and expediency are repugnant to nature.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Cicero's \"On Duties,\" he discusses the four cardinal virtues: wisdom, justice, fortitude, and temperance. He argues that these virtues are in accord with nature and that acting against them is unnatural.\n\nExpediency, if it leads to acting against these virtues, would also be against nature.\n\nMoreover, Cicero believed in the unity of virtue and interest, meaning that what is morally right is also what is truly beneficial.\n\nTherefore, any action that seems expedient but is immoral is actually not truly expedient, because it goes against the natural order and moral duties.\n\nSo, in Cicero's view, both immorality and expediency that conflicts with morality are against nature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: repugnant to Nature for both immorality and expediency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
