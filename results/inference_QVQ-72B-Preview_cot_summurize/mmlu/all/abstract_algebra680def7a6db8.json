                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It says that the set of integers, denoted by Z, is equipped with a binary operation * defined as a*b = a + b + 1 for any integers a and b. And I need to find the identity element of this group. The options are 0, 1, -1, and 12.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an identity element is in the context of a group. An identity element, often denoted by e, is an element that, when combined with any element of the group under the group operation, leaves that element unchanged. In other words, for any element a in the group, e*a = a*e = a.\n\nSo, in this case, I need to find an integer e such that for any integer a, e*a = a and a*e = a, using the operation * defined as a*b = a + b + 1.\n\nSince the operation is commutative (a*b = b*a), I only need to find e such that e*a = a.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\ne*a = a\n\nSubstituting the definition of *:\n\ne*a = e + a + 1 = a\n\nSo, e + a + 1 = a\n\nNow, I can subtract a from both sides:\n\ne + 1 = 0\n\nThen, subtract 1 from both sides:\n\ne = -1\n\nWait, but let me verify this.\n\nIf e = -1, then for any a, (-1)*a = -1 + a + 1 = a\n\nSimilarly, a*(-1) = a + (-1) + 1 = a\n\nYes, both equal a, so e = -1 is indeed the identity element.\n\nBut let me check the options again to make sure. The options are:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1\n\nC. -1\n\nD. 12\n\nSo, -1 is option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see what happens if we choose other options.\n\nOption A: 0\n\nIf e = 0, then 0*a = 0 + a + 1 = a + 1 \u2260 a (unless a = -1, which is not true for all a)\n\nSo, 0 is not the identity.\n\nOption B: 1\n\nIf e = 1, then 1*a = 1 + a + 1 = a + 2 \u2260 a (unless a = -2, which again isn't true for all a)\n\nNot the identity.\n\nOption D: 12\n\nIf e = 12, then 12*a = 12 + a + 1 = a + 13 \u2260 a\n\nClearly not the identity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. -1.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about this differently. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up the equation for the identity element.\n\nFor a group (Z, *), the identity element e must satisfy:\n\na * e = a for all a in Z.\n\nSo, a * e = a + e + 1 = a\n\nSubtract a from both sides:\n\ne + 1 = 0\n\nThus, e = -1\n\nAgain, confirming that e = -1 is the identity element.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the operation * as a transformation. But since it's a binary operation on integers, the algebraic approach seems sufficient.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The identity element is -1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-1} \\]"
