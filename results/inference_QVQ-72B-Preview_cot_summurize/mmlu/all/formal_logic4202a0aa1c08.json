                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem. So, we have a sentence: \"Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it.\" And we need to find which of the given formulas best symbolizes this sentence in propositional logic (PL).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. It seems like there's a cause and effect here. The university raised tuition, and as a result, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it. So, the raising of tuition is the condition that leads to the president's approval and the board's non-prevention.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (P \u2022 ~B) \u2283 U\n\nB. (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B\n\nC. U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B)\n\nD. U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B)\n\nI need to match these with the sentence's meaning. Let me assign variables to make it clearer:\n\nLet:\n\n- U = The university raised tuition.\n\n- P = The president approved of it.\n\n- B = The board prevented it.\n\nSo, the sentence can be rephrased as: If the university raised tuition, then the president approved of it and the board did not prevent it.\n\nIn logical terms, that's: U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B)\n\nWait, but option C is U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B), and option D is U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B). So, the difference is between \"and\" and \"or.\"\n\nI need to decide which one correctly represents the relationship in the sentence.\n\nThe sentence says \"the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it.\" This seems like both conditions must be true: the president approved and the board did not prevent.\n\nSo, it should be U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B), which is option C.\n\nBut let's double-check option D: U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B). This would mean that if the university raised tuition, then either the president approved or the board did not prevent, but not necessarily both.\n\nBut the original sentence seems to require both conditions to be true. So, option C seems more appropriate.\n\nOption A is (P \u2022 ~B) \u2283 U, which would mean that if both the president approved and the board didn't prevent, then the university raised tuition. This seems like the converse of what we want. It's saying that approval and non-prevention imply that tuition was raised, which isn't exactly matching the original sentence.\n\nOption B is (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B, which seems a bit confusing. It says that U implies P, and also B is true. But B is \"the board prevented it,\" which contradicts the original sentence that says \"the board didn't prevent it.\"\n\nWait, that's a problem. If B is \"the board prevented it,\" then in the original sentence, it's \"the board didn't prevent it,\" which is ~B.\n\nSo, option B says (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B, which means U implies P, and B is true. But B being true is \"the board prevented it,\" which contradicts the original sentence's \"the board didn't prevent it.\"\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption A seems to be the converse of what we want, option B contradicts the original sentence, and option D is a disjunction, which doesn't capture the \"and\" in the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization should be option C: U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B).\n\nBut wait, in some logical notations, \"\u2022\" is used for conjunction (and), and \"\u2228\" for disjunction (or). So, P \u2022 ~B means P and not B.\n\nYes, that matches the original sentence's \"the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it.\"\n\nOption D is U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B), which would mean that if the university raised tuition, then either the president approved or the board didn't prevent, but not necessarily both. That's weaker than what the sentence is saying, which requires both to be true.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect because it doesn't capture the conjunction.\n\nSo, I think the answer is option C: U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B).\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the sentence.\n\n\"Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it.\"\n\nThis seems like a straightforward causal relationship: the raising of tuition led to the president's approval and the board's non-prevention.\n\nSo, it's a single consequence with two parts, both of which must be true.\n\nTherefore, the correct symbolization is U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B), which is option C.\n\nI don't see any ambiguity in the sentence that would suggest otherwise.\n\nSo, the answer should be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
