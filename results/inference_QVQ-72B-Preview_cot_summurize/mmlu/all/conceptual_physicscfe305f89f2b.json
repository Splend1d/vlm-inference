                    "text": "So I have this question about waves. It says that the period of a 10-Hz wave is... and gives me four options: A. 1/10 s, B. 1.0 s, C. 10 s, or D. None of these. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the period of a wave is. I think the period is the time it takes for one complete cycle of the wave to pass a point. So, if a wave has a frequency of 10 Hz, that means 10 cycles are happening per second. But what does that tell me about the time for one cycle?\n\nI recall that frequency and period are related. In fact, frequency (f) is the reciprocal of the period (T). So, f = 1/T. That means T = 1/f. So, if the frequency is 10 Hz, the period should be 1/10 seconds.\n\nLooking at the options, A. 1/10 s seems to be the correct answer based on this formula.\n\nBut let me double-check. If frequency is the number of cycles per second, then having 10 cycles per second would mean each cycle takes 1/10 of a second to complete. That makes sense.\n\nLet me consider the units as well. Hz is short for hertz, which is equivalent to cycles per second. So, 10 Hz means 10 cycles per second. Therefore, time per cycle would be 1/10 seconds per cycle.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. So, the correct choice should be A. 1/10 s.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to interpret this? Maybe I should think about the wave's wavelength or other properties, but the question is specifically about the period.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might confuse period with wavelength or other related concepts, but in this case, it's clearly asking for the period.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider an example. Suppose I have a wave that oscillates at 10 Hz. So, it completes 10 cycles in one second. Therefore, the time for one cycle is indeed 1/10 second.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula T = 1/f, where T is the period and f is the frequency. Plugging in f = 10 Hz, T = 1/10 s.\n\nSo, all signs point to A. 1/10 s being the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any reason why it would be B. 1.0 s or C. 10 s. Those seem too large compared to the frequency given.\n\nOption D. None of these seems unlikely because A. 1/10 s is clearly the calculation result.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is A. 1/10 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1/10\\ \\text{s}} \\]"
