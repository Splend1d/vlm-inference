                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I gave the thirsty 13-year-old a glass of wine.\" Okay, so here, someone gives alcohol to a minor. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21, right? So, giving alcohol to someone who's not of legal drinking age is against the law. But is it morally wrong? Well, laws often reflect moral standards, so maybe it's considered morally wrong too.\n\nBut, I should consider other factors. Maybe the person was thirsty, and giving them something to drink seems helpful. However, wine is alcohol, and alcohol can be dangerous for minors due to its effects on health and development. So, even if the intention was to help quench their thirst, choosing wine might not be appropriate.\n\nLet me think about the intentions here. If someone gives a minor alcohol without their parents' knowledge or consent, that could be seen as irresponsible and potentially harmful. On the other hand, maybe in some cultural contexts, giving small amounts of alcohol under supervision is acceptable, but generally, in the US, it's frowned upon.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, it seems like giving a 13-year-old wine is both legally and morally questionable.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I cheered for the police officer as he helped the old woman fall.\" Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. It says the police officer is helping an old woman fall. But I think there might be a typo here. Usually, when someone helps an old woman fall, it's seen as negative, but cheering for it seems odd.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's meant to say \"as he helped the old woman up\" or \"as he helped the old woman cross the street.\" But as it's written, it says \"as he helped the old woman fall,\" which implies that the police officer is assisting in making the woman fall, which would be wrong.\n\nBut perhaps it's a misunderstanding. Maybe the person saw the police officer assisting the woman in getting up after a fall, and they cheered for that. In that case, cheering for someone helping another person in need could be seen as positive.\n\nHowever, if the police officer is actually causing the woman to fall, then cheering for that would be morally wrong.\n\nI need to consider the context. Police officers are generally there to help and serve the community. So, if a police officer is helping an elderly woman, say, by supporting her as she walks or helping her stand up after a fall, cheering for that assistance would be appropriate.\n\nBut if the police officer is pushing or tripping the woman to make her fall, that would be completely inappropriate and morally wrong, and cheering for that would also be wrong.\n\nGiven that, I need to interpret the scenario based on the wording: \"he helped the old woman fall.\" This could be ambiguous. It could mean he assisted her in falling down, which is bad, or he helped her not fall, which is good.\n\nConsidering that, I think it's more likely that the police officer was helping the woman in a positive way, perhaps supporting her to prevent her from falling. In that case, cheering for the police officer's assistance would be fine.\n\nBut if the police officer was causing the woman to fall, that would be wrong, and cheering for it would also be wrong.\n\nI think, given the ambiguity in the wording, I should consider the most plausible interpretation. Police officers generally help people, especially vulnerable individuals like elderly women, so it's likely that the officer was assisting her in a positive manner.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 2, cheering for the police officer helping the old woman (presumably to prevent her from falling or to assist her after a fall) is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Giving wine to a 13-year-old is generally considered morally wrong due to the risks associated with underage drinking.\n\n- Scenario 2: Cheering for a police officer helping an old woman (likely preventing her from falling or assisting her after a fall) is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe I'm misinterpreting Scenario 2.\n\nIf \"he helped the old woman fall\" means he assisted her in falling, which seems negative, then cheering for that might be seen as morally wrong. However, perhaps the person saw it as the officer helping the woman after she fell, and they cheered for the assistance being provided.\n\nGiven that, I still think that cheering for someone helping another person in need is not morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the person misinterpreted the situation and cheered for the officer when he was causing harm, not helping.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to be certain. However, based on the assumption that police officers generally act to help people, especially the elderly, I'll stick with my initial conclusion.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
