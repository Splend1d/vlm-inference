After conducting the sessions, the professor submitted an expense report to the owner of the bar review course. Her expense voucher included a $225 travel expenditure to a fourth city where the professor had attended a symposium unrelated to the bar review course. The professor also submitted the $225 travel expenditure to the administrator for the faculty at the law school where she teaches. The dean of the law school had previously approved the professor's appearance at the symposium. The owner paid the professor for the symposium-related expenditure but indicated that the expense item was improperly billed to his company. The professor was indicted for false pretenses. In her defense, she contends that the double billing was the result of a bookkeeping error. Her defense should be\n\nA. valid, if her mistake was reasonable.\nB. valid, if she didn't know that the billing to the bar review company included the symposium expenditure.\nC. invalid, if her bookkeeping error was unreasonable.\nD. invalid, because white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this legal scenario about a professor who double-billed an expense, and now she's being indicted for false pretenses. She claims it was a bookkeeping error. I need to figure out which option best describes her defense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what false pretenses mean. I think it involves misleading someone to obtain something of value, like money or property, by deceiving them. In this case, the professor submitted the same expense to two different entities, which seems like she might have intended to deceive one or both of them to get extra money.\n\nBut she's saying it was a mistake, a bookkeeping error. That suggests she didn't intend to deceive anyone; it was just an accident. If that's true, then maybe she shouldn't be held criminally liable because criminal intent is often a key component in these kinds of crimes.\n\nOption A says her defense is valid if her mistake was reasonable. That makes sense because even if she made a mistake, if it was a reasonable one, she might not be culpable.\n\nOption B says her defense is valid if she didn't know that the billing to the bar review company included the symposium expenditure. Well, if she didn't know, that suggests lack of intent to defraud, which could be a defense.\n\nOption C says her defense is invalid if her bookkeeping error was unreasonable. So, if the mistake was unreasonable, maybe she should have known better, and thus her defense fails.\n\nOption D says her defense is invalid because white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability. Absolute liability means you can be held responsible regardless of intent, which would make her defense irrelevant.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these is correct.\n\nFirst, in most criminal cases, intent is important. You have to show that the person meant to do something wrong. So, if the professor's mistake was truly unintentional, and she had no reason to know she was double-billing, her defense might be valid.\n\nBut, in some cases, especially in regulatory offenses or strict liability crimes, intent might not be a required element. However, false pretenses typically do require intent to deceive.\n\nOption A says her defense is valid if her mistake was reasonable. That seems plausible because if the mistake was reasonable, it reinforces that she didn't have the required intent.\n\nOption B says her defense is valid if she didn't know that the billing included the symposium expenditure. Again, lack of knowledge can negate intent.\n\nOption C says her defense is invalid if her bookkeeping error was unreasonable. So, if the error was unreasonable, maybe she should have known better, and thus her defense fails.\n\nOption D claims that white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability, making her defense invalid.\n\nI need to consider whether false pretenses is a crime that requires intent or whether it can be a strict liability offense.\n\nFrom what I recall, false pretenses generally require intent to defraud. So, if the professor didn't intend to defraud anyone, her defense could be valid.\n\nBut, I should check if there are any exceptions or if the law considers this a strict liability offense.\n\nLet me see: false pretenses involve intentionally misleading someone to obtain something of value. So, intent is a key element. Therefore, if the professor can show that she didn't intend to deceive, her defense should be valid.\n\nNow, between options A and B, both suggest that lack of intent can be a defense, but they phrase it differently.\n\nOption A refers to a \"reasonable\" mistake, which might imply that the mistake was one that a reasonable person could make. So, if her bookkeeping error was reasonable under the circumstances, her defense holds.\n\nOption B focuses on her lack of knowledge specifically about the inclusion of the symposium expenditure in the billing to the bar review company.\n\nI think both A and B are similar in that they both require her not to have intended the deception, but A adds the \"reasonable\" standard.\n\nOption C seems to suggest that if the mistake was unreasonable, then her defense fails. That makes sense because if the mistake was unreasonable, perhaps she should have known better, and thus she had recklessness or negligence, which might be sufficient for criminal liability in some jurisdictions.\n\nOption D claims that white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability, which I doubt is generally the case. Most white-collar crimes still require some level of intent or knowledge.\n\nSo, I think Option A is the best answer because it includes the idea that the mistake must be reasonable, which is a standard defense in criminal law where mistakes of fact can be defenses if they're reasonable.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any case law or specific statutes that might apply here.\n\nLet me think about the elements of false pretenses. Typically, it requires:\n\n1. Making a false representation of fact.\n\n2. Intentionally misleading someone.\n\n3. Obtaining something of value thereby.\n\nIn this case, the false representation is submitting the same expense to two different entities, implying that it's only being submitted to one.\n\nIf the professor truly believed that she was only submitting it to one entity due to a bookkeeping error, and that belief was reasonable, then she didn't have the intent to deceive.\n\nTherefore, her defense should be valid if her mistake was reasonable.\n\nOption A seems to capture that.\n\nOption B is similar but doesn't specify the reasonableness of her lack of knowledge. So, maybe A is stronger.\n\nOption C is essentially the opposite of A, saying that if the mistake was unreasonable, her defense fails. That makes sense, but since the question is about her defense being valid, A is more directly addressing that.\n\nOption D is likely incorrect because, as far as I know, white-collar crimes generally do require some level of intent or knowledge.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: valid, if her mistake was reasonable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
