                    "text": "So I've got these two statements here, and I need to figure out which ones are true and which ones are false. Let's take them one at a time.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"The back-propagation algorithm learns a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers.\"\n\nHmm, back-propagation is a method used to train neural networks, right? It's a way to adjust the weights of the connections between neurons based on the error of the output. But does it always find the absolute best set of weights,\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3?\n\nI remember that neural networks can have multiple layers, and when they do, they become more complex and can model more intricate relationships in the data. But with that complexity comes the challenge of training them properly.\n\nOne thing I've heard is that back-propagation can get stuck in local minima. That means it might find a set of weights that are good, but not necessarily the best possible set. So, if I recall correctly, it doesn't always converge to the global optimum, especially in networks with hidden layers.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Back-propagation uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the weights in the direction of the steepest decrease of the loss. However, the loss surface of neural networks, especially those with multiple hidden layers, can be full of local minima and saddle points.\n\nIn practice, getting stuck in a local minimum is a common issue, meaning that the algorithm might not reach the global optimum. Additionally, the initial weights can significantly affect the final solution, as different initializations can lead to different local minima.\n\nSo, based on this, Statement 1 seems to be false because back-propagation doesn't guarantee finding the global optimum in neural networks with hidden layers.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line.\"\n\nOkay, so VC dimension, or Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, is a measure of the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm. It's the maximum number of points that can be shattered by the algorithm. Shattering means that for any possible labeling of the points, the algorithm can correctly classify them.\n\nIn this case, we're talking about a line, which I assume is being used to classify points in a 2D plane. So, the question is, what's the maximum number of points that a line can shatter?\n\nLet's consider two points first. With two points, a line can shatter them in all possible ways: both on one side, both on the other side, or one on each side. So, it can separate any possible labeling of the two points.\n\nNow, for three points, things get a bit trickier. If the three points are arranged in a way that they are not collinear (i.e., they don't lie on a straight line), then it's impossible for a single line to shatter them. For example, if you have a triangle formed by three points, there's no way to draw a line that can separate all three points in certain labelings. Specifically, if you try to label two points on one side and one on the other, there's no line that can achieve that separation.\n\nHowever, if the three points are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line, then a line can shatter them in some configurations. For instance, if you have three points in a straight line, you can label the two outer points as one class and the middle one as another, and a line can separate them by placing it between the middle point and the others.\n\nBut the key point here is that for a set of points to be shattered by a line, it must be possible to separate them correctly for any labeling. Since there exists at least one arrangement of three points (a triangle) that cannot be shattered by a line, the VC dimension of a line should be at most 2.\n\nWait a minute, I think there's a bit more to this. The VC dimension is defined as the maximum number of points that can be shattered. So, if there's any set of that size that can be shattered, then that's the VC dimension. But in this case, for three points, not all possible labelings can be achieved if the points are not collinear.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of a line is indeed at most 2, because with three points, there are labelings that cannot be achieved.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1: False, because back-propagation doesn't guarantee finding the global optimum in neural networks with hidden layers due to the risk of getting stuck in local minima.\n\n- Statement 2: True, because a line cannot shatter three points in all possible labelings, hence the VC dimension is at most 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
