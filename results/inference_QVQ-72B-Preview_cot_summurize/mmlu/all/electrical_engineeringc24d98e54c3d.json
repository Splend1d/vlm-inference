                    "text": "So I need to convert a hexadecimal number to binary, and for each hexadecimal digit, I have to figure out how many bits are needed. The options are 1, 2, 4, or 8. Hmm, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, which means each digit can represent 16 different values, right? The digits are 0-9 and then A-F, where A is 10, B is 11, and so on up to F, which is 15.\n\nNow, binary is base-2, with each bit representing either 0 or 1. So, I need to find out how many binary digits (bits) are needed to represent one hexadecimal digit.\n\nMaybe I should think about the range of values each system can represent with a certain number of digits.\n\nIn hexadecimal, one digit can represent 16 values (0-15). In binary, how many bits do I need to represent 16 different values?\n\nLet's consider that each additional bit doubles the number of values you can represent:\n\n- 1 bit: 2^1 = 2 values (0 and 1)\n\n- 2 bits: 2^2 = 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11)\n\n- 3 bits: 2^3 = 8 values (000-111)\n\n- 4 bits: 2^4 = 16 values (0000-1111)\n\nAh, so 4 bits can represent 16 different values, which matches the 16 values of one hexadecimal digit. That makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I take the hexadecimal digits from 0 to F:\n\n0 in binary is 0000\n\n1 is 0001\n\n...\n\nF is 1111\n\nYes, exactly 4 bits are needed for each hexadecimal digit.\n\nWait a minute, what about option D, 8 bits? That seems like it would be too many. 8 bits would be a byte, which can represent 256 values (from 0 to 255), but we only need to represent 16 values for one hexadecimal digit. So, 8 bits would be overkill.\n\nOption B is 2 bits. But 2 bits can only represent 4 values (00, 01, 10, 11), which is not enough for the 16 values needed for one hexadecimal digit.\n\nOption A is 1 bit, which can only represent 2 values, so that's definitely not enough.\n\nSo, based on this, option C, 4 bits, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about how hexadecimal and binary are related in computing. I know that in computer systems, data is often represented in bytes (8 bits), and hexadecimal is used as a shorthand for binary values.\n\nFor example, one byte can be represented by two hexadecimal digits, since each digit corresponds to 4 bits, and 4 bits times two is 8 bits.\n\nSo, yes, that reinforces the idea that one hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 bits.\n\nMaybe another way to look at it is to consider the binary representation of all possible hexadecimal digits:\n\n0: 0000\n\n1: 0001\n\n2: 0010\n\n3: 0011\n\n4: 0100\n\n5: 0101\n\n6: 0110\n\n7: 0111\n\n8: 1000\n\n9: 1001\n\nA: 1010\n\nB: 1011\n\nC: 1100\n\nD: 1101\n\nE: 1110\n\nF: 1111\n\nHere, each hexadecimal digit is perfectly matched with a unique 4-bit binary sequence. So, this confirms that 4 bits are sufficient to represent any hexadecimal digit.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider converting a larger hexadecimal number to binary. For instance, take the hexadecimal number \"3F\".\n\n3 in hexadecimal is 0011 in binary, and F is 1111 in binary. So, combined, it's 00111111, which is 63 in decimal.\n\nIf I tried to use fewer bits, say 2 bits per hexadecimal digit, I wouldn't be able to represent all 16 possible values. For example, F (15 in decimal) can't be represented with only 2 bits, since 2 bits only allow representations up to 3 (011 in binary).\n\nTherefore, 4 bits are necessary and sufficient for each hexadecimal digit when converting to binary.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
