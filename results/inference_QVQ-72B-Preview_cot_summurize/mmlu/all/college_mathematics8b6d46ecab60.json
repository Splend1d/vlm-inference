                    "text": "I've got this problem here about subsets of R^n, where n > 1. It says K is a nonempty subset, and there are three statements to evaluate. I need to figure out which one must be true if K is compact. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what compactness means in R^n. I know that in Euclidean space, a set is compact if and only if it's closed and bounded. That's the Heine-Borel theorem. So, compactness in R^n means two things: the set is closed, and it's bounded.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\n\nHmm, this seems familiar. I think there's a theorem about this. Let me see. Oh, right! It's the extreme value theorem, or something similar. If a function is continuous on a compact set, then it's bounded and achieves its maximum and minimum values on that set.\n\nWait, the extreme value theorem in calculus says that if a function is continuous on a closed and bounded interval [a, b], then it attains its maximum and minimum values. In R^n, if K is compact, which means it's closed and bounded, then any continuous function f: K \u2192 R should be bounded and attain its extrema.\n\nSo, statement I seems to be true based on that. But I should double-check. Maybe I can think of a counterexample where K is compact, and a continuous function on K is not bounded. Hmm, can't think of one. Because if K is compact, and f is continuous, then f(K) should be compact in R, which is a closed and bounded subset, so f must be bounded.\n\nAlright, so I think statement I is true.\n\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\n\nThis seems like the converse of statement I. So, if whenever I have a continuous function on K, it's bounded, then K must be compact.\n\nHmm, is this true? Let's see. If K is not compact, what can I say about continuous functions on K?\n\nWell, if K is not compact, it means that either K is not closed or not bounded. So, let's consider both cases.\n\nFirst, suppose K is not bounded. Can I find a continuous function on K that is unbounded? For example, if K is the set of all points (x,0) in R^2 where x is a real number, which is not bounded, and I take the function f(x,y) = x. That should be continuous and unbounded on K, since as x goes to infinity, f goes to infinity.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\" So, if I can find even one continuous function that's unbounded, then the premise fails, and the implication is true.\n\nBut, to prove the converse, I need to show that if every continuous function on K is bounded, then K is compact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the contrapositive. The original statement is: if K is compact, then every continuous function on K is bounded. The contrapositive is: if not every continuous function on K is bounded, then K is not compact.\n\nBut I'm trying to evaluate the converse: if every continuous function on K is bounded, then K is compact.\n\nI need to see if this is always true.\n\nLet me think about a set K that is not compact, and see if I can find a continuous function that is bounded.\n\nSuppose K is closed but not bounded, like K = [0, \u221e) in R. Is there a continuous function on K that is bounded? For example, f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2). That's continuous on K and bounded, but the statement says every continuous function is bounded.\n\nWait, in this case, not every continuous function is bounded, because I can take f(x) = x, which is unbounded. So, if K is not bounded, even if it's closed, there exists a continuous function that's unbounded.\n\nWhat if K is bounded but not closed? Like K = (0,1) in R. Is every continuous function on K bounded?\n\nWell, in this case, yes, because (0,1) is bounded, and any continuous function on (0,1) is bounded. Wait, is that true?\n\nActually, consider f(x) = 1/x on (0,1). That's continuous on (0,1) and unbounded, since as x approaches 0, f(x) goes to infinity.\n\nSo, in this case, even though K is bounded but not closed, there exists a continuous function that's unbounded.\n\nWait, but in R^n, for n > 1, similar examples can be constructed.\n\nSo, it seems that if K is not compact, meaning either not closed or not bounded, then there exists at least one continuous function that's unbounded.\n\nTherefore, if K is not compact, then not every continuous function on K is bounded.\n\nWhich means that if every continuous function on K is bounded, then K must be compact.\n\nSo, statement II seems to be true as well.\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful. Is it always the case that if K is not compact, there exists a continuous function on K that is unbounded?\n\nLet me think about a specific example in R^2.\n\nSuppose K is the open unit disk in R^2, i.e., all points (x,y) with x^2 + y^2 < 1.\n\nThis set is bounded but not closed. Is there a continuous function on K that is unbounded?\n\nWell, f(x,y) = 1/(1 - x^2 - y^2) should be continuous on K and unbounded, since as (x,y) approaches the boundary, f approaches infinity.\n\nSo, yes, in this case, there exists an unbounded continuous function.\n\nSimilarly, if K is unbounded, like the entire plane R^2, then f(x,y) = x is continuous and unbounded.\n\nTherefore, it seems that if K is not compact, there exists at least one continuous function that is unbounded on K.\n\nHence, the contrapositive holds: if not every continuous function on K is bounded, then K is not compact.\n\nTherefore, the original statement II must be true as well.\n\nSo, both I and II seem to be true.\n\nNow, statement III: If K is compact, then K is connected.\n\nIs this true?\n\nI need to recall what connectedness means in R^n. A set is connected if it cannot be divided into two nonempty open subsets that are disjoint.\n\nIn R^n, compact sets can be connected or disconnected.\n\nLet me think of an example where K is compact but not connected.\n\nConsider, in R^2, the set K consisting of two separate points, say K = {(0,0), (1,1)}.\n\nThis set is compact because it's closed and bounded. But it's not connected because it's made up of two disconnected points.\n\nSo, here, K is compact but not connected.\n\nTherefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, based on this, only statements I and II are true.\n\nWait, but in the options, D says I and II only.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nStatement I: If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function on K is bounded. This seems to be true based on the extreme value theorem.\n\nStatement II: If every continuous real-valued function on K is bounded, then K is compact. This also seems to hold, based on the earlier reasoning.\n\nStatement III: If K is compact, then K is connected. This is not necessarily true, as shown by the counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: I and II only.\n\nBut wait, in the options, D says \"I and II only,\" but I need to make sure that there isn't a standard convention or some theorem that might make one of these statements not necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, some properties change.\n\nLet me consider n=2.\n\nIn R^2, compact sets are exactly the closed and bounded sets.\n\nIn R^2, are there compact sets that are not connected?\n\nYes, like the two points example.\n\nAre there compact sets that are connected?\n\nYes, like closed intervals in R, or closed disks in R^2.\n\nSo, compactness does not imply connectedness.\n\nTherefore, statement III is false.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D: I and II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
