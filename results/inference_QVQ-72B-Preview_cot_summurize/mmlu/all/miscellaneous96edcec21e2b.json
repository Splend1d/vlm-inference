                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this blackjack question. It says, \"In the card game blackjack, how much are a queen and a king worth together?\" And the options are A. 11, B. 15, C. 20, D. 21.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the values of cards in blackjack. I know that in blackjack, cards have certain point values. The number cards are worth their face value, so like a 5 is worth 5 points. But the face cards\u2014king, queen, and jack\u2014I think they all have the same value. Let me confirm that.\n\nI recall that in blackjack, all face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are each worth 10 points. So, a queen is worth 10, and a king is worth 10. So together, they should be worth 10 plus 10, which is 20.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any scenario in blackjack where a queen or a king would have a different value? I don't think so. It's pretty standard that they're all worth 10 points each.\n\nLet me just double-check the basic rules of blackjack to be absolutely sure. In blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their numerical value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are all worth 10 points. Aces are either 1 or 11 points, depending on the hand.\n\nSo, with that in mind, a queen is 10, a king is 10, and together they add up to 20.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider if there's any situation where this might not be the case. For example, if I already have an ace in my hand, does that change the value of the face cards? No, I don't think so. The ace can be 1 or 11, but the face cards remain 10.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in some variations of blackjack, the rules might differ, but in standard casino blackjack, face cards are always 10.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be C. 20.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. The question says \"together,\" which means both cards are in the same hand, right? So, if I have a queen and a king, that's 10 plus 10, which is 20. But just to be thorough, let's think about blackjack hands.\n\nIf I have a queen and a king, that's already 20. That's a pretty strong hand. It's less than 21, but close, and depending on the dealer's upcard, I might choose to stand or hit. But in terms of the value, it's just 20.\n\nIs there any way in blackjack where having a queen and a king together could be worth more than 20? Maybe if there are other cards involved, but the question specifies just a queen and a king together.\n\nNo, I don't think so. I think it's straightforward: queen is 10, king is 10, together they're 20.\n\nLet me look at the other options to see if any of them make sense.\n\nOption A is 11. That doesn't seem right because even if one of the cards was an ace, an ace can be 1 or 11, but in this case, both are face cards, so they're both 10.\n\nOption B is 15. That might be if one of them was a 5 and the other was a 10, but no, both are face cards, so they should be 10 each.\n\nOption D is 21. That's a blackjack, which is an ace and a 10-value card, like a king or queen, making 11 (ace) plus 10 (king or queen) equals 21. But in this case, I have a queen and a king, which are both 10, so it's 20, not 21.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 20.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll check online or in a blackjack rule book. Let me imagine I'm looking this up.\n\nI would search for \"blackjack card values\" and find that all face cards (kings, queens, jacks) are worth 10 points each. So, queen is 10, king is 10, total is 20.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the suits, does the suit of the card matter? No, in blackjack, suits don't affect the point values of the cards.\n\nAlso, the number of decks being used in the game doesn't change the value of the cards. So, whether it's a single deck or multiple decks, face cards are still 10 each.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and everything points to the answer being C. 20.\n\nMaybe one last thing: is there any situation in blackjack where having two 10-value cards could be counted differently? For example, if they're both counted as 10, that's still 20. Or if they're both counted as 10, that's still 20. There doesn't seem to be any exception to this rule.\n\nAlright, I feel confident now. The answer is C. 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
