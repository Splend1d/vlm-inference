                    "text": "So I have this question here about urban growth theories. It says: \"The theory that cities grow outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth was proposed by...\" and the options are Rostow, Ravenstein, von Th\u00fcnen, and Harris and Ullmann. Hmm, I need to recall which of these theorists proposed a model where cities expand from a central point using multiple nodes.\n\nFirst, let's think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Rostow. I remember that Walt Rostow was an economist who proposed the Stage's of Economic Growth model. He talked about how economies progress through various stages, like traditional society, takeoff, and so on. But I don't recall him having a specific theory about urban growth involving nodes of growth. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I think his focus was more on economic development stages rather than urban spatial development.\n\nNext, Ravenstein. Edward Ravenstein is known for his laws of migration. He proposed that migration follows certain patterns, like people tend to migrate over short distances first and longer distances later. While this is related to population movement, I don't think he had a direct theory about how cities grow outward from a core using nodes.\n\nThen there's von Th\u00fcnen. Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen developed the von Th\u00fcnen model, which is about agricultural land use around a central market city. This model shows how different crops are grown at different distances from the city center based on their profitability and transport costs. It's a early form of a central place theory, but I'm not sure if it specifically talks about cities growing outward using multiple nodes.\n\nLastly, Harris and Ullmann. This must be Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullmann. They are known for developing the Multiple Nuclei Theory of urban structure. This theory suggests that cities don't just grow from a single center but have multiple centers or nodes of growth. These nodes can be commercial, industrial, or residential areas that act as their own centers of growth, leading to a polycentric urban form.\n\nAh, that sounds very much like what the question is asking. The theory describes cities growing outward from a core but utilizing several nodes of growth. So, Harris and Ullmann's Multiple Nuclei Theory seems to fit this description perfectly.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. The question mentions \"cities grow outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth.\" The core part might refer to the central business district (CBD), and the nodes could be secondary centers that develop as the city expands.\n\nIn the Multiple Nuclei Theory, these nodes can form due to various factors like transportation improvements, land use zoning, or the agglomeration of similar activities. This leads to a more dispersed pattern of development rather than a single, dense center.\n\nComparing this with the other options, Rostow's stages are about economic growth, Ravenstein's laws are about migration, and von Th\u00fcnen's model is about agricultural land use around a city. None of these directly address the concept of multiple nodes of growth in urban areas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Harris and Ullmann.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"the theory that cities grow outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth.\" That sounds a lot like the Multiple Nuclei Theory, which was indeed proposed by Harris and Ullmann in 1945. They built upon earlier work by Burgess and Hoyt but introduced the idea of multiple centers.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation. Maybe the question is referring to another theory that also involves nodes, but I can't think of any that fit the description as well as the Multiple Nuclei Theory.\n\nAlso, considering that Rostow, Ravenstein, and von Th\u00fcnen have different areas of focus, it's clear that Harris and Ullmann are the ones who proposed the theory in question.\n\nSo, with confidence, I'll go with D. Harris and Ullmann.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
