Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nFrom the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore\n\nA. seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\nB. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\nC. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\nD. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. There are two passages provided, one from William Howard Russell's \"My Indian Mutiny Diary\" in 1860 and another from Rudrangshu Mukherjee's work in 1990. The question is asking me to consider the perspective of the first passage and determine how the death of British citizens at Cawnpore is viewed from that standpoint.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each passage is saying. The first passage by William Howard Russell seems to be reflecting on the Cawnpore massacres from a British perspective. He mentions that the massacres were particularly aggravating because they were committed by \"a subject race\" against their masters, and that it was part of a larger context involving religion, race, and revenge. He also notes that it was part of a servile war and a national uprising to overthrow British rule and re-establish native authority.\n\nThe second passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee offers a different angle, emphasizing the role of violence in colonial rule and how the revolt of 1857 challenged the British monopoly on violence. He discusses how the British viewed themselves as superior and the Indians as inferior, almost animal-like, and how this hierarchy was enforced through violence.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about the perspective of the first passage. So, I need to focus on William Howard Russell's viewpoint. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\n\nB. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\n\nC. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\n\nD. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\n\nLet me analyze each option in relation to the first passage.\n\nOption A suggests that the deaths mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race. Looking back at the first passage, Russell does mention that the deeds were done by \"black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children.\" He also refers to it as a \"servile war,\" which implies a slave uprising against their masters. This language seems to imply a hierarchical view of race, with the British seen as superior and the Indians as inferior. So, from this perspective, it could be viewed as a betrayal of the superior race by the subordinate one.\n\nOption B proposes that it should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake. The first passage does express aggravation and seems to present the massacres as a terrible event, but it doesn't explicitly suggest that it was avoidable or a mistake per se. It seems more focused on the nature of the act and the motivations behind it, rather than on whether it could have been prevented.\n\nOption C suggests that the British themselves brought on the massacres. The first passage doesn't directly state this. While it does mention the context of a national uprising to shake off colonial rule, it doesn't blame the British for provoking the massacres. It seems more focused on describing the events and their place in a larger conflict rather than assigning blame.\n\nOption D states that it was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty. The first passage mentions that the revolt involved a war of religion, among other things, but it doesn't specifically say that killing British citizens was seen as a religious duty by the perpetrators. It's more about the broader context of the revolt rather than the specific motivations of the individuals involved in the massacres.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the most aligned with the perspective of the first passage. Russell's language suggests a strong sense of hierarchy based on race, and the idea that the massacres were a betrayal of the superior race by the inferior one resonates with his description.\n\nHowever, I should double-check this interpretation. Maybe there's more to it. Let's see if there's any other part of the first passage that might suggest a different perspective.\n\nRussell mentions that the massacres were part of a war of religion, race, and revenge, and that it was a servile war aimed at re-establishing native rule and religions. This suggests that from the British perspective, it was a multifaceted conflict with deep-rooted causes. But again, it's from the British viewpoint, which might not fully capture the Indian perspective.\n\nWait a minute, the second passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee provides a different perspective, emphasizing the British monopoly on violence and the hierarchical view of race. He talks about how the British viewed themselves as superior and Indians as inferior, almost animal-like. This seems to align with option A, where the massacres are seen as a betrayal of the superior race by the inferior one.\n\nBut Mukherjee's passage also suggests that the British monopoly on violence was challenged during the revolt, which might imply that the Indians were asserting their right to violence, breaking the established order. However, the question is specifically about the perspective of the first passage, which is Russell's, not Mukherjee's.\n\nSo, focusing back on Russell, his passage seems to convey a sense of shock and outrage that the subordinate race would dare to rise up against their masters and commit such acts. This aligns with the idea of a betrayal of the superior race by the inferior one.\n\nOption B, seeing it as a regrettable but avoidable mistake, doesn't seem to fully capture Russell's tone. He appears to view the massacres as a grave and deliberate act, not just an avoidable mistake.\n\nOption C, suggesting that the British brought it on themselves, isn't supported by the first passage. Russell doesn't blame the British for provoking the massacres; rather, he presents them as part of a larger uprising.\n\nOption D, that the killings were seen as a religious duty by the perpetrators, isn't explicitly stated in the first passage. While it mentions a war of religion, it doesn't specify the motivations of those who committed the massacres in terms of religious duty.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer from the perspective of the first passage is option A: it seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly check if there's any other detail in the first passage that might change this conclusion. Russell refers to the victims as \"poor helpless ladies and children,\" which reinforces the idea of vulnerable people being targeted by those who were supposed to be subordinate. This further supports the notion of a betrayal or a transgression against the established order.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that from the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore is viewed as a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
