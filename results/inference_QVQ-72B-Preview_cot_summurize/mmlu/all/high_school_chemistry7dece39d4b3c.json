                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which of these reactions has the greatest decrease in entropy. Entropy is like disorder, right? So, if a reaction goes from more disorder to less disorder, entropy decreases. I need to look at the number of moles of gases because gases have higher entropy than liquids or solids.\n\nLet's look at each reaction one by one.\n\nFirst one:\n\nA. C(s) + CO2(g) \u2192 2 CO(g)\n\nHere, we have solid carbon and gas carbon dioxide reacting to form gas carbon monoxide. On the reactant side, we have one mole of gas (CO2). On the product side, we have two moles of gas (CO). So, the number of gas moles increases from one to two. I think that means entropy increases, not decreases, because more gas means more disorder. So, this probably isn't the one with the greatest decrease in entropy.\n\nNext:\n\nB. 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \u2192 Na2O2(s)\n\nHere, we have two moles of solid sodium and one mole of oxygen gas reacting to form one mole of solid sodium peroxide. On the reactant side, we have one mole of gas (O2), and on the product side, there are no gases. So, the number of gas moles decreases from one to zero. That should be a decrease in entropy.\n\nThird one:\n\nC. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\n\nMethane gas plus oxygen gas reacts to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. On the reactant side, we have one mole of CH4 and two moles of O2, totaling three moles of gas. On the product side, we have one mole of CO2 and two moles of H2O, which also adds up to three moles of gas. So, the number of gas moles stays the same. That means entropy doesn't change in terms of gas moles. Maybe there's some other factor, but for now, I'll consider this as no change in entropy.\n\nLast one:\n\nD. 2 NI3(s) \u2192 3 I2(s) + N2(g)\n\nHere, two moles of solid NI3 decompose to form three moles of solid I2 and one mole of nitrogen gas. On the reactant side, all solids, no gases. On the product side, one mole of gas (N2). So, the number of gas moles increases from zero to one. That should be an increase in entropy.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nA. Entropy increases (1 gas mole to 2 gas moles)\n\nB. Entropy decreases (1 gas mole to 0 gas moles)\n\nC. Entropy stays the same (3 gas moles to 3 gas moles)\n\nD. Entropy increases (0 gas moles to 1 gas mole)\n\nFrom this, the only reaction that shows a decrease in entropy is B. So, I think the answer is B.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that in reaction C, even though the number of gas moles is the same, there might be a change in entropy due to the type of molecules or something? I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nEntropy isn't only about the number of moles of gas; it's also about the state of the substances and possibly the temperature and pressure, but since those aren't given, I have to assume standard conditions.\n\nIn reaction C, both reactants and products are gases, and the number of moles is the same, so entropy change due to moles is zero. But maybe there's a change in entropy due to the complexity of the molecules or something like that. For example, CH4 is reacting to form CO2 and H2O, which are simpler molecules. Maybe that leads to some entropy decrease.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the standard entropy changes for these reactions, but that might be too complicated for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the types of bonds and the number of particles.\n\nIn reaction B, solids and a gas are forming a solid, which likely has less disorder.\n\nIn reaction C, gases are forming other gases with the same number of moles, so maybe entropy doesn't change much.\n\nSo, still, reaction B seems to have the most decrease in entropy.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the general principle: when gases are consumed to form solids, entropy decreases because solids have less disorder than gases.\n\nIn reaction B, one mole of O2 gas is consumed to form solid Na2O2, so entropy decreases.\n\nIn reaction D, solid NI3 decomposes to form solid I2 and N2 gas, so entropy increases.\n\nReaction A increases entropy as per earlier analysis.\n\nReaction C keeps the number of gas moles the same, so entropy likely remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the reaction with the greatest decrease in entropy is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
