                    "text": "So I have this problem about unpolarized light passing through two ideal linear polarizers. The transmission axes of these polarizers make an angle of 45 degrees with each other. I need to find out what percentage of the incident light intensity is transmitted through both polarizers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts about polarized light and how it interacts with polarizers. Unpolarized light consists of electric field vibrations in all possible planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation. When this light passes through a polarizer, it only allows the components of the electric field that are parallel to the polarizer's transmission axis to pass through. This means the light becomes linearly polarized in the direction of the transmission axis.\n\nNow, if the light passes through a second polarizer, the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the angle between the transmission axes of the first and second polarizers. This relationship is described by Malus's law, which states that the intensity of the transmitted light is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer.\n\nIn this problem, there are two polarizers with their transmission axes at a 45-degree angle to each other. Let's denote the first polarizer as P1 and the second as P2, with the transmission axes making an angle \u03b8 = 45\u00b0.\n\nFirst, unpolarized light passes through P1. After passing through P1, the light is polarized along the transmission axis of P1. The intensity of this polarized light is half of the original unpolarized light intensity because only one component of the electric field is allowed to pass. So, if the incident intensity is I\u2080, the intensity after P1 is I\u2081 = I\u2080/2.\n\nNext, this polarized light passes through P2. The transmission axis of P2 is at 45 degrees to that of P1. According to Malus's law, the intensity after passing through P2 is I\u2082 = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the transmission axes.\n\nSubstituting the values, we have:\n\nI\u2082 = (I\u2080/2) * cos\u00b2(45\u00b0)\n\nI know that cos(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2, so cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) = (\u221a2/2)\u00b2 = 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, I\u2082 = (I\u2080/2) * (1/2) = I\u2080/4.\n\nThis means the transmitted intensity through both polarizers is I\u2080/4, which is 25% of the incident intensity.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard something about the percentage being 50%. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the unpolarized light passing through P1, which polarizes it, and then passing through P2. But maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that unpolarized light has equal components along both P1 and P2's axes. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me think about the polarization state after P1. Unpolarized light becomes linearly polarized along P1's axis after passing through P1. Then, when it passes through P2, which is at 45 degrees, the intensity is reduced by a factor of cos\u00b2(45\u00b0), as per Malus's law.\n\nSo, I\u2081 = I\u2080/2, and I\u2082 = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) = (I\u2080/2) * (1/2) = I\u2080/4, which is 25% of I\u2080.\n\nBut I recall that sometimes, when light passes through two polarizers at 90 degrees, the intensity drops to zero, which makes sense according to Malus's law, since cos(90\u00b0) = 0. So, for 45 degrees, cos(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.707, and its square is 1/2 \u2248 0.5, so I\u2082 = I\u2080/2 * 0.5 = I\u2080/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the unpolarized light passing through both polarizers simultaneously. But no, it's sequential passage through two polarizers.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct. The transmitted intensity is 25% of the incident intensity.\n\nBut let me check another source or think of it differently. Maybe using the concept of intensity transmission through multiple polarizers.\n\nThe general formula for intensity after passing through multiple polarizers is given by the product of the cosines squared of the angles between consecutive polarizers.\n\nIn this case, there are two polarizers at 45 degrees to each other.\n\nSo, I\u2082 = I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between P1 and P2.\n\nGiven \u03b8 = 45\u00b0, I\u2082 = I\u2080 * (cos 45\u00b0)\u00b2 = I\u2080 * (1/2) = I\u2080/2.\n\nWait, that would suggest that the transmitted intensity is 50%, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think carefully.\n\nWhen unpolarized light passes through the first polarizer, it becomes polarized along the axis of P1, and its intensity is reduced to half.\n\nThen, this polarized light passes through P2, which is at 45 degrees to P1.\n\nAccording to Malus's law, the intensity after P2 is I\u2082 = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the transmission axes.\n\nGiven \u03b8 = 45\u00b0, I\u2082 = (I\u2080/2) * (1/2) = I\u2080/4 = 25% of I\u2080.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the unpolarized light has equal probability of being polarized in any direction, so the intensity after both polarizers is I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8).\n\nBut that seems similar to the previous approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the polarization state more carefully.\n\nLet me consider that the unpolarized light has equal components along both axes.\n\nSo, if P1 is at angle 0\u00b0, and P2 is at 45\u00b0, then the light after P1 is polarized at 0\u00b0.\n\nWhen this light passes through P2, which is at 45\u00b0, the transmitted intensity is I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) = (I\u2080/2) * (1/2) = I\u2080/4.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the Stokes parameters or other more advanced concepts, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the intensity reduction happens in two steps or just one.\n\nLet me try calculating it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Unpolarized light passes through P1.\n\n- The light becomes polarized along P1's axis.\n\n- Intensity reduces to I\u2081 = I\u2080 / 2.\n\nStep 2: The polarized light passes through P2.\n\n- The transmission axis of P2 is at 45\u00b0 to P1's axis.\n\n- According to Malus's law, I\u2082 = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = (I\u2080 / 2) * (cos 45\u00b0)\u00b2 = (I\u2080 / 2) * (1/2) = I\u2080 / 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the unpolarized light has equal components along both axes, so the intensity after both polarizers is I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = I\u2080 * (1/2) = I\u2080 / 2.\n\nBut that seems to ignore the fact that the first polarizer already reduces the intensity to half.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the polarization state after P1 and then see how much is transmitted by P2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using the Jones calculus or something, but that might be too complicated for this level.\n\nLet me try to think about it in terms of energy conservation.\n\nIf unpolarized light has equal energy in all polarization directions, and P1 selects one direction, reducing the intensity to half, then P2, being at 45\u00b0, would transmit half of that, since it's at 45\u00b0 to the polarization direction.\n\nSo, I\u2081 = I\u2080 / 2, and I\u2082 = I\u2081 / 2 = I\u2080 / 4.\n\nThat seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the two polarizers together act like a single polarizer at some angle, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the fact that the unpolarized light has equal components along both axes, and thus the intensity after both polarizers is I\u2080 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = I\u2080 * (1/2) = I\u2080 / 2.\n\nBut that contradicts the step-by-step approach.\n\nI think the step-by-step approach is more accurate because it accounts for the reduction in intensity by the first polarizer.\n\nTherefore, the transmitted intensity is I\u2080 / 4, which is 25% of the incident intensity.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 25%.\n\nBut let me check online or in a textbook to confirm.\n\n[Imagining searching for \"intensity through two polarizers at 45 degrees\"]\n\nOkay, suppose I have unpolarized light of intensity I\u2080 passing through two polarizers with their transmission axes at 45 degrees to each other.\n\nFirst, the unpolarized light passes through the first polarizer, becoming polarized along the first axis, and its intensity is reduced to I\u2080 / 2.\n\nThen, this polarized light passes through the second polarizer, which is at 45 degrees to the first.\n\nAccording to Malus's law, the intensity after the second polarizer is I\u2082 = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = (I\u2080 / 2) * (cos 45\u00b0)\u00b2 = (I\u2080 / 2) * (1/2) = I\u2080 / 4.\n\nTherefore, the transmitted intensity is 25% of the incident intensity.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the unpolarized light passing through both polarizers simultaneously, the total transmission would be cos\u00b2(\u03b8), which is (1/2), but that doesn't account for the first polarizer's reduction.\n\nSo, yes, the correct answer should be D. 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
