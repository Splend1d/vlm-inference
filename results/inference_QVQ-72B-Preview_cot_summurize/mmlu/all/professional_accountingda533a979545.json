                    "text": "So I have this question about whether Bay Co. should capitalize legal fees incurred in defending its patent rights, depending on the outcome of the litigation. The options are \"Successful\" and \"Unsuccessful,\" with \"Yes\" or \"No\" for each scenario. I need to choose among A. Yes Yes, B. Yes No, C. No No, or D. No Yes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to capitalize legal fees. Capitalizing means treating the legal fees as an asset rather than an expense in the period they're incurred. So, if Bay Co. pays legal fees to defend its patent, under certain conditions, these fees can be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the patent instead of being expensed immediately.\n\nNow, the question is about the outcome of the litigation. There are two possible outcomes: successful and unsuccessful.\n\nLet's consider the successful outcome first. If Bay Co. successfully defends its patent, it means the patent remains valid, and the company can continue to exclusively use or license the patent. In this case, the legal fees incurred in defending the patent might be seen as enhancing or preserving the value of the patent asset. So, it makes sense to capitalize these legal fees because they contribute to the future economic benefits of the patent.\n\nOn the other hand, if the litigation is unsuccessful, the patent might be invalidated or its scope reduced, meaning that the legal fees didn't result in any enhancement or preservation of the patent asset. In this scenario, capitalizing the legal fees wouldn't be appropriate because they didn't lead to any future economic benefits related to the patent. Instead, these fees should be expensed in the period they were incurred.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, for a successful outcome, legal fees should be capitalized (Yes), and for an unsuccessful outcome, they should not be capitalized (No). Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Yes No.\n\nLet me double-check this understanding. In accounting, research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred, but there are exceptions for certain intangible assets like patents and trademarks. Specifically, according to US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), costs incurred in successfully defending a patent would be capitalized as part of the patent's cost and amortized over its remaining useful life.\n\nIn contrast, if the defense is unsuccessful, and the patent is invalidated, the legal fees wouldn't be capitalized because there's no patent asset to which they can be attributed. Instead, these costs would be considered period costs and expensed immediately.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Yes No.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
