                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about how an increase in the per unit price of labor affects different cost measures in economics. The options are AFC, MPL, ATC, and MC. I need to figure out which one of these is correctly associated with an upward shift due to an increase in the per unit price of labor.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand what each of these abbreviations stands for:\n\n- AFC: Average Fixed Cost\n\n- MPL: Marginal Physical Product of Labor\n\n- ATC: Average Total Cost\n\n- MC: Marginal Cost\n\nNow, let's recall what each of these represents:\n\n1. **AFC**: This is the fixed cost per unit of output. Fixed costs are costs that do not change with the level of production. So, AFC = Total Fixed Cost / Quantity produced.\n\n2. **MPL**: This is the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of labor. It's about physical production, not directly about costs.\n\n3. **ATC**: This is the total cost per unit of output. ATC = (Total Fixed Cost + Total Variable Cost) / Quantity produced.\n\n4. **MC**: This is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of output. MC = Change in Total Cost / Change in Quantity.\n\nThe question states that the per unit price of labor, a variable resource, increases. Labor is a variable cost because it varies with the level of production. So, if the price of labor increases, the total variable cost will increase for any given level of production, assuming the amount of labor used per unit of output remains the same.\n\nLet's think about how this affects each of the options:\n\n**Option A: An upward shift in AFC.**\n\nAFC is average fixed cost, which is total fixed cost divided by quantity. Since fixed costs don't change with the level of production, an increase in the price of labor (a variable cost) shouldn't affect fixed costs directly. Therefore, AFC shouldn't be directly impacted by this change. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\n**Option B: An upward shift in MPL.**\n\nMPL is about the physical productivity of labor, not directly about costs. If the price of labor increases, that doesn't necessarily change how much additional output one more unit of labor can produce. So, MPL shouldn't be directly affected by the price change. Maybe indirectly, if higher labor costs lead to changes in production methods, but that's assuming other things change, which isn't stated here. So, probably not the correct choice.\n\n**Option C: A downward shift in ATC.**\n\nATC is total cost divided by quantity. If the price of labor increases, and assuming the same amount of labor is used per unit of output, then the total variable cost increases, which would lead to an increase in ATC, not a decrease. So, this seems incorrect.\n\n**Option D: An upward shift in MC.**\n\nMC is the change in total cost from producing one more unit of output. If the price of labor increases, and assuming that more labor is needed to produce more output, then the additional cost of producing one more unit would likely increase. Therefore, MC would shift upward.\n\nGiven this analysis, option D seems to be the correct choice. An increase in the per unit price of labor\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fb9\u9645\u6210\u672c\uff08MC\uff09\u7684\u5411\u4e0a\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that other options could also be affected?\n\nGoing back to AFC, since fixed costs aren't changing, and the price of labor doesn't affect fixed costs, AFC shouldn't be impacted. So, option A is unlikely.\n\nMPL is about the productivity of labor, not its cost. Unless there's some relationship between the price of labor and its efficiency, which isn't stated here, MPL shouldn't be affected. So, option B is probably not correct.\n\nATC is total cost divided by quantity. If variable costs increase due to higher labor prices, ATC should increase, not decrease. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: an upward shift in MC.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the relationship between MC and variable costs more carefully. MC includes both variable costs and any changes in fixed costs due to increased production. But since fixed costs are, by definition, fixed and don't change with the level of production, the increase in variable costs due to higher labor prices should indeed lead to an increase in MC.\n\nAdditionally, in the short run, when capital is fixed, an increase in labor costs would lead to higher costs for each additional unit produced, assuming constant returns to labor. Therefore, MC would shift upward.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
