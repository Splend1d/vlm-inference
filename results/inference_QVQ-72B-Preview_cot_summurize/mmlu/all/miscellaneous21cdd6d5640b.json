I think it was a big push to increase food production, especially in developing countries. Something about new agricultural technologies and practices.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Increased varieties of each crop planted.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about that. I thought the Green Revolution focused on breeding specific high-yield varieties of crops like wheat and rice. So, maybe fewer varieties, but more of those high-yield ones?\n\nB. Increased use of fertilizers.\n\nThat sounds familiar. I recall that with the new crop varieties, farmers needed to use more fertilizers to get the best yields. These new crops were designed to respond well to higher inputs of fertilizers.\n\nC. Decreased use of mechanization.\n\nWait, I think the Green Revolution actually promoted mechanization in agriculture. Machines like tractors and harvesters were introduced to make farming more efficient. So, probably not a decrease.\n\nD. Decreased use of pesticides.\n\nI have a feeling that pesticide use increased during the Green Revolution. With more intensive farming, there might have been more pests and diseases, so farmers probably used more pesticides to protect their crops.\n\nLet me double-check. I remember reading that the Green Revolution had both positive and negative impacts. Positives like increased food production and yields, but negatives like environmental issues from increased chemical use.\n\nSo, based on that, options B and D seem contradictory. If they increased fertilizers, did they also increase pesticides? I need to think carefully.\n\nI think the answer is B. Increased use of fertilizers.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n- The Green Revolution focused on developing high-yielding crop varieties that could produce more food with increased inputs.\n\n- These new crops were designed to respond well to higher levels of fertilizers, so farmers had to use more fertilizers to achieve those higher yields.\n\n- Mechanization was indeed promoted to make farming more efficient, so C is probably incorrect.\n\n- As for pesticides, while it's possible that their use increased, I think the primary emphasis of the Green Revolution was on fertilizers and improved seed varieties.\n\n- And A seems unlikely because I think the Green Revolution led to a narrowing of crop diversity as farmers adopted a few high-yield varieties rather than growing many different types.\n\nSo, I believe B is the best answer here.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there was any emphasis on reducing pesticide use during the Green Revolution.\n\nI don't think so. In fact, with increased crop production, there might have been more pests, leading to increased pesticide use.\n\nSimilarly, the use of mechanization increased, not decreased, so C is definitely incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
