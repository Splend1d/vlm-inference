                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what's going on with property ownership and whether the stepson can stay based on the deed he got from his mother. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the husband and wife own a piece of land as tenants by the entirety. From what I recall, tenancy by the entirety is a special form of joint ownership between married couples. It means that neither spouse can sell or transfer their interest in the property without the other's consent. Also, neither spouse can pass their interest to someone else through a will because the property automatically goes to the surviving spouse upon the other's death.\n\nNow, there were marital problems, and the wife secretly conveyed her interest in the real estate to her youngest son from a prior marriage. She did this so that he would always have a place to live. But she did it secretly, without her husband's knowledge or consent.\n\nThe wife then died, and the husband is trying to evict his stepson. The question is, according to the majority view among the states, can the stepson prevail by asserting his deed from his mother?\n\nOkay, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed from mother to her son, and son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\n\nB. Yes, the son became a tenant by the entireties with his mother's husband upon his mother's death.\n\nC. No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\n\nD. No, a mother cannot convey a real estate interest to a son without getting the approval of all of her children.\n\nHmm, I need to think carefully about this.\n\nFirst, in a tenancy by the entirety, both spouses have an undivided interest in the property, and neither can convey their interest without the other's consent. So, the wife couldn't just transfer her interest to her son without her husband's agreement, right?\n\nBut she did it secretly. Does that make the deed invalid?\n\nI think in most states, attempting to convey one's interest in a tenancy by the entirety without the other spouse's consent is\u65e0\u6548\u7684. It's kind of like trying to sell part of something you jointly own with your spouse; you can't do it unilaterally.\n\nSo, if the deed is invalid, then the stepson doesn't actually own any interest in the property based on that deed.\n\nBut the stepson is arguing that he has a deed from his mother, so he should be able to stay.\n\nWait, but if the deed is invalid, then the husband is the sole owner of the property after the wife's death, right? Because in a tenancy by the entirety, upon the death of one spouse, the surviving spouse gets the whole property.\n\nSo, the husband is now the sole owner, and he can decide who lives there.\n\nTherefore, the stepson can't use the invalid deed to claim a right to stay.\n\nBut let's look at option A: it says that the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed, and now the son owns one-half as tenants in common with the husband.\n\nBut if the deed isn't valid because it was done without the husband's consent, then this option doesn't hold up.\n\nOption B says that the son became a tenant by the entirety with his mother's husband upon her death. That doesn't make much sense to me. Tenancy by the entirety is between spouses, and the son isn't the husband's spouse. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says no, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties, and the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death. This seems to align with what I was thinking. Since the deed was invalid, the husband is now the sole owner and can evict the stepson.\n\nOption D says no, a mother cannot convey a real estate interest to a son without getting the approval of all of her children. This seems off. I don't think that conveying property to one child requires approval from all children. That doesn't sound right.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the correct answer is C. The mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties, and the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn tenancy by the entirety, both spouses must agree to transfer or convey the property. If one spouse tries to convey their interest without the other's consent, that conveyance is generally invalid. So, the stepson doesn't actually have any legal interest in the property based on that deed.\n\nUpon the wife's death, the property passes automatically to the husband, as per the tenancy by the entirety rules, unless the tenancy was severed properly before her death, which it wasn't in this case.\n\nTherefore, the husband is the sole owner and has the right to evict the stepson.\n\nSo, the stepson cannot prevail by asserting his deed from his mother because that deed is invalid.\n\nHence, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
