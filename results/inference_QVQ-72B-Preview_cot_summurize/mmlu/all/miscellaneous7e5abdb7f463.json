Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these refers to elegant handwriting.\n\nFirst off, I know that handwriting can be artistic, right? Like, some people can write really beautifully, and that's kind of elegant. So, among these options, which one is related to writing or handwriting?\n\nLet me think about option A: calligraphy. I've heard of calligraphy before. I think it's like fancy writing, maybe involving different styles of lettering. Actually, I recall seeing calligraphy in wedding invitations or certificates where the text is written in a very elaborate and stylish way. That sounds a lot like elegant handwriting. So, maybe A. calligraphy is the answer.\n\nNow, option B: engraving. I'm not so sure about this one. Engraving, to me, seems more about carving or etching images or text into surfaces like metal or stone. It's more about permanent marking or decoration, not necessarily about handwriting. So, while it can involve text, it's not specifically about elegant handwriting.\n\nOption C: decoupage. I've heard of decoupage, but I'm not entirely sure what it entails. I think it's a technique where you glue paper cutouts onto surfaces and then coat them with varnish or something similar to create decorative items. It's more of a craft technique involving cutting and pasting, not really related to handwriting.\n\nLastly, option D: lithography. I remember learning about lithography in the context of printing. It's a method of printing where images are transferred from a flat surface to paper or another material. It's primarily a printing technique, not directly related to handwriting.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, calligraphy seems to be the one that directly relates to elegant handwriting. It's the art of beautiful writing, often involving stylized letterforms and intricate designs. The other options\u2014engraving, decoupage, and lithography\u2014are more about different forms of art or decoration that aren't specifically focused on handwriting.\n\nI think I'm confident with my choice here. The correct answer should be A. calligraphy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. calligraphy}} \\]"
