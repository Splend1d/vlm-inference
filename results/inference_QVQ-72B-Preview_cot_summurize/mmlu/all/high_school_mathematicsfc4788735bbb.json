                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Owen has blue jeans with a 32-inch waist, and his waist circumference increases by 15%. I need to find out what his new jean waist size will be, rounded to the nearest whole inch.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 15% increase on his current waist size means. Percentage increase is calculated based on the original amount, so I'll need to find 15% of 32 inches and then add that to the original size.\n\nTo find 15% of 32 inches, I can calculate 15/100 * 32. Let's do that:\n\n15/100 = 0.15\n\n0.15 * 32 = 4.8 inches\n\nSo, his waist increases by 4.8 inches.\n\nNow, to find the new waist size, I add this increase to the original size:\n\n32 inches + 4.8 inches = 36.8 inches\n\nBut the question asks for the nearest whole inch, so I need to round 36.8 to the nearest whole number.\n\nLooking at 36.8, it's between 36 and 37. Since .8 is greater than .5, I should round up to 37 inches.\n\nSo, Owen's new jean waist size would be 37 inches.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm calculating the percentage increase correctly. Sometimes, people might confuse percentage increases with absolute increases.\n\nAnother way to calculate the increased waist size is to use the formula:\n\nNew waist size = original waist size + (percentage increase * original waist size)\n\nWhich is what I did: 32 + (0.15 * 32) = 32 + 4.8 = 36.8 inches.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\nNew waist size = original waist size * (1 + percentage increase)\n\nSo, 32 * (1 + 0.15) = 32 * 1.15 = 36.8 inches.\n\nYep, same result.\n\nNow, rounding 36.8 to the nearest whole inch would indeed be 37 inches, since the decimal is .8, which is greater than .5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 35 inches\n\nB. 36 inches\n\nC. 37 inches\n\nD. 38 inches\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. 37 inches.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
