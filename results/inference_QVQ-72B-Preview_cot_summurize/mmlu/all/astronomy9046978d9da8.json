                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is asking which planet(s) in the solar system have active plate tectonics. The options are Mars, Venus, Earth, or both Mars and Earth. Hmm, I need to recall what plate tectonics is and which planets exhibit this phenomenon.\n\nFirst off, plate tectonics is the theory that Earth's outer shell is divided into several rigid plates that ride on top of a more fluid layer. These plates move relative to one another and interact at their boundaries, leading to geological activities like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountain ranges. So, it's a process that shapes the surface of a planet and can also affect its interior and atmosphere.\n\nNow, Earth is the most well-known example of a planet with active plate tectonics. It's one of the key features that make Earth habitable, as the movement of plates helps regulate the planet's temperature by facilitating the exchange of heat and gases between the interior and the surface. Without plate tectonics, Earth might be a much different place, perhaps more like some of the other terrestrial planets.\n\nLet's consider Mars. Mars is smaller than Earth and has a thinner crust, but there's evidence to suggest that it once had active geology in the distant past. There are large volcanic features and extensive valley networks that imply some form of plate movement or at least volcanic activity. However, most of this activity seems to have ceased billions of years ago. The Martian crust appears to be mostly rigid now, without the kind of widespread plate movement seen on Earth. So, while Mars may have had some form of plate tectonics in the past, it doesn't seem to have active plate tectonics today.\n\nNext, Venus. Venus is often called Earth's sister planet because of its similar size and mass, but it's drastically different in terms of surface conditions. Venus has an extremely thick atmosphere and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead. In terms of geology, Venus shows evidence of past volcanic activity and some tectonic features, but again, these seem to be from a long time ago. The Venusian crust appears to be mostly stationary now, without the active plate boundaries that characterize Earth's tectonics.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that among the options provided\u2014Mars, Venus, and Earth\u2014only Earth currently has active plate tectonics. But just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any possibility of active plate tectonics on other celestial bodies in the solar system.\n\nFor example, Jupiter's moon Europa is known for its icy surface and potential ocean beneath, and there might be some tectonic activity there, but that's beyond the scope of this question, which specifies planets in the solar system.\n\nSimilarly, Saturn's moon Titan has geological features like dunes and lakes, but again, these are moons, not planets.\n\nBack to the options given: Mars, Venus, Earth, or both Mars and Earth. Given that Mars and Venus do not exhibit active plate tectonics at present, the correct answer should be Earth alone.\n\nWait a minute, I recall reading about some scientists proposing that Mars might still have some tectonic activity, perhaps in the form of occasional quakes or volcanic eruptions. But from what I can remember, it's nothing on the scale of Earth's plate tectonics. Most of Mars's geological activity seems to be dormant or extinct.\n\nSimilarly, Venus's geology is complex, with evidence of past global resurfacing events, but again, no clear signs of current plate tectonics.\n\nTherefore, the only planet in our solar system that definitively has active plate tectonics is Earth. So, the answer should be C. Earth.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check a few points. First, plate tectonics requires a few key elements: a strong, rigid outer layer (the lithosphere), a weaker, more plastic underlying layer (the asthenosphere), and internal heat to drive the movement of these plates. Earth has all of these, thanks to its size, composition, and heat production from radioactive decay.\n\nOn Mars, its smaller size means it cooled faster, and its internal heat is much reduced compared to Earth's. This likely led to the stiffening of its crust and the cessation of plate tectonics over time.\n\nVenus, despite being larger and closer to the Sun, seems to handle its internal heat differently. Some scientists suggest that Venus may experience episodic global reorganizations of its crust rather than steady plate tectonics, but this is still a topic of research.\n\nTherefore, based on current scientific understanding, Earth is the only planet in our solar system with active plate tectonics. So, the answer is C. Earth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
