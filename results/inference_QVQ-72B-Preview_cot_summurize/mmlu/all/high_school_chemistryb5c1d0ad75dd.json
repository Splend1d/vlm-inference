                    "text": "So I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the equilibrium concentration of BrCl given some initial amounts and an equilibrium constant. Let me try to wrap my head around this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions the reaction of Br\u2082(g) with Cl\u2082(g) to form BrCl(g). The equilibrium constant K is 15.0 at a certain temperature. I should probably start by writing out the balanced chemical equation for this reaction. I believe it's:\n\nBr\u2082(g) + Cl\u2082(g) \u21cc 2 BrCl(g)\n\nWait, actually, I think the products are BrCl and maybe something else? Let me double-check that. Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082 are both diatomic molecules, and BrCl is already a diatomic molecule as well. Maybe the reaction is directly Br\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u21cc 2 BrCl. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNext, it says there are initially 10.0 grams of BrCl present in a 15.0-liter reaction vessel. I need to find the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert the initial amount of BrCl into moles and then into concentration to see where I'm starting from.\n\nThe molar mass of BrCl: Br is approximately 80 g/mol, and Cl is about 35.5 g/mol, so BrCl is about 115.5 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of BrCl initially = 10.0 g / 115.5 g/mol \u2248 0.0866 moles.\n\nThe initial concentration of BrCl is 0.0866 moles / 15.0 L \u2248 0.00577 M.\n\nWait a minute, but the reaction starts with Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082, but here we have BrCl initially present. Does that mean there's no Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082 initially? Or are they present as well? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I have to assume that only BrCl is present initially, and the reaction can proceed in both directions to reach equilibrium.\n\nBut, in reality, for the reaction Br\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u21cc 2 BrCl, if only BrCl is present initially, the reaction would proceed to produce some Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082 to reach equilibrium.\n\nSo, I need to set up an ICE table to represent the initial concentrations, the changes in concentrations, and the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nLet me define the variables:\n\nLet's say the change in concentration of BrCl is -2x (since it's on the product side), so the concentrations would change as follows:\n\nBr\u2082: +x\n\nCl\u2082: +x\n\nBrCl: -2x\n\nBut wait, if BrCl is being consumed to produce Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082, then BrCl decreases by 2x, and Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082 each increase by x.\n\nBut initially, there is only BrCl present, so [Br\u2082] and [Cl\u2082] are zero initially.\n\nSo, the ICE table would look like this:\n\nInitial: [Br\u2082] = 0 M, [Cl\u2082] = 0 M, [BrCl] = 0.00577 M\n\nChange: +x, +x, -2x\n\nEquilibrium: [Br\u2082] = x, [Cl\u2082] = x, [BrCl] = 0.00577 - 2x\n\nNow, the equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:\n\nK = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br\u2082][Cl\u2082]) = 15.0\n\nSo, plugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n15.0 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / (x * x)\n\nWait, no. Actually, according to the balanced equation, it should be:\n\nK = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br\u2082][Cl\u2082]) = 15.0\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n15.0 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / (x * x)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the stoichiometry is correct. Let me double-check the balanced equation.\n\nBr\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u21cc 2 BrCl\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the equilibrium expression is indeed K = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br\u2082][Cl\u2082]).\n\nNow, I have to solve for x in this equation:\n\n15.0 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / (x^2)\n\nFirst, I can take the square root of both sides to simplify, but that might not be the best approach. Maybe it's better to expand the numerator and then solve the resulting equation.\n\nLet me expand (0.00577 - 2x)^2:\n\n(0.00577 - 2x)^2 = 0.00577^2 - 2*(0.00577)*(2x) + (2x)^2 = 0.00003329 - 0.02308x + 4x^2\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n15.0 = (0.00003329 - 0.02308x + 4x^2) / x^2\n\nNow, multiply both sides by x^2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n15.0 * x^2 = 0.00003329 - 0.02308x + 4x^2\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.\n\nActually, when you have:\n\n15.0 = (0.00003329 - 0.02308x + 4x^2) / x^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2:\n\n15.0 * x^2 = 0.00003329 - 0.02308x + 4x^2\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side:\n\n15x^2 - 0.00003329 + 0.02308x - 4x^2 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(15x^2 - 4x^2) + 0.02308x - 0.00003329 = 0\n\n11x^2 + 0.02308x - 0.00003329 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in terms of x:\n\n11x^2 + 0.02308x - 0.00003329 = 0\n\nI can solve this quadratic equation for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nWhere a = 11, b = 0.02308, and c = -0.00003329\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant:\n\nD = b^2 - 4ac = (0.02308)^2 - 4*(11)*(-0.00003329)\n\nCalculate (0.02308)^2:\n\n0.02308 * 0.02308 = 0.00053269664\n\nNow, calculate 4*11*(-0.00003329):\n\n4*11 = 44\n\n44*(-0.00003329) = -0.00146476\n\nSo, D = 0.00053269664 + 0.00146476 = 0.00199745664\n\nNow, sqrt(D) = sqrt(0.00199745664) \u2248 0.0447\n\nNow, x = [-0.02308 \u00b1 0.0447] / (2*11)\n\nFirst, calculate -0.02308 + 0.0447 \u2248 0.02162\n\nThen, -0.02308 - 0.0447 \u2248 -0.06778\n\nNow, divide both by 22:\n\nx \u2248 0.02162 / 22 \u2248 0.0009827 M\n\nAnd x \u2248 -0.06778 / 22 \u2248 -0.00308 M\n\nSince concentration can't be negative, we discard the negative value.\n\nSo, x \u2248 0.0009827 M\n\nNow, the equilibrium concentration of BrCl is:\n\n[BrCl] = initial [BrCl] - 2x = 0.00577 M - 2*(0.0009827 M) \u2248 0.00577 - 0.0019654 \u2248 0.0038046 M\n\nNow, I need to see which of the provided options this corresponds to.\n\nOption A is 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L, which is 0.0038 M\n\nOption B is 5.77 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L, which is 0.00577 M (initial concentration)\n\nOption C is 1.97 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nOption D is 9.9 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 0.0038046 M, which is closest to option A: 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.\n\nBut let me check if this is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the ICE table.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the reaction starting from the reactants, but the problem states that only BrCl is present initially, so the reaction would proceed to the left to produce Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is Br\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u21cc 2 BrCl, and if only BrCl is present, the reaction would proceed to produce Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082.\n\nWait, but in that case, perhaps I need to consider the direction of the reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the reaction quotient Q compared to K.\n\nInitially, [BrCl] = 0.00577 M, and [Br\u2082] and [Cl\u2082] are zero.\n\nSo, Q = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br\u2082][Cl\u2082]) = (0.00577)^2 / (0)(0) = undefined.\n\nSince [Br\u2082] and [Cl\u2082] are zero, Q is effectively zero, which is less than K = 15.0.\n\nTherefore, the reaction will proceed to the right to reach equilibrium, meaning [BrCl] will decrease, and [Br\u2082] and [Cl\u2082] will increase.\n\nSo, my ICE table should be:\n\nInitial: [Br\u2082] = 0 M, [Cl\u2082] = 0 M, [BrCl] = 0.00577 M\n\nChange: +x, +x, -2x\n\nEquilibrium: [Br\u2082] = x, [Cl\u2082] = x, [BrCl] = 0.00577 - 2x\n\nNow, plug into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\nK = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br\u2082][Cl\u2082]) = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / (x * x) = 15.0\n\nSo, (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / x^2 = 15.0\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n(0.00577 - 2x) / x = sqrt(15.0)\n\nSo, 0.00577 - 2x = x * sqrt(15.0)\n\nLet me calculate sqrt(15.0) \u2248 3.87299\n\nSo, 0.00577 - 2x = 3.87299x\n\nNow, bring like terms together:\n\n0.00577 = 3.87299x + 2x = 5.87299x\n\nSo, x = 0.00577 / 5.87299 \u2248 0.0009827 M\n\nWhich matches my previous calculation.\n\nThen, [BrCl] at equilibrium = 0.00577 - 2*(0.0009827) \u2248 0.00577 - 0.0019654 \u2248 0.0038046 M\n\nWhich is approximately 0.0038 M or 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 M, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut let me check if there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the relationship between Q and K.\n\nInitially, Q = 0, which is less than K = 15.0, so the reaction proceeds to the right.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the reaction is Br\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u21cc 2 BrCl, and if only BrCl is present, perhaps I need to think about the reverse reaction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the reaction starting from the products side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the integrated rate law or some other method, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that since K is 15.0, and the initial [BrCl] is 0.00577 M, the reaction will proceed significantly to the left.\n\nBut given that K is 15.0, which is relatively large, the reaction favors the products.\n\nWait, but in this case, since we have only BrCl initially, the reaction would proceed to the left to produce Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me try to use the equilibrium constant expression directly.\n\nGiven that K = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br\u2082][Cl\u2082]) = 15.0\n\nAnd at equilibrium, [BrCl] = 0.00577 - 2x, [Br\u2082] = x, [Cl\u2082] = x\n\nSo, 15.0 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / (x * x)\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rearrange this equation to solve for x more easily.\n\nLet me set y = x, then the equation becomes:\n\n15.0 = (0.00577 - 2y)^2 / y^2\n\nTake square roots:\n\nsqrt(15.0) = (0.00577 - 2y) / y\n\nSo, 3.87299 y = 0.00577 - 2y\n\nThen, 3.87299 y + 2y = 0.00577\n\n5.87299 y = 0.00577\n\ny = 0.00577 / 5.87299 \u2248 0.0009827 M\n\nThen, [BrCl] = 0.00577 - 2*(0.0009827) \u2248 0.0038046 M\n\nWhich again gives approximately 0.0038 M, matching option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is different, but based on the information given, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the units more carefully.\n\nGiven that the volume is in liters and mass is in grams, I converted grams of BrCl to moles correctly, and then to concentration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the molar masses more precisely.\n\nThe molar mass of Br is 79.904 g/mol, and Cl is 35.453 g/mol, so BrCl is approximately 115.357 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of BrCl = 10.0 g / 115.357 g/mol \u2248 0.0867 moles\n\nThen, initial concentration = 0.0867 M / 15.0 L \u2248 0.00578 M\n\nThen, proceeding as before, x \u2248 0.000983 M\n\nThen, [BrCl] \u2248 0.00578 - 2*(0.000983) \u2248 0.00578 - 0.001966 \u2248 0.003814 M\n\nWhich is still approximately 0.0038 M.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
