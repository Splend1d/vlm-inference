                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. So, statement 1 says: If T: V -> W is a linear transformation and dim(V) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what it means for a linear transformation to be injective. Injectivity means that each element in V is mapped to a unique element in W, right? In other words, if T(u) = T(v), then u must equal v.\n\nNow, the condition given is dim(V) < dim(W) < 1. Wait a minute, dim(W) is less than 1? That seems odd because dimensions are usually non-negative integers. Maybe there's a typo here. Perhaps it should be dim(V) < dim(W), and the \"< 1\" is just a misplacement. Assuming that, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, if dim(V) < dim(W), meaning the dimension of V is less than the dimension of W, what can I say about T being injective?\n\nI remember the rank-nullity theorem, which states that for a linear transformation T: V -> W,\n\ndim(V) = rank(T) + nullity(T)\n\nwhere rank(T) is the dimension of the image of T, and nullity(T) is the dimension of the kernel of T.\n\nFor T to be injective, its kernel should be {0}, which means nullity(T) = 0.\n\nGiven that dim(V) < dim(W), can I conclude that nullity(T) = 0?\n\nWell, rank(T) can be at most dim(V), and since dim(W) is larger, there's room for the image in W, but does that force nullity(T) to be zero?\n\nNot necessarily. Even if dim(V) < dim(W), it's possible to have a linear transformation where the kernel is nontrivial, meaning nullity(T) > 0.\n\nFor example, consider V = R^1 and W = R^2. Then dim(V) = 1 < dim(W) = 2.\n\nDefine T: V -> W by T(v) = 0 for all v in V. Then T is the zero transformation, with rank(T) = 0 and nullity(T) = 1, which is equal to dim(V). So, in this case, T is not injective because its kernel is not {0}.\n\nAnother example: take T to be the identity map. Then rank(T) = dim(V), and nullity(T) = 0, so T is injective.\n\nTherefore, depending on the specific transformation, T can be either injective or not, even if dim(V) < dim(W).\n\nSo, statement 1 seems to be false based on this reasoning.\n\nMoving on to statement 2: Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V -> V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\nOkay, so here V is finite-dimensional with dimension n, and T is a linear transformation from V to itself.\n\nWe're given that T is injective, and we need to show that it's a bijection.\n\nI recall that for functions from a set to itself, injectivity implies bijectivity if the set is finite. But here V is a vector space, which is infinite-dimensional unless n=0, but n is at least 1, I assume.\n\nWait, V is n-dimensional, which is finite, but V itself is infinite because it's a vector space over an infinite field, like the real numbers.\n\nBut in linear algebra, for linear transformations from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself, injectivity does imply bijectivity.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nGiven that dim(V) = n, and T: V -> V is linear and injective, then by the rank-nullity theorem:\n\ndim(V) = rank(T) + nullity(T)\n\nSince T is injective, nullity(T) = 0, so rank(T) = dim(V) = n.\n\nBut rank(T) is the dimension of the image of T, so dim(im(T)) = n.\n\nSince dim(V) = n, this means im(T) = V, which means T is surjective.\n\nTherefore, T is both injective and surjective, which makes it a bijection.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, in the context of linear algebra, for a linear transformation T: V -> V where V is finite-dimensional, T is injective if and only if it's surjective, which implies T is bijective.\n\nSo, statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be False, True for statement 1 and statement 2, respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nSo, the answer is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
