                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"A city that is more than twice as large as the next largest city in a country is called a ________.\" And the options are A. global city, B. world leader city, C. megalopolis, D. primate city.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these terms fits the description of a city that's more than twice as large as the next biggest city in its country.\n\nLet me start by understanding what each term means.\n\nFirst, a global city. I think global cities are major centers of commerce and finance that have a significant influence on the world stage. Places like New York, London, or Tokyo come to mind. But the definition doesn't seem to hinge on size comparison with other cities in the same country. So, maybe this isn't the right fit.\n\nNext, world leader city. That sounds similar to global cities. These are cities that lead in various sectors on a global scale, like technology, fashion, or finance. Again, it's about international standing rather than size relative to other cities in the same country.\n\nMegalopolis. This term usually refers to a large cluster of cities that are so closely connected that they form a single, massive urban area. Think of the Northeastern Seaboard in the United States, from Boston down to Washington, D.C. It's not about a single city being twice as big as another in the same country.\n\nPrimate city. Now, this sounds familiar. I recall that a primate city is the largest city in a country, usually the capital, and it's significantly bigger than other cities in the nation. Often, it dominates the country's economic, cultural, and political life.\n\nWait a minute, the question specifies that the city is more than twice as large as the next largest city in the country. So, it's not just about being the biggest city, but about having a specific size relationship with the second-biggest city.\n\nLet me check each option again with this in mind.\n\nGlobal city: These are important international hubs, but their size relative to other cities in their own country isn't directly tied to their definition.\n\nWorld leader city: Similar to global cities, more about international influence than size comparison within the country.\n\nMegalopolis: This is about a dense cluster of cities, not about a single city being twice as big as another.\n\nPrimate city: This seems the closest. Primate cities are indeed the largest in their country and often significantly larger than other cities there.\n\nBut is there a specific threshold, like being more than twice as large?\n\nI think so. In geography, a primate city is typically defined as being at least twice as large as the next largest city in the country. In fact, some definitions require it to be three times as large.\n\nSo, if a city is more than twice as large as the next biggest city in its country, it fits the definition of a primate city.\n\nLet me confirm this with an example. Take Thailand, where Bangkok is by far the largest city, much bigger than Chiang Mai or any other city in the country. Bangkok is often referred to as a primate city.\n\nSimilarly, in Turkey, Istanbul is much larger than Ankara, the capital. Again, it's considered a primate city.\n\nOn the other hand, in countries like the United States, where New York is the largest city but not more than twice as large as Los Angeles or Chicago, it doesn't fit the primate city definition.\n\nWait, but New York is still a global city and a world leader in many respects, but it's not a primate city because there are other large cities in the country that are comparable in size, at least to some extent.\n\nSo, based on this, the term that fits the description in the question is \"primate city.\"\n\nJust to make sure, let's look at the other options again.\n\nGlobal city: Not about size comparison within the country.\n\nWorld leader city: Also not directly related to size within the country.\n\nMegalopolis: Refers to a large urban cluster, not to a single city being dominantly large.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. primate city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
