                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"When an object is set vibrating by a wave that has a matching frequency, what occurs is...\" and the options are A. forced vibration, B. resonance, C. refraction, D. amplitude reduction. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening. There's an object, and it's being made to vibrate by a wave that has the same frequency as it. So, the frequency of the wave matches the natural frequency of the object.\n\nI remember learning about natural frequencies. Every object has a natural frequency at which it vibrates or oscillates when disturbed. And when an external force is applied at that same frequency, something special happens.\n\nOption A is forced vibration. Forced vibration happens when an external force is applied to an object, causing it to vibrate at the frequency of the force. But in this case, the wave has a matching frequency, so maybe it's more than just forced vibration.\n\nOption B is resonance. Resonance occurs when an object is forced to vibrate at its natural frequency, leading to a large increase in amplitude. This is because the external force is adding energy to the system in sync with the object's natural oscillations.\n\nOption C is refraction. Refraction is when a wave changes direction as it passes from one medium to another, like light bending when it goes from air to water. This doesn't seem related to making an object vibrate.\n\nOption D is amplitude reduction. This sounds like the vibration is getting smaller, maybe due to damping or some resistance. But the question is about setting the object vibrating, not reducing its vibration.\n\nSo, considering the scenario, where a wave is making an object vibrate at a matching frequency, it seems like resonance is the most fitting answer. The external force (the wave) is at the same frequency as the object's natural frequency, which should cause resonance, leading to larger vibrations.\n\nBut wait, let's think about forced vibration again. Forced vibration can happen at any frequency, but when the forcing frequency matches the natural frequency, that's resonance. So, forced vibration is a broader term, and resonance is a specific case where the frequencies match and lead to maximum amplitude.\n\nGiven that, the question specifies that the wave has a matching frequency, so it's not just any forced vibration, but specifically resonance.\n\nI don't think it's refraction because that's about waves changing direction, not making objects vibrate.\n\nAmplitude reduction would be the opposite of what's happening in resonance, where amplitude increases, so that doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. resonance.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider an example. Suppose you have a guitar string tuned to a certain frequency. If you pluck it, it vibrates at its natural frequency. If you have another object, say a wine glass, that has the same natural frequency, and you bring the vibrating guitar string close to it, the wine glass might start vibrating too, due to the sound waves from the guitar string matching its natural frequency. This is resonance.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the wine glass is being set vibrating by the wave (sound wave from the guitar string) that has a matching frequency, and that's resonance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. resonance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
