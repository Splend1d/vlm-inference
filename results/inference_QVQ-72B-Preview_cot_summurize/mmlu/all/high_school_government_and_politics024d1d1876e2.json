                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives. Let me see if I can figure this out. I know that both are parts of the U.S. Congress, but they have different roles and rules.\n\nOption A says that only the House has the power to issue subpoenas. Hmm, I thought both chambers could issue subpoenas as part of their investigative powers. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOption B claims that only the Senate may introduce revenue bills. I remember learning that in the United States, revenue bills, which are about taxing and spending, have to start in the House of Representatives. So, that seems backwards. Maybe that's not correct.\n\nOption C states that states are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population. Wait a minute, I think it's the other way around. In the House, representation is based on population, so bigger states have more representatives, while in the Senate, each state gets two senators, regardless of population. So, this option seems confused.\n\nOption D says that the Senate allows unlimited debate, while the House does not. I know that the House has strict time limits on debate, usually controlled by the Rules Committee. In the Senate, debate can go on longer, and there's this thing called filibuster, where a senator can talk endlessly to delay a vote. But I think there are limits to that now; maybe they changed the rules.\n\nLet me think again. I think the House allows more limited debate compared to the Senate. In the Senate, traditionally, debate could go on indefinitely, but there have been changes to the rules recently, especially for certain types of legislation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the Senate used to allow unlimited debate, but now there are restrictions like the filibuster rule, where a certain number of senators can end debate by invoking cloture.\n\nBut in comparison, the House has always had stricter debate limits, so that might be a key difference.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is correct, but I need to confirm.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA. Only the House has the power to issue subpoenas.\n\n- Both the House and the Senate can issue subpoenas for investigations and oversight.\n\nB. Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n\n- Actually, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nC. States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n\n- No, in the House, representation is proportional to population (based on census data), while in the Senate, each state has two senators, regardless of population.\n\nD. The Senate allows unlimited debate, while the House does not.\n\n- While the Senate traditionally allows for longer and potentially unlimited debate (though filibuster rules can restrict this), the House has stricter time limits on debate.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's think about subpoenas: Both chambers can issue subpoenas; it's not exclusive to the House.\n\nRevenue bills: Exclusively House's prerogative to originate them.\n\nRepresentation: House is population-based, Senate is equal per state.\n\nDebate: Senate allows longer debate, House has stricter limits.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the Senate allows more unlimited debate compared to the House.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
