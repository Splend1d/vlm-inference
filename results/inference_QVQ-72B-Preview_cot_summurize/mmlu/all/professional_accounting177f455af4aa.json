                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about audit confirmations. The auditor is using a blank form for positive accounts receivable confirmation. I need to figure out why this approach might be ineffective based on the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a blank form of positive confirmation means. I think it's when the auditor sends a confirmation request to the customer without preprinting any information, like the account balance or specific transactions. The customer is supposed to fill in the details themselves.\n\nOption A says that not all accounts have an equal chance of being selected for confirmation. Hmm, that sounds like it relates to the sampling method, not necessarily to the type of confirmation form used. Maybe this isn't directly related to the blank form issue.\n\nOption B mentions that unconfirmed accounts may have already been written off as uncollectible. That seems more related to the accounts that the auditor decides not to confirm, perhaps because they think they're not collectible. But if the auditor is using a blank form, I'm not sure how that affects the writedowns.\n\nOption C says that few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients. That makes sense. If the form is blank, the customer has to look up their balance and fill it in, which is more work than just checking a preprinted balance. So, they might be less likely to respond.\n\nOption D states that the accounts actually confirmed may not be representative of the population. This seems similar to option A, suggesting that the sample isn't representative. Again, this seems more about how the sample is selected rather than the type of confirmation form used.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about the blank form being ineffective. So, what does the blank form specifically affect?\n\nWell, the blank form requires the customer to provide the balance information. This could lead to several issues:\n\n- Customers might not respond because it's inconvenient.\n\n- Customers might provide incorrect information if they look up the wrong balance.\n\n- There might be a higher risk of fraud if the customer can fill in any amount.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C seems to directly address the issue of response rates due to the extra effort required.\n\nOption A is about equal opportunity in selection, which is more about the sampling technique, not the confirmation form type.\n\nOption B is about accounts being written off, which isn't directly related to the use of a blank form.\n\nOption D is about representativeness of the confirmed accounts, which again seems more about the sampling method.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is option C: few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another angle. Maybe the blank form doesn't ensure that all accounts are confirmed, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the blank form could lead to confirmation requests being sent to accounts that have been written off, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blank form doesn't allow for equal selection chances, but I don't see how that would be the case.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is option C. The blank form requires more effort from the customer, which could lead to lower response rates, making the confirmation process less effective.\n\nYeah, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
