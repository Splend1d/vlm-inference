                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the Inca civilization and their agriculture methods. It says that by practicing a certain technique, the Inca were able to greatly increase the amount of arable land. The options are irrigating, terracing, slashing and burning, and fertilizing. I need to pick the one that best fits this description.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what arable land means. Arable land is land that can be plowed and used to grow crops, right? So, the Inca found a way to turn more land into usable farm land through one of these practices.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with irrigating. I know that irrigation is about providing water to fields, especially in dry areas. It's a way to make sure crops get enough water to grow, even when there's not enough rainfall. So, irrigating might help in using land that otherwise wouldn't get enough water, turning it into productive farm land. That sounds like it could increase arable land.\n\nNext is terracing. I've heard of terraced fields, especially in mountainous areas. It's when you build steps or flat areas on steep slopes so that you can plant crops without them sliding down the hill. This seems like a way to use land that's too steep for normal farming. By building these terraces, you can create flat surfaces where you can grow crops. So, this also seems like a method to increase arable land.\n\nThen there's slashing and burning. I think this is a method where you cut down trees and bushes in a forested area and then burn them to clear the land for farming. The ash from the burning acts as fertilizer. This practice is often used in tropical regions to clear forests for agriculture. So, in this case, you're turning forested land into farmable land. This could also increase arable land, especially in areas with dense vegetation.\n\nLastly, there's fertilizing. Fertilizers add nutrients to the soil, which can improve crop yields. But does it necessarily increase the amount of arable land? Well, it might help make existing land more productive, but it's not directly about turning non-arable land into arable land.\n\nSo, all of these practices\u2014irrigating, terracing, slashing and burning, and fertilizing\u2014can influence arable land, but in different ways. Irrigating helps with water management, terracing deals with slope and erosion, slashing and burning clears vegetation, and fertilizing improves soil fertility.\n\nBut the question is specifically about increasing the amount of arable land. That is, turning land that wasn't previously arable into arable land.\n\nLet me consider the Inca civilization specifically. They were located in the Andes Mountains, which are known for their steep slopes and high altitude. So, land was probably limited, and much of it was too steep for farming without some kind of modification.\n\nGiven that context, terracing seems particularly relevant. Building terraces on steep slopes would allow them to cultivate crops that otherwise couldn't be grown on such terrain. This would effectively increase the amount of arable land available to them.\n\nIrrigating is also important in the Andes, as water can be scarce at higher altitudes, but it doesn't directly address the issue of steep slopes.\n\nSlashing and burning might have been used in forested areas, but I don't recall the Inca having extensive forests in their primary territories. Their main challenge was more about cultivating on mountainous terrain.\n\nFertilizing would help with soil quality, but again, it doesn't directly convert non-arable land into arable land.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, terracing seems to be the most appropriate answer to the question of how the Inca increased their arable land.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Did the Inca actually practice terracing extensively? I have a vague memory of seeing pictures or models of Inca terraces, like in Machu Picchu, where there are clear examples of terraced fields.\n\nAlso, I recall that the Andes are characterized by their rugged terrain, so terracing would make a lot of sense for agriculture there. It not only provides flat areas for planting but also helps prevent soil erosion on the steep slopes.\n\nIn contrast, irrigating is more about water management and is common in many civilizations, but it doesn't directly address the physical constraints of steep land.\n\nSlashing and burning, while it can clear land for farming, is more typical of forested regions, which may not have been as prevalent in the Inca empire.\n\nFertilizing is about enhancing soil fertility, which is important, but it doesn't transform non-arable land into arable land.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm fairly confident that terracing is the correct answer to how the Inca increased their arable land.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other practice that the Inca might have used that isn't listed here. For example, they might have used raised fields in wetlands, which is another way to create arable land, but that's more associated with the Aztecs in Mexico.\n\nAlso, the Inca were known for their advanced engineering, including aqueducts and canals for water management, but again, that relates more to irrigating than to directly increasing arable land.\n\nTherefore, based on this detailed thought process, I believe the best answer is B. terracing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
