                    "text": "So I've got this problem about Alex placing paving stones. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, Alex starts at the crate of stones, walks three feet, places the first stone, and then walks back to the crate. So for the first stone, the total distance walked is 3 feet there and 3 feet back, which is 6 feet in total.\n\nFor each subsequent stone, Alex walks two feet farther each way compared to the previous stone. So for the second stone, it's 3 + 2 = 5 feet each way, so 10 feet total. For the third stone, it's 5 + 2 = 7 feet each way, so 14 feet total. And this pattern continues.\n\nSo, for the nth stone, the distance each way is (3 + 2*(n-1)) feet, and the total distance is 2*(3 + 2*(n-1)) feet.\n\nAlex places the first 50 stones, so I need to find the total distance walked after placing the 50th stone and returning to the crate.\n\nLet me try to find a formula for the total distance.\n\nFirst, let's define the distance for each stone.\n\nFor n = 1: 2*3 = 6 feet\n\nFor n = 2: 2*(3 + 2*(2-1)) = 2*(3 + 2) = 10 feet\n\nFor n = 3: 2*(3 + 2*(3-1)) = 2*(3 + 4) = 14 feet\n\n...\n\nFor n = k: 2*(3 + 2*(k-1)) = 2*(3 + 2k - 2) = 2*(2k + 1) = 4k + 2 feet\n\nSo, the total distance for the kth stone is 4k + 2 feet.\n\nNow, to find the total distance for all stones from the first to the 50th, I need to sum this up from k = 1 to k = 50.\n\nTotal distance = Sum from k=1 to 50 of (4k + 2)\n\nThis is an arithmetic series. Let's recall that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (first term + last term).\n\nAlternatively, I can write the sum as:\n\nSum = Sum from k=1 to 50 of 4k + Sum from k=1 to 50 of 2\n\nFirst, sum of 4k from k=1 to 50:\n\nSum of 4k = 4 * Sum from k=1 to 50 of k = 4 * (50/2)*(1 + 50) = 4 * 25 * 51\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the sum of the first n integers:\n\nSum from k=1 to n of k = n(n+1)/2\n\nSo, sum from k=1 to 50 of k = 50*51/2 = 1275\n\nTherefore, sum of 4k = 4 * 1275 = 5100\n\nNext, sum of 2 from k=1 to 50 is simply 2 * 50 = 100\n\nTherefore, total sum = 5100 + 100 = 5200 feet\n\nWait a minute, that's one of the options: C. 5200\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the distance for each stone:\n\nFor n=1: 6 feet (3 there, 3 back)\n\nn=2: 10 feet (5 there, 5 back)\n\nn=3: 14 feet (7 there, 7 back)\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nThe general formula for the nth stone: 2*(3 + 2*(n-1)) = 4n + 2\n\nThen, total distance is sum from n=1 to 50 of (4n + 2) = 4*1275 + 50*2 = 5100 + 100 = 5200\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider the distances each way.\n\nFirst stone: 3 feet each way, total 6\n\nSecond stone: 5 feet each way, total 10\n\nThird stone: 7 feet each way, total 14\n\n...\n\n50th stone: 3 + 2*(50-1) = 3 + 98 = 101 feet each way, total 202 feet\n\nSo, the sequence of total distances is: 6, 10, 14, ..., 202\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with first term a=6, common difference d=4, number of terms n=50\n\nThe sum is n/2 * (first term + last term) = 50/2 * (6 + 202) = 25 * 208 = 5200\n\nAgain, 5200 feet.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of an arithmetic series is also n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)\n\nPlugging in: 50/2 * (2*6 + 49*4) = 25*(12 + 196) = 25*208 = 5200\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total distance Alex walked after placing the 50th stone and returning to the crate is 5200 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5200} \\]"
