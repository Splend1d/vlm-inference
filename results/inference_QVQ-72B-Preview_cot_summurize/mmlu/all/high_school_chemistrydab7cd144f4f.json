                    "text": "So I have this question here about entropy, and I need to figure out which reaction has the greatest decrease in entropy. Entropy is kind of a tricky concept for me, but I think I have a basic understanding. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. When a reaction occurs, the entropy can either increase or decrease, depending on the nature of the reactants and products.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what factors affect entropy. Generally, entropy tends to be higher when you have gases because gas particles are more spread out and have more freedom of movement compared to liquids or solids. So, reactions that produce more gas molecules might have an increase in entropy, while reactions that produce fewer gas molecules might have a decrease in entropy.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \u2192 NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\n\nHere, both reactants are in aqueous solution, and the products are also in aqueous solution and water liquid. There are no gases involved in this reaction. So, I think the entropy change might be minimal, maybe even close to zero, because the states of matter are the same on both sides.\n\nB. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nIn this reaction, we have gases on the reactant side (CH4 and O2) and a gas and a liquid on the product side (CO2 and H2O). Specifically, there are 3 moles of gas on the reactant side (1 mole of CH4 + 2 moles of O2) and only 1 mole of gas on the product side (CO2). So, the number of gas moles decreases from 3 to 1, which suggests a decrease in entropy because there are fewer gas molecules to spread out the disorder.\n\nC. C(s) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g)\n\nHere, we have a solid (carbon) and a gas (oxygen) reacting to form a gas (carbon dioxide). The number of gas moles increases from 1 (O2) to 1 (CO2), so no change in gas moles. Since both are gases with the same number of moles, and one reactant is a solid, which has lower entropy, I think the entropy might actually increase slightly because the solid is turning into a gas.\n\nWait, but the question is about decrease in entropy, so maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nD. 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) \u2192 2 SO3(g)\n\nIn this reaction, we have 2 moles of SO2 gas and 1 mole of O2 gas reacting to form 2 moles of SO3 gas. So, total gas moles on the reactant side are 3 (2 SO2 + 1 O2), and on the product side, there are 2 moles of SO3. Again, fewer gas moles on the product side, which suggests a decrease in entropy.\n\nComparing options B and D, both have a decrease in gas moles, but option B has a decrease from 3 moles to 1 mole, which is a decrease of 2 moles, while option D has a decrease from 3 moles to 2 moles, which is a decrease of 1 mole. So, option B has a larger decrease in gas moles, which should correspond to a greater decrease in entropy.\n\nBut wait, in option B, one of the products is a liquid (H2O), which has lower entropy compared to a gas. So, maybe the decrease in entropy isn't just about the number of gas moles, but also about the state of the products.\n\nI need to consider the entropy changes associated with the physical states. Generally, gas > liquid > solid in terms of entropy.\n\nIn option B, even though there's a decrease of 2 moles of gas, one of the products is a liquid, which might compensate for some of the entropy decrease.\n\nIn option D, all reactants and products are gases, with a decrease of 1 mole of gas.\n\nWait, but option B has a larger decrease in gas moles (2 moles), while option D has a smaller decrease (1 mole). But option B also produces a liquid, which has lower entropy than a gas.\n\nI need to think about this more carefully.\n\nMaybe I should look up the standard entropy values for these substances to make a more accurate comparison.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for entropy change in a reaction, which is the sum of the entropies of the products minus the sum of the entropies of the reactants.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for this context.\n\nLet me try to think of a simpler way.\n\nSince entropy is largely determined by the number of possible arrangements of particles, reactions that produce fewer moles of gas or produce liquids or solids from gases will generally have a decrease in entropy.\n\nSo, in option B, you have 3 moles of gas reacting to form 1 mole of gas and 2 moles of liquid. That's a significant decrease in the number of gas moles, which should correspond to a large decrease in entropy.\n\nIn option D, you have 3 moles of gas reacting to form 2 moles of gas, which is still a decrease of 1 mole of gas, but not as large as in option B.\n\nAdditionally, in option C, you have a solid and a gas reacting to form a gas, which might actually increase entropy slightly due to the solid turning into a gas.\n\nOption A involves only aqueous and liquid phases, which might have a minimal change in entropy compared to reactions involving gases.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, option B seems to have the greatest decrease in entropy because it involves a larger decrease in the number of gas moles and the production of a liquid.\n\nI think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
