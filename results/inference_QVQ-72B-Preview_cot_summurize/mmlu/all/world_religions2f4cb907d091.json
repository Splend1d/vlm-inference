                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question: \"Which bodhisattva is known for conducting the souls of dead children to salvation?\" And the options are A. Guan-yin, B. Kannon, C. Ojizo-sama, D. Amitabha. Hmm, I'm a bit confused because some of these names seem similar, and I'm not entirely sure about their specific roles.\n\nFirst off, I know that a bodhisattva is a being who has attained a high level of wisdom and compassion in Buddhism and is destined to become a Buddha but has postponed enlightenment to help others. So, all of these options are bodhisattvas, but each has different emphasis or areas they are associated with.\n\nLet me start by looking up Guan-yin. I've heard of Guan-yin; she's often depicted in statues and is associated with mercy and compassion. In some traditions, she's known for hearing the cries of the world and is a symbol of compassion. But I'm not sure if she's specifically associated with guiding the souls of dead children to salvation.\n\nNext is Kannon. I think Kannon is the Japanese name for Guan-yin, like how different languages have their own names for the same bodhisattva. In Japanese Buddhism, Kannon is also associated with mercy and compassion. Maybe there's a specific aspect of Kannon that relates to children, but I need to check that.\n\nThen there's Ojizo-sama. I've seen small statues of Jizo in Japanese temples. He's often shown with a gentle face, sometimes wearing a monk's robe, and sometimes with a halo. I recall that Jizo is particularly revered for his role in comforting and protecting children, travelers, and even the deceased. Maybe he's the one who guides the souls of dead children to salvation.\n\nLastly, Amitabha. I know Amitabha is a buddha, actually, not a bodhisattva. Wait, is Amitabha a bodhisattva or a buddha? I think he's a buddha, specifically associated with the Pure Land tradition in Buddhism. He's believed to preside over the Western Pure Land, where beings who recite his name with faith and aspiration can be reborn upon death. But again, I'm not sure about his specific connection to children.\n\nLet me double-check that. Amitabha is indeed a buddha, not a bodhisattva, so maybe he shouldn't be on this list of bodhisattvas. Perhaps there's a mistake in the options. But maybe in some traditions, Amitabha is referred to as a bodhisattva before attaining buddhahood.\n\nWait, in some Buddhist traditions, Amitabha is considered a bodhisattva before becoming a buddha. But generally, he's venerated as a buddha. So, perhaps option D is a bit confusing.\n\nNow, going back to Ojizo-sama, I think he's the one who is particularly associated with children. In Japanese Buddhism, Jizo is often seen as a protector of children, travelers, and even pregnant women. There are many legends about Jizo comforting the souls of miscarried or stillborn children, guiding them to the Pure Land or other realms of existence.\n\nI think there's a specific belief that Jizo helps the souls of children who die before birth or in early childhood to cross over and find peace. There are even shrines dedicated to Jizo where people can pray for the repose of such souls.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like Ojizo-sama is the bodhisattva known for conducting the souls of dead children to salvation.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check about Guan-yin and Kannon again. While Guan-yin/Kannon is associated with mercy and compassion, and sometimes with fertility and protecting children, I don't think she/he is specifically known for guiding the souls of dead children.\n\nGuan-yin is often invoked for her compassionate nature, but in terms of guiding souls after death, especially of children, I think Jizo has a more direct association with that role.\n\nAs for Amitabha, as a buddha, he is believed to preside over the Pure Land, where beings can be reborn through faith in him. However, again, his primary role isn't specifically about guiding the souls of dead children; it's more about offering a path to enlightenment for all beings.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Ojizo-sama.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
