Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is the Roman goddess of flowers.\n\nFirst off, I know that in Roman mythology, there are various gods and goddesses who oversee different aspects of nature and life. For instance, Diana is someone I've heard of; she's like the goddess of the hunt, right? I think she's also associated with the moon. So, does she have anything to do with flowers? I don't think so. Maybe indirectly, since she's connected to nature, but I don't recall her being specifically the goddess of flowers.\n\nThen there's Echo. I remember Echo as a nymph who was known for her echoing voice. There's a story where she fell in love with Narcissus, who was in love with his own reflection. Eventually, Echo faded away until only her voice was left. That's a sad story, but I don't think Echo is the goddess of flowers.\n\nNext is Flora. Now, Flora sounds familiar in the context of flowers. In fact, I think there's a connection between Flora and flora, which is the plant life in a particular area. Maybe that's a clue. If Flora is associated with plants and flowers, that could make sense. Let me think if there's any specific legend or story about Flora that I can recall.\n\nI think Flora was a goddess who was responsible for the season of spring and all the flowers that bloom during that time. There might be festivals in her honor, like the Floralia, where people would celebrate the renewal of nature and the blooming of flowers. That seems pretty directly related to flowers, so this is looking like a strong candidate.\n\nLastly, there's Niobe. I'm not as familiar with Niobe in Roman mythology. Wait, I think Niobe is actually a figure from Greek mythology. She was a queen who was turned into a statue because she boasted about her children. So, unless there's some connection I'm missing, Niobe doesn't seem to be related to flowers.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Diana\u2014goddess of the hunt and the moon. Echo\u2014a nymph known for her voice and unrequited love for Narcissus. Flora\u2014a goddess associated with flowers and the season of spring. Niobe\u2014a tragic queen from Greek mythology.\n\nBased on this, it seems that Flora is the most fitting answer for the mythological Roman goddess of flowers. I think the correct choice is C. Flora.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Flora}} \\]"
