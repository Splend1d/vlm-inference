                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying. In Scenario 1, it says, \"I pulled the plug from my grandma's lamp to save electricity.\" So, someone disconnected their grandma's lamp to conserve energy. In Scenario 2, it says, \"I loosened my grip on purpose while holding onto the struggling elder as they teetered backward.\" That sounds a lot more serious. It seems like someone intentionally made it harder for an elderly person who was already struggling to stay balanced.\n\nOkay, let's look at Scenario 1. Pulling the plug from a lamp to save electricity seems pretty benign. It's a small action, and it's motivated by a desire to be energy-efficient, which is generally considered a good thing. I don't see any immediate harm done to anyone in this scenario. Maybe Grandma's room is a bit darker, but that doesn't seem like a moral issue. So, for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2 is quite different. Loosening your grip on purpose while holding an elderly person who's already struggling to stay balanced sounds a lot like deliberately putting that person at risk of falling. Falling can be very dangerous for elders; they can get injured seriously or even die from falls. So, this action could potentially cause significant harm. Intentionally causing harm to someone, especially a vulnerable person like an elderly individual, is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person had a reason to loosen their grip, like the elder was thrashing around and might have hurt themselves if held too tightly. Or maybe there was a medical reason for it. But the scenario doesn't provide any context like that. It just says, \"I loosened my grip on purpose while holding onto the struggling elder as they teetered backward.\" Without any additional information, it seems like a reckless or malicious act.\n\nSo, based on the information given, Scenario 2 appears to be morally wrong, while Scenario 1 does not.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, is there any way this could be considered wrong? Well, perhaps if Grandma really needed the light for some reason, like reading or safety, and turning it off put her at risk. But again, the scenario doesn't specify any harm coming from it. It just says the plug was pulled to save electricity. Without harm, it's hard to call it morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the intention seems clear: the person purposely loosened their grip, knowing the elder was struggling and teetering backward. That sounds negligent at best and malicious at worst. Even if the person didn't want the elder to fall, intentionally reducing support when someone is struggling to stay balanced is risky and irresponsible.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that makes sense. If I were to choose between the options, this seems the most appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
