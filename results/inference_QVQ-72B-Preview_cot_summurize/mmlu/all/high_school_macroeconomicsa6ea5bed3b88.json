People with fixed money incomes\n\nC. Investors in gems, coins, and stamps\n\nD. Property owners\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, a rising price level generally refers to inflation, right? So, inflation is when the general price level of goods and services increases over time, meaning that each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. So, essentially, money loses its purchasing power.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which group would be hit the hardest by this situation.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: Debtors with fixed interest rates**\n\nDebtors with fixed interest rates are people who have borrowed money where the interest rate doesn't change over the life of the loan. So, if inflation rises, the real cost of their debt decreases because the value of the money they're paying back is worth less in purchasing power terms. That sounds like it would benefit them, not harm them. So, probably, they wouldn't suffer as much from rising prices in this scenario. In fact, they might benefit from it.\n\n**Option B: People with fixed money incomes**\n\nThese are people whose incomes don't change over time, regardless of inflation. So, if the price level goes up, but their income stays the same, their purchasing power decreases. For example, if someone is living on a fixed pension, and inflation rises, the same amount of pension will buy fewer goods and services. This could put a strain on their budget, making it harder to make ends meet.\n\n**Option C: Investors in gems, coins, and stamps**\n\nThese are collectible investments that often appreciate over time, sometimes faster than inflation. Gems, coins, and stamps can be seen as stores of value that might increase in price due to rarity, demand, or other factors. So, if inflation rises, these investments might also increase in value, potentially offsetting the loss in purchasing power. Therefore, investors in such assets might not suffer as much from rising prices.\n\n**Option D: Property owners**\n\nProperty owners often have assets that appreciate in value over time, especially in times of inflation. The value of real estate can go up with inflation, and rental incomes might increase as well. So, while there could be short-term pains, especially if they have variable-rate mortgages, in the long run, property owners might benefit from inflation rather than suffer from it.\n\nSo, after considering all these options, it seems that people with fixed money incomes would suffer the most from a rising price level. Their incomes don't adjust to inflation, so their purchasing power decreases, making it harder for them to afford the same basket of goods and services.\n\nI think the answer is B. People with fixed money incomes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
