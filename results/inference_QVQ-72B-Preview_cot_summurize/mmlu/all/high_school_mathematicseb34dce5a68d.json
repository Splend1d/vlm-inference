                    "text": "I've got this probability problem here. It says that six 6-sided dice are rolled, and I need to find the probability that exactly three of them show prime numbers and the remaining three show composite numbers. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a prime number and a composite number on a 6-sided die. The numbers on a die are 1 through 6. Among these:\n\n- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5\n\n- Composite numbers: 4, 6\n\n- And then there's 1, which is neither prime nor composite. Hmm, that could be a bit tricky.\n\nWait a minute, the problem specifies that we have three dice showing prime numbers and the rest showing composite numbers. So, that means three dice show 2, 3, or 5, and the other three show 4 or 6. But what about the number 1? It's neither prime nor composite, so does that mean if any die shows a 1, that roll doesn't count towards either category? But the way the problem is phrased, it seems like only primes and composites are being considered, and maybe 1 is just ignored or perhaps it's not possible to have a 1 in those categories. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers.\" It says \"the rest,\" meaning the remaining dice. So, perhaps rolls of 1 are not considered in this scenario, or maybe the problem assumes that all dice show either a prime or a composite number, excluding the possibility of rolling a 1. But that seems odd because a standard die includes 1.\n\nWait, maybe I need to interpret this differently. Perhaps the problem is assuming that the dice being used only show numbers 2 through 6, which are either prime or composite. But that's not standard for a 6-sided die, which typically includes 1 as well. Alternatively, maybe in this context, 1 is being treated as something else, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLet me consider the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice. Each die has 6 sides, so there are \\(6^6\\) possible outcomes. That should include all combinations of numbers from 1 to 6 on each die.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three dice show prime numbers and the remaining three show composite numbers. But again, I have to account for the number 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in this problem, only primes (2, 3, 5) and composites (4, 6) are relevant, and any die that shows a 1 is disregarded. But that would mean that if any die shows a 1, the entire roll doesn't qualify unless specified otherwise. This seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that each die can show any number from 1 to 6, but in the desired outcome, exactly three dice show primes (2, 3, 5) and the other three show composites (4, 6), with no dice showing a 1. But that would mean that the rolls where a die shows a 1 are not part of the favorable outcomes.\n\nBut that seems problematic because if I have six dice, and I need exactly three to show primes and three to show composites, but each die can also show a 1, which is neither, then the total number of favorable outcomes would have to account for the fact that some dice might show a 1.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should assume that the dice only show numbers from 2 to 6, which are either prime or composite, and disregard the number 1 entirely. But that feels like an assumption I shouldn't make without confirmation.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose that the problem is considering only the cases where no die shows a 1, and among the numbers 2 through 6, three dice show primes (2, 3, 5) and three show composites (4, 6).\n\nIn that case, the total number of possible outcomes where no die shows a 1 is \\(5^6\\), since each die has 5 possible outcomes (2 through 6).\n\nThen, the number of favorable outcomes would be the number of ways to choose which three dice show primes and which three show composites.\n\nFirst, choose which three dice show primes. There are \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) ways to choose which three dice show primes.\n\nFor each of those three dice, the probability of showing a prime is \\(3/5\\), since there are three primes (2, 3, 5) out of five possible numbers (2 through 6).\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining three dice, the probability of showing a composite is \\(2/5\\), since there are two composites (4, 6) out of five possible numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability would be:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} \\times \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^3 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^3\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{125}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{125}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n20 \\times \\frac{27}{125} \\times \\frac{8}{125} = 20 \\times \\frac{216}{15625} = \\frac{4320}{15625} = \\frac{864}{3125}\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the given options. Maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all six dice must show either a prime or a composite number, meaning no die shows a 1. In that case, the total number of possible outcomes is \\(5^6\\), since each die can show only 2 through 6.\n\nThen, the number of favorable outcomes is \\(\\binom{6}{3} \\times (3^3) \\times (2^3)\\), because:\n\n- Choose 3 dice to show primes: \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\)\n\n- Each of those 3 dice has 3 options for primes: 2, 3, 5\n\n- The remaining 3 dice each have 2 options for composites: 4, 6\n\nSo, total favorable outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} \\times 3^3 \\times 2^3 = 20 \\times 27 \\times 8 = 20 \\times 216 = 4320\n\\]\n\nTotal possible outcomes (excluding 1):\n\n\\[\n5^6 = 15625\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4320}{15625} = \\frac{864}{3125}\n\\]\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider that the dice can show 1, and adjust accordingly.\n\nIf dice can show 1, then the total number of possible outcomes is \\(6^6 = 46656\\).\n\nNow, to find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three dice show primes and three show composites, with some dice possibly showing 1.\n\nBut if a die shows 1, does that disqualify it from being in the prime or composite category? The problem says \"three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers.\" It doesn't specify what happens if a die shows 1.\n\nPerhaps dice showing 1 are just ignored, and we only consider dice that show primes or composites. But in that case, if one or more dice show 1, those rolls wouldn't count towards the desired outcome.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to assume that all six dice must show either a prime or a composite number, meaning no die shows a 1.\n\nIn that case, the total number of possible outcomes is \\(5^6 = 15625\\), as each die can show 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nThen, the number of favorable outcomes is \\(\\binom{6}{3} \\times 3^3 \\times 2^3 = 20 \\times 27 \\times 8 = 4320\\), as calculated earlier.\n\nThus, the probability is \\(4320 / 15625 = 864 / 3125\\), which still doesn't match any options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the dice showing primes and composites are distinct in some way, but I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total number of possible outcomes includes dice showing 1, and adjusting the probability accordingly.\n\nIn that case, the total number of possible outcomes is \\(6^6 = 46656\\).\n\nNow, to find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three dice show primes and three show composites, with the remaining dice showing 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers.\" It doesn't specify what happens if some dice show 1. Does that mean that if any die shows 1, that roll doesn't qualify?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look at it differently.\n\nLet's consider that for each die, it can show either a prime (2, 3, 5), a composite (4, 6), or a 1.\n\nWe want exactly three dice to show primes and three to show composites.\n\nFirst, choose which three dice show primes: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nFor each of these three dice, the probability of showing a prime is \\(3/6 = 1/2\\), since there are three primes out of six possible outcomes.\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining three dice, the probability of showing a composite is \\(2/6 = 1/3\\), since there are two composites out of six possible outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the three dice not chosen can show either a prime or a composite, but we've specified they must show composites.\n\nWait, no, in the selection, we've already chosen which three dice show primes, and the remaining three must show composites.\n\nSo, the probability for the three chosen dice to show primes is \\((1/2)^3\\), and for the remaining three to show composites is \\((1/3)^3\\).\n\nTherefore, the total probability would be:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^3 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^3 = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{20}{216} = \\frac{5}{54}\n\\]\n\nOh, interesting. This matches one of the options, which is B. \\(\\frac{5}{54}\\).\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThen, \\((1/2)^3 = 1/8\\).\n\nAnd \\((1/3)^3 = 1/27\\).\n\nMultiplying them: \\(20 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{20}{216} = \\frac{5}{54}\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{5}{54}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{54}} \\]"
