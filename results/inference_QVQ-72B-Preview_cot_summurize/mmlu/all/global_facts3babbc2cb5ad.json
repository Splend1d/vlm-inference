                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"As of 2020, about what percentage of the world population practices open defecation? The options are A. 2%, B. 4%, C. 9%, D. 18%.\"\n\nHmm, open defecation refers to people defecating in the open, like fields, forests, or bodies of water, right? It's a big issue in many parts of the world, especially in areas without access to proper sanitation facilities.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that significant progress has been made in reducing open defecation over the years, but it's still a problem in some regions. The Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 6, aim to ensure universal access to safe sanitation by 2030.\n\nNow, to answer the question, I need to recall the latest data on open defecation practices worldwide. Let me think... I think the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF joint monitoring programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) provides regular updates on this.\n\nIf I recall correctly, their 2019 report showed that the percentage of the global population practicing open defecation had decreased significantly over the past decades. But what was the exact number for 2020?\n\nLet me consider that from 2010 to 2020, various initiatives and policies were implemented worldwide to improve sanitation, so the percentage should be lower compared to previous years.\n\nLooking back at the options: 2%, 4%, 9%, or 18%. Which one seems plausible?\n\nI think 18% seems too high. That would mean almost one in five people practices open defecation, which doesn't align with my knowledge of recent progress.\n\n9% also seems a bit high, but maybe possible. However, considering the efforts to improve sanitation, I doubt it's that high.\n\n4% seems more reasonable. But wait, I think in some regions, like South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, open defecation is still prevalent, but even there, substantial progress has been made.\n\n2% seems quite low, but perhaps it's the current global figure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the percentage is higher, and 2% is just for a specific region.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up some data to confirm. Although, since this is a thought exercise, I should rely on my existing knowledge.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I can think about the number of people practicing open defecation and then calculate the percentage based on the world population.\n\nAs of 2020, the world population was roughly 7.7 billion people.\n\nIf I can estimate the number of people practicing open defecation, I can calculate the percentage.\n\nBut I don't remember the exact number off the top of my head.\n\nI think in 2015, the number was around 892 million people, which was about 12% of the global population at that time.\n\nGiven that, if we've made progress since then, the percentage could be lower by 2020.\n\nAssuming a reduction of about 3% points over five years, that would bring it down to around 9%, which is option C.\n\nBut I feel like the progress might have been more significant, possibly reducing it to around 4%, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's even lower, around 2%, which is option A.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I'm underestimating the challenge.\n\nLet me consider some key facts:\n\n- In India, which had a high prevalence of open defecation, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign aimed to eliminate open defecation by 2019.\n\n- Many countries have implemented similar initiatives.\n\n- Organizations like WaterAid and UNICEF have been working tirelessly to improve sanitation worldwide.\n\nGiven these efforts, it's likely that open defecation has decreased significantly by 2020.\n\nBut, on the other hand, COVID-19 might have disrupted some of these efforts, although that's more of an issue for 2021 onwards.\n\nStill, I think it's safe to assume that by 2020, the percentage was around 4%.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if 4% of the world population practices open defecation, that would be approximately 308 million people (4% of 7.7 billion). That seems like a substantial number, but even so, it's a significant improvement from previous years.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 2%, that would be around 154 million people, which is still a large number but indicates greater progress.\n\nHowever, I think 2% might be underestimating the current situation.\n\nPerhaps 4% is a more accurate estimate.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the WHO and UNICEF reports. In their 2019 report, they might have provided data up to 2020 or estimated for that year.\n\nIf I recall correctly, their data showed that between 2000 and 2017, the percentage of the global population practicing open defecation decreased from 13.7% to 6.1%.\n\nSo, from 2017 to 2020, if we assume a continued decrease, say another 2% points, that would bring it down to around 4%.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option B, 4%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there are any regions where open defecation has increased or remained stagnant.\n\nI don't think that's the case globally; most regions have shown decreases due to improved sanitation access and behavior change programs.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is B. 4%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
