                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about two computers backing up data at different intervals, and I need to find out how many times in 24 hours they back up at the same time. The first computer backs up every five minutes at the turn of the minute, and the second one every two minutes at the turn of the minute. And they don't back up at the start of the 24-hour period.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what it means for them to back up \"at the turn of the minute.\" I think it means that they back up when the time reaches a specific minute mark. For example, if one backs up every five minutes, it would back up at 0:00, 0:05, 0:10, and so on. Similarly, the other backs up every two minutes, so at 0:00, 0:02, 0:04, etc.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"at the turn of the minute every five minutes,\" but if they back up at the turn of the minute, it probably means they back up at the exact minute mark, like 0:00, 0:05, etc., not in between.\n\nSo, for the first computer, it backs up at 0:00, 0:05, 0:10, 0:15, and so on.\n\nThe second computer backs up at 0:00, 0:02, 0:04, 0:06, etc.\n\nAnd I need to find out how many times in 24 hours these backup times coincide.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the frequency of their backups.\n\nThe first computer backs up every 5 minutes.\n\nThe second backs up every 2 minutes.\n\nSo, the times they back up are multiples of 5 minutes and multiples of 2 minutes, starting from time 0:00.\n\nWait, but the problem says they don't back up at the start of the 24-hour period. So, their first backup is at 0:00, but since they don't back up at the start, maybe we should consider that their backups start after 0:00.\n\nBut the problem is a bit ambiguous. Maybe I should assume that their backups occur at times that are multiples of their intervals, starting from some time after 0:00.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I can assume that their backups start at some time after 0:00 and proceed every 5 minutes and every 2 minutes respectively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the least common multiple (LCM) of their backup intervals to find when they back up at the same time.\n\nThe LCM of 5 and 2 is 10 minutes. So, perhaps they back up together every 10 minutes.\n\nBut wait, if one backs up every 5 minutes and the other every 2 minutes, their backup times would be:\n\nFirst computer: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, etc.\n\nSecond computer: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, etc.\n\nLooking at these, the common times are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc., which are multiples of 10 minutes.\n\nSo, indeed, they back up together every 10 minutes.\n\nNow, in 24 hours, there are 24 hours * 60 minutes = 1440 minutes.\n\nIf they back up together every 10 minutes, then the number of times they back up together in 24 hours would be 1440 / 10 = 144 times.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the computers do not back up at the start of the 24-hour period.\" So, do I need to consider whether the first backup at time 0 is included or not?\n\nIf they don't back up at the start, maybe I should start counting from the first backup after time 0.\n\nLet's assume that their first backups are at time t = 5 minutes for the first computer and t = 2 minutes for the second computer.\n\nBut since their backup intervals are 5 and 2 minutes, their common backups are at multiples of 10 minutes.\n\nSo, the first common backup would be at t = 10 minutes.\n\nThen, t = 20 minutes, t = 30 minutes, and so on, up to t = 1440 minutes.\n\nNow, how many 10-minute intervals are there in 1440 minutes?\n\n1440 / 10 = 144.\n\nSo, there are 144 times when both back up together in 24 hours.\n\nBut wait, does this include the time t = 0?\n\nIf t = 0 is considered the start and they don't back up then, do I need to subtract one?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf their common backups are at multiples of 10 minutes, starting from t = 10 minutes, then in 1440 minutes, there are 144 such intervals.\n\nBut if t = 0 is included in this count, and the problem says not to count the start, then perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nBut in reality, t = 0 is a multiple of 10 minutes, but since they don't back up at t = 0, it's not included.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 144.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 144\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 6\n\nD. 36\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the frequency of their backups.\n\nFirst computer: every 5 minutes.\n\nSecond computer: every 2 minutes.\n\nTheir common backups are every LCM of 5 and 2, which is 10 minutes.\n\nIn 24 hours, there are 1440 minutes.\n\nNumber of 10-minute intervals in 1440 minutes is 1440 / 10 = 144.\n\nSo, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the computers back up together every 10 minutes, and in 24 hours there are 144 such intervals, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the backups are at the turn of the minute.\n\nDoes that change anything?\n\nProbably not, since both are at the minute marks.\n\nSo, I think 144 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]"
