                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a bin with 5 green balls and \\(k\\) purple balls, and \\(k\\) is some positive integer that I need to find. When someone picks a ball at random, if it's green, they win $2, but if it's purple, they lose $2. The expected amount won for playing this game is 50 cents, which is $0.50. I need to find out what \\(k\\) is.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what expected value means. In probability, the expected value is like the average outcome if you play the game many times. So, it's the sum of all possible outcomes each multiplied by their probability.\n\nHere, there are two possible outcomes: winning $2 or losing $2.\n\nThe probability of drawing a green ball is \\(\\frac{5}{5+k}\\), because there are 5 green balls and \\(5+k\\) total balls.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing a purple ball is \\(\\frac{k}{5+k}\\).\n\nSo, the expected value \\(E\\) should be:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left( \\frac{5}{5+k} \\times 2 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{k}{5+k} \\times (-2) \\right)\n\\]\n\nAnd we know that \\(E = 0.50\\).\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{5+k} - \\frac{2k}{5+k} = 0.50\n\\]\n\nSince both terms have the same denominator, I can combine them:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 - 2k}{5+k} = 0.50\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(k\\).\n\nFirst, I can cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k = 0.50 \\times (5 + k)\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate \\(0.50 \\times (5 + k)\\):\n\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 5 = 2.5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0.50 \\times k = 0.5k\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k = 2.5 + 0.5k\n\\]\n\nNow, I'll move all terms involving \\(k\\) to one side and constants to the other side.\n\nSubtract \\(0.5k\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k - 0.5k = 2.5\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2.5k = 2.5\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me check that step again.\n\nActually, when I subtract \\(0.5k\\) from \\(10 - 2k\\), it should be:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k - 0.5k = 2.5\n\\]\n\nCombining \\(-2k\\) and \\(-0.5k\\) gives \\(-2.5k\\), so:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2.5k = 2.5\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-2.5k = 2.5 - 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-2.5k = -7.5\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\(-2.5\\):\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-7.5}{-2.5} = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(k = 3\\).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 4\n\nSo, option C is 3, which matches my answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me verify the steps again.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 - 2k}{5 + k} = 0.50\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k = 0.50 \\times (5 + k)\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k = 2.5 + 0.5k\n\\]\n\nThen, moving all terms with \\(k\\) to one side:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2k - 0.5k = 2.5\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2.5k = 2.5\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n-2.5k = 2.5 - 10 = -7.5\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-7.5}{-2.5} = 3\n\\]\n\nYeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug in the value of \\(k = 3\\) back into the original formula to check if the expected value is indeed $0.50.\n\nSo, total number of balls is \\(5 + 3 = 8\\).\n\nProbability of green ball: \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\), winning $2.\n\nProbability of purple ball: \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\), losing $2.\n\nSo, expected value:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left( \\frac{5}{8} \\times 2 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{3}{8} \\times (-2) \\right) = \\frac{10}{8} - \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} = 0.50\n\\]\n\nWhich matches the given expected value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(k = 3\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
