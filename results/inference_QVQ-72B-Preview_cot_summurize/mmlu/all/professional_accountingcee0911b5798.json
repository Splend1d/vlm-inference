                    "text": "Let's tackle this tax problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, we have Summer, who is single, and three years ago, she had a net operating loss of $20,000. A Code Sec. 1244 stock loss made up three-fourths of that loss. So, let's find out how much that is.\n\nThree-fourths of $20,000 is:\n\n\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20,000 = 15,000 \\)\n\nSo, $15,000 of that net operating loss was from Code Sec. 1244 stock.\n\nNow, Summer had no taxable income from that year until the current year. In the current year, she has gross income of $80,000 and sustains another loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock.\n\nAssuming that Summer can carry the entire $20,000 net operating loss to the current year, we need to figure out the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss she can deduct for the current year.\n\nFirst, let's recall that net operating losses (NOLs) can generally be carried forward to offset future taxable income. The character of the losses might affect how they're treated in the current year.\n\nCode Sec. 1244 allows certain small business stock losses to be treated as ordinary losses rather than capital losses, up to a certain limit. For individuals, the annual deduction limit is $50,000 for single taxpayers.\n\nIn the previous year, Summer had a $15,000 Code Sec. 1244 loss, which would have been treated as an ordinary loss. The remaining $5,000 of the net operating loss ($20,000 - $15,000) would be other ordinary losses.\n\nNow, in the current year, she has $80,000 of gross income and a new $50,000 Code Sec. 1244 stock loss.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the carryover of the net operating loss from three years ago, which is $20,000.\n\nBut, we need to see how this NOL carryover interacts with the current year's Code Sec. 1244 loss.\n\nGenerally, NOL carryforwards are deducted after reducing income by current-year losses.\n\nSo, first, apply the current-year Code Sec. 1244 loss to reduce taxable income.\n\nBut, there's also the annual limit of $50,000 for deducting Code Sec. 1244 losses for single taxpayers.\n\nWait, but she has a $50,000 loss this year, and the limit is $50,000, so she can deduct the full $50,000 as an ordinary loss.\n\nBut, she also has a carryover from three years ago, which included $15,000 of Code Sec. 1244 loss.\n\nHowever, I think the carryover of the NOL is $20,000, which includes both the Code Sec. 1244 portion and the other ordinary loss portion.\n\nBut, the Code Sec. 1244 loss is already treated as an ordinary loss, and the remaining $5,000 is other ordinary loss.\n\nIn the current year, she has $80,000 of gross income.\n\nFirst, apply the current-year Code Sec. 1244 loss of $50,000 to reduce taxable income.\n\nSo, $80,000 - $50,000 = $30,000.\n\nBut, she also has a net operating loss carryover of $20,000.\n\nNow, the NOL carryover can be applied to further reduce taxable income.\n\nSo, $30,000 - $20,000 = $10,000 taxable income.\n\nBut, wait, I need to make sure about the character of the losses.\n\nCode Sec. 1244 losses are ordinary losses, and they reduce ordinary income first.\n\nSo, in the current year, she has $80,000 of ordinary income.\n\nShe has a current-year Code Sec. 1244 loss of $50,000, which reduces ordinary income to $30,000.\n\nThen, she has a net operating loss carryover of $20,000, which further reduces ordinary income to $10,000.\n\nBut, the question is asking for the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year.\n\nGiven that she has a $50,000 Code Sec. 1244 loss in the current year and the annual deduction limit for single taxpayers is $50,000, she can deduct the full $50,000 as an ordinary loss.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any interaction with the net operating loss carryover.\n\nBut, I think the NOL carryover is applied after the current-year losses.\n\nSo, first, apply the current-year Code Sec. 1244 loss, then apply the NOL carryover.\n\nTherefore, the current-year Code Sec. 1244 loss is fully deductible as an ordinary loss, up to the $50,000 limit.\n\nSo, the answer should be $50,000 ordinary loss.\n\nBut, let's double-check.\n\nOption C is $50,000 ordinary loss.\n\nOption A is $35,000 ordinary loss, which doesn't seem to align with the given information.\n\nOption B is $35,000 capital loss, but Code Sec. 1244 losses are treated as ordinary losses, not capital losses.\n\nOption D is $50,000 capital loss, which is incorrect because Code Sec. 1244 losses are ordinary losses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C: $50,000 ordinary loss.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
