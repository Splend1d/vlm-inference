                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which theory of emotion cognitive psychologists would most likely support. The options are social facilitation theory, two-factor theory, thalamic theory, and James-Lange theory. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, cognitive psychology focuses on mental processes like thinking, perception, memory, and problem-solving. So, any theory of emotion that cognitive psychologists favor should emphasize the role of cognitive processes in emotion.\n\nLet me recall what each of these theories proposes.\n\nStarting with the social facilitation theory: I think this one is about how the presence of others affects our performance on tasks. It suggests that being around other people can either improve or impair our performance, depending on the task's difficulty and the nature of the audience. But this doesn't seem directly related to emotions. Maybe it's not the top choice for cognitive psychologists in this context.\n\nNext, the two-factor theory. I remember this one from psychology class. It's also known as the Schachter-Singer theory. It proposes that emotion has two components: physiological arousal and cognitive labeling. So, when we experience arousal, we look for cues in the environment to label that arousal as a specific emotion. For example, if I'm aroused and see a scary movie, I might label my arousal as fear. This theory emphasizes the role of cognition in interpreting arousal, which aligns well with cognitive psychology's focus on mental processes.\n\nMoving on to the thalamic theory. I believe this refers to the work of Walter Cannon and Philip Bard, who proposed that the thalamus plays a central role in emotion. They suggested that sensory information passes through the thalamus, which then sends signals to the cortex for perception and to the autonomic nervous system for physiological responses. This theory emphasizes physiological responses and the role of the thalamus in processing emotion, but it doesn't place as much emphasis on cognitive processes as the two-factor theory does.\n\nLastly, the James-Lange theory. This is an older theory that suggests that physiological arousal comes before the emotional experience. According to this theory, we feel emotions because of the bodily changes that occur in response to stimuli. For example, if I see a bear, my heart races and I feel scared because of those physical reactions. This theory puts less emphasis on cognitive processes and more on the body's response, which might not align as closely with cognitive psychology's focus.\n\nGiven these explanations, the two-factor theory seems to be the one that best fits cognitive psychology's perspective. It explicitly incorporates cognitive labeling as a key component of emotion, emphasizing how we interpret our arousal based on our environment and thoughts.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's any other theory that cognitive psychologists might prefer. For instance, perhaps there are more recent theories that integrate cognition even more deeply with emotion. However, based on the options provided, the two-factor theory seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. two-factor theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
