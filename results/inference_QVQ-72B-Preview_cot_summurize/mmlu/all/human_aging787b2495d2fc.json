                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following is always the longest? A. Life expectancy at birth (LEAB) B. Life span C. Life expectancy at a specified age (LEASA) D. There is no way of knowing.\" Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let's try to understand what each term means and see which one is always the longest.\n\nFirst off, life expectancy at birth (LEAB) is probably the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, based on current mortality rates. So, for example, if a country has a LEAB of 75 years, that means, on average, a baby born today is expected to live 75 years.\n\nNext, life span seems a bit different. Life span might refer to the maximum number of years that a member of a particular species can live. For humans, that's generally thought to be around 120 years, give or take. So, it's like the upper limit of how long someone can live under ideal conditions.\n\nThen there's life expectancy at a specified age (LEASA). This sounds like it's similar to LEAB but starting from a different age. So, for example, if you want to know the life expectancy of someone who is already 20 years old, that would be their LEASA at age 20.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these is always the longest. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, compare LEAB and LEASA. Since LEAB is the life expectancy at birth, and LEASA is at a specified age, which is usually older than birth, generally, LEAB should be longer than LEASA because people who have already lived to a certain age have already survived any childhood mortality risks, and thus might have a longer remaining life expectancy. But wait, I think in reality, depending on the age specified, LEASA can sometimes be longer than LEAB, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to look this up.\n\nLet me recall: in actuarial science, life expectancy does decrease with age, meaning that the older you are, the shorter your remaining life expectancy is, on average. So, LEASA at age 65, for example, is less than LEASA at age 20, and both are less than LEAB. Wait, that seems counterintuitive at first, but it makes sense because those who have reached older ages have already surpassed earlier mortality risks.\n\nSo, generally, LEAB is longer than LEASA at any age older than birth.\n\nNow, comparing LEAB to life span: life span is the maximum possible lifespan, which is much longer than the average life expectancy. So, life span is generally longer than LEAB.\n\nFor example, the current world record for the longest human lifespan is around 122 years for Jeanne Calment, whereas global average life expectancy at birth is around 70-75 years.\n\nSimilarly, LEASA would also be shorter than life span because LEASA is an average remaining lifespan from a certain age, which is still less than the maximum possible lifespan.\n\nSo, from this, it seems like life span is always longer than both LEAB and LEASA.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there are exceptions. For example, in countries with very high infant mortality, LEAB might be lower than in countries with lower infant mortality, but life span remains around the same. So, in that case, life span is still longer than LEAB.\n\nAnother consideration: life span can be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, whereas life expectancy is more about the average experience of a population at a particular time.\n\nSo, in general, life span is the theoretical maximum, while life expectancy is the average experience.\n\nTherefore, life span is always longer than life expectancy, whether it's at birth or at a specified age.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Life span.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any scenario where life expectancy at birth could be equal to or longer than life span?\n\nNo, because life span is the maximum possible lifespan, and life expectancy is the average lifespan, which is always less than the maximum.\n\nSimilarly, life expectancy at a specified age is also an average remaining lifespan from that age, which is still less than the maximum possible lifespan.\n\nTherefore, life span is always the longest among these options.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Life span.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
