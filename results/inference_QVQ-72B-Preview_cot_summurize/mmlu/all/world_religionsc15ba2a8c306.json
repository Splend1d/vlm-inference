                    "text": "So I have this question here about the meaning of the title \"Dalai Lama.\" The options are:\n\nA. Ocean of Love\n\nB. Lover of Wisdom\n\nC. Ocean of Wisdom\n\nD. Stillness of Love\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. I know that the Dalai Lama is a title given to the leader of the Tibetan Buddhists, but I'm not sure about the exact meaning of the title.\n\nLet me think about this. I recall that \"Dalai\" comes from the Mongolian language, and \"Lama\" is a Tibetan term. Maybe I should look into the meanings of these words separately.\n\nFirst, \"Lama.\" I believe that in Tibetan Buddhism, a lama is a revered teacher or spiritual guide. So, \"lama\" generally means a respected religious figure.\n\nNow, \"Dalai\" is Mongolian. I think it means \"ocean\" or \"sea,\" which suggests something vast and deep.\n\nPutting them together, \"Dalai Lama\" would literally mean something like \"ocean lama\" or \"sea lama.\" But that doesn't quite roll off the tongue in English.\n\nMaybe there's a more accurate translation or an idiomatic expression that captures the full meaning.\n\nLet me consider the context. In Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama is considered a manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. So, perhaps the title conveys qualities like wisdom and compassion.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Ocean of Love\n\nB. Lover of Wisdom\n\nC. Ocean of Wisdom\n\nD. Stillness of Love\n\nI can see how \"ocean\" might relate to \"Dalai,\" given its connotation of vastness and depth. Similarly, \"lama\" suggests a connection to wisdom or spiritual knowledge.\n\nOption A is \"Ocean of Love.\" While love is certainly a key aspect of the Dalai Lama's teachings, I'm not sure if \"ocean\" specifically refers to love in this context.\n\nOption B is \"Lover of Wisdom.\" This seems close because \"lama\" refers to a teacher, but I'm not sure if \"lover\" is the right translation.\n\nOption C is \"Ocean of Wisdom.\" This seems plausible because \"Dalai\" means ocean, and \"lama\" refers to wisdom or spiritual knowledge. So, combining them would make \"Ocean of Wisdom.\"\n\nOption D is \"Stillness of Love.\" This also seems like it could relate to Buddhist teachings on tranquility and compassion, but it doesn't directly align with the literal translation of the title.\n\nBetween these options, C seems the most straightforward literal translation. However, I wonder if there's a deeper or more symbolic meaning.\n\nLet me do a quick search to verify. Oh, wait, since this is a test-like scenario, maybe I shouldn't rely on external sources. Instead, I'll try to reason it out based on what I know.\n\nI know that in many languages, titles and names have specific connotations beyond their literal meanings. In this case, \"Dalai Lama\" is a title that carries significant religious and cultural importance.\n\nConsidering that, perhaps the title is meant to convey the idea of vast wisdom and compassion, which are central to Buddhist philosophy.\n\nIf I had to choose one option that best captures this, I would go with C. Ocean of Wisdom. It suggests a vast reservoir of knowledge and insight, which aligns with the role and teachings of the Dalai Lama.\n\nBut let's double-check. I recall that in some translations, \"Dalai\" is indeed translated as \"ocean,\" and \"lama\" as \"guru\" or \"teacher.\" So, \"ocean teacher\" or \"ocean of wisdom\" makes sense.\n\nOption A, \"Ocean of Love,\" also has merit, as love and compassion are central to the Dalai Lama's message. However, I think \"wisdom\" is more directly associated with the role of a teacher or lama.\n\nOption B, \"Lover of Wisdom,\" seems a bit off because \"lover\" implies a strong affection for wisdom, but it doesn't capture the breadth of knowledge suggested by \"ocean.\"\n\nOption D, \"Stillness of Love,\" could relate to the inner peace and compassion taught by the Dalai Lama, but again, it doesn't directly translate the title's components.\n\nTherefore, based on my reasoning, I believe the correct answer is C. Ocean of Wisdom.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
