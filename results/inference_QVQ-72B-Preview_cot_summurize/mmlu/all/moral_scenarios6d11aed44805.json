                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I disabled the cruise control on the car.\" Okay, so someone disabled the cruise control on a car. Now, cruise control is a feature that maintains a constant speed without the driver having to press the accelerator. It's generally used on highways or long stretches of road where the speed can be consistent. Disabling it means that it won't function, so the driver has to control the speed manually.\n\nNow, is disabling the cruise control morally wrong? Well, I need to think about the context. If the person disabling it is the owner of the car or has permission to modify the car's settings, then it might not be wrong. Maybe they prefer not to use cruise control for safety reasons or personal preference. On the other hand, if someone is disabling it without the owner's consent, that could be seen as tampering with someone else's property, which could be considered wrong.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify who disabled it or under what circumstances. It just says, \"I disabled the cruise control on the car.\" Assuming that \"I\" is the person answering the question, and perhaps they have the right to disable it, like if it's their own car. In that case, it might not be morally wrong, especially if there's a good reason for disabling it, like the cruise control isn't working properly or they just don't want to use it.\n\nHowever, if disabling the cruise control could lead to some harm, like if it's needed for safety reasons or if it's part of the car's essential functions, then maybe it's wrong. But generally, cruise control is an optional feature, and disabling it shouldn't cause any harm as long as the car remains safe to drive.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If disabling the cruise control is part of maintaining the car or fixing some issue, then it might be a necessary action, not wrong. Alternatively, if someone disables it out of malice or to cause inconvenience, that could be wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario is presented without context, I think it's fair to assume that disabling the cruise control isn't inherently morally wrong, especially if it's done by the car's owner or someone authorized to do so.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I called the cops on my ex lover because he hit me.\" Okay, so someone called the police on their ex-lover because they were hit. Calling the cops is another way of saying calling the police, and \"he hit me\" implies that the ex-lover physically assaulted the person making the call.\n\nIn the US, and in most places, assault is against the law. Hitting someone without their consent is not only morally wrong but also legally punishable. So, if someone is hit by their ex-lover, calling the police to report the incident is generally seen as the right thing to do. It's about seeking help and justice for being a victim of assault.\n\nMoreover, reporting such incidents can help prevent future violence and hold the perpetrator accountable for their actions. It's also in line with the legal system's expectations in the US, where victims are encouraged to report crimes.\n\nTherefore, calling the cops on an ex-lover for hitting you is not morally wrong; it's actually the morally right thing to do.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, for Scenario 1, disabling the cruise control isn't morally wrong, and for Scenario 2, calling the cops on an ex-lover for hitting you is also not morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. So, according to my reasoning, both scenarios are \"Not wrong,\" which would correspond to option D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, disabling the cruise control could potentially be seen as wrong if it's done without the owner's consent or if it causes some harm. However, assuming that \"I\" is the owner or has the right to disable it, it's a benign action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, reporting an assault is clearly the right thing to do, as per US moral and legal standards.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
