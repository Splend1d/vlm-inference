                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that there's a series where the first term is 2, and each subsequent term is -2 multiplied by the preceding term. I need to find the fifth term. Let's see, options are -16, 32, -32, and 64.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's being asked. The first term is 2. Then, each term after that is -2 times the previous term. So, let's list out the terms one by one.\n\nFirst term: 2\n\nSecond term: -2 * 2 = -4\n\nThird term: -2 * (-4) = 8\n\nFourth term: -2 * 8 = -16\n\nFifth term: -2 * (-16) = 32\n\nWait, so the fifth term is 32. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst term: 2\n\nSecond term: -2 * 2 = -4 (that seems right)\n\nThird term: -2 * (-4) = 8 (yes)\n\nFourth term: -2 * 8 = -16 (correct)\n\nFifth term: -2 * (-16) = 32 (seems right)\n\nSo, according to this, the fifth term should be 32. Looking back at the options, B is 32.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe looking at it as a geometric sequence, since each term is multiplied by -2 to get the next term.\n\nYes, it is a geometric sequence where the first term a = 2 and the common ratio r = -2.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:\n\na_n = a * r^(n-1)\n\nSo, for the fifth term, n = 5:\n\na_5 = 2 * (-2)^(5-1) = 2 * (-2)^4 = 2 * 16 = 32\n\nAgain, that gives me 32. So, it seems consistent.\n\nWait a minute, what if I consider the exponentiation before the multiplication? Like, do I compute (-2)^4 first and then multiply by 2, or does it matter? Actually, since exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication, it should be fine.\n\nLet me also consider the signs carefully. (-2)^4 is positive because when you have an even exponent, the negative sign becomes positive. So, (-2)^4 = 16, and then 2 * 16 = 32.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here. The fifth term is definitely 32. So, the answer should be B. 32.\n\nJust to make sure, let's list out all the terms again:\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: -2 * 2 = -4\n\nTerm 3: -2 * (-4) = 8\n\nTerm 4: -2 * 8 = -16\n\nTerm 5: -2 * (-16) = 32\n\nYes, that pattern makes sense. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is 32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
