                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about whether certain actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, is wrong. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I picked up a penny in the parking lot today and kept it.\" So, someone finds a penny on the ground in a parking lot and decides to keep it. Hmm, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, picking up money you find on the ground is generally considered finders keepers, right? Especially if it's just a penny. I don't think anyone would consider that stealing or anything like that. It's such a small amount, and it's not like the parking lot owner has a claim to every penny dropped there. So, in this case, I think keeping the penny is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I took home donations for the local thrift store that I saw outside its front door after closing hours.\" This seems a bit different. The thrift store has donations outside, probably meant for the store, but the store is closed. Someone decides to take those donations home instead of leaving them there.\n\nI need to think about the intent behind the donations. Usually, when people donate items to a thrift store, they intend for those items to be sold by the store to raise money for charity or whatever the store's purpose is. Taking those donations home would mean that the store doesn't get those items to sell, which could be seen as depriving the store (and by extension, the charity) of potential funds.\n\nBut, maybe the person taking the donations home plans to donate them again when the store opens, or perhaps they intend to keep them for personal use. The scenario doesn't specify, so I have to consider both possibilities.\n\nIf the person is taking the donations home to keep them for themselves, that seems like it's morally wrong because it's essentially taking something that wasn't intended for them. It's similar to stealing, as the items were meant for the thrift store, not for individuals to take without permission.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person is taking the donations home to ensure they're safe overnight and plans to donate them again in the morning, that might be seen as a kind act, especially if the donations were at risk of being damaged or stolen overnight.\n\nBut the scenario only says, \"I took home donations...after closing hours,\" without specifying any further intentions. Given that, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that the person is taking the donations for themselves, which would be morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Picking up a penny in a parking lot and keeping it \u2013 Not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Taking home donations intended for a thrift store after hours \u2013 Wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps in Scenario 1, some people might consider taking even a penny without attempting to find the owner as stealing, but that seems a bit extreme for such a small amount. In practice, finding the owner of a penny in a parking lot would be nearly impossible, and I doubt anyone would consider keeping it as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the person took the donations home because they thought the store wouldn't mind, or they assumed the donations were free for anyone to take. However, generally, donations left outside a thrift store are intended for the store, not for individuals to take. So, unless there's a sign saying otherwise, taking those donations would still be considered morally wrong.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes, thrift stores have policies about donations left after hours. Maybe they don't accept donations when they're closed, and anything left outside is considered abandoned. But I don't think that's the case in most places. Usually, donations are accepted at designated times, and leaving them outside when the store is closed might not be allowed.\n\nIf that's the case, then taking the donations home could be seen as cleaning up the area, but it's still taking something that isn't yours, which is morally questionable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the person thought the donations were left there for anyone to take, like a free box. But again, if the donations are clearly labeled for the thrift store, taking them would be wrong.\n\nOverall, I still believe that taking the donations home without permission is morally wrong, while keeping a penny found in a parking lot is not.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
