                    "text": "Alright, let's dive into this property law scenario. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have a man who owns land along the south side of a highway. South of his land is a lot owned by a woman, where she lives in a house. Five years ago, the man gave the woman a right-of-way easement over his land because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. This easement was marked by a clearly visible path, and the document granting the easement was recorded promptly. That means it's part of the public record.\n\nThree years ago, the woman sold her house to the man. Wait a minute, the man already owned the land with the easement, and now he's buying the house from the woman. But it says he never took actual possession of the house. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe he bought it but didn't move in or do anything with it immediately.\n\nThen, two years ago, the man sold the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. A warranty deed typically guarantees that the seller has clear title to the property and will defend against any claims. So, the purchaser should have received the house free from any liens or encumbrances unless specifically stated otherwise.\n\nTwo months after the purchaser moved in, a neighbor told him about the easement, and he started using the path. But when the man saw the purchaser using the path, he put up a barricade to prevent access. Now, the purchaser is suing the man, claiming he has an easement over the man's land.\n\nThe question is, who is likely to prevail?\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\n\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\n\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\n\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\nFirst, let's think about whether the easement was extinguished. An easement can be extinguished in several ways, such as abandonment, merger, or prescription. In this case, there's no indication that the woman abandoned the easement or that there was any merger of properties that would cause the easement to be extinguished. So, option A seems unlikely.\n\nOption B suggests that the man wins because the purchaser didn't have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition. However, in property law, generally, easements that are recorded are part of the public record and are considered constructive notice to everyone. So, even if the purchaser didn't have actual knowledge, the recording of the easement should have provided constructive notice.\n\nBut wait, the man never took actual possession of the house after buying it from the woman. Does that affect anything? Maybe, but I'm not sure how.\n\nOption C says the purchaser wins because he bought the house by warranty deed. A warranty deed does guarantee clear title, but if there's an easement attached to the property, that's part of the title burden. So, unless the easement was unknown or not recorded, the purchaser should have been aware of it.\n\nOption D says the purchaser wins because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house. This seems relevant. If the easement was recorded, it's part of the public record, and the purchaser should have been able to find it through a title search. In many jurisdictions, a subsequent purchaser takes the property subject to any recorded easements.\n\nBut here's a twist: the man conveyed the right-of-way easement to the woman five years ago, and then three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. Then, two years ago, the man conveyed the house to the purchaser. So, the easement was granted before the man bought the house from the woman.\n\nWait a second, when the woman conveyed her house to the man, did that include the easement? Generally, easements run with the land, meaning they benefit the land, not the individual owner. So, when the woman sold the house to the man, the easement should have stayed with the house.\n\nThen, when the man sold the house to the purchaser, the easement should still be attached to the house, unless something happened to extinguish it, which we've already determined is unlikely.\n\nSo, the purchaser should have the right to use the easement over the man's land, as it was granted to the house, which now belongs to the purchaser.\n\nBut the man is arguing that the purchaser didn't have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition. However, since the easement was recorded, it's part of the public record, and the purchaser should have been aware of it through a title search. Therefore, the lack of actual notice isn't relevant because constructive notice applies.\n\nMoreover, the path was clearly marked, which might indicate that it was visible and apparent to anyone inspecting the property.\n\nSo, between the options, it seems that the purchaser is likely to prevail because the easement was of public record and runs with the land, benefiting the house, which the purchaser now owns.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
