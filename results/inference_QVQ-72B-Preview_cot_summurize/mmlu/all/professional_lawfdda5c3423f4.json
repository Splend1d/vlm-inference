In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees. Before the professor had paid the rancher and taken his deed, the professor visited the farm and observed the fence. However, the teacher was not present when the professor visited the property, and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094f anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the professor did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The professor then recorded the deed. Note: This jurisdiction uses Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Indices and has no Tract IndexThe jurisdiction's recording act provides: \"Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded. \"In 2008, in an action to quiet title to the farm, which of the following parties would have priority of title?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, let's dive into this complex property law scenario. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, we have a series of transactions involving a farm from 1993 to 2007, with multiple deeds being executed and recorded, and some not. The question is about who has priority of title in an action to quiet title in 2008.\n\nFirst, let's map out the timeline of events:\n\n1. **1993:** The farmer has good record title to the farm in fee simple absolute.\n\n2. **1994:** The farmer deeds the farm to his son for $1,000. The son doesn't record this deed.\n\n3. **1998:** An investor, knowing about the farmer-to-son deed, buys the farm from the farmer for $10,000 and records the deed. The investor's goal is to acquire color of title and eventually own the farm via adverse possession. He builds a fence around the farm.\n\n4. **1999:** The son deeds the farm to a rancher for $15,000. The rancher doesn't search the title, examine the property, or record the deed.\n\n5. **2003:** A teacher pays the investor $20,000 for the farm and records the deed. The teacher has examined the property and searched the title, knowing about the prior farmer-to-son deed.\n\n6. **2007:** The rancher deeds the farm to a professor for $25,000. The professor visits the farm and sees the fence but doesn't search the title before purchasing. He records the deed.\n\nNow, considering the recording act in this jurisdiction: \"Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\"\n\nThis seems like a race-notice statute, where a subsequent purchaser who records first and is in good faith (without actual knowledge of prior unrecorded interests) has priority over prior unrecorded interests.\n\nLet's consider the parties involved:\n\n- **Farmer (original owner):** Had good title in 1993.\n\n- **Son:** Received a deed from the farmer in 1994 but didn't record it.\n\n- **Investor:** Bought from the farmer in 1998, recorded the deed, and built a fence.\n\n- **Rancher:** Bought from the son in 1999, didn't record the deed.\n\n- **Teacher:** Bought from the investor in 2003, recorded the deed, and visited the farm regularly.\n\n- **Professor:** Bought from the rancher in 2007, recorded the deed after visiting the farm and seeing the fence.\n\nOur task is to determine who has the best claim to the farm in 2008.\n\nFirst, let's look at the son's deed from 1994. He received a deed from the farmer but didn't record it. Under the recording act, this unrecorded deed is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith who records first.\n\nIn 1998, the investor buys from the farmer, records the deed, and builds a fence. The investor was aware of the farmer-to-son deed but proceeded anyway. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and eventually own the farm via adverse possession.\n\nIn 1999, the son deeds the farm to the rancher, who doesn't record the deed. The rancher doesn't search the title or examine the property.\n\nIn 2003, the teacher buys from the investor, records the deed, and visits the farm regularly. The teacher was aware of the prior farmer-to-son deed.\n\nIn 2007, the rancher deeds the farm to the professor, who records the deed after visiting the farm and seeing the fence but without searching the title.\n\nNow, let's think about the priorities:\n\n1. **Farmer to son deed (1994):** Unrecorded. Void against subsequent purchasers who record first and are in good faith.\n\n2. **Investor's deed (1998):** Recorded first. The investor was aware of the son's unrecorded deed but proceeded anyway. Does this affect his priority?\n\n3. **Rancher's deed (1999):** Unrecorded. Void against subsequent purchasers who record first and are in good faith.\n\n4. **Teacher's deed (2003):** Recorded. The teacher was aware of the son's unrecorded deed but bought from the investor, who had recorded his deed.\n\n5. **Professor's deed (2007):** Recorded. He saw the fence but didn't search the title.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- The investor recorded his deed in 1998, which should give him priority over prior unrecorded interests, provided he was in good faith.\n\n- The son's unrecorded deed from 1994 is void against the investor's recorded deed.\n\n- The rancher's unrecorded deed from 1999 is void against the investor's recorded deed.\n\n- The teacher's recorded deed in 2003 is subsequent to the investor's, but since the investor's deed was recorded first, the teacher's deed should also be valid, assuming no one else has a better claim.\n\n- The professor's recorded deed in 2007 is subsequent to the teacher's recorded deed.\n\nHowever, there are complications:\n\n- The investor was aware of the son's unrecorded deed but still proceeded to buy from the farmer. Does this affect his good faith status?\n\n- The rancher didn't record his deed and didn't search the title.\n\n- The professor saw the fence but didn't search the title.\n\nLet's consider the investor's position:\n\n- He bought from the farmer in 1998, knowing about the son's unrecorded deed from 1994.\n\n- He recorded his deed first.\n\n- His intent was to acquire color of title and eventually own the farm via adverse possession.\n\n- He built a fence around the farm, which is a visible sign of possession.\n\nNow, the teacher bought from the investor in 2003, recorded the deed, and visited the farm regularly. The teacher was aware of the son's unrecorded deed but still proceeded.\n\nThe professor bought from the rancher in 2007, recorded the deed, but didn't search the title.\n\nSo, in terms of recording, the sequence is:\n\n- Investor (1998)\n\n- Teacher (2003)\n\n- Professor (2007)\n\nBut the recording act says that an unrecorded conveyance is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith who records first.\n\nGiven that the investor recorded first, his deed should prevail over prior unrecorded interests (son's deed).\n\nThen, the teacher bought from the investor, recorded the deed, and was aware of the son's unrecorded deed but still proceeded.\n\nThe professor bought from the rancher, who had an unrecorded deed from the son, but the professor didn't search the title.\n\nSo, between the teacher and the professor, the teacher recorded earlier and was aware of the son's claim but still bought from the investor.\n\nThe professor, on the other hand, bought from the rancher, who had an unrecorded deed from the son, and didn't search the title.\n\nBut the investor's recorded deed in 1998 should have priority over the son's unrecorded deed, so the rancher's deed from the son is invalid against the investor's recorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the rancher didn't have good title to convey to the professor.\n\nThus, the professor's deed is defective because the rancher didn't have good title to convey.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher bought from the investor, who had a recorded deed, and the teacher recorded his deed in 2003.\n\nSo, the teacher has a chain of title from the investor, who had recorded first in 1998.\n\nTherefore, the teacher should have priority over the professor, who bought from the rancher, who didn't have good title to convey.\n\nAdditionally, the teacher recorded his deed before the professor, so in a race-notice statute, the first to record has priority.\n\nTherefore, in an action to quiet title in 2008, the teacher should have the best claim to the farm.\n\nWait a minute, but let's consider if the investor's knowledge of the son's unrecorded deed affects his good faith status.\n\nThe recording act says \"purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\"\n\nThe investor was aware of the son's unrecorded deed but still bought from the farmer and recorded the deed.\n\nDoes this knowledge make the investor not in good faith?\n\nPossibly, because he had notice of a prior claim.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, actual knowledge of a prior unrecorded interest doesn't necessarily negate good faith if the purchaser still records first.\n\nBut it's a gray area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the investor's deed is defective because of his knowledge of the son's claim.\n\nIf that's the case, then the teacher's deed, which derives from the investor's deed, might also be defective.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the son's unrecorded deed is void against the investor's recorded deed, so the son had no interest to convey to the rancher in 1999.\n\nTherefore, the rancher's deed to the professor is invalid.\n\nThus, between the teacher and the professor, the teacher has a better claim because his deed is derived from the investor's recorded deed, which has priority over the son's unrecorded deed.\n\nMoreover, the professor bought from the rancher, who had no good title to convey.\n\nTherefore, the teacher should have priority.\n\nBut let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose the son's unrecorded deed is still valid against the investor because the investor had actual knowledge of it.\n\nIn that case, the son still has an interest in the property, which he could convey to the rancher.\n\nBut the investor recorded first, so the son's unrecorded deed is void against the investor's recorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the son had no interest to convey to the rancher in 1999.\n\nHence, the rancher's deed to the professor is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the professor has no valid claim to the property.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher bought from the investor, who had a valid recorded deed, and the teacher recorded his deed.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has a clear chain of title.\n\nThus, in an action to quiet title, the teacher should prevail.\n\nWait, but what about the fact that the teacher was aware of the son's unrecorded deed?\n\nDoes that affect his status?\n\nProbably not, because the investor's recorded deed should prevail over the son's unrecorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the teacher's knowledge of the son's claim doesn't taint his title derived from the investor's recorded deed.\n\nHence, the teacher has the best claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the son's unrecorded deed is still a cloud on the title, but given the recording act, the investor's recorded deed should prevail.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. The teacher.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any other angle that could give priority to another party.\n\nFor example, the professor saw the fence, which might indicate possession by someone else.\n\nBut he didn't search the title, so he might be considered not in good faith.\n\nHowever, the recording act primarily deals with recorded deeds, not actual possession.\n\nMoreover, the investor built the fence, which is a sign of possession, but he didn't reside there; he just visited regularly.\n\nThe teacher also visited regularly but didn't reside there.\n\nThe professor saw the fence but didn't know who built it or who was using the property.\n\nTherefore, it's unclear if the professor had constructive notice of the investor's or teacher's claims based solely on seeing the fence.\n\nIn any case, since the investor and teacher had recorded deeds, and the professor didn't search the title, the professor's lack of knowledge doesn't protect him.\n\nTherefore, the teacher, having recorded first after the investor, should have priority over the professor.\n\nHence, the answer is C. The teacher."
