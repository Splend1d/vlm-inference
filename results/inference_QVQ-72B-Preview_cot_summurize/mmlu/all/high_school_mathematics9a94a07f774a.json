                    "text": "So Bob has this routine where he rolls a six-sided die every morning to decide what kind of cereal to eat. If he rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal, and if he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. But if he rolls a 1, he has to roll again. The question is asking for the expected number of times he'll roll his die in a non-leap year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what expected value means in this context. It's basically the average number of times Bob will roll the die each day, considering that he might have to roll again if he gets a 1.\n\nSo, let's think about what happens each morning. Bob rolls the die once. If he gets a 1, which is neither prime nor composite, he has to roll again. Otherwise, he stops.\n\nI need to find out how many times, on average, he has to roll the die each day.\n\nLet me think about the probabilities involved. A standard six-sided die has numbers from 1 to 6.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nNow, among these, which are composite numbers and which are prime numbers?\n\nComposite numbers are those that have more than two distinct positive divisors. So:\n\n- 1 is neither prime nor composite.\n\n- 2 is prime.\n\n- 3 is prime.\n\n- 4 is composite (divisors: 1, 2, 4).\n\n- 5 is prime.\n\n- 6 is composite (divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6).\n\nSo, composite numbers are 4 and 6. That's two out of six.\n\nPrime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. That's three out of six.\n\nAnd 1 is neither, so he has to roll again.\n\nSo, the probability that he stops after one roll is the probability of getting a composite number or a prime number.\n\nThat's 2/6 (composites) + 3/6 (primes) = 5/6.\n\nThe probability that he has to roll again (gets a 1) is 1/6.\n\nSo, on any given roll, there's a 5/6 chance he stops and a 1/6 chance he has to roll again.\n\nThis seems like a geometric distribution, where the probability of success is 5/6.\n\nThe expected number of trials until success in a geometric distribution is 1/p, where p is the probability of success.\n\nSo, expected number of rolls per day is 1 / (5/6) = 6/5.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Is that right?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think recursively.\n\nLet E be the expected number of rolls per day.\n\nHe rolls the die once. With probability 5/6, he stops after that one roll. With probability 1/6, he has to roll again, and the expected number of additional rolls is also E.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nE = 1*(5/6) + (1 + E)*(1/6)\n\nBecause if he rolls again, he has already rolled once plus the expected additional rolls.\n\nSolving for E:\n\nE = 5/6 + (1 + E)/6\n\nMultiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6E = 5 + 1 + E\n\n6E = 6 + E\n\nSubtract E from both sides:\n\n5E = 6\n\nSo, E = 6/5.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, on average, Bob rolls the die 6/5 times per day.\n\nNow, a non-leap year has 365 days.\n\nSo, the expected number of rolls in a year is 365 * (6/5) = (365 * 6)/5 = 2190/5 = 438.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\frac{5}{8}\n\nB. \\frac{1825}{4}\n\nC. \\frac{5}{4}\n\nD. 438\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, identifying the composite and prime numbers on the die:\n\nComposites: 4,6 \u2192 2 out of 6.\n\nPrimes: 2,3,5 \u2192 3 out of 6.\n\n1 is neither, so probability of stopping after one roll is indeed 5/6.\n\nProbability of rolling again is 1/6.\n\nExpected value of geometric distribution is 1/p = 6/5 per day.\n\nOver 365 days: 365 * 6/5 = 438.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expected value per day as 6/5, and 365 days, that's 438 rolls.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 438.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{438} \\]"
