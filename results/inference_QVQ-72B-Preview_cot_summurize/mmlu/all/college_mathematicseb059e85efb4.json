                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It says that V is the vector space of real polynomials with degree at most 3, and W is the subspace of V consisting of polynomials p(x) such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. I need to find dim V + dim W among the given options: 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what V and W are. V is the space of all polynomials of degree up to 3, which means polynomials like p(x) = a + bx + cx\u00b2 + dx\u00b3, where a, b, c, d are real numbers. The dimension of V should be the number of coefficients, which is 4, right? So dim V = 4.\n\nNow, W is a subspace of V consisting of polynomials that vanish at x=0, x=1, and x=-1. That is, p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 for all p(x) in W.\n\nI need to find dim W. One way to approach this is to use the dimension formula for subspaces. I recall that if we have a subspace W of V, then dim W = dim V - dim(V/W), where V/W is the quotient space.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the conditions p(0) = 0, p(1) = 0, and p(-1) = 0, and see how these conditions reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the coefficients of p(x).\n\nSince p(x) is of degree at most 3, and it has roots at x=0, x=1, and x=-1, that means p(x) is divisible by (x-0)(x-1)(x+1) = x(x-1)(x+1). So, p(x) can be written as p(x) = x(x-1)(x+1)q(x), where q(x) is a polynomial. But wait, p(x) is of degree at most 3, so q(x) must be a constant because if q(x) were non-constant, the degree of p(x) would be higher than 3.\n\nWait, but p(x) is of degree at most 3. Let's check:\n\nIf p(x) = x(x-1)(x+1)q(x), and p(x) is degree at most 3, then q(x) must be a constant. Because x(x-1)(x+1) is degree 3, and multiplying by q(x) would increase the degree by the degree of q(x). So q(x) must be a constant, say q(x) = c.\n\nTherefore, p(x) = c * x(x-1)(x+1) = c(x\u00b3 - x).\n\nSo, p(x) has one free parameter, c, which can be any real number.\n\nTherefore, dim W = 1, because there's only one independent coefficient, c.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought dim V = 4, and dim W = 1, so dim V + dim W = 5.\n\nBut according to the rank-nullity theorem, dim V = dim W + dim(V/W). Here, V/W is the quotient space, which can be thought of as the set of cosets of W in V.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to think about this.\n\nLet me consider the linear transformation T: V \u2192 R^3 defined by T(p) = (p(0), p(1), p(-1)).\n\nThen, the kernel of T is W, since W consists of all p in V such that T(p) = (0,0,0).\n\nBy the rank-nullity theorem, dim V = dim ker T + rank T.\n\nWe know dim V = 4, and dim ker T = dim W.\n\nSo, dim W = 4 - rank T.\n\nNow, rank T is the dimension of the image of T, which is the subspace of R^3 consisting of vectors (p(0), p(1), p(-1)) for all p in V.\n\nI need to find rank T.\n\nAlternatively, rank T is at most 3, since the codomain is R^3.\n\nBut what is the actual rank?\n\nLet me consider the basis of V. A basis is {1, x, x\u00b2, x\u00b3}.\n\nLet's see what T does to this basis:\n\nT(1) = (1, 1, 1)\n\nT(x) = (0, 1, -1)\n\nT(x\u00b2) = (0, 1, 1)\n\nT(x\u00b3) = (0, 1, -1)\n\nNow, the image of T is the span of these vectors.\n\nLet me see if I can find a basis for the image.\n\nWe have:\n\n(1,1,1)\n\n(0,1,-1)\n\n(0,1,1)\n\n(0,1,-1)\n\nThese are four vectors in R^3, so they are linearly dependent.\n\nLet's see which ones are linearly independent.\n\nFirst, (1,1,1) is linearly independent.\n\nThen, (0,1,-1) is linearly independent from (1,1,1).\n\nNext, (0,1,1) is the same as (0,1,-1) plus (0,0,2), which is not a multiple, but let's check linear dependence.\n\nWait, (0,1,-1) and (0,1,1) are linearly independent because they differ in the last coordinate.\n\nNow, (0,1,-1) is already included, and (0,1,1) is different.\n\nSo, the first three vectors seem linearly independent.\n\nBut wait, (1,1,1), (0,1,-1), and (0,1,1) are linearly independent.\n\nLet me check:\n\na(1,1,1) + b(0,1,-1) + c(0,1,1) = (0,0,0)\n\nWhich gives:\n\na = 0\n\nb + c = 0\n\n-b + c = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, a = 0.\n\nFrom the second and third equations, b + c = 0 and -b + c = 0.\n\nAdding these two equations, 2c = 0, so c = 0, then b = 0.\n\nTherefore, these three vectors are linearly independent.\n\nSo, the rank of T is 3.\n\nTherefore, dim W = dim V - rank T = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nThis confirms my earlier conclusion that dim W = 1.\n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, since W is the set of all p in V such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0, and V is the space of polynomials of degree at most 3, we can think of W as the space of polynomials that are zero at x=0, x=1, and x=-1.\n\nAny such p(x) can be written as p(x) = x(x-1)(x+1)q(x), where q(x) is a polynomial.\n\nBut since p(x) is of degree at most 3, and x(x-1)(x+1) is degree 3, q(x) must be a constant.\n\nTherefore, p(x) = c(x\u00b3 - x), where c is any real number.\n\nThus, W is spanned by a single polynomial, x\u00b3 - x, so dim W = 1.\n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that p(x) in V can be written generally as p(x) = a + bx + cx\u00b2 + dx\u00b3.\n\nThe conditions p(0) = 0, p(1) = 0, and p(-1) = 0 give us a system of equations:\n\np(0) = a = 0\n\np(1) = a + b + c + d = 0\n\np(-1) = a - b + c - d = 0\n\nFrom p(0) = 0, we have a = 0.\n\nSo, p(x) = bx + cx\u00b2 + dx\u00b3.\n\nNow, from p(1) = b + c + d = 0\n\nAnd p(-1) = -b + c - d = 0\n\nSo, we have:\n\nb + c + d = 0\n\n-b + c - d = 0\n\nLet me solve for b, c, d.\n\nLet me add these two equations:\n\n(b + c + d) + (-b + c - d) = 0 + 0 \u21d2 2c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0\n\nSo, c = 0.\n\nThen, from b + c + d = 0, and c = 0, we have b + d = 0 \u21d2 d = -b\n\nTherefore, p(x) = b x + 0 x\u00b2 + (-b) x\u00b3 = b(x - x\u00b3)\n\nSo, p(x) = b(x - x\u00b3), where b is any real number.\n\nThus, W is spanned by the single polynomial x - x\u00b3, so dim W = 1.\n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, the conditions p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 impose three linear constraints on the four coefficients of p(x).\n\nHowever, since these constraints are not all linearly independent (as seen from the earlier system of equations leading to c = 0 and d = -b), effectively, only two independent constraints are imposed, reducing the dimension by 2: dim W = 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nLet me check where I went wrong.\n\nEarlier, I found that dim W = 1, but now I'm getting dim W = 2.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nFrom the system of equations:\n\na = 0\n\nb + c + d = 0\n\n-b + c - d = 0\n\nFrom a = 0, we have p(x) = bx + cx\u00b2 + dx\u00b3.\n\nThen, b + c + d = 0 and -b + c - d = 0.\n\nAdding these two equations gives 2c = 0, so c = 0.\n\nThen, from b + c + d = 0, and c = 0, we have b + d = 0, so d = -b.\n\nTherefore, p(x) = b x + 0 x\u00b2 + (-b) x\u00b3 = b(x - x\u00b3)\n\nSo, p(x) is a scalar multiple of x - x\u00b3, meaning dim W = 1.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion was correct.\n\nI must have made a mistake in thinking that the constraints impose only two independent conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 impose three conditions, but they are not all independent.\n\nFrom the system:\n\nb + c + d = 0\n\n-b + c - d = 0\n\nThese two equations are enough to solve for b and d in terms of c, but since c = 0 from adding the equations, then d = -b.\n\nSo, effectively, only one parameter remains free, which is b.\n\nTherefore, dim W = 1.\n\nHence, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, using the rank-nullity theorem, dim V = dim W + rank T.\n\nWe found that rank T = 3, so dim W = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5.\n\nBut let me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the basis of V as {1, x, x\u00b2, x\u00b3}.\n\nThen, W consists of all linear combinations of these basis vectors that satisfy p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0.\n\nLet me find which basis vectors satisfy these conditions.\n\nFirst, p(x) = 1: p(0) = 1 \u2260 0\n\np(x) = x: p(0) = 0, p(1) = 1 \u2260 0, p(-1) = -1 \u2260 0\n\np(x) = x\u00b2: p(0) = 0, p(1) = 1 \u2260 0, p(-1) = 1 \u2260 0\n\np(x) = x\u00b3: p(0) = 0, p(1) = 1 \u2260 0, p(-1) = -1 \u2260 0\n\nNone of the basis vectors individually satisfy p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0.\n\nSo, I need to find linear combinations that do.\n\nEarlier, I found that p(x) = x(x - 1)(x + 1) = x\u00b3 - x satisfies p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0.\n\nIs there another linearly independent polynomial in W?\n\nWell, from the earlier solution, p(x) = b(x - x\u00b3), which is just a scalar multiple of x - x\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, W is spanned by a single vector, x - x\u00b3, so dim W = 1.\n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that p(x) in W must be divisible by x(x - 1)(x + 1), and since p(x) is degree at most 3, and x(x - 1)(x + 1) is degree 3, then p(x) must be a scalar multiple of x(x - 1)(x + 1).\n\nTherefore, again, dim W = 1.\n\nHence, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
