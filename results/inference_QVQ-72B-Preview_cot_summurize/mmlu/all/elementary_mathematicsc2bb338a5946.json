                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a tank shaped like a triangular prism. The base is a triangle with an area of 116 square feet, and the tank is 30 feet tall. I need to find out how much water it can hold when it's full. The options are 1725 ft\u00b3, 1740 ft\u00b3, 3480 ft\u00b3, and 6960 ft\u00b3.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a triangular prism is. It's a three-dimensional shape with two triangular bases that are parallel and connected by rectangular faces. The volume of a prism is generally the area of the base multiplied by the height of the prism. So, for a triangular prism, the volume should be the area of the triangular base times the height of the prism.\n\nGiven that the area of the base is 116 ft\u00b2 and the height (or depth) of the prism is 30 ft, the volume should be:\n\nVolume = base area \u00d7 height\n\nVolume = 116 ft\u00b2 \u00d7 30 ft\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n116 \u00d7 30 = 3480 ft\u00b3\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the tank can hold 3480 cubic feet of water when full. Looking at the options, C. 3480 ft\u00b3 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way to approach this problem?\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the formula for the volume of a triangular prism again. The volume is indeed the area of the base times the height. So, if the base area is 116 ft\u00b2 and the height is 30 ft, multiplying them should give the correct volume.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might get confused about whether to use the perimeter or area of the base, but in this case, since it's a prism, and specifically a triangular prism, using the area of the base is correct.\n\nLet me see if there's any other information I should consider. The problem mentions that the tank is in the shape of a triangular prism, with a triangular base area of 116 ft\u00b2 and a height of 30 ft. It doesn't provide any other dimensions or information that would affect the volume calculation.\n\nSo, based on the given information and the standard formula for the volume of a triangular prism, 3480 ft\u00b3 should be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's any trick here. Is the tank completely filled to the top, or is there some part that's not filled? The problem says \"when it is full,\" so I assume it's filled to the top.\n\nAlso, sometimes problems might ask for the capacity in gallons or other units, but here it's in cubic feet, which is a unit of volume, so that matches.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the base area is indeed the area of the triangular base. The problem specifies that the base has an area of 116 ft\u00b2, so I think we can take that at face value.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation. If the base were not the area but something else, that would change things, but no, it's clearly stated as the area of the base.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here. The calculation seems straightforward, and unless there's some unusual aspect I'm missing, which I don't think is the case here, the volume should be 3480 ft\u00b3.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. 3480 ft^3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 3480 \\ \\text{ft}^3} \\]"
