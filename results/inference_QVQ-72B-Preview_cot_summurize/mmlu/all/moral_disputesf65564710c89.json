                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this question about Mill's view on what each person desires. The options are:\n\nA. To do his or her duty.\n\nB. To be virtuous.\n\nC. His or her own happiness.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nI need to figure out which one Mill would agree with.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall who Mill is. I know that John Stuart Mill was an English philosopher, economist, and advocate of liberalism. He's famous for his work on utilitarianism, which is a theory about ethics and happiness.\n\nUtilitarianism is based on the idea that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, which is often defined as happiness or pleasure. So, according to Mill, people should act in ways that produce the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nNow, the question is asking about what each person desires. So, from a utilitarian perspective, what do individuals want?\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: To do his or her duty.\n\nHmm, duty is an interesting concept. In some ethical theories, like deontology, duty is central. For example, Immanuel Kant believed that people should act according to their duty, not based on the consequences of their actions. But Mill was more focused on the consequences\u2014specifically, maximizing happiness.\n\nSo, while duty might be important, Mill would likely see it as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Duty could be important if it leads to greater happiness, but it's not the ultimate desire.\n\nMaybe not A.\n\nOption B: To be virtuous.\n\nVirtue is another concept that's important in ethics. Some philosophers, like Aristotle, emphasize virtues as essential for a good life. Virtues are traits of character that help us live well and make the right choices.\n\nBut again, Mill's focus is on happiness. While virtues might help us achieve happiness, they aren't the same as happiness itself. In fact, Mill might argue that virtues are valuable because they contribute to happiness, but being virtuous isn't the ultimate goal; happiness is.\n\nSo, perhaps not B.\n\nOption C: His or her own happiness.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Mill believed that happiness is the ultimate good, and that people should seek to maximize happiness\u2014both their own and others'.\n\nBut wait, utilitarianism isn't just about individual happiness; it's about overall happiness. The principle of utility considers the happiness of all affected by an action, not just the individual's own happiness.\n\nSo, while individuals might desire their own happiness, Mill would argue that they should consider the happiness of others as well.\n\nBut the question is about what each person desires, not necessarily what they ought to desire according to Mill's theory.\n\nMaybe people naturally desire their own happiness, even if they should consider others.\n\nOption D: None of the above.\n\nThis seems like a possible answer if none of the other options fit, but I'd prefer to choose one of the given options if possible.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider Mill's view on human nature.\n\nMill was a proponent of psychological hedonism, which is the idea that humans are motivated by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. So, in that sense, people desire their own happiness.\n\nBut again, utilitarianism builds on that by suggesting that we should consider the happiness of others as well as our own.\n\nHowever, the question is about what each person desires, not what they should desire.\n\nPerhaps Mill would say that people naturally desire their own happiness, but they should desire the greatest happiness for all.\n\nSo, in that case, option C seems the most fitting answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Mill would argue that people desire their own happiness, but in practice, they also care about others to some extent.\n\nBut the question is specifically about what each person desires, not what they ought to desire or what they might care about.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nWait, but utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness, not just one's own. So, if Mill believed that people naturally desire their own happiness, that might be different from what they should desire.\n\nBut the question is about what they desire, not what they should desire.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is C: his or her own happiness.\n\nI think that's the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
