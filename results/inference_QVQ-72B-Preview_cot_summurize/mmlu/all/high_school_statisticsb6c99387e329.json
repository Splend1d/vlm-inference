                    "text": "So I've got this statistics problem here. It says that I did 10 independent tests, each testing the null hypothesis that the mean is equal to 25 against the alternative hypothesis that the mean is less than 25, all at a 0.05 significance level. The question is, what's the probability of committing a Type I error and incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis with at least one of these 10 tests?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a Type I error is. A Type I error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis. So, in this context, if the null hypothesis is true, but we still end up rejecting it in one or more of these tests, that's a Type I error.\n\nEach test is independent, and they're all being done at \u03b1 = 0.05. That means that for each individual test, the probability of making a Type I error is 0.05.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability of making at least one Type I error across all 10 tests. To find this, it's often easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe complementary event here is that none of the tests result in a Type I error. So, the probability of not making a Type I error in a single test is 1 - \u03b1 = 0.95.\n\nSince the tests are independent, the probability that all 10 tests do not result in a Type I error is (0.95)^10.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.95 ^ 10 = 0.5987369392039129\n\nSo, approximately 0.5987.\n\nThen, the probability of making at least one Type I error in the 10 tests is 1 minus this value.\n\n1 - 0.5987 \u2248 0.4013\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.05\n\nB. 0.40\n\nC. 0.50\n\nD. 0.60\n\nSo, the closest option is B. 0.40.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nEach test has a 0.05 chance of incorrectly rejecting H0, and a 0.95 chance of not incorrectly rejecting it.\n\nFor 10 independent tests, the probability that none result in a Type I error is (0.95)^10, which is approximately 0.5987.\n\nThen, the probability of at least one Type I error is 1 - 0.5987 \u2248 0.4013, which rounds to 0.40.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 0.40.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of having one or more Type I errors.\n\nThe number of Type I errors follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 10 and p = 0.05.\n\nThe probability of at least one Type I error is 1 - P(X = 0), where X is the number of Type I errors.\n\nP(X = 0) = (1 - p)^n = (0.95)^10 \u2248 0.5987\n\nSo, P(X \u2265 1) = 1 - 0.5987 \u2248 0.4013\n\nAgain, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the multiplicity of testing. When performing multiple hypothesis tests, the overall probability of making at least one Type I error increases beyond the individual \u03b1 level.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the multiple comparisons problem, and adjusting for it is crucial in statistical analysis to maintain the overall Type I error rate.\n\nOne common method to adjust for multiple comparisons is the Bonferroni correction, which simply multiplies the per-test \u03b1 level by the number of tests. However, in this problem, we're not asked to adjust the significance level but rather to find the probability of making at least one Type I error under the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the approach taken\u2014calculating 1 - (1 - \u03b1)^n\u2014is appropriate and directly answers the question.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. 0.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 0.40} \\]"
