                    "text": "So I have this question: \"What company makes Oreo cookies? A. General Mills, B. Nabisco, C. Keebler, D. Kraft.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these companies produces Oreo cookies. I think I know the answer, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing them up.\n\nFirst, let's consider each option one by one. Starting with General Mills. I know General Mills makes a lot of breakfast cereals like Cheerios, Wheaties, and Lucky Charms. They also have a baking division that makes things like Bisquick and Betty Crocker mixes. But I don't recall them making Oreo cookies. Maybe they make some kind of cookies, but not Oreos. So, perhaps A is not the right answer.\n\nNext, Nabisco. Now, Nabisco rings a bell in relation to cookies. I remember that Nabisco is known for making cookies and snacks like Ritz crackers, Chips Ahoy!, and of course, Oreos. In fact, I think Oreo is one of their flagship products. So, B. Nabisco seems like a strong candidate.\n\nThen there's Keebler. Keebler is another cookie and cracker company. They make things like Eggo waffles, Town House crackers, and Frosted Flakes. Wait, Frosted Flakes is actually a Kellogg's product. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Anyway, I don't think Keebler makes Oreos. So, C is probably not the correct answer.\n\nLastly, Kraft. Kraft is a big food company known for products like Kraft cheeses, Velveeta, and Oscar Mayer meats. They also own some other brands, but I don't think they make Oreos. Wait a minute, I think at one point Kraft owned Nabisco, or maybe they were separate. Let me think about that. Actually, I believe Kraft did own Nabisco at one time, but I'm not sure about the current status. This is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try to clarify this. If Kraft owned Nabisco in the past, does that mean they own Oreo cookies? Or did they sell Nabisco to someone else? I need to recall the corporate history here. After a quick search in my memory, I think Kraft did acquire Nabisco in 2000, but then they spun off their grocery division into a separate company called Mondelez International in 2012. So, Mondelez now owns Nabisco, along with other brands like Cadbury and LU. Therefore, Kraft doesn't currently own Nabisco or Oreo cookies. So, D. Kraft is probably not the correct answer.\n\nWait, but sometimes companies have complex ownership structures, and maybe Kraft still has some connection to Nabisco. To be safe, I should double-check this information. Let me see if I can recall any recent updates or news about Nabisco's ownership. No, nothing comes to mind immediately. Maybe I should consider that Nabisco is currently part of Mondelez International, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, Nabisco is the company that makes Oreo cookies, and Nabisco is now owned by Mondelez International. Therefore, if the question is asking about the current direct manufacturer, it would still be Nabisco, even if it's under the Mondelez umbrella. So, B. Nabisco is the best answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other companies might have acquired Nabisco or parts of it. General Mills did acquire Pillsbury, which makes biscuits and dough, but not Nabisco. Keebler was acquired by Kellogg's in 2001, so it's now part of Kellogg's portfolio, which doesn't include Nabisco. And as I thought earlier, Kraft used to own Nabisco but no longer does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \"What company makes Oreo cookies?\" is B. Nabisco. I'm confident about that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Nabisco}} \\]"
