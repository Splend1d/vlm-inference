                    "text": "So I have this problem here: Determine whether the polynomial in Z[x] satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q. The polynomial is x^2 - 12. The options are:\n\nA. Yes, with p=2.\n\nB. Yes, with p=3.\n\nC. Yes, with p=5.\n\nD. No.\n\nAlright, let's recall what the Eisenstein criterion is. It's a test to determine if a polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q. The criterion states that if you have a polynomial:\n\na_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0\n\nAnd if there exists a prime number p such that:\n\n1. p divides each of the coefficients a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}.\n\n2. p does not divide a_n.\n\n3. p^2 does not divide a_0.\n\nThen the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\n\nSo, for the polynomial x^2 - 12, let's see if it satisfies the Eisenstein criterion with any of the primes given: 2, 3, or 5.\n\nFirst, write the polynomial in standard form:\n\n1 x^2 + 0 x + (-12)\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\na_2 = 1\n\na_1 = 0\n\na_0 = -12\n\nNow, let's check each option.\n\nOption A: p=2\n\n1. p divides a_0, a_1: 2 divides -12 (since 2 divides 12), and 2 divides 0.\n\n2. p does not divide a_2: 2 does not divide 1.\n\n3. p^2=4 does not divide a_0: 4 does not divide -12, because 4 divides 12, but the condition is that p^2 should not divide a_0. Wait, 4 does divide 12, because 12 divided by 4 is 3, which is an integer. So, actually, 4 does divide 12, which means the third condition is not satisfied.\n\nSo, with p=2, the third condition fails.\n\nOption B: p=3\n\n1. p divides a_0, a_1: 3 divides -12 (3 divides 12), and 3 divides 0.\n\n2. p does not divide a_2: 3 does not divide 1.\n\n3. p^2=9 does not divide a_0: 9 does not divide -12. Well, 9 does not divide 12, because 12 divided by 9 is 1 and 1/3, which is not an integer. So, 9 does not divide 12.\n\nTherefore, all three conditions are satisfied with p=3.\n\nOption C: p=5\n\n1. p divides a_0, a_1: 5 divides -12? Well, 5 divides 12? 12 divided by 5 is 2 and 2/5, which is not an integer, so 5 does not divide 12.\n\nSince the first condition fails, we don't need to check the others for p=5.\n\nSo, only option B seems to satisfy the Eisenstein criterion.\n\nWait a minute, but I know that x^2 - 12 can be factored over the rationals. Is it irreducible over Q?\n\nLet me check if it can be factored into two linear terms with rational coefficients.\n\nSuppose it factors as (x - r)(x - s) = x^2 - (r+s)x + rs\n\nThen, r + s = 0 and rs = -12.\n\nSo, s = -r, and thus r*(-r) = -r^2 = -12, so r^2 = 12.\n\nTherefore, r = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), which is not rational.\n\nSo, indeed, x^2 - 12 is irreducible over Q.\n\nTherefore, the Eisenstein criterion should hold for some prime p.\n\nWe saw that p=3 satisfies the criterion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Yes, with p=3.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's another way to see this.\n\nAlternatively, x^2 - 12 is a quadratic polynomial, and quadratic polynomials are irreducible over Q if and only if their discriminant is not a perfect square.\n\nThe discriminant of ax^2 + bx + c is b^2 - 4ac.\n\nHere, a=1, b=0, c=-12.\n\nSo, discriminant is 0^2 - 4*1*(-12) = 48.\n\nNow, 48 is not a perfect square, since sqrt(48) is approximately 6.928, which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, x^2 - 12 is irreducible over Q.\n\nSo, the Eisenstein criterion, being a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for irreducibility, holds with p=3, and thus the polynomial is irreducible, which matches our conclusion from the discriminant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Yes, with p=3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
