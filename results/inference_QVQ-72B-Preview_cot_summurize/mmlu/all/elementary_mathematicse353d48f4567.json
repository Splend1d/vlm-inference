                    "text": "Let's see here. Sam paid $8.28 for 18 stamps. I need to find out how much it would cost to buy 12 stamps at the same rate. Okay, so first I should probably figure out the cost per stamp, right?\n\nSo, if 18 stamps cost $8.28, then the cost per stamp is $8.28 divided by 18. Let me calculate that. 8.28 divided by 18. Hmm, 18 times 0.46 is 8.28. So, 0.46 per stamp. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 18 times 0.4 is 7.20, and then 0.46 times 18 should be 7.20 plus 0.46 times 8, which is 3.68, total 10.88. No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should use a different way.\n\nLet me try dividing 8.28 by 18. Well, 18 times 0.4 is 7.20, subtract that from 8.28 and get 1.08. Then, 18 times 0.06 is 1.08. So, total is 0.4 + 0.06 = $0.46 per stamp. Yeah, that makes sense because 18 times 0.46 is 8.28.\n\nNow, to find the cost for 12 stamps, I just multiply 12 by $0.46. Let's do that. 12 times 0.4 is 4.80, and 12 times 0.06 is 0.72. So, total is $5.52.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $2.19\n\nB. $2.28\n\nC. $3.72\n\nD. $5.52\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. $5.52.\n\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way to do this? Maybe using proportions. If 18 stamps cost $8.28, then 12 stamps would cost (12/18) times $8.28.\n\nLet me calculate that. 12 divided by 18 is 2/3. So, 2/3 of $8.28 is $5.52. Yeah, that matches what I got before.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion: cost / stamps = cost / stamps.\n\nSo, $8.28 / 18 stamps = x / 12 stamps.\n\nCross-multiplying: 18x = $8.28 times 12.\n\nFirst, 8 times 12 is 96, and 0.28 times 12 is 3.36, so total is $99.36.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 18 stamps are $8.28, so 12 stamps should be less. Maybe I messed up the calculation.\n\nLet me try again. 8.28 times 12 divided by 18.\n\nFirst, 8.28 times 12.\n\n8 times 12 is 96, and 0.28 times 12 is 3.36, so total is $99.36.\n\nThen, divide by 18. 99.36 divided by 18.\n\n18 times 5 is 90, and 9.36 divided by 18 is 0.52, so total is $5.52.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is $5.52, which is option D.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach that might lead to a different answer. Maybe using unit rates or something else, but no, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stamps don't cost the same per stamp, but since it says \"at this rate,\" I think it's safe to assume that the cost per stamp is constant.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is D. $5.52."
