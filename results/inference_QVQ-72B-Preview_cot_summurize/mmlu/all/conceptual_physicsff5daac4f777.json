                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about lifting a crate using a pulley system. The crate weighs 100 N, and I'm pulling down on a rope with a force of 25 N. For every 1 meter of rope I pull down, I need to figure out how much the crate rises. The options are 25 cm, 25 m, 50 cm, or none of these.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of pulley system this is. Since I'm pulling down with 25 N to lift 100 N, it seems like the pulley system is giving a mechanical advantage. Mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output force to the input force. So, mechanical advantage (MA) = output force / input force = 100 N / 25 N = 4.\n\nNow, for an ideal pulley system, the mechanical advantage is equal to the number of rope segments supporting the load. So, if MA is 4, that means there are 4 segments of rope supporting the crate.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how much the crate rises when I pull down 1 meter of rope. In an ideal pulley system, the distance you pull the rope is equal to the mechanical advantage multiplied by the distance the crate rises.\n\nSo, rope pulled (distance) = mechanical advantage \u00d7 crate rise distance.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the crate rise distance as D. Then, 1 meter = 4 \u00d7 D.\n\nSolving for D, D = 1 meter / 4 = 0.25 meters.\n\n0.25 meters is the same as 25 cm.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 25 cm, B is 25 m, C is 50 cm, and D is none of these.\n\n25 cm seems to be the correct answer based on this calculation.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should consider the type of pulley system that would give a mechanical advantage of 4.\n\nLet me think about pulley configurations. A block and tackle system with multiple pulleys can provide mechanical advantage. For example, a system with 4 supporting ropes would have MA=4.\n\nAlternatively, a system with 2 pulleys, each with 2 ropes supporting the load, might give MA=4, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nActually, in a block and tackle system, the mechanical advantage is equal to the number of rope segments supporting the load. So, if MA=4, there are 4 segments.\n\nTherefore, for every meter of rope pulled, the crate rises by 1/4 meter, which is 0.25 meters or 25 cm.\n\nSo, according to this, option A, 25 cm, is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using energy considerations.\n\nThe work done by the person pulling the rope is force times distance, which is 25 N times 1 m = 25 J.\n\nThis work should be equal to the increase in potential energy of the crate, which is crate weight times height raised, so 100 N times D.\n\nTherefore, 25 J = 100 N \u00d7 D.\n\nSolving for D, D = 25 J / 100 N = 0.25 meters, which is again 25 cm.\n\nSo, this confirms the previous result.\n\nAlternatively, considering the mechanical advantage again, since MA=4, and force applied is 25 N to lift 100 N, the distance relationship should be inversely related to the force ratio.\n\nSo, rope pulled / crate rises = MA.\n\nTherefore, 1 m / D = 4.\n\nThus, D = 1 m / 4 = 0.25 m.\n\nAgain, this points to 25 cm being the correct answer.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from a few different angles and consistently arrived at the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 25 cm, which corresponds to option A.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any other factors at play here. For example, friction or the weight of the pulleys themselves. However, the problem specifies an \"ideal pulley system,\" so we can assume that there is no friction or mass in the pulleys, and that the ropes are massless as well.\n\nTherefore, in this ideal scenario, the relationships between forces and distances hold exactly as calculated.\n\nSo, the final answer is 25 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 25 \\ \\text{cm}} \\]"
