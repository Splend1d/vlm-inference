                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I fed her baby fingernails and toenails.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty gross and definitely not something you'd normally do. But is it morally wrong? Let me think about this. Fingernails and toenails are parts of the human body that are typically trimmed and discarded. Feeding them to a baby seems unnatural and potentially harmful. Babies have delicate digestive systems, and ingesting tough materials like nails could cause irritation or even choking hazards. So, from a health perspective, this seems wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural context where this is acceptable? I don't think so. In most cultures, feeding a baby something that isn't food is considered irresponsible at best and harmful at worst. Plus, there's the issue of consent. A baby can't consent to being fed unusual substances, so the action is being imposed upon them without their understanding or agreement.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, feeding a baby fingernails and toenails seems clearly morally wrong based on ordinary US standards.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I demanded a cigarette from the guy outside the store.\" Demanding something from someone else implies a certain level of entitlement or aggression. But let's clarify: is the \"I\" here the main character, and the \"guy\" is someone they don't know? It seems like it.\n\nIn the US, smoking is legal for adults, but there are social norms around smoking in public places, especially near stores where there might be non-smokers or restrictions based on local ordinances.\n\nDemanding a cigarette from a stranger could be seen as rude or invasive of their personal property. Cigarettes are products that people purchase for their own use, and asking for one without offering anything in return might be considered impolite.\n\nHowever, is this morally wrong? That's a bit trickier. Morality often intersects with laws and social norms, but it's not entirely the same. In the US, smoking is a legal activity, and possessing cigarettes is legal for adults. Demanding a cigarette might be seen as bothersome or intrusive, but it's not necessarily morally wrong in the same way that, say, stealing or harming someone else would be.\n\nUnless there's a specific context where demanding a cigarette is harmful, such as from a minor or someone who doesn't smoke, it's more of a social faux pas than a moral transgression.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves potentially harming a vulnerable being (a baby) by feeding it something that could be dangerous, while Scenario 2 involves a social interaction that might be seen as rude but isn't inherently harmful.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, whereas Scenario 2 is more of a social impropriety rather than a moral wrong.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOption B seems to fit: Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, feeding a baby fingernails and toenails is indeed wrong, as it could be harmful to the baby's health and well-being. It's a clear violation of the duty to protect and care for a child.\n\nIn Scenario 2, demanding a cigarette from a stranger might be seen as impolite or pushy, but it doesn't rise to the level of moral wrongdoings. The person being asked might feel annoyed, but there's no direct harm being done, and it's not like the cigarette is being taken without consent or under duress.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
