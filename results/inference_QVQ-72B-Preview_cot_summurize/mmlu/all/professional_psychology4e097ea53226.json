                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is an example of anterograde amnesia. I remember that anterograde amnesia is when someone can't form new memories after an event, usually some sort of trauma or injury. So, it's about not being able to remember things that happen after the event that caused the amnesia.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that a man can't remember where he was going before the accident. So, the accident is the event, and he can't remember something that happened before it. That sounds like retrograde amnesia, where you can't remember things that happened before the event, not anterograde, which is after the event.\n\nOption B talks about a woman who can't remember events that occurred during the 24 hours after she was sexually assaulted. So, the assault is the event, and she can't remember what happened after that. That seems like she's having trouble forming new memories after the traumatic event, which would be anterograde amnesia.\n\nOption C is about a high school junior who learned Spanish in freshman year and is now having trouble learning French because she's mixing up Spanish words with French ones. This seems more like interference in learning a new language rather than amnesia. It's not related to memory loss after an event; it's about learning and mixing up two different languages.\n\nOption D mentions a college student who can remember information related to an important event but can't remember how he acquired that information. This sounds more like implicit versus explicit memory. He knows the information but doesn't recall the learning process. It's not directly related to amnesia following an event.\n\nBased on this, option B seems to be the best example of anterograde amnesia because it describes someone who can't remember events that occurred after a traumatic event, which is the classic definition of anterograde amnesia.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Anterograde amnesia is indeed the inability to form new memories after a traumatic event or brain injury. So, in option B, the woman can't remember events after the assault, which fits this description.\n\nOption A is retrograde amnesia, where memories formed before the event are lost. Option C is more about language interference in learning, and option D is about implicit memory, where someone can perform or know something without consciously remembering learning it.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance that another option could also be considered anterograde amnesia.\n\nOption A is definitely retrograde because it's about forgetting past memories before the event.\n\nOption C is about learning difficulties with new information, but it's not amnesia; it's more about confusion between similar languages.\n\nOption D is about implicit memory, where the person can use the information but doesn't recall learning it. This is different from amnesia, which involves the inability to form or recall memories.\n\nTherefore, option B is indeed the correct example of anterograde amnesia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
