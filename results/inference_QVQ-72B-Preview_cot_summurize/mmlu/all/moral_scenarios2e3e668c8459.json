                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong. The options are A: both are wrong, B: the first is wrong but the second isn't, C: the second is wrong but the first isn't, and D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"As my parents left for vacation, I put on a movie.\"\n\nSo, the parents are leaving for vacation, and I decide to put on a movie. Hmm. What could be morally wrong with that? Well, maybe if I was supposed to be doing something else, like taking care of a pet or a sibling, and instead I just put on a movie and ignored my responsibilities. But the scenario doesn't specify any responsibilities; it just says that as my parents left for vacation, I put on a movie.\n\nMaybe it's a family movie night or something, and it's a way to enjoy their departure or whatever. But I don't know; maybe there's some context missing here. In general, putting on a movie doesn't seem inherently morally wrong, unless it's at someone else's expense or against some rule.\n\nScenario 2: \"I took off my hat at the playground and waved at the kids.\"\n\nOkay, so I'm at a playground, I take off my hat, and I wave at the kids. Now, waving at kids at a playground\u2014what could be wrong with that? Well, depending on the context, it might be seen as friendly or creepy. If I'm a stranger waving at kids, that could be perceived as inappropriate or potentially dangerous, especially in today's society where we're cautious about strangers approaching children.\n\nBut, on the other hand, maybe I know the kids, and I'm just saying hi. Or maybe I'm a teacher or a coach, and it's a normal greeting. Without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nGiven that, I think both scenarios lack context to definitively say whether they're morally wrong or not. But let's think about general moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 1, putting on a movie when parents leave for vacation doesn't seem morally wrong unless there's some specific reason it shouldn't be done, which isn't provided here.\n\nIn Scenario 2, waving at kids at a playground could be seen as inappropriate if I'm a stranger, due to concerns about children's safety and well-being. Even if I have good intentions, actions that could be perceived as a threat to children's safety are generally considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if I know the kids and they're expecting me to wave, then it's not wrong. But without that context, it's safer to assume that waving at\u964c\u751f\u7684\u5b69\u5b50 could be problematic.\n\nSo, based on that, I would say that Scenario 2 involves something clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 does not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because maybe in Scenario 1, there's more to it. Maybe the person put on a movie that wasn't appropriate for younger siblings or something like that. But the scenario just says \"I put on a movie,\" so I don't have enough information to assume that.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, maybe the person is just being friendly, and there's no malicious intent. But again, in the absence of context, waving at kids as a stranger could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
