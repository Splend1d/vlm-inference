                    "text": "So I have this question here about Captain Marvel. It's asking which of these options isn't one of Captain Marvel's abilities. The options are:\n\nA. The power of Apollo\n\nB. The strength of Hercules\n\nC. The courage of Achilles\n\nD. The wisdom of Solomon\n\nAlright, I need to recall what Captain Marvel's abilities are. I know that Captain Marvel is a superhero from DC Comics, and there have been multiple characters who have taken on that name. The most famous one is probably Shazam, who is sometimes referred to as Captain Marvel, especially in older comics.\n\nWait, actually, there's some confusion here. In DC Comics, the character originally called Captain Marvel was Shazam. He was a young boy named Billy Batson who could transform into a powerful superhero by saying the magic word \"Shazam!\" Each letter in Shazam represents the powers he receives from different mythological figures:\n\n- S: The wisdom of Solomon\n\n- H: The strength of Hercules\n\n- A: The stamina of Atlas\n\n- Z: The power of Zeus\n\n- A: The courage of Achilles\n\n- M: The speed of Mercury\n\nSo, based on this, option D, the wisdom of Solomon, is indeed one of Captain Marvel's abilities.\n\nOption B, the strength of Hercules, is also part of Captain Marvel's powers.\n\nOption C, the courage of Achilles, is another one of his abilities.\n\nThat leaves option A, the power of Apollo. Hmm, I don't recall Apollo being part of the Shazam acronym. Let me double-check.\n\nThe standard Shazam powers are:\n\n- Wisdom of Solomon\n\n- Strength of Hercules\n\n- Stamina of Atlas\n\n- Power of Zeus\n\n- Courage of Achilles\n\n- Speed of Mercury\n\nSo, Apollo isn't listed here. Therefore, the power of Apollo is not one of Captain Marvel's abilities.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about other possible references. Apollo is the Greek god of the sun, medicine, and poetry, among other things. He's often associated with archery and music as well. In DC Comics, Apollo has been depicted in various ways, sometimes as a god-like being or as a character in his own right.\n\nHowever, in the context of Captain Marvel/Shazam, the powers come specifically from the gods represented in the Shazam acronym: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. Apollo isn't part of that group.\n\nSo, based on this information, option A, the power of Apollo, is not one of Captain Marvel's abilities.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe there's some confusion with another character or another version of Captain Marvel. For instance, in Marvel Comics, there is a character named Captain Marvel, but that's a different character with different powers, mostly related to cosmic energy and flight.\n\nBut the question specifies \"superhero Captain Marvel's abilities,\" and given that there are multiple characters across different comic book companies with that name, I think the intended reference here is to the DC Comics character, Shazam, who was originally called Captain Marvel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. The power of Apollo.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
