                    "text": "So I came across this question: \"What is the meaning of the Punjabi word 'Sikh'?\" and the options are A. Disciple, B. Faithful, C. Devotee, D. Enlightened. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm not entirely sure about the exact meaning of \"Sikh\" in English, but I think it has something to do with being a follower of Sikhism. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that Sikhism is a religion that originated in the Punjab region of India, and it was founded by Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the 15th century. The followers of this religion are called Sikhs. But what does the word \"Sikh\" literally mean?\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. Disciple: A disciple is someone who learns from a teacher or follows a particular philosophy or religion. This seems plausible because Sikhs follow the teachings of the Gurus.\n\nB. Faithful: This generally refers to someone who is loyal or trusting, often in a religious context. While Sikhs are faithful to their religion, this might be too broad.\n\nC. Devotee: A devotee is someone who is deeply dedicated to a particular cause or person, often religious. Again, this could apply to Sikhs, but it feels a bit generic.\n\nD. Enlightened: This suggests someone who has achieved a higher state of knowledge or understanding, possibly referring to spiritual enlightenment. While Sikhism emphasizes spiritual growth, calling every Sikh \"enlightened\" might not be accurate.\n\nI need to find the most accurate translation or the primary meaning of \"Sikh\" in English.\n\nMaybe I should look at the structure of the word. \"Sikh\" comes from the Punjabi language, and in Punjabi, \"sikh\" can mean \"disciple\" or \"learner.\" This makes sense because Sikhs are followers of the teachings of the Gurus, and as such, they are learners or disciples of these teachings.\n\nAdditionally, in Sikhism, the concept of being a Sikh involves committing to the principles and practices taught by the Gurus, which again aligns with the idea of being a disciple.\n\nLet me see if there's any other perspective I should consider. For instance, does \"Sikh\" have any specific connotation in Punjabi that might not be captured by just \"disciple\"?\n\nIn Punjabi, the word \"sikh\" can also imply someone who is educated or learned, but again, that seems closely related to being a disciple who learns and follows the teachings.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the initiation ceremony in Sikhism, which is called Amrit Sanskar. During this ceremony, Sikhs who have been initiated are called \"Amritdharis\" and are considered baptized Sikhs. Does this ceremony add any specific meaning to the term \"Sikh\"?\n\nWell, the Amrit Sanskar is a significant step in a Sikh's spiritual journey, where they make a commitment to follow the Sikh way of life. So, it reinforces the idea of being a disciple who not only learns but also practices the teachings.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the Sikh script, Gurmukhi. The word \"Gurmukhi\" literally means \"from the Guru's mouth,\" and it's the script used to write the Punjabi language in Sikh scriptures. Does this provide any clue about the meaning of \"Sikh\"?\n\nNot directly, but it does emphasize the importance of the Guru's teachings in Sikhism, which again points towards the idea that a Sikh is someone who follows these teachings.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the Sikh scriptures for insight. The primary scripture is the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the holy book of Sikhism. It's written in various languages, including Punjabi, and contains the teachings of the Gurus.\n\nIf I look into the Guru Granth Sahib, I might find definitions or explanations of what a Sikh is. However, since I don't have access to it right now, maybe I can recall some basic teachings.\n\nI remember that Sikhism emphasizes the importance of bhakti (devotion), karma (action), and gnana (knowledge). So, being a Sikh involves devotion to God, performing good actions, and seeking knowledge through the Guru's teachings.\n\nThis further supports the idea that a Sikh is a disciple who learns and follows the Guru's teachings.\n\nLet me consider if there's any difference between how \"Sikh\" is used in Punjabi and how it's understood in English. In Punjabi, \"Sikh\" refers to the follower of Sikhism, and in English, it's commonly translated as \"disciple.\"\n\nI think this translation is accurate and captures the essence of what a Sikh is\u2014someone who follows the path shown by the Gurus.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should check a dictionary definition. If I recall correctly, in dictionaries, \"Sikh\" is defined as a follower of Sikhism, which is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of Guru Nanak and nine other Gurus.\n\nBut that's more of a descriptive definition rather than explaining what the word itself means.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look into the etymology of the word \"Sikh.\" In Punjabi, \"sikh\" can be traced back to the Sanskrit word \"shishya,\" which means disciple or student. This seems to align perfectly with option A: disciple.\n\nMoreover, in many Indian languages, \"shishya\" is commonly used to refer to a disciple or a learner, especially in a spiritual context.\n\nGiven this etymological background, it makes sense that \"Sikh\" would mean \"disciple\" in English.\n\nLet me see if any of the other options could also be considered correct.\n\nOption B: faithful. While Sikhs are faithful to their religion, the term \"faithful\" can be applied to followers of any religion. It doesn't specifically capture the essence of being a Sikh.\n\nOption C: devotee. Similar to \"faithful,\" this term is quite broad and can apply to anyone who is devoted to a particular cause or belief. It doesn't convey the specific idea of following the Guru's teachings.\n\nOption D: enlightened. In Sikhism, enlightenment is a spiritual goal, achieved through living a moral life and meditating on God. However, not every Sikh has necessarily reached the state of enlightenment. So, defining all Sikhs as \"enlightened\" wouldn't be accurate.\n\nTherefore, based on my reasoning, I conclude that the most accurate meaning of the Punjabi word \"Sikh\" is \"disciple.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
