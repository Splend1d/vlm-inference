                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. There's a debtor who owes $750 to a creditor, but by July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. That means the creditor couldn't sue to collect the debt because the time period allowed for collecting it had expired. So, basically, the debt is unenforceable in court.\n\nThen, on August 1, the debtor overhears the creditor calling him a deadbeat who welches on his debts. Feeling guilty, the debtor approaches the creditor and orally agrees to pay the $750 on September 1. But when September 1 rolls around, the debtor doesn't pay up. Now, the creditor wants to sue to recover the $750.\n\nThe question is asking which option provides the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise is unenforceable. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. It was not supported by new consideration.\n\nI know that in contract law, consideration is essential for a contract to be enforceable. Consideration is something of value exchanged between the parties. Here, the original debt was already barred by the statute of limitations, so the creditor no longer has a legal right to enforce it. If the debtor voluntarily promises to pay it anyway, is there new consideration from the creditor? Maybe not, because the creditor wasn't giving up anything new or different. So, perhaps the promise lacks new consideration.\n\nB. It was violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nThe statute of frauds generally requires that certain contracts be in writing to be enforceable. These usually include contracts for the sale of land, contracts that can't be performed within one year, and promises to answer for the debt of another. In this case, the debtor is promising to pay his own debt, so it's not exactly promising to answer for someone else's debt. Plus, it's an oral agreement, so if the statute of frauds applies, it might not be enforceable. But I need to check if the statute of frauds applies here.\n\nC. The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nThis is true, but does that directly make the new oral promise unenforceable? The debt is unenforceable because of the statute of limitations, but if the debtor voluntarily promises to pay it anyway, can't the creditor enforce that promise? I think there's more to it.\n\nD. There was no mutuality of obligation.\n\nMutuality of obligation means that both parties are bound by the contract. In this case, the debtor is promising to pay, but is there any promise or obligation from the creditor in return? Maybe not directly. The creditor is just receiving a payment, not giving anything in exchange. So, perhaps there's no mutuality of obligation here.\n\nLet me think about this again. The original debt is barred by the statute of limitations, so the creditor can't enforce it through legal means. But the debtor, feeling guilty, orally promises to pay it anyway. Now, oral contracts are generally enforceable, but there are exceptions.\n\nOption A suggests that there's no new consideration. In contract law, a promise to perform an existing duty doesn't constitute new consideration unless there's something additional. Here, the creditor wasn't giving up anything new; the debt was already owed, just unenforceable. So, perhaps the debtor's promise lacks new consideration, making it unenforceable.\n\nOption B mentions the statute of frauds. Generally, promises to pay the debt of another need to be in writing. But in this case, it's the debtor promising to pay their own debt, not someone else's. So, I'm not sure if the statute of frauds applies here. Maybe not directly.\n\nOption C points out that the debt is barred by the statute of limitations. While that's true, it doesn't directly make the new promise unenforceable. The debtor could still choose to pay voluntarily.\n\nOption D talks about mutuality of obligation. In this scenario, the debtor is promising to pay, and the creditor is promising to accept payment. Is there mutuality? It seems a bit one-sided because the creditor isn't promising anything specific in return, other than perhaps not calling the debtor a deadbeat anymore, but that wasn't part of the agreement. So, maybe there's an argument there.\n\nBut I think the strongest ground is Option A: lack of new consideration. The debtor is simply promising to do what was already legally unenforceable, without any new benefit to the creditor or detriment to themselves beyond what was already owed.\n\nLet me check some case law or legal principles to confirm. I recall that in some jurisdictions, when a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, a new promise to pay it must be supported by new consideration to be enforceable. Otherwise, it's just a promise to perform an existing duty, which isn't sufficient.\n\nAlso, the statute of frauds might come into play if the promise falls under its purview, but as I thought earlier, it's primarily about promises to pay the debts of others or contracts that can't be performed within one year. Since this is the debtor promising to pay their own debt, it might not qualify.\n\nMutuality of obligation is more about whether both parties are bound by the terms of the contract. Here, the debtor is bound to pay, but the creditor is essentially just receiving payment. There might not be a reciprocal promise from the creditor, but in some cases, accepting a payment can be considered sufficient consideration.\n\nHowever, considering all this, I still think that the lack of new consideration is the strongest ground to argue that the promise is unenforceable.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there is new consideration. The creditor is giving up the right to call the debtor a deadbeat in the future, or perhaps refraining from pursuing the debt further. But the scenario doesn't specify any such agreement. The debtor approached the creditor and offered to pay out of guilt, without any condition from the creditor.\n\nSo, unless there's an implicit understanding that the creditor won't pursue the debt anymore, which isn't stated, there's no new consideration from the creditor.\n\nTherefore, I believe Option A is the correct answer: the promise was not supported by new consideration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
