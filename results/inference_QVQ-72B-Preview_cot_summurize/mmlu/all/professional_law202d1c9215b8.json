Of a dwelling, of another\n\nC. During the daytime\n\nD. With the intent to commit a felony therein.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what common law burglary is. I remember that burglary is traditionally about entering someone else's house with the intent to commit a crime inside. But let's make sure I understand each option.\n\nOption A: A breaking and entry. I think this refers to the act of forcing one's way into a property. In common law, burglary required some sort of breaking, like breaking a window or unlocking a door without permission. So, this seems like a key part of burglary.\n\nOption B: Of a dwelling, of another. This suggests that the place being burglarized needs to be someone else's dwelling, or home. Common law typically focused on dwellings because they were considered private and protected spaces. So, this also seems relevant.\n\nOption C: During the daytime. This one makes me pause. I always thought burglary was more associated with night-time activities, like breaking into houses at night when people are asleep. But is it specifically required to be during the daytime? That seems counterintuitive.\n\nOption D: With the intent to commit a felony therein. This refers to the mental state of the person breaking in\u2014they must intend to commit a serious crime inside, like theft or assault. Intent is crucial in criminal law, so this seems important.\n\nGiven that, I'm a bit confused about option C. Let me do a quick search to confirm when common law burglary was thought to occur.\n\nAlright, from what I can recall, common law burglary was defined as the breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another, with intent to commit a felony therein, typically at night. Wait, so it's actually during the nighttime, not the daytime.\n\nSo, option C says \"during the daytime.\" But according to common law definition, burglary was traditionally a night-time offense. Does that mean that burglary at common law did not include daytime break-ins?\n\nLet me check that. In common law, burglary was indeed defined as an offense that occurred during the night, not during the day. The requirement was that it had to be after sunset and before sunrise.\n\nTherefore, option C, \"during the daytime,\" would not be an element of common law burglary because burglary was specifically a night-time crime under common law.\n\nWait a minute, but modern burglary statutes often don't distinguish between day and night. They just require unauthorized entry with intent to commit a crime. But according to common law, it was essential that the breaking and entering occurred at night.\n\nSo, to answer the question, which of the following is not an element of common law burglary, it would be option C: during the daytime.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A: A breaking and entry \u2013 yes, that's a key element.\n\n- Option B: Of a dwelling, of another \u2013 yes, it has to be someone else's dwelling.\n\n- Option C: During the daytime \u2013 no, it should be at night.\n\n- Option D: With the intent to commit a felony therein \u2013 yes, intent is required.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
