                    "text": "So I've got this contract situation between a homeowner and a painter. They signed a written contract on March 1 for the painter to paint the exterior of the house for $3,000. But before signing, they orally agreed that the contract would be null and void unless the homeowner could get a $3,000 loan from National Bank by April 1. So, the homeowner applies for the loan, and on March 31, they find out the loan application was rejected. The next day, the homeowner calls the painter and says the deal is off.\n\nNow, the painter wants to sue the homeowner for breach of contract. The question is, can the homeowner use the fact that they couldn't secure the loan as a defense?\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a written contract saying the painter will paint the house for $3,000. But there's also an oral agreement that says this contract is null and void unless the homeowner gets a $3,000 loan from National Bank by April 1.\n\nSo, the written contract says the painter will paint for $3,000, but the oral agreement says that's only if the homeowner gets the loan. If the homeowner doesn't get the loan, the contract is null and void.\n\nThe painter is going to sue for breach of contract, meaning the painter thinks the homeowner is obligated to pay $3,000 for the painting job, but the homeowner is saying, \"No, because I didn't get the loan, so the contract is off.\"\n\nThe homeowner's defense is that the loan was a condition that needed to be met for the contract to be valid. Since the loan wasn't approved, the contract never came into existence.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because the homeowner is estopped to deny the validity of the written contract.\n\nHmm, estoppel generally means that if someone has relied on a representation and changed their position based on that representation, the other party can't go back on it. But in this case, the homeowner is relying on the oral agreement that the contract is null if the loan isn't approved. I'm not sure if estoppel applies here directly.\n\nB. No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.\n\nThis seems interesting. The written contract says the painter will paint for $3,000, but the oral agreement adds a condition that the contract is null without the loan. So, is this oral agreement a variation of the written contract? Generally, written contracts are favored, and oral variations might not be enforceable. But there's also the parol evidence rule, which says that oral agreements can't contradict the written contract. However, in this case, the oral agreement isn't contradicting the written contract; it's adding a condition that the contract is null without the loan.\n\nC. Yes, because the agreement regarding the loan constituted a valid modification of the writing.\n\nModification of a contract usually requires mutual consent and consideration. Here, the oral agreement was made before the written contract was signed, so it's not really a modification but part of the original agreement. So, maybe this isn't the best way to look at it.\n\nD. Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n\nThis seems plausible. A condition precedent is something that must happen before a contract becomes binding. So, if the loan approval was a condition precedent, then until that condition is met, the contract doesn't come into existence. Since the loan wasn't approved, the contract never became binding, and thus there's no breach of contract.\n\nBut wait, the written contract was already signed on March 1, before the loan decision was known. So, did the contract exist provisionally, subject to the loan being approved?\n\nI think that's the case here. The parties agreed that the contract would only be binding if the homeowner obtained the loan by April 1. So, the contract was conditional, with the loan approval being the condition that had to be satisfied for the contract to be enforceable.\n\nNow, since the loan wasn't approved by March 31, the condition wasn't met, and therefore the contract never became binding. So, when the homeowner called on April 1 to say the deal was off, that was consistent with the original agreement.\n\nTherefore, if the painter sues for breach of contract, the homeowner can argue that there was no valid contract because the condition precedent\u2014the loan approval\u2014wasn't satisfied.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the homeowner's defense should be valid.\n\nBut let's look back at the options:\n\nA. No, because the homeowner is estopped to deny the validity of the written contract.\n\nI don't think estoppel applies here because the homeowner is relying on the oral agreement, which was part of the original agreement, not something added later that the painter relied on.\n\nB. No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.\n\nWell, the written contract says the painter will paint for $3,000, and the oral agreement says that's only if the loan is approved. It's not really varying the terms; it's adding a condition for the contract's existence.\n\nC. Yes, because the agreement regarding the loan constituted a valid modification of the writing.\n\nAgain, this seems like it's part of the original agreement, not a modification after the fact.\n\nD. Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n\nThis seems the most accurate. The loan approval was a condition that had to be met for the contract to become binding. Since it wasn't met, there was no valid contract, and thus no breach.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\nYes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
