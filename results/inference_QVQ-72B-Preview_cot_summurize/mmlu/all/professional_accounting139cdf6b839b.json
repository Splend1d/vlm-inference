                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these procedures an accountant is least likely to perform during a review engagement of a nonissuer's financial statements. The options are:\n\nA. Making inquiries of management about actions taken at board of directors' meetings.\n\nB. Studying the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns.\n\nC. Identifying internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements.\n\nD. Comparing the financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a review engagement entails for a nonissuer. Nonissuers are companies that don't have securities registered with the SEC or that aren't required to file periodic reports with the SEC. A review engagement is less extensive than an audit but more involved than a compilation. It's aimed at providing limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Making inquiries of management about actions taken at board of directors' meetings.\n\nI know that during a review engagement, accountants do inquire of management about various matters, including significant events or transactions that could affect the financial statements. Actions taken at board meetings might include decisions that impact the financial statements, like declaring dividends, approving significant expenditures, or changes in accounting policies. So, it seems relevant for the accountant to inquire about such actions.\n\nB. Studying the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns.\n\nThis sounds like analytical procedures, which are commonly performed in review engagements. Analytical procedures involve looking at ratios, trends, and relationships to see if they make sense and are consistent with expectations. This is a key part of a review engagement to identify areas that may require further investigation.\n\nC. Identifying internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements.\n\nNow, this is where I need to be careful. In a review engagement, the extent of testing internal controls is limited compared to an audit. During an audit, a detailed understanding and testing of internal controls are necessary because the auditor relies on them to some degree. However, in a review engagement, the accountant is not required to obtain an understanding of internal controls beyond that necessary to plan the review and to determine the nature, timing, and extent of review procedures.\n\nSo, while some consideration of internal controls is involved in a review, the primary focus isn't on identifying specific control activities that prevent or detect material misstatements. That sounds more like what's done in an audit.\n\nD. Comparing the financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts.\n\nThis is another analytical procedure that's typically performed in a review engagement. By comparing actual results with budgets or forecasts, the accountant can identify variances that may indicate potential issues or areas that need further explanation from management.\n\nPutting it all together, option C seems to be the least likely procedure an accountant would perform during a review engagement of a nonissuer's financial statements because detailed assessment of internal controls is more aligned with audit procedures rather than review procedures.\n\nTo double-check, I'll look back at the AICPA's standards for reviews of financial statements for nonissuers. According to Statement on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS), specifically SSARS No. 21, Review of Financial Statements, the accountant is required to:\n\n- Inquire of management about events or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n- Perform analytical procedures, which include comparing financial data with information from prior periods, budgets, or forecasts.\n\n- Consider whether the financial statements are presented in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.\n\nBut there's no requirement to obtain an understanding of internal controls beyond what's necessary to plan the review and determine the nature, timing, and extent of review procedures.\n\nTherefore, identifying specific internal control activities that prevent or detect material misstatements is indeed more associated with an audit than with a review engagement.\n\nSo, my answer is C. Identify internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
