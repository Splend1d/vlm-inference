                    "text": "So I have this problem here: 365 + 56. I need to find the exact answer, and there are some options provided: A. 300, B. 309, C. 311, D. 421. Hmm, let me see.\n\nFirst off, I know that addition is just combining numbers together to get their total sum. So, 365 plus 56 should be straightforward. But let me make sure I do it correctly.\n\nI can start by adding the units place. 5 plus 6 is 11. So, that means I have 11 in the units place, which means I should carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\nNext, in the tens place, it's 6 plus 5. Wait, no, actually, it's 365, so the tens place is 6, and 56 has 5 in the tens place. So, 6 plus 5 is 11, plus the carried over 1 from before, which makes 12. So, I write down the 2 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nNow, in the hundreds place, it's 3 plus 0, which is 3, plus the carried over 1, making it 4. So, the hundreds place is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, I have 4 in the hundreds, 2 in the tens, and 1 in the units place. That should be 421.\n\nLet me double-check that. 365 plus 56. If I think about it in terms of money, like $365 plus $56. Well, 300 plus 50 is 350, and then 65 plus 6 is 71, so 350 plus 71 is 421. Yeah, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard algorithm again. Starting from the right:\n\n5 + 6 = 11. Write down 11.\n\nThen, 6 + 5 = 11, plus the carried 1 is 12. Write down 12.\n\nThen, 3 + 0 + 1 = 4. Write down 4.\n\nSo, the sum is 421.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options, A is 300, B is 309, C is 311, and D is 421. So, according to my calculations, D. 421 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other way to approach this, maybe to confirm further. Perhaps I can use the concept of breaking apart the numbers.\n\nSo, 365 is the same as 300 + 60 + 5, and 56 is the same as 50 + 6.\n\nAdding them together: 300 + 50 = 350, and 60 + 50 = 110, and 5 + 6 = 11. So, 350 + 110 + 11.\n\n350 + 110 is 460, and 460 + 11 is 471. Wait, that doesn't match my previous result of 421. Hmm, that's strange.\n\nLet me check where I went wrong. Oh, I see. When I broke apart 365 into 300 + 60 + 5 and 56 into 50 + 6, and then added 300 + 50 to get 350, and 60 + 50 to get 110, and 5 + 6 to get 11, and then added those together: 350 + 110 is 460, plus 11 is 471.\n\nBut earlier, using the standard addition method, I got 421. There's a discrepancy here. Both methods should give the same result, so something is wrong.\n\nLet me re-examine the breaking apart method. Maybe I should add the parts differently.\n\n300 + 50 = 350\n\n60 + 50 = 110\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nNow, adding 350 + 110 + 11 equals 471.\n\nBut according to the standard method, it's 421. There's a difference of 50. That's odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in breaking apart the numbers. Let's try a different way.\n\nLet's think of 365 as 300 + 65, and 56 as 50 + 6.\n\nNow, add 300 + 50 = 350\n\nThen, 65 + 6 = 71\n\nNow, 350 + 71 equals 421.\n\nAh, that matches the standard addition method. So, it seems like the first way I tried to break apart the numbers led to an incorrect sum.\n\nSo, to ensure accuracy, I should stick with the standard addition method or this alternative breaking apart method where I add 300 + 50 and then 65 + 6, totaling 421.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 421.\n\nI think the initial confusion came from incorrectly adding the parts when breaking them down. It's important to make sure that when breaking numbers apart, I add the corresponding places correctly.\n\nTo further confirm, I can use counting. Starting from 365 and adding 56.\n\nFirst, add 50 to 365, which gives 415. Then, add the remaining 6 to 415, which gives 421.\n\nPerfect, that matches the previous results. So, now I'm confident that 421 is the correct sum of 365 and 56.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can also perform the addition using the number line concept. Imagine a number line starting at 365.\n\nAdding 56 would mean moving 56 units to the right on the number line.\n\nFirst, add 50 to 365, moving to 415.\n\nThen, add the remaining 6, moving to 421.\n\nAgain, this confirms the answer is 421.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to approach this addition problem, and all point to the same answer: 421.\n\nSo, the exact answer is D. 421.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 421} \\]"
