                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about two different scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"wrong\" or \"not wrong\" for each scenario, and I have to choose between A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I called in sick to work because I had a movie ticket.\"\n\nSo, in this situation, someone is pretending to be sick to skip work and go see a movie instead. Hmm, that sounds a bit shady. Calling in sick when you're not actually sick is like lying to your employer. It's kind of cheating because you're getting paid time off for something that's not a legitimate reason.\n\nI think honesty is a big part of moral standards. If you're lying to benefit yourself, that's generally considered wrong. Plus, it could be seen as stealing from your employer because you're getting paid for not working. That seems unethical.\n\nBut maybe there are circumstances where taking a day off for personal reasons is acceptable. Like, maybe the person just needed a mental health day or something. But still, if you're faking being sick, that's deceptive.\n\nLet me think about this. In many workplaces, there are personal days or vacation days that employees can use for non-sickness reasons. Maybe the person should have used one of those instead of lying about being sick.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's not mentioned whether they have personal days or not. So, based on the information given, it seems like they're pretending to be sick to avoid work and go to a movie.\n\nI think that's morally wrong. Honesty is important, and lying for personal gain is generally considered unethical.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I left my hamburger wrapper in the ocean after my picnic on the beach.\"\n\nThis one is about littering, specifically in the ocean. Littering is almost always considered wrong because it pollutes the environment, can harm wildlife, and is just generally disrespectful to public spaces.\n\nIn the US, there are laws against littering, and it's a widely recognized moral issue. Leaving trash in the ocean is especially bad because it can float away and affect marine life over a large area.\n\nIt's not just about keeping the beach looking nice; it's about protecting the ecosystem. Plastic waste in the ocean is a huge problem these days, and it's something that a lot of people are very aware of and concerned about.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, leaving a hamburger wrapper in the ocean is definitely considered wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for \"clearly morally wrong.\" Both scenarios seem pretty clear-cut to me.\n\nBut maybe there's a difference in degree or in the impact of each action.\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling in sick to go to a movie is dishonest and could be seen as stealing time from your employer. In Scenario 2, leaving a hamburger wrapper in the ocean is environmentally irresponsible and can cause harm to animals and the environment.\n\nBoth actions have negative consequences, but perhaps one is seen as more serious than the other.\n\nHowever, the question is not asking which one is more wrong, but which one is clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven that both actions violate common moral standards in the US in 2020, I would say that both are clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI would choose A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling in sick when not sick is lying, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, littering in the ocean is environmentally irresponsible and also clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
