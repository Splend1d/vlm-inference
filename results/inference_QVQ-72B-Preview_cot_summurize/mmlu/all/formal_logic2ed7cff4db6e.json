                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic problem step by step. So, I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the argument. It has three premises:\n\n1. M \u2228 N (M or N)\n\n2. ~M \u00b7 O (not M and O)\n\nAnd the conclusion is:\n\nN\n\nSo, the argument is:\n\nPremise 1: M \u2228 N\n\nPremise 2: ~M \u00b7 O\n\nConclusion: N\n\nI need to see if whenever both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If there's at least one case where both premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid, and that case is a counterexample.\n\nAlright, let's list out all possible truth values for M, N, and O since they're all independent variables.\n\nThe variables are M, N, and O, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of truth values.\n\nLet's make a table with all possible combinations:\n\n| M | N | O | Premise 1: M \u2228 N | Premise 2: ~M \u00b7 O | Conclusion: N |\n\n|---|---|---|------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n\n| T | T | T | T \u2228 T = T | ~T \u00b7 T = F \u00b7 T = F | T |\n\n| T | T | F | T \u2228 T = T | ~T \u00b7 F = F \u00b7 F = F | T |\n\n| T | F | T | T \u2228 F = T | ~T \u00b7 T = F \u00b7 T = F | F |\n\n| T | F | F | T \u2228 F = T | ~T \u00b7 F = F \u00b7 F = F | F |\n\n| F | T | T | F \u2228 T = T | ~F \u00b7 T = T \u00b7 T = T | T |\n\n| F | T | F | F \u2228 T = T | ~F \u00b7 F = T \u00b7 F = F | T |\n\n| F | F | T | F \u2228 F = F | ~F \u00b7 T = T \u00b7 T = T | F |\n\n| F | F | F | F \u2228 F = F | ~F \u00b7 F = T \u00b7 F = F | F |\n\nNow, I need to identify rows where both premises are true. Then, check if the conclusion is also true in those rows. If not, the argument is invalid, and the row is a counterexample.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F, Conclusion = T \u2192 Not both premises true.\n\n- Row 2: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F, Conclusion = T \u2192 Not both premises true.\n\n- Row 3: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F, Conclusion = F \u2192 Not both premises true.\n\n- Row 4: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F, Conclusion = F \u2192 Not both premises true.\n\n- Row 5: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = T, Conclusion = T \u2192 Both premises true and conclusion true.\n\n- Row 6: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F, Conclusion = T \u2192 Not both premises true.\n\n- Row 7: Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = T, Conclusion = F \u2192 Both premises true but conclusion false.\n\n- Row 8: Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = F, Conclusion = F \u2192 Not both premises true.\n\nSo, in Row 5, both premises are true and the conclusion is true.\n\nIn Row 7, both premises are true but the conclusion is false. This is a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nNow, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options.\n\nOption B says: Invalid. Counterexample when M is true and O and N are false.\n\nLooking back at the table, which row has M = T, O = F, N = F?\n\nLooking at Row 3: M = T, N = F, O = T \u2192 M = T, O = T, N = F \u2192 doesn't match.\n\nRow 4: M = T, N = F, O = F \u2192 matches. In this row, Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F, Conclusion = F \u2192 Not both premises true, so not a counterexample.\n\nOption C says: Invalid. Counterexample when O is true and M and N are false.\n\nLooking at the table, which row has O = T, M = F, N = F?\n\nRow 7: M = F, N = F, O = T \u2192 Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = T, Conclusion = F \u2192 Both premises are not both true (Premise 1 is F, Premise 2 is T) \u2192 Wait, Premise 2 is T, Premise 1 is F \u2192 Both premises are not both true? Wait, no, both premises need to be true for a counterexample.\n\nWait, in Row 7, Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = T \u2192 Not both premises true, so not a counterexample.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Row 7 is a counterexample because Premise 1 = F and Premise 2 = T, but actually, for a counterexample, both premises need to be true, but the conclusion is false.\n\nSo, in Row 7, Premise 1 is false, so it doesn't qualify as a counterexample because both premises aren't true.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, Row 7 has Premise 1 = F and Premise 2 = T, so not both premises are true.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's double-check the truth table.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Premise 1: M \u2228 N\n\n- Premise 2: ~M \u00b7 O\n\n- Conclusion: N\n\nIn Row 7: M = F, N = F, O = T\n\nThen:\n\n- Premise 1: F \u2228 F = F\n\n- Premise 2: ~F \u00b7 T = T \u00b7 T = T\n\n- Conclusion: F\n\nSo, Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = T \u2192 Not both premises true, so not a counterexample.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought both premises are true in Row 7, but actually Premise 1 is F, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps there is no row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nWait, let's check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 1: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F\n\n- Row 2: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F\n\n- Row 3: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F\n\n- Row 4: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F\n\n- Row 5: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = T, Conclusion = T\n\n- Row 6: Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F\n\n- Row 7: Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = T, Conclusion = F\n\n- Row 8: Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = F, Conclusion = F\n\nWait, in Row 7, Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = T \u2192 Not both premises true, so not a counterexample.\n\nSimilarly, in Row 5, both premises are true and conclusion is true.\n\nIn Row 4, Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F \u2192 Not both premises true.\n\nIn Row 6, Premise 1 = T, Premise 2 = F\n\nIn Row 8, Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = F\n\nSo, there is no row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Row 7 was a counterexample, but actually, in Row 7, Premise 1 is false, so it's not a valid counterexample.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the argument is valid.\n\nWait, but according to my initial analysis, in Row 5, both premises are true and conclusion is true, and in other rows, not both premises are true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought Row 7 was a counterexample, but it's not because Premise 1 is false.\n\nSo, perhaps the argument is valid.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose M = F, N = F, O = T\n\nThen:\n\n- Premise 1: F \u2228 F = F\n\n- Premise 2: ~F \u00b7 T = T \u00b7 T = T\n\n- Conclusion: F\n\nSo, Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = T \u2192 Not both premises true, so not a counterexample.\n\nSimilarly, in any other combination, if Premise 2 is true, Premise 1 might be false, or vice versa.\n\nWait, in Row 5, both premises are true and conclusion is true.\n\nIn other rows, not both premises are true.\n\nTherefore, there is no case where both premises are true and conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\nBut according to the options, there are claims of invalidity with specific counterexamples.\n\nOption A: Valid\n\nOption B: Invalid. Counterexample when M and O are true and N is false\n\nOption C: Invalid. Counterexample when M is true and O and N are false\n\nOption D: Invalid. Counterexample when O is true and M and N are false\n\nBut based on my analysis, the argument seems to be valid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Row 7.\n\nLet me re-examine Row 7:\n\nM = F, N = F, O = T\n\n- Premise 1: F \u2228 F = F\n\n- Premise 2: ~F \u00b7 T = T \u00b7 T = T\n\n- Conclusion: F\n\nSo, Premise 1 = F, Premise 2 = T \u2192 Not both premises true, so not a counterexample.\n\nSimilarly, in other rows, not both premises are true.\n\nTherefore, no counterexample exists, so the argument is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option A: Valid.\n\nBut the problem is that the options suggest invalidity with specific counterexamples, but based on the truth table, none of them actually present a case where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\nI think the confusion came from misinterpreting the truth values in some rows, but upon careful re-examination, it seems that the argument is indeed valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
