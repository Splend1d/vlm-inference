                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here: If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the number on the face of each die, what's the probability that the product is a composite number? The options are A. 485/486, B. 16/7776, C. 4/7776, D. 2/7776.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. So, basically, any number that's not 1, 2, 3, 5, etc., but in this case, since we're dealing with products, the smallest composite number is 4.\n\nSo, I need to find the probability that the product of the numbers on five dice is a composite number.\n\nNow, probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 6 faces, and there are 5 dice, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6^5, which is 7776. So, that's the denominator.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are when the product is a composite number. But sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be rolling a product that is not a composite number, which means the product is 1, since 1 is neither prime nor composite, and any product involving 2 or more dice would be at least 2, which is composite or prime, but since the question specifies composite, we need to exclude primes as well.\n\nWait, no. Actually, composite numbers are specifically non-prime numbers greater than 1. So, in the context of products of dice rolls, any product that is a prime number or greater than 1 but not prime would be composite. But in practice, since the smallest composite number is 4, and we're dealing with products of at least two numbers (since there are five dice), most products will be composite.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the probability that the product is not composite, i.e., it's 1, and subtract that from 1 to get the probability that the product is composite.\n\nSo, the only way the product is 1 is if every single die shows 1. Since each die is independent, the probability of rolling all ones is (1/6)^5, which is 1/7776.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product is not 1 is 1 - 1/7776 = 7775/7776.\n\nBut wait a minute, is that correct? Because looking at the options, none of them match 7775/7776. The closest is A. 485/486, which is 485/486 = (485*16)/(486*16) = 7760/7776, which is not 7775/7776.\n\nHmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me think again. The product of the dice rolls is composite. So, it's not 1, and it's not a prime number. But in the context of dice rolls, the smallest composite number is 4, and the possible products can be quite large since we're multiplying up to five dice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the product being composite versus not composite, where not composite includes 1 and any prime numbers.\n\nBut given that, and considering that the only way to get a product of 1 is to roll all ones, which has probability 1/7776, then the probability of not getting all ones is 7775/7776.\n\nHowever, among these 7775 outcomes where the product is not 1, some of them result in a prime number, and others are composite.\n\nWait, but in the context of dice rolls, what are the possible prime products?\n\nWell, the smallest prime is 2, which could be obtained by rolling, say, (1,1,1,1,2). Similarly, other primes like 3, 5 could be obtained with specific combinations.\n\nBut actually, since we're multiplying five dice, the smallest product is 1 (all ones), which is not composite, and the next smallest is 2 (four ones and a two), which is prime, and then 3 (four ones and a three), which is prime, and so on.\n\nSo, to find the probability that the product is composite, I need to find the total number of outcomes where the product is composite and divide by 7776.\n\nAlternatively, as I thought earlier, it might be easier to find the probability that the product is not composite (i.e., it's 1 or a prime number) and subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, first, find the probability that the product is 1, which is (1/6)^5 = 1/7776.\n\nThen, find the probability that the product is a prime number.\n\nFinally, subtract the sum of those probabilities from 1 to get the probability that the product is composite.\n\nBut calculating the probability that the product is a prime number seems complicated because there are many possible primes that can be obtained by multiplying five dice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider that a product is composite unless it's 1 or a prime number.\n\nBut since we're dealing with five dice, the product can be quite large, and determining whether it's prime or composite might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, but actually, in the context of dice rolls, the possible products are limited to the numbers you can get by multiplying numbers from 1 to 6 five times.\n\nSo, let's list out all possible products.\n\nFirst, the smallest product is 1 (all ones), which is neither prime nor composite.\n\nNext, the smallest prime product would be 2, obtained by, say, four ones and a two.\n\nSimilarly, 3 (four ones and a three), which is prime.\n\nThen, 4 (three ones, a two, and another two), which is composite.\n\nWait, but actually, to get a product of 4, you could have (1,1,1,2,2), since 2*2=4.\n\nSimilarly, 5 (four ones and a five), which is prime.\n\n6 (three ones, a two, and a three), since 2*3=6, which is composite.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, perhaps I can list all possible products and determine which ones are composite.\n\nBut with five dice, there are 7776 possible outcomes, and listing all possible products seems tedious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can think about the prime factorization of the product.\n\nEach die roll can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, which are 1, 2, 3, 2^2, 5, and 2*3 respectively.\n\nSo, the product of the dice rolls will be 2^{a} * 3^{b} * 5^{c}, where a, b, and c are the exponents based on the dice rolls.\n\nWait, but that might not be the most straightforward way.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI recall that a number is composite if it has factors other than 1 and itself.\n\nIn the context of dice rolls, the product will be composite unless it's 1 or a prime number.\n\nSo, perhaps it's easier to calculate the probability that the product is 1 or a prime number and subtract that from 1.\n\nWe already know that the probability of getting a product of 1 is 1/7776.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that the product is a prime number.\n\nTo do that, I need to find all possible products that are prime numbers.\n\nGiven that we're multiplying five dice, each die showing numbers from 1 to 6, the possible products range from 1 up to 6^5 = 7776.\n\nBut practically, the maximum product is 6^5 = 7776, but we're interested in products that are prime numbers.\n\nNow, what are the possible prime numbers that can be obtained by multiplying five dice?\n\nWell, the smallest prime is 2, which can be obtained by rolling four ones and one two.\n\nSimilarly, 3 can be obtained by four ones and one three.\n\n5 can be obtained by four ones and one five.\n\n7 would require a combination that multiplies to 7, but since the smallest die is 1, it's impossible because 1*1*1*1*7, but 7 is not on a die, so 7 is not possible.\n\nWait, no, dice only go up to 6, so the possible primes are 2, 3, 5, since higher primes can't be obtained by multiplying five dice with faces up to 6.\n\nWait, but actually, 7 can't be obtained because the smallest combination beyond four ones is four ones and a two, which is 2, or four ones and a three, which is 3, or four ones and a five, which is 5.\n\nAny higher primes like 7, 11, etc., can't be obtained because the product would exceed the possible combinations.\n\nWait, but 7 can be obtained if we have, say, (1,1,1,1,7), but dice don't have a 7, so indeed, 7 is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, 11, 13, etc., are also not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible prime products are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nSo, the probability that the product is a prime number is the probability that it's 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe already know that the probability of getting a product of 1 is (1/6)^5 = 1/7776.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of getting a product of 2.\n\nTo get a product of 2, we need four ones and one two.\n\nThe number of ways to choose which die shows the two is C(5,1) = 5.\n\nEach of these combinations has a probability of (1/6)^5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting a product of 2 is 5 * (1/6)^5.\n\nSimilarly, for a product of 3, we need four ones and one three.\n\nAgain, C(5,1) = 5 ways, each with probability (1/6)^5.\n\nSo, probability of product being 3 is also 5 * (1/6)^5.\n\nSimilarly, for a product of 5, four ones and one five.\n\nAgain, 5 * (1/6)^5.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of getting a product that is a prime number is:\n\nP(prime) = P(2) + P(3) + P(5) = 5*(1/6)^5 + 5*(1/6)^5 + 5*(1/6)^5 = 15*(1/6)^5 = 15/7776.\n\nNow, the probability that the product is 1 or a prime number is P(1) + P(prime) = 1/7776 + 15/7776 = 16/7776.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product is composite is 1 - P(1 or prime) = 1 - 16/7776 = 7776/7776 - 16/7776 = 7760/7776.\n\nSimplifying 7760/7776, we can divide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n7760 \u00f7 16 = 485\n\n7776 \u00f7 16 = 486\n\nSo, 7760/7776 = 485/486.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product is a composite number is 485/486.\n\nLooking back at the options, this corresponds to option A.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 485/486.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\
