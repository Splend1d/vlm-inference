There are three different boxes or stages that information passes through. The question is asking about the first place where memories are stored in this model.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. short-term memory\n\nB. eidetic memory\n\nC. semantic memory\n\nD. sensory memory\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with sensory memory: I think this is where information from our senses is initially processed. Like, when we see something, it's held in our visual sensory memory, and for sounds, it's auditory sensory memory. This storage is usually very brief, maybe just a fraction of a second.\n\nNext, short-term memory is where information is held temporarily while we decide what to do with it. It's like a workspace for thinking. This memory can hold a limited amount of information for about 20 seconds to a minute unless we actively rehearse it.\n\nEidetic memory sounds familiar; I think it's related to having a photographic memory. Some people can recall images or information in great detail after only seeing it once. But I'm not sure if this is a standard part of the information processing model.\n\nSemantic memory, on the other hand, seems to involve the meaning of words and concepts. It's part of our long-term memory, where we store knowledge and understanding about the world.\n\nNow, in the three-box model, I believe the stages are sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. So, information comes in through sensory memory, is processed in short-term memory, and if it's important, it's stored in long-term memory.\n\nGiven that, the first place where memories are stored would be sensory memory. But let's double-check.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\n1. Sensory Memory: This is the initial recording of sensory information in its original form. It's a very brief storage, and not all information here gets processed further.\n\n2. Short-Term Memory: Information that's attended to from sensory memory moves here. It's held for a short time and can be manipulated or rehearsed.\n\n3. Long-Term Memory: If information from short-term memory is deemed important, it's stored here permanently.\n\nSo, in this sequence, sensory memory is the first storage point for incoming information.\n\nBut wait, is eidetic memory part of this model? I don't think so. It seems more like a special type of memory that some people have, rather than a standard component of the information processing system.\n\nSemantic memory is part of long-term memory, so it comes after sensory and short-term memory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be sensory memory.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nMaybe the question is phrased in a way that makes it confusing. It says \"the first place where memories are stored,\" but perhaps in some contexts, memories are first stored elsewhere.\n\nFor example, in some models, there might be a temporary storage before sensory memory, but I don't think that's the case in the standard three-box model.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the encoding process, where information is converted into a form that can be stored in memory. But again, that happens during the sensory memory stage.\n\nI think the best answer is D. sensory memory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
