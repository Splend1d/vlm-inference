                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a store that advertised some items at a discount price, and there's a dispute over whether they have to sell a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684 item to the first person who showed up to buy it. The question is whether the man who was first will win or lose if he sues the store for refusing to sell him the necklace because it's supposedly intended for women only.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nature of the advertisement. The store published an ad in the newspaper offering certain items at specific discounted prices, with a clear statement like \"first come, first served.\" That suggests that the items are available to whoever arrives first on the specified date, which was Saturday, March 17.\n\nNow, the man was the first to arrive and demanded the necklace, but the clerk refused based on a \"house rule\" that the necklace is intended for women only. So, the core issue here is whether the advertisement constitutes a binding offer that the store is obligated to honor, or if it's just an invitation to treat, which would give the store more discretion in who they sell the item to.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Lose, because the advertisement was intended only as an invitation to make an offer.\n\nB. Lose, because the man did not notify the store in writing that he intended to accept the offer.\n\nC. Win, because the advertisement should be construed as a binding offer.\n\nD. Win, because it is immaterial whether the man was the first customer to appear at the store to purchase the necklace.\n\nI need to determine which of these is correct based on the information provided and general principles of contract law.\n\nStarting with option A: lose because the advertisement was only an invitation to make an offer. In contract law, an invitation to treat is when one party invites others to make an offer, and the\u9080\u8bf7\u4eba can choose whether to accept or not. However, in this case, the ad says \"first come, first served,\" which suggests that the store is committing to sell the item to the first person who arrives on the specified date. This sounds more like a specific offer with clear terms, not just an invitation to treat.\n\nOption B: lose because the man didn't notify the store in writing that he intended to accept the offer. There's no mention in the scenario that any written notification was required. The ad specifies \"first come, first served,\" so presumably, the acceptance is by being the first to show up on the designated day. Unless there's a specific requirement for written notice, which isn't stated here, this option seems unlikely.\n\nOption C: win because the advertisement should be construed as a binding offer. This seems plausible. If the ad specifies the item, the price, and the condition of \"first come, first served,\" it's reasonable to interpret that as a binding offer. The man was the first to arrive, so he should be entitled to purchase the necklace at the advertised price.\n\nOption D: win because it's immaterial whether he was the first customer. This contradicts the ad's clear statement of \"first come, first served.\" The whole point of the ad is that the items are available to the first person who shows up. So, if he was indeed the first, it should matter, and the store should be bound to sell it to him.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that option C is the correct answer. The advertisement should be construed as a binding offer, and the man, being the first to arrive, should be able to purchase the necklace at the advertised price. The store cannot refuse based on their \"house rule\" about who the necklace is intended for, as that rule isn't part of the advertised offer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any principle that allows the store to refuse sale based on the intended use or the gender of the buyer. Generally, in contract law, once an offer is made with clear terms and those terms are met, the offeror is bound to perform. Discriminating based on gender could also raise issues under anti-discrimination laws, but that's more about the legality of the refusal rather than the contract aspect.\n\nIn summary, the man should win because the advertisement constitutes a binding offer, and he met the conditions of being the first to arrive on the specified date.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
