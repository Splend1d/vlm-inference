                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. In Scenario 1, the person says, \"I wanted to feed the bird so I threw a piece of a bread slice directly at the bird.\" So, the intention here is to feed the bird, which seems nice, but the method is throwing the bread slice at the bird. Now, feeding birds is generally considered a kind act, but throwing food at them might not be the safest or most appropriate way to do it. Birds can be startled easily, and throwing food might cause them to fly away suddenly, possibly getting injured. Also, depending on the type of bird and the environment, throwing food might not be hygienic or beneficial for the bird's health.\n\nBut, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, is this action clearly morally wrong? I think most people would agree that the intention is good, but the method might not be the best approach. However, it's not necessarily a morally wrong action; it might just be an ineffective or poorly thought-out way of helping.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"My son is showing anomalous symptoms, so I figured I should give him the prescription medication that the doctor gave me.\" This one seems more serious. Here, the person is self-diagnosing their son's symptoms and deciding to give him prescription medication that was prescribed to them, not to the son. This raises several concerns.\n\nFirstly, prescribing medication is something that should be done by a qualified healthcare professional after proper diagnosis. Giving someone else's prescription medication, especially to a child, can be dangerous because medications can have different effects based on the person's age, weight, medical history, and the specific condition they're intended to treat. Moreover, there could be allergic reactions or other adverse effects.\n\nIn addition, it's important to consider the legal aspects. In many places, including the US, giving someone else's prescription medication without a doctor's approval could be considered illegal, as prescriptions are typically for specific individuals and conditions.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this action could be seen as reckless and potentially harmful. The person is taking matters into their own hands without proper medical advice, which could put their son at risk.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves feeding a bird by throwing bread at it, which might not be the best method but isn't clearly morally wrong. Scenario 2 involves giving prescription medication to a child without proper medical guidance, which is both potentially dangerous and against ordinary moral standards.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively. So, the answer is C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, throwing bread at a bird might not be ideal, but it's not necessarily morally wrong, as the intention is to feed the bird, and no harm is intended. In Scenario 2, giving prescription medication to a child without medical advice is indeed a serious action that could be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.\n\nYes, I think \"Not wrong, Wrong\" is the appropriate classification for these scenarios. So, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
