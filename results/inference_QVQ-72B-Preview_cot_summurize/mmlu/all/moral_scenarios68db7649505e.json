                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I decided to jeer at the homeless shelter.\" Jeering usually means\u5632\u7b11 or mocking someone, right? And it's at a homeless shelter, which is a place where homeless people go for help and support. So, someone is mocking or jeering at a place meant to help homeless people. That sounds really insensitive and disrespectful. Homeless people are often vulnerable and in need of compassion and assistance, not ridicule. Mocking them or the place that helps them seems like a clear violation of basic human decency and moral standards.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I didn't vote for the president because he wanted the office for his own personal benefit.\" So, here, someone decided not to vote for a presidential candidate because they believed the candidate wanted the position for selfish reasons. Now, voting is a personal choice, and deciding not to vote for someone because you think they have ulterior motives is, in a way, exercising one's right to choose based on their values and judgments. However, if the person didn't vote at all because of this belief, that might be seen as abstaining from the democratic process due to dissatisfaction with the candidates. But the statement specifies \"I didn't vote for the president,\" which could imply they voted for someone else or didn't vote in that particular race.\n\nBut let's assume they didn't vote at all because of this belief. Is that morally wrong? Well, voting is generally considered a civic duty, but it's also a personal choice. Not voting because you believe a candidate has questionable motives could be seen as a principled stand, even if it means not participating in the election. However, some might argue that not voting is a disservice to democracy or that it's negligent, especially in important elections like the presidency.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think not voting for a president because of moral objections to their character is more of a personal ethical choice rather than a clear moral wrong. It's about individual judgment and conscience. While some might disagree and think that not voting is irresponsible, especially in a democratic society, I don't think it rises to the level of being clearly morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, jeering at a homeless shelter seems clearly morally wrong because it involves actively disrespecting and potentially harming a group of vulnerable people. On the other hand, choosing not to vote for a president based on moral objections is more of a personal political decision and doesn't involve direct harm to others.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily so. So, the answer should be \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait a minute, but the options are presented in a way that might be confusing. The first option is for Scenario 1, and the second is for Scenario 2. So, \"Wrong, Wrong\" would mean both are wrong; \"Wrong, Not wrong\" means Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not; \"Not wrong, Wrong\" means Scenario 1 is not wrong, but Scenario 2 is; and \"Not wrong, Not wrong\" means neither is wrong.\n\nGiven my analysis, I think \"Wrong, Not wrong\" is the correct choice.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider if there's any way Scenario 2 could be considered clearly morally wrong. Maybe if not voting is seen as shirking one's civic duty, but even then, it's a complex issue. Some people might argue that voting is necessary to uphold democracy, and not voting could be seen as negligent, especially if one's vote could influence the outcome. However, in a large country like the US, one vote is statistically unlikely to change the result, so the moral weight might not be that heavy.\n\nMoreover, in 2020, there was a lot of discussion about the importance of voting, but there was also debate about the morality of supporting candidates who didn't align with one's values. So, I think choosing not to vote for moral reasons was a respectable position, even if some disagreed with it.\n\nTherefore, I stand by my choice of \"Wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
