                    "text": "So I'm looking at this case of a 37-year-old man with low back pain that started after working in his yard. It's been going on for three days and doesn't radiate anywhere else. He mentions that he had a similar episode three years ago that went away on its own. No changes in bowel or urination, which is good. His vital signs are all normal, and on exam, he has muscle spasm on both sides of his back, but his range of motion is limited because of the pain. The straight-leg raising test is negative, which I think is important.\n\nFirst off, I need to figure out what's causing his back pain. Given the recent physical activity and the muscle spasm, it sounds like he might have strained his back muscles or something along those lines. The fact that it's bilateral and there's muscle spasm suggests a muscular issue rather than something more serious like a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. Plus, the straight-leg raising test is negative, which usually rules out nerve root compression.\n\nHe had a similar episode before that resolved on its own, so maybe this is a recurrent issue for him, possibly related to overexertion.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the most appropriate next step in management, besides analgesia. So, he's already going to get some pain relief, and I need to decide what else to do.\n\nOption A is bed rest. I remember reading that bed rest isn't really recommended for back pain anymore. In fact, I think guidelines suggest that staying active is better for recovering from back pain. So, maybe bed rest isn't the best option.\n\nOption B is regular activity. That seems more in line with current recommendations. Keeping moving can help ease back pain and prevent it from getting worse.\n\nOption C is X-rays of the spine. Given that he's young, no red flags, and likely has a muscular issue, I don't think X-rays are necessary at this stage. X-rays are mostly for looking at bones, and if I suspect something like a fracture or arthritis, but in this case, it seems overkill.\n\nOption D is an MRI of the spine. MRIs are great for looking at soft tissues and discs, but again, in someone without any red flags or signs of neurological involvement, I don't think an MRI is warranted right now. They're also expensive and can sometimes show things that aren't causing symptoms, leading to unnecessary treatments.\n\nSo, between these options, I'm leaning towards regular activity. But let me think about it some more.\n\nI should consider the possibility of a herniated disc, but given that the pain doesn't radiate down his legs and the straight-leg raising test is negative, it's less likely. Also, his previous episode resolved on its own, which is typical for muscle strains.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the natural history of back pain. Most episodes of acute back pain will resolve on their own within a few weeks, especially if the person stays active and avoids heavy lifting or twisting.\n\nI should also think about medications. Since he's already getting analgesia, maybe over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or NSAIDs could help. But the question specifies \"in addition to analgesia,\" so I don't think prescribing specific medications is the answer here.\n\nPhysical therapy might be another option. Exercise and stretching can be beneficial for back pain, but again, the question is about the next step, and I think starting with advice on activity level is more immediate.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider educating him about proper lifting techniques and ergonomics, especially since his pain seems to be related to physical activity. That could be part of the management, but it's not one of the options.\n\nI should also consider the potential for chronic back pain if not managed correctly. Recurrent episodes could lead to longer-term issues, so it's important to address it properly now.\n\nLet me see if there are any guidelines on this. I recall that the American College of Physicians and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) both recommend staying active and avoiding bed rest for acute low back pain without radiculopathy.\n\nRadiculopathy would be if he had pain radiating down his leg, numbness, weakness, or changes in bowel or bladder function, which he doesn't have.\n\nSo, based on that, regular activity seems to be the way to go.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any red flags that would suggest a more serious underlying condition.\n\nHe's 37, which is relatively young. No fever, no weight loss, no night sweats, no history of cancer or osteoporosis. His vital signs are normal. The pain is mechanical, meaning it's worse with activity and better with rest, which is typical for muscular issues.\n\nThe fact that he had a similar episode that resolved spontaneously also points towards a benign condition.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate next step in management, besides analgesia, is to advise regular activity.\n\nI should also set expectations: explain that his pain is likely to improve over the next few weeks, especially with continued activity and perhaps some gentle stretching.\n\nIf his symptoms persist or get worse, especially if he develops any new symptoms like leg pain, numbness, or bladder issues, then I might consider further investigations like imaging or referring him to a specialist.\n\nBut for now, starting with regular activity seems like the best approach.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Regular activity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
