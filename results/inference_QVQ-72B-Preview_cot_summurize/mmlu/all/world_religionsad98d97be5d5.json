                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question about Jainism, specifically about the Digambara sect, which is one of the two main traditions in Jainism. The other is the Svetambara sect. Both have some differences in their practices and beliefs, especially regarding the ascetics and the nature of the Jinas, who are the enlightened beings in Jainism.\n\nSo, the question is asking about the distinctive beliefs or practices of the southerners, which I believe refers to the Digambara sect since they are more prominent in the southern parts of India. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. They worshipped exclusively outside of the temple.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit absolute. I know that Digambaras do have temples, like the famous ones in Sravanabelagola and Ranakpur. So, it's unlikely that they worship only outside temples. Maybe this is not correct.\n\nB. They believed that nakedness was an elemental expression of non-attachment.\n\nThis rings a bell. Digambara monks are known for practicing nudity as a sign of renunciation and non-attachment to material things. They believe that even the simplest clothing can be a source of attachment, so they choose to remain naked. This seems like a distinctive practice of theirs.\n\nC. They included women within the ranks of the leadership.\n\nI think both sects allow women to become nuns, but there might be differences in leadership positions. Let me think about this. In Digambara Jainism, I believe that women cannot become monks or attain moksha (liberation) in their current birth and must be reborn as men to achieve that. So, they might not have women in the highest leadership positions. I'm not entirely sure, so I'll need to verify this.\n\nD. They believed that the omniscient Jina must eat and sleep.\n\nThis seems interesting. Jinas are considered to have achieved perfect knowledge and enlightenment. In Digambara belief, once a Jina achieves kevala jnana (perfect knowledge), they do not engage in any bodily functions, including eating or sleeping. They remain in a state of perfect bliss and knowledge. So, this option seems contrary to what I know about Digambara beliefs.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most accurate. Digambara monks are indeed known for their practice of nudity as a expression of non-attachment, which is a key aspect of their asceticism.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. In Digambara Jainism, monks practice strict asceticism, including going without clothing, as they believe that any possession, even something as minimal as clothing, can lead to attachment and thereby hinder the path to liberation.\n\nAdditionally, Digambara monks do not carry any possessions, not even a bowl for alms, as they practice strict non-possession. They rely on the elements and the generosity of laypeople for their needs.\n\nSo, yes, this practice of nudity is a distinctive feature of the Digambara sect, setting them apart from the Svetambara monks, who wear white robes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. They believed that nakedness was an elemental expression of non-attachment.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly consider why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Digambaras do have temples and worship inside them, so this is false.\n\nC. While Digambara nuns exist, leadership positions are likely held by male monks due to the beliefs about attaining moksha.\n\nD. According to Digambara doctrine, Jinas are in a state beyond eating and sleeping, so this is also incorrect.\n\nHence, B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
