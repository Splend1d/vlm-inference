A witness for the defendant testified to the defendant's non-culpability at the grand jury proceeding. The witness was later called as a defense witness at the trial. During his direct examination, defendant's attorney asked him, \"Is it not true that the defendant could not have performed the abortion on the decedent since he was assisting you in another abortion at the time?\" The witness answers in the negative and states that the defendant did, in fact, perform the abortion on the girl. The defendant's attorney then assails the witness's testimony as a recent fabrication, and asks the witness if he had not stated to a grand jury that the defendant was not guilty of performing the abortion, thus causing the death of the girl.

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this legal scenario. There's a defendant who's being prosecuted for manslaughter in the first degree because he allegedly performed an abortion on a 15-year-old girl, which resulted in her death. The defense is trying to prove that he couldn't have done it because he was assisting another procedure at the same time.\n\nA witness for the defense testified at the grand jury proceeding that the defendant was not guilty. But then at the trial, when the defense attorney asks him a question about whether the defendant was assisting in another abortion at the time, the witness says no and admits that the defendant did perform the abortion on the girl.\n\nNow, the defense attorney is trying to impeach this witness by suggesting that his current testimony is a recent fabrication. He wants to ask the witness if he didn't previously tell the grand jury that the defendant was not guilty of performing the abortion.\n\nThe prosecutor is objecting to this question. And the trial judge has to decide whether this question is objectionable or not.\n\nI need to figure out which option is correct:\n\nA. Objectionable, because the defendant's attorney did not lay a proper foundation for impeaching his own witness.\n\nB. Objectionable, because a party may not impeach his own witness.\n\nC. Unobjectionable, because a witness's testimony before a grand jury is more reliable because it occurred shortly after the abortion was allegedly performed.\n\nD. Unobjectionable, because a party can impeach his own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what impeachment of a witness means. Impeachment is when you challenge the credibility of a witness's testimony. In this case, the defense attorney is trying to show that the witness's current statement is different from what he said before, specifically at the grand jury proceeding.\n\nNow, generally, a party can impeach their own witness under certain circumstances. So option B seems like it might be wrong because it states that a party may not impeach his own witness. I think there are situations where a party can impeach their own witness, especially if the witness changes their story during the trial.\n\nOption A says that the attorney didn't lay a proper foundation for impeaching his own witness. Laying a foundation usually involves establishing that the witness had the opportunity to observe or know about the events in question. Maybe the attorney needs to establish that the witness was present at the grand jury proceeding and that his previous testimony was under oath or something like that.\n\nOption C says that the grand jury testimony is more reliable because it occurred shortly after the abortion. I'm not sure about that. Just because something was said sooner doesn't automatically make it more reliable. There could be other factors at play, like the witness being under duress or having a different perspective at the time.\n\nOption D says that it's unobjectionable because a party can impeach his own witness by a prior inconsistent statement. This seems plausible. If the witness said one thing before and is now saying something different, the attorney can point out that inconsistency to challenge the witness's credibility.\n\nI need to recall some rules about impeaching your own witness. I think that generally, a party can impeach their own witness if the witness is hostile or if the witness's testimony is contrary to the party's expectations.\n\nIn this case, the witness seems to have given testimony that is harmful to the defense's case, since he now admits that the defendant performed the abortion, which contradicts the defense's earlier position that the defendant was assisting in another procedure at the time.\n\nSo, the defense attorney probably has a right to impeach his own witness if the witness is giving testimony that is adverse to the defense's position.\n\nTherefore, option B is likely incorrect because it asserts that a party may not impeach his own witness, which isn't always the case.\n\nOption A mentions laying a proper foundation. Maybe the attorney needs to establish that the grand jury testimony was indeed given by the witness and that it was under oath or similar circumstances. If the attorney hasn't done that yet, perhaps the judge would rule that a proper foundation hasn't been laid.\n\nHowever, in the scenario described, it doesn't say that the attorney hasn't laid a foundation; it just says that he's asking the question. So, perhaps the foundation has been laid already.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is the most accurate. A party can impeach his own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nOption C seems like a red herring because the reliability of the grand jury testimony isn't necessarily more or less than the trial testimony based solely on the timing.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. Unobjectionable, because a party can impeach his own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
