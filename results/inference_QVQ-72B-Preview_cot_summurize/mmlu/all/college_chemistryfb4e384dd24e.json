                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about mass spectrometry. There are three statements, and I need to figure out which ones are characteristic of mass spectrometry. The options are I, II, and III, and there are choices from A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what mass spectrometry is. I know that it's a technique used to identify different substances based on their mass-to-charge ratio. So, it involves converting molecules into ions and then separating them based on their mass and charge.\n\nLet's look at statement I: \"Analyte molecules are converted to gaseous ions.\" Does this happen in mass spectrometry? I think so. In mass spectrometry, the sample is usually introduced into the instrument and ionized. This ionization process turns the molecules into ions, which are then analyzed. So, this seems to be a characteristic of mass spectrometry.\n\nNow, statement II: \"The ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio.\" This also sounds familiar. After the molecules are ionized, the ions are separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio. This is typically done using magnetic fields or electric fields, depending on the type of mass spectrometer. So, this should be another characteristic of mass spectrometry.\n\nLastly, statement III: \"In addition to compound identification, mass spectra can be utilized to determine precise isotopic masses and isotopic ratios.\" I know that mass spectrometry is used to identify compounds by their mass-to-charge ratios, but can it also determine isotopic masses and ratios? I think so, because different isotopes have slightly different masses, and mass spectrometry can detect these differences. In fact, it's commonly used in dating and in studying the composition of elements by looking at their isotopes.\n\nSo, all three statements seem to be characteristics of mass spectrometry. That would mean the answer is D: I, II, and III.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Sometimes questions can be tricky, and not all statements might be correct.\n\nLet me think again about statement I. Yes, in mass spectrometry, the analyte molecules are indeed converted to gaseous ions. This is usually done in the ionization source, where techniques like electron impact ionization or electrospray ionization are used to create ions from the sample.\n\nStatement II: The separation of ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio is a fundamental aspect of mass spectrometry. Different types of mass analyzers, like quadrupoles, time-of-flight, or orbitraps, use various methods to separate these ions.\n\nStatement III: Mass spectrometry can indeed be used to determine isotopic masses and ratios. This is particularly useful in fields like geology, where isotopic ratios can provide information about the age of rocks or the origin of materials. Additionally, in biochemistry, isotopic labeling is commonly used to track metabolic pathways, and mass spectrometry is used to detect these labels.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that all three statements are correct characteristics of mass spectrometry. Therefore, the answer should be D: I, II, and III.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any possibility that one of these statements might not be accurate. For example, maybe in some special cases, mass spectrometry doesn't convert analytes to gaseous ions, or perhaps it doesn't always separate ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. But from what I know, these are standard procedures in mass spectrometry.\n\nMoreover, the ability to determine isotopic masses and ratios is a well-established application of mass spectrometry, so statement III is also correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D: I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
