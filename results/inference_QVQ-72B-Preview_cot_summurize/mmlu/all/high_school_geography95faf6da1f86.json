                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about urban geography. It says: \"A large node of office and commercial land use outside the central city with more jobs than residents is a(n)...\" and the options are A. suburb, B. primate city, C. town, D. edge city.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"large node of office and commercial land use outside the central city\" means. I think it refers to a significant concentration of businesses and offices not in the downtown area but somewhere else.\n\nThe term \"more jobs than residents\" suggests that this area attracts people from surrounding regions for work, meaning it's a job center but doesn't have as many people living there compared to working there.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Suburb: Suburbs are residential areas on the outskirts of a city. They are primarily residential and usually have more residents than jobs. So, this doesn't seem to fit because the question mentions more jobs than residents.\n\nB. Primate city: This is a city that is much larger and more dominant than any other in the region. It's usually the central city with a wide range of economic activities. But the question specifies \"outside the central city,\" so this can't be the central city. This option doesn't fit.\n\nC. Town: A town is generally smaller than a city and has fewer economic functions. However, the question mentions a \"large node of office and commercial land use,\" which sounds more significant than a typical town. So, this seems too small for what's being described.\n\nD. Edge city: This term rings a bell. I think an edge city is a large commercial and business district that's not in the traditional downtown but has developed along transportation corridors, often near suburbs.\n\nLet me think more about edge cities. I recall that they emerged in the latter half of the 20th century with the rise of automobiles and highways. They are characterized by large office parks, shopping malls, and other commercial developments. Importantly, they can have more jobs than residents, as people commute there from nearby residential areas.\n\nGiven that, edge cities fit the description in the question: they are outside the central city, have a significant concentration of office and commercial land use, and have more jobs than residents.\n\nLet me double-check if any of the other options could possibly fit.\n\nSuburbs are mainly residential and don't typically have more jobs than residents. Primate cities are the largest in a region and are the central cities themselves. Towns are smaller and less economically diversified than what's described.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be D. edge city.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other concept in urban geography that might fit this description. For example, could this be a satellite city or an exurb? A satellite city is a smaller city that is economically dependent on a larger neighboring city but still has its own center. An exurb is an area beyond the suburbs that is still connected to the city through commuting.\n\nNeither of these seems to fit the description of a large node of office and commercial land use with more jobs than residents. Satellite cities have their own economic bases but might not necessarily have more jobs than residents. Exurbs are even less likely to fit the bill.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. edge city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
