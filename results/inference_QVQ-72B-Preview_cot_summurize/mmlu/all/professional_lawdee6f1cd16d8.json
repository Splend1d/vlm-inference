The city council has enacted an ordinance requiring illegal aliens to pay a $100 \"school fee\" for each child enrolled in a city public school. Citizens and legal aliens are not required to pay the school fee. The city council has enacted this law to raise funds to hire additional teachers who are bilingual. The city determined that over 15% of children attending public schools in the city were illegal aliens. Furthermore, the city conducted a study and found that the overwhelming majority of illegal aliens residing in the city did not pay any local property taxes. As a result, since the city provided educational benefits to the children of illegal aliens, the school fee furthered a significant governmental interest. The illegal alien, who is indigent, is unable to pay the city school fee. The city will not allow her children to attend school unless the fee is paid. If she seeks your legal advice regarding the constitutionality of the fee, you should advise her that the ordinance is\n\nA. valid, because the city can demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest.\nB. valid, because the imposition of the school fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest.\nC. invalid, because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\nD. invalid, because the cost of educating the children imposed an undue burden on the public school system by requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about an illegal alien and her three children living in a U.S. city. The city has passed an ordinance that requires illegal aliens to pay a $100 \"school fee\" for each child enrolled in a public school. Legal residents and citizens don't have to pay this fee. The city says they're doing this to raise money to hire more bilingual teachers because a significant portion of the students are illegal aliens and don't pay local property taxes. But the mother in question can't afford to pay this fee, and the city is saying her kids can't go to school unless she does pay. She's asking for legal advice on whether this ordinance is constitutional.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to think about the constitutionality of this ordinance. The options are:\n\nA. Valid, because the city can demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest.\n\nB. Valid, because the imposition of the school fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nC. Invalid, because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\n\nD. Invalid, because the cost of educating the children imposes an undue burden on the public school system by requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers.\n\nHmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what level of scrutiny applies here. Ordinarily, economic regulations and social programs are subject to rational basis review, meaning that as long as there's a rational relationship between the means and the ends, and the law is not arbitrary or discriminatory, it's constitutional. However, when it comes to education and potentially discrimination based on alienage or immigration status, that might trigger higher scrutiny.\n\nWait, education is considered a fundamental right under the Constitution, right? I think the Supreme Court has said that education is a fundamental right, and any law that interferes with that right would be subject to strict scrutiny. So, if that's the case, the city would need to show that this ordinance is necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest.\n\nBut, I should double-check that. Is education a fundamental right? I recall some cases where the Supreme Court has protected the right to education, like in Plyler v. Doe, which dealt with educating undocumented children. In that case, the Court struck down a law that excluded undocumented immigrant children from public schools, saying that it violated the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nIn Plyler v. Doe, the Court held that denying education to undocumented children was not permissible because it imposed a burden on their right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court found that education was a fundamental right and that denying it to these children didn't serve a compelling state interest.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the city's ordinance here is treading on dangerous ground. By requiring illegal aliens to pay a fee that effectively denies their children access to education if they can't pay, it's similar to what was struck down in Plyler v. Doe.\n\nLet me see what the options are saying.\n\nOption A says it's valid because the city can demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest. But according to Plyler v. Doe, even if the city has an interest in raising funds for bilingual education, denying education to these children isn't a means that's necessary to achieve that interest. There are likely other ways to fund bilingual education without denying education to children.\n\nOption B says it's valid because the imposition of the school fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest. But again, based on Plyler v. Doe, education is a fundamental right, so the rational basis test doesn't apply here. It's not enough for the city to have a legitimate interest; they need a compelling interest and a narrowly tailored means to achieve it.\n\nOption C says it's invalid because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest. This seems to align with the reasoning in Plyler v. Doe. The Court in that case held that denying education to undocumented children doesn't serve a compelling state interest and violates equal protection.\n\nOption D says it's invalid because the cost of educating the children imposes an undue burden on the public school system by requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers. This seems a bit off-track. The issue isn't about the burden on the school system; it's about the constitutional rights of the children.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the correct answer. The ordinance is invalid because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. The city is trying to fund bilingual education by charging illegal aliens a fee. Is that a legitimate interest? Maybe, but as Plyler v. Doe suggests, even if it is, denying education to children isn't a permissible way to achieve that interest.\n\nAlso, the city is saying that many illegal aliens don't pay local property taxes, so they're not contributing to the school system. That might be a legitimate concern, but again, Plyler v. Doe said that states can't deny education to children based on their immigration status, even if they don't pay taxes.\n\nSo, perhaps the city could find another way to fund bilingual education that doesn't involve denying education to children. For example, they could impose a general tax increase or find other revenue sources.\n\nTherefore, the ordinance in question is likely unconstitutional because it denies education to children based on their parents' immigration status, which violates the Equal Protection Clause as interpreted in Plyler v. Doe.\n\nSo, the best advice would be that the ordinance is invalid, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
