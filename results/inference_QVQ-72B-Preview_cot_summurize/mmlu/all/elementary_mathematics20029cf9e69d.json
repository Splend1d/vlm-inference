                    "text": "Let's see what Tisha's riddle is all about. She says: \"I have 2 faces, no vertices, and I can roll. What am I?\" And the options are cone, cylinder, sphere, or prism. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these shapes fits all the descriptions.\n\nFirst, let's break down the riddle:\n\n1. **I have 2 faces:** So, the shape should have exactly two faces.\n\n2. **No vertices:** It shouldn't have any corners or vertices.\n\n3. **I can roll:** It should be able to roll, like a wheel or a ball.\n\nAlright, let's consider each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: Cone**\n\n- A cone has one circular face and one curved surface. But wait, is that considered two faces? Actually, in geometry, a face is usually defined as a flat surface, so for a cone, the circular base is one face, and the curved part is another face. So, yes, two faces.\n\n- Does it have any vertices? A cone has a vertex where the curved surface meets the base. So, it has one vertex.\n\n- Can it roll? Well, a cone can roll on its curved surface, but not very stably like a wheel.\n\nBut, it has a vertex, which contradicts the \"no vertices\" part of the riddle. So, probably not a cone.\n\n**Option B: Cylinder**\n\n- A cylinder has two circular faces (top and bottom) and one curved surface. But in terms of faces, if we consider only flat surfaces as faces, then a cylinder has two faces (the two circular ends) and the curved surface isn't a face. However, sometimes, in more advanced geometry, we might consider the curved surface as a face, but let's stick to basic definitions.\n\n- Does it have any vertices? A cylinder doesn't have any vertices or corners; it's smooth all around.\n\n- Can it roll? Yes, a cylinder can roll along its axis very well, like a wheel.\n\nThis seems to fit all the criteria: two faces, no vertices, and can roll.\n\n**Option C: Sphere**\n\n- A sphere has one curved surface, but no flat faces. So, if we define a face as a flat surface, then a sphere has zero faces.\n\n- Does it have any vertices? No, it's completely smooth without any corners.\n\n- Can it roll? Yes, a sphere can roll in any direction.\n\nBut according to the riddle, it should have two faces, which a sphere doesn't have. So, probably not a sphere.\n\n**Option D: Prism**\n\n- A prism has two parallel polygonal bases and several rectangular faces connecting the corresponding sides of the bases. For example, a rectangular prism has six faces, and a triangular prism has five faces.\n\n- Does it have vertices? Yes, prisms have vertices where the edges meet.\n\n- Can it roll? Not really; prisms are polyhedrons and don't roll smoothly like wheels or balls.\n\nSo, this doesn't fit the description of having two faces, no vertices, and being able to roll.\n\nAlright, so based on this analysis, the cylinder seems to be the best fit for Tisha's riddle. It has two faces (the two circular ends), no vertices, and it can roll.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nIn some contexts, a sphere could be considered to have one face (the curved surface), but as we established earlier, if we define a face as a flat surface, it has none. So, that doesn't work.\n\nA cone has two faces: the base and the lateral surface, but it has a vertex, which disqualifies it.\n\nA prism has more than two faces and has vertices, so that's out.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable answer is a cylinder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. cylinder}} \\]"
