                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario to work through. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Here's what I know:\n\nA lady owns a house in fee simple absolute. That means she has the highest possible ownership interest in the property, with the right to use it, sell it, or pass it on to heirs without any restrictions.\n\nShe devises the house to her cousin, but it's in trust for her grandchild, for the grandchild's life. Then, after the grandchild's death, the property is to go to the children appointed in the grandchild's will. If there is no such appointment in the will, or if there are no surviving children, the property is to be divided equally among any surviving children of the grandchild.\n\nNow, the question is: if the grandchild dies and is in debt, can the creditors attach the house?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes, because of the rule in Shelley's Case.\n\nB. No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\n\nC. Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.\n\nD. No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.\n\nAlright, let's tackle this one point at a time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nature of the trust and the power of appointment involved.\n\nThe lady devises the house to her cousin, in trust for her grandchild, for the grandchild's life. So, the cousin is the trustee, and the grandchild is the life beneficiary of the trust.\n\nAfter the grandchild's death, the trust property is to go to the children appointed in the grandchild's will. If there is no such appointment or no surviving children, then it goes to any surviving children of the grandchild equally.\n\nSo, the grandchild has a special power of appointment through her will, but it's limited by the contingency that if no children are appointed or if there are no surviving children, then it goes to any surviving children equally.\n\nNow, the grandchild dies indebted. Can creditors attach the house?\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nOption A: Yes, because of the rule in Shelley's Case.\n\nShelley's Case is an old English case that established the rule that a deed providing for a life estate to one person and a remainder to another is invalid if both interests are in the same person. In other words, a life estate and a remainder cannot vest in the same person.\n\nIn this scenario, the lady devises the house to her cousin in trust for her grandchild for life, and then to the children appointed in the grandchild's will.\n\nIs there a remainder interest that could be considered vesting in the grandchild? Not directly, because the grandchild has a life estate, and the remainder goes to the children appointed in the grandchild's will.\n\nUnless the grandchild appoints herself as a beneficiary, which I don't think is allowed since she only has a special power of appointment, not a general one.\n\nWait, the problem says \"children appointed in a will by her grandchild.\" So, the grandchild is appointing the remainder interest to her children through her will.\n\nSo, the remainder interest is not vesting in the grandchild; it's vesting in her children.\n\nTherefore, Shelley's Case doesn't seem to apply here because the life estate and the remainder are not vesting in the same person.\n\nSo, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B: No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\n\nThis seems relevant. A special power of appointment allows the donee (the person with the power) to appoint the property to certain beneficiaries, but not to themselves.\n\nIn trust law, the donee of a special power of appointment generally doesn't have a direct interest in the trust property, only the power to direct where it goes upon their death.\n\nTherefore, the grandchild has a life estate in the house, but the remainder interest is controlled through her special power of appointment in her will.\n\nSo, the grandchild's creditors generally cannot reach the remainder interest because it's not hers to dispose of freely; she only has a limited power over it.\n\nHowever, the life estate may be subject to claims of creditors during her lifetime.\n\nBut the question is about attaching the house after her death.\n\nSo, perhaps the creditors can't attach the house because the grandchild didn't own it outright; she only had a life estate and a special power of appointment.\n\nBut I need to think about whether the life estate itself can be reached by creditors.\n\nGenerally, a life estate is subject to the claims of the life tenant's creditors during their lifetime, but after their death, the remainder interest passes to the remaindermen free of the life tenant's debts.\n\nIn this case, the remainder interest goes to the children appointed in the grandchild's will, or to any surviving children equally.\n\nSo, after the grandchild's death, the house passes to these beneficiaries free of her debts.\n\nTherefore, the creditors may not be able to attach the house after her death.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nOption C: Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.\n\nI'm not sure about the \"rule of sequential appointments.\" Maybe this refers to the rule against multiple powers of appointment or something similar.\n\nBut in this case, the grandchild has a special power of appointment through her will to appoint the remainder interest to her children.\n\nUnless there's some restriction in the trust preventing multiple appointments, which isn't mentioned, I don't see why this would invalidate the will.\n\nMoreover, the grandchild does have a life estate in the house, so she does have an interest in the property during her lifetime.\n\nTherefore, option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D: No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.\n\nThe rule against perpetuities is a complex legal doctrine that prevents interests in property from being tied up indefinitely.\n\nIt generally states that any interest that doesn't vest, if at all, within a certain period (often measured by the lifetime of a person alive when the interest was created plus 21 years) is invalid.\n\nIn this case, the remainder interest is to go to the children appointed in the grandchild's will, or to any surviving children equally.\n\nAssuming the grandchild has children, and they are living at the time of her death, then the remainder interest should vest immediately upon her death, as it's passing to her surviving children.\n\nTherefore, the rule against perpetuities shouldn't be an issue here because the interests vest within the required period.\n\nSo, option D is probably incorrect.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A: Incorrect because Shelley's Case doesn't apply.\n\n- Option B: Possibly correct, as the special power of appointment may protect the remainder interest from the grandchild's creditors.\n\n- Option C: Incorrect because the grandchild does have a life estate and the will isn't invalidated by sequential appointments.\n\n- Option D: Incorrect because the rule against perpetuities doesn't seem to be violated.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is Option B: No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should double-check the law on creditors' rights regarding trust assets and powers of appointment.\n\nIn general, a special power of appointment doesn't give the donee an ownership interest in the trust property; rather, it gives them the ability to direct where the property goes upon their death.\n\nTherefore, the donee's creditors typically cannot reach the trust property because the donee doesn't have an enforceable property interest in it.\n\nHowever, the life estate that the grandchild has in the house may be subject to her creditors' claims during her lifetime.\n\nBut after her death, the remainder interest passes to the appointed children free of her debts.\n\nTherefore, the house shouldn't be attachable by her creditors after her death.\n\nSo, the answer is No, because of the protection afforded by the special power of appointment.\n\nThus, the correct choice is Option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
