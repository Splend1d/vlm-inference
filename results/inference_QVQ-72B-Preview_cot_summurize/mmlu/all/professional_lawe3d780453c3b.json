                    "text": "So I have this question about impeachment in the United States. It's asking which statement about impeachment is not true. Let me go through each option one by one to make sure I understand them correctly.\n\nOption A says that grounds for impeachment include treason and bribery. I know that the Constitution lists \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" as impeachable offenses. So, treason and bribery are indeed part of the grounds for impeachment. This seems correct.\n\nOption B mentions that grounds include high crimes and misdemeanors. That sounds familiar; it's part of the same clause in the Constitution that I just thought about. High crimes and misdemeanors are broader categories that can include various forms of misconduct or abuse of power by officials. So, this also seems to be true.\n\nOption C states that a majority vote in the House is necessary to invoke charges of impeachment. I recall that the House of Representatives has the power to impeach, and it's like bringing charges against the official. For impeachment to proceed, a simple majority vote in the House is required. This matches what I remember.\n\nNow, option D says that a three-fourths vote in the Senate is necessary to convict and remove from office. Hmm, I think this might be the one that's not true. Let me double-check. The Senate conducts the trial after impeachment, and I believe it requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the official from office, not three-fourths.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The Constitution states that \"no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.\" So, two-thirds majority, not three-fourths. Therefore, option D is incorrect because it says three-fourths, when in fact it's two-thirds.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything here. Maybe there's a confusion between impeachment and some other legislative processes. For example, amending the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote in both houses, but that's a different process. No, I think I'm on the right track.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Impeachment is initiated by the House with a majority vote.\n\n- Trial is conducted by the Senate, requiring a two-thirds majority to convict and remove.\n\nTherefore, option D is not true because it incorrectly states that a three-fourths vote is needed in the Senate to convict and remove from office.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
