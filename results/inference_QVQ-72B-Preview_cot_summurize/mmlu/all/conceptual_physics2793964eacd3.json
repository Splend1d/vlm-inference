                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question: \"When small pieces of material are assembled into a larger piece, the combined surface area...\". And the options are:\n\nA. greatly increases\n\nB. slightly increases\n\nC. decreases\n\nD. is unchanged\n\nHmm. I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that surface area has to do with how much area is exposed to the outside. So, if you have a bunch of small pieces, each one has its own surface area. When you put them together to make a larger piece, what happens to the total surface area?\n\nLet me consider an example. Say I have eight small cubes, each with a side length of 1 unit. Each cube has a surface area of 6 square units (since a cube has 6 faces). So, the total surface area of all eight cubes would be 8 times 6, which is 48 square units.\n\nNow, if I assemble these eight small cubes into one larger cube, what would be the side length of that larger cube? Well, since volume is conserved, and each small cube has a volume of 1 cubic unit, eight small cubes would have a total volume of 8 cubic units. So, the larger cube would have a side length of the cube root of 8, which is 2 units.\n\nWhat's the surface area of this larger cube? It would be 6 times the area of one face. One face has an area of 2 squared, which is 4 square units. So, total surface area is 6 times 4, which is 24 square units.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. The total surface area decreased from 48 square units to 24 square units when I combined the eight small cubes into one larger cube. So, in this case, the combined surface area decreased.\n\nBut is this always the case? Let's think about another scenario. Suppose I have two rectangular blocks, each measuring 1 unit by 2 units by 3 units. Each block has a surface area of 2 times (1*2 + 1*3 + 2*3), which is 2 times (2 + 3 + 6), which is 2 times 11, so 22 square units. Together, that's 44 square units.\n\nIf I assemble them into one larger rectangular block, say by placing them side by side along their 3-unit sides, the new dimensions would be 1 by 2 by 6 units (since 3 + 3 = 6). The surface area of this larger block would be 2 times (1*2 + 1*6 + 2*6), which is 2 times (2 + 6 + 12), so 2 times 20, which is 40 square units.\n\nAgain, the combined surface area decreased from 44 to 40 square units.\n\nHmm, so in both examples, combining smaller pieces into a larger piece resulted in a decrease in total surface area.\n\nBut wait, is this always true? Let's consider another arrangement. Suppose I have four cubes, each 1 unit by 1 unit by 1 unit. If I arrange them in a straight line, side by side, the total surface area would be less than if I arranged them in a more spread-out configuration.\n\nActually, in general, when you combine smaller pieces into a larger one, the surface area decreases because some of the surfaces that were exposed in the smaller pieces become internal surfaces in the larger piece.\n\nLet me think about it mathematically. For n small cubes, each with side length a, the total surface area is n * 6a\u00b2. If I combine them into one larger cube, the side length of the larger cube is n^(1/3) * a, and its surface area is 6 * (n^(1/3) * a)\u00b2 = 6n^(2/3)a\u00b2.\n\nSince 2/3 is less than 1, n^(2/3) < n when n > 1. Therefore, 6n^(2/3)a\u00b2 < 6n a\u00b2, meaning the surface area decreases when small cubes are combined into one larger cube.\n\nBut does this hold true for other shapes besides cubes? Let's consider rectangular prisms.\n\nSuppose I have two rectangular prisms, each with dimensions l, w, h. The surface area of one prism is 2(lw + lh + wh). If I combine them by placing them face-to-face along one of their faces, say the l by w face, then the combined rectangular prism would have dimensions l, w, and height h + h = 2h. Its surface area would be 2(lw + l(2h) + w(2h)) = 2(lw + 2lh + 2wh) = 2lw + 4lh + 4wh.\n\nComparing this to the total surface area of the two separate prisms: 2(lw + lh + wh) * 2 = 4(lw + lh + wh) = 4lw + 4lh + 4wh.\n\nClearly, 2lw + 4lh + 4wh < 4lw + 4lh + 4wh, which again shows that the combined surface area is less than the sum of the individual surface areas.\n\nSo, in both cubic and rectangular prism examples, combining smaller pieces into a larger piece results in a decrease in total surface area.\n\nBut is this always the case, regardless of the shape or how the pieces are assembled?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose I have two identical spheres, each with radius r. The surface area of one sphere is 4\u03c0r\u00b2, so for two spheres, it's 8\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nIf I combine them into one larger sphere, what would be the radius of the larger sphere? The volume is conserved, so the volume of the larger sphere is twice the volume of one small sphere.\n\nThe volume of one small sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, so for two spheres, it's (8/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n\nLet R be the radius of the larger sphere. Then, (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3 = (8/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, which simplifies to R\u00b3 = 2r\u00b3, so R = r\u221b2.\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the larger sphere is 4\u03c0R\u00b2 = 4\u03c0(r\u221b2)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 * (\u221b4) \u2248 4\u03c0r\u00b2 * 1.587.\n\nComparing this to the total surface area of the two small spheres, which is 8\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nSo, 4\u03c0r\u00b2 * (\u221b4) \u2248 6.36\u03c0r\u00b2, which is less than 8\u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nThus, even for spheres, combining two into one larger sphere results in a decrease in total surface area.\n\nWait a second, but is there a way to assemble smaller pieces into a larger piece where the surface area doesn't decrease or even increases?\n\nLet me consider a different scenario. Suppose I have a bunch of small rods, and I assemble them into a larger rod by stacking them end-to-end. In this case, the surface area would decrease because the ends that were exposed in the smaller rods become internal surfaces in the larger rod.\n\nAlternatively, if I arrange the rods side by side instead of end-to-end, the surface area would still decrease compared to the sum of the individual surface areas.\n\nIs there any way to arrange the pieces so that the combined surface area increases?\n\nLet me think about folding a piece of paper. If I take a flat sheet of paper and fold it into a zigzag pattern, the surface area increases because the folds create more surface area.\n\nBut in this case, I'm starting with a single flat sheet and creating a more complex shape, which isn't exactly assembling multiple small pieces into a larger one.\n\nAlternatively, consider taking two flat plates and stacking them with a small gap between them, so that the total surface area is slightly more than the sum of their individual surface areas because of the added gap surfaces.\n\nBut again, this seems like creating additional surfaces rather than assembling into a larger piece.\n\nWait, perhaps if I assemble pieces in a way that some new surfaces are created.\n\nFor example, suppose I have two identical rectangular blocks, each 1x1x4. If I place them side by side to form a 1x2x4 block, as before, the surface area decreases.\n\nBut if I arrange them in a way that they don't completely cover each other's surfaces, maybe the combined surface area could be higher.\n\nHowever, in practice, when assembling pieces into a larger whole, typically some surfaces are internalized, leading to a decrease in total surface area.\n\nMoreover, in chemistry and materials science, it's known that smaller particles have higher surface area to volume ratios. When these particles are combined into larger aggregates, their total surface area decreases.\n\nLet me consider the formula for surface area in general. For any assembly of pieces, the total surface area is the sum of the individual surface areas minus twice the area of the interfaces between the pieces (since each interface removes two exposed surfaces and replaces them with one internal surface).\n\nTherefore, unless there's some unusual arrangement where new surfaces are created, combining smaller pieces into a larger piece should generally result in a decrease in total surface area.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the concept of fractals, where shapes can have increasing surface areas as they become more intricate.\n\nHowever, in the context of assembling small pieces into a larger piece in a typical geometric sense, without creating new surfaces, the total surface area should decrease.\n\nAdditionally, in real-world manufacturing processes, when parts are assembled, the contact areas between parts are internalized, reducing the overall surface area.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, it seems that combining small pieces into a larger piece results in a decrease in total surface area.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be:\n\nC. decreases\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
