                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to calculate the relative occupancies of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 spin energy levels for a radical species with a g-factor of 2.05, at L- and W-band frequencies, and at a temperature of 300 K. The options provided are four different pairs of values, so I need to find which one correctly represents the ratio N\u03b1/N\u03b2 for each band.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the expressions for the populations of these energy levels. In EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectroscopy, the energy levels of an electron spin in a magnetic field are given by the Zeeman effect. The energy difference between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 states is:\n\n\u0394E = E_\u03b2 - E_\u03b1 = \u03bc_B g B\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u03bc_B is the Bohr magneton\n\n- g is the g-factor of the radical (2.05 in this case)\n\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n\nAt thermal equilibrium, the population of each level follows the Boltzmann distribution:\n\nN_i = N_total * (g_i / Z) * e^(-E_i / k_B T)\n\nwhere:\n\n- N_i is the population of level i\n\n- g_i is the degeneracy of level i\n\n- Z is the partition function\n\n- E_i is the energy of level i\n\n- k_B is the Boltzmann constant\n\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\nFor an electron spin, the degeneracy of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 levels is 1 (since S = 1/2, and each spin state has m_s = \u00b11/2). Therefore, the ratio N\u03b1/N\u03b2 is:\n\nN\u03b1 / N\u03b2 = e^(-\u0394E / k_B T)\n\nGiven that \u0394E = \u03bc_B g B, and knowing that B = h \u03bd / (g \u03bc_B), where \u03bd is the frequency and h is Planck's constant, I can relate the energy difference to the frequency of the EPR transition.\n\nBut wait, in EPR, the energy difference between the spin states is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength and the g-factor:\n\n\u0394E = \u03bc_B g B\n\nThe frequency \u03bd corresponding to this energy difference is:\n\n\u03bd = \u0394E / h = (\u03bc_B g B) / h\n\nAt a particular frequency band, the magnetic field B can be expressed in terms of \u03bd:\n\nB = (h \u03bd) / (g \u03bc_B)\n\nSubstituting this back into \u0394E:\n\n\u0394E = \u03bc_B g * (h \u03bd) / (g \u03bc_B) = h \u03bd\n\nSo, \u0394E = h \u03bd\n\nTherefore, the ratio N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^(-\u0394E / k_B T) = e^(-h \u03bd / k_B T)\n\nNow, I need to find the frequencies for L- and W-bands. I recall that L-band is approximately 1 GHz, and W-band is around 95 GHz.\n\nLet me confirm that:\n\n- L-band: approximately 1 GHz (1 \u00d7 10^9 Hz)\n\n- W-band: approximately 95 GHz (95 \u00d7 10^9 Hz)\n\nNow, I need to calculate N\u03b1/N\u03b2 for each band at T = 300 K.\n\nFirst, let's list the constants I'll need:\n\n- Planck's constant (h) = 6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s\n\n- Boltzmann constant (k_B) = 1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K\n\nTemperature (T) = 300 K\n\nNow, for L-band (\u03bd = 1 GHz):\n\n\u0394E = h \u03bd = 6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10^9 Hz = 6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nThen, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^(-\u0394E / k_B T) = e^(-6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25 J / (1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K \u00d7 300 K))\n\nCalculating the exponent:\n\n-\u0394E / (k_B T) = -6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25 / (1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 \u00d7 300) \u2248 -6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25 / (4.141947 \u00d7 10^-21) \u2248 -0.0001599\n\nTherefore, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 \u2248 e^(-0.0001599) \u2248 1 - 0.0001599 \u2248 0.9998401\n\nWait, that seems too close to 1. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation of \u0394E / (k_B T):\n\nFirst, calculate h \u03bd:\n\nh = 6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s\n\n\u03bd = 1 GHz = 1 \u00d7 10^9 Hz\n\nSo, h \u03bd = 6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nk_B = 1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K\n\nT = 300 K\n\nTherefore, \u0394E / (k_B T) = (6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25) / (1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 \u00d7 300)\n\nCalculate denominator:\n\n1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 \u00d7 300 = 4.141947 \u00d7 10^-21 J/K\n\nThen, \u0394E / (k_B T) = 6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25 / 4.141947 \u00d7 10^-21 = 0.0001599\n\nWait, but in the exponential, it's -\u0394E / (k_B T), so -0.0001599\n\ne^(-0.0001599) \u2248 1 - 0.0001599 \u2248 0.9998401\n\nSo, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 \u2248 0.9998401 at L-band\n\nThis is much closer to 1 than any of the options suggest. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that at L-band, the energy difference is so small compared to k_B T that N\u03b1/N\u03b2 is essentially 1. But looking at the options, they suggest values like 0.9800 or 0.9950, which are still quite close to 1 but not exactly matching my calculation.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider more significant figures or check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the population ratio in terms of the g-factor and magnetic field.\n\nLet me recall that in EPR, the energy difference is \u0394E = \u03bc_B g B\n\nAnd B can be expressed in terms of the frequency \u03bd as B = h \u03bd / (g \u03bc_B)\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-derive \u0394E in terms of frequency.\n\nThe EPR condition is:\n\n\u0394E = h \u03bd\n\nBut also, \u0394E = \u03bc_B g B\n\nTherefore, h \u03bd = \u03bc_B g B \u21d2 B = (h \u03bd) / (\u03bc_B g)\n\nThen, \u0394E = \u03bc_B g * (h \u03bd) / (\u03bc_B g) = h \u03bd\n\nSo, indeed, \u0394E = h \u03bd\n\nTherefore, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^(-h \u03bd / k_B T)\n\nNow, for L-band, \u03bd = 1 GHz:\n\nN\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^(-6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10^9 / (1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 \u00d7 300))\n\nCalculate numerator: 6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nDenominator: 1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 \u00d7 300 = 4.141947 \u00d7 10^-21 J\n\nSo, -\u0394E / (k_B T) = -6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25 / 4.141947 \u00d7 10^-21 = -0.0001599\n\nTherefore, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 \u2248 e^(-0.0001599) \u2248 0.9998401\n\nThis is still very close to 1. Maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the g-factor should be considered more carefully. The g-factor for the radical is given as 2.05, but in the energy difference formula, it's \u03bc_B g B.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the energy levels are E_\u03b1 = -\u03bc_B g B / 2 and E_\u03b2 = +\u03bc_B g B / 2 for S = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E = E_\u03b2 - E_\u03b1 = \u03bc_B g B\n\nThen, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^(-\u0394E / k_B T) = e^(-\u03bc_B g B / k_B T)\n\nBut B = h \u03bd / (g \u03bc_B), so \u0394E = \u03bc_B g * (h \u03bd) / (g \u03bc_B) = h \u03bd\n\nSo, again, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^(-h \u03bd / k_B T)\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the gyromagnetic ratio or something else, but I think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the partition function Z to find the exact ratio.\n\nLet me recall that for a two-level system:\n\nZ = e^{-E_\u03b1 / k_B T} + e^{-E_\u03b2 / k_B T}\n\nBut since E_\u03b1 = -E_\u03b2, Z = e^{+\u0394E / 2 k_B T} + e^{-\u0394E / 2 k_B T} = 2 cosh(\u0394E / 2 k_B T)\n\nThen, N\u03b1 / Z = e^{-E_\u03b1 / k_B T} = e^{+\u0394E / 2 k_B T}\n\nAnd N\u03b2 / Z = e^{-E_\u03b2 / k_B T} = e^{-\u0394E / 2 k_B T}\n\nTherefore, N\u03b1 / N\u03b2 = e^{\u0394E / k_B T}\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps N\u03b1 / N\u03b2 = e^{-\u0394E / k_B T}\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me look up the correct expression for the population ratio in a two-level system.\n\nUpon checking, for a two-level system with energies E_\u03b1 and E_\u03b2, and assuming E_\u03b2 > E_\u03b1, the population ratio is:\n\nN\u03b1 / N\u03b2 = e^{-\u0394E / k_B T}\n\nwhere \u0394E = E_\u03b2 - E_\u03b1\n\nIn EPR, E_\u03b2 > E_\u03b1, so this should hold.\n\nGiven that, my earlier calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, for L-band, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 \u2248 0.9998401\n\nThis is much closer to 1 than any of the options suggest. Maybe there's a mistake in the options or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the magnetic field in Tesla rather than using frequency directly.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, find B for L-band.\n\nGiven that \u03bd = \u03b3 B / (2 \u03c0), where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nBut for EPR, \u03b3 = g \u03bc_B / h\n\nTherefore, \u03bd = (g \u03bc_B / h) B / (2 \u03c0)\n\nBut more commonly, \u03bd = (g \u03bc_B / h) B\n\nTherefore, B = h \u03bd / (g \u03bc_B)\n\nFor L-band, \u03bd = 1 GHz = 1 \u00d7 10^9 Hz\n\nThen, B = (6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s) \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 10^9 Hz) / (2.05 \u00d7 9.27401 \u00d7 10^-24 J/T)\n\nWait, \u03bc_B = 9.27401 \u00d7 10^-24 J/T\n\nSo, B = (6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10^9) / (2.05 \u00d7 9.27401 \u00d7 10^-24) = (6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25) / (1.90692 \u00d7 10^-23) \u2248 0.0347 T\n\nNow, \u0394E = \u03bc_B g B = 9.27401 \u00d7 10^-24 J/T \u00d7 2.05 \u00d7 0.0347 T \u2248 9.27401 \u00d7 2.05 \u00d7 0.0347 \u00d7 10^-24 \u2248 0.65 \u00d7 10^-24 J\n\nWait, calculating more precisely:\n\n9.27401 \u00d7 2.05 = 19.0692 J/T\n\nTimes 0.0347 T: 19.0692 \u00d7 0.0347 \u2248 0.662 J\n\nSo, \u0394E \u2248 0.662 \u00d7 10^-24 J\n\nThen, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^(-\u0394E / k_B T) = e^(-0.662 \u00d7 10^-24 / (1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 \u00d7 300)) = e^(-0.662 \u00d7 10^-24 / 4.141947 \u00d7 10^-21) = e^(-0.662 / 41419.47) \u2248 e^(-0.00001598)\n\nTherefore, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 \u2248 1 - 0.00001598 \u2248 0.99998402\n\nThis is even closer to 1. This doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.\n\nLet me recalculate B for L-band.\n\nGiven \u03bd = \u03b3 B, where \u03b3 = g \u03bc_B / h\n\nTherefore, B = h \u03bd / (g \u03bc_B)\n\nGiven h = 6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s\n\n\u03bc_B = 9.27401 \u00d7 10^-24 J/T\n\ng = 2.05\n\n\u03bd = 1 GHz = 1 \u00d7 10^9 Hz\n\nTherefore, B = (6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10^9) / (2.05 \u00d7 9.27401 \u00d7 10^-24) = (6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-25) / (19.0692 \u00d7 10^-24) \u2248 0.0347 T\n\nNow, \u0394E = \u03bc_B g B = 9.27401 \u00d7 10^-24 \u00d7 2.05 \u00d7 0.0347 \u2248 0.662 \u00d7 10^-24 J\n\nThen, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^(-\u0394E / k_B T) = e^(-0.662 \u00d7 10^-24 / 1.380649 \u00d7 10^-23 \u00d7 300) = e^(-0.662 \u00d7 10^-24 / 4.141947 \u00d7 10^-21) = e^(-0.662 / 41419.47) \u2248 e^(-0.00001598)\n\nTherefore, N\u03b1/N\u03b2 \u2248 0.99998402\n\nThis is still very close to 1, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the hyperfine splitting or other corrections, but the problem specifies a radical species, so perhaps it's a single unpaired electron without significant hyperfine interactions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are given with a different approach or different assumptions.\n\nLet me consider the general formula for the population ratio in EPR:\n\nN\u03b1/N\u03b2 = e^{-\u0394E / k_B T} = e^{-h \u03bd / k_B T}\n\nGiven that, and knowing that at room temperature (T = 300 K), k_B T \u2248 4.14 \u00d7 10^-21 J, and for L-band, h \u03bd \u2248 6.63 \u00d7 10^-25 J, so h \u03bd / k_B T \u2248 1.6 \u00d7 10^-4, hence e^{-0.00016} \u2248 0.99984, which again is very close to 1.\n\nThis suggests that at L-band, the populations are almost equal, which makes sense because the energy difference is much smaller than k_B T.\n\nHowever, none of the options reflect this value. Maybe there's a mistake in the options, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio in terms of the number of spins aligned with the field (\u03b1) versus those opposed (\u03b2), considering the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nGiven that, and with the calculations leading to N\u03b1/N\u03b2 \u2248 0.99984 at L-band, which is not matching any option, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the partition function Z for the two-level system.\n\nZ = e^{-E_\u03b1 / k_B T} + e^{-E_\u03b2 / k_B T} = e^{+\u0394E / 2 k_B T} + e^{-\u0394E / 2 k_B T} = 2 cosh(\u0394E / 2 k_B T)\n\nThen, N\u03b1 = (g_\u03b1 / Z) e^{-E_\u03b1 / k"
