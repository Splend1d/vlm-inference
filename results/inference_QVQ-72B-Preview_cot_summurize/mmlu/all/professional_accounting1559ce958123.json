                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Grant Co.'s sales budget for the year, broken down by quarters:\n\n- First quarter: 30,000 units\n\n- Second quarter: 40,000 units\n\n- Third quarter: 22,500 units\n\n- Fourth quarter: 27,500 units\n\nTotal sales for the year are 120,000 units. The beginning inventory is 9,000 units. The policy is to end each quarter with finished goods inventory equal to 30% of the next quarter's budgeted sales.\n\nWe need to find out how many units should be produced in the first quarter based on the production budget.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between sales, inventory, and production. The formula to determine the production quantity is:\n\nProduction = Expected sales + Desired ending inventory - Beginning inventory\n\nSo, for the first quarter, the production would be:\n\nProduction Q1 = Sales Q1 + Desired inventory end of Q1 - Beginning inventory\n\nBut wait, the desired ending inventory for Q1 is 30% of the next quarter's sales, which is Q2.\n\nSo, Desired inventory end of Q1 = 30% of Sales Q2\n\nSales Q2 = 40,000 units\n\nTherefore, Desired inventory end of Q1 = 0.30 * 40,000 = 12,000 units\n\nBeginning inventory is given as 9,000 units.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nProduction Q1 = 30,000 + 12,000 - 9,000 = 33,000 units\n\nLooking at the options, 33,000 is option B.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nStarting with Q1:\n\n- Sales: 30,000 units\n\n- Desired ending inventory: 30% of Q2 sales = 0.30 * 40,000 = 12,000 units\n\n- Beginning inventory: 9,000 units (from the problem)\n\nSo, Production Q1 = 30,000 + 12,000 - 9,000 = 33,000 units\n\nSeems straightforward. Maybe I should consider if there's any other factor that could affect the production in Q1.\n\nIs there any mention of purchases or manufacturing costs? No, the question is purely about the production quantity for the first quarter based on the given sales and inventory policies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a need to consider the production for subsequent quarters to verify, but the problem specifically asks for the first quarter's production, so I think the calculation above suffices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 33,000 units, which is option B.\n\nWait a minute, option A is 36,000, which might be a distractor. If I didn't account for the ending inventory, production would be just sales plus beginning inventory, but that's not the case here.\n\nOption C is 24,000, which seems too low compared to sales of 30,000.\n\nOption D is 12,000, which is likely the ending inventory, but not the production for the quarter.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that 33,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
