                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit involved, but I think I can work through it step by step. So, we have two law students having lunch, and one of them is thinking about selling his car. The conversation goes like this:\n\nFirst student: \"I'm thinking of selling my car.\"\n\nSecond student: \"I might be interested in buying your car if the price is reasonable and I can convince my parents to float me a loan.\"\n\nFirst student then writes something on a piece of paper: \"I will sell you my car for $1,000. In exchange for $1 received this day, I agree that you can have one month from today's date to decide whether to accept this offer.\" He signs it and hands it to the second student. The second student gives him a one-dollar bill and leaves.\n\nOne week later, the second student gets a $1,000 loan from his parents and decides to accept the offer. He calls the first student to tell him, but before he can say anything, the first student says, \"I've changed my mind. I do not want to sell my car.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the second student can still accept the first student's offer.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.\n\nB. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\n\nC. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\n\nD. Yes, based on the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what is an option contract? An option contract is when one party pays consideration to keep an offer open for a certain period. In this case, the first student is offering to sell his car for $1,000 and is giving the second student one month to decide, in exchange for $1.\n\nSo, the first student wrote a letter saying he'll sell the car for $1,000 and in exchange for $1, he's giving the second student a month to decide. He signed it and handed it to the second student, who gave him a dollar.\n\nThis seems like a binding option contract. The first student made an offer, the second student accepted by paying $1, and there's a written agreement signed by the first student.\n\nNow, one week later, the second student wants to accept, but the first student has changed his mind.\n\nSo, the question is, can the second student still accept despite the first student's change of heart?\n\nOption A says no because $1 is inadequate consideration. But in contract law, consideration doesn't have to be adequate; it just has to be sufficient. Even a nominal amount like $1 can be valid consideration. So, I don't think A is correct.\n\nOption B says no because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wishes to contract. But the first student's change of heart comes after the option period has started. The option contract should bind him for the entire month, unless there's some reason it shouldn't.\n\nOption C says yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option. This seems plausible. If the option is valid, the second student should be able to accept within the one-month period.\n\nOption D says yes, based on the principle of promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel applies when one party reasonably relies on a promise to their detriment. Here, the second student obtained a loan from his parents, presumably in reliance on being able to buy the car. So, maybe promissory estoppel could apply here.\n\nBut, since there's a written agreement that seems to form a valid option contract, I think C is more directly applicable than D.\n\nWait, but the first student said he's changed his mind before the second student could accept. Does that matter?\n\nIn contract law, once an option contract is formed, the offeror can't revoke the offer during the option period. So, even if the first student says he's changed his mind, as long as the option period is still in effect, the offer can't be revoked.\n\nSo, if the second student accepts within the one-month period, that should be valid.\n\nBut what if the first student refuses to go through with it? Well, that's a different issue. The second student might have to take legal action to enforce the contract.\n\nBut the question is whether the second student can still accept the offer. Based on the option contract, I think the answer is yes.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards C: yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs the option contract valid? It seems to be. There's an offer, consideration ($1), and a specified time period.\n\nDid the second student accept within the option period? Yes, he did, since it was only one week later.\n\nThe first student's change of heart doesn't affect the validity of the option contract.\n\nTherefore, the second student can still accept the offer.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
