                    "text": "So I have this multiplication problem here: 28 times 42. I need to figure out what that equals, and there are some options given: 420, 816, 1,166, and 1,176. I have to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall how to multiply two-digit numbers. It's been a while since I've done this, but I think I can manage. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nSo, 28 times 42. One way to approach this is to use the standard multiplication algorithm that I learned in school. That involves multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then adding up all the products.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n```\n\n    28\n\n  \u00d7 42\n\n  -----\n\n```\n\nFirst, I'll multiply 28 by 2 (the ones place of 42):\n\n28 \u00d7 2 = 56\n\nSo, I write down 56 on the bottom, aligned with the ones place.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the standard method, when you multiply by the ones place, you don't shift the number to the left. But I think I might be a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nI'll set it up properly:\n\n```\n\n    28\n\n  \u00d7 42\n\n  -----\n\n```\n\nFirst, multiply 28 by 2 (the ones place of 42):\n\n28 \u00d7 2 = 56\n\nSo, I write 56 below the line, aligned with the ones place.\n\nThen, multiply 28 by 4 (the tens place of 42), but I need to remember to shift it one place to the left because it's the tens place.\n\nSo, 28 \u00d7 4 = 112, and I write 112 shifted one place to the left, starting from the tens place.\n\nNow, it should look like this:\n\n```\n\n    28\n\n  \u00d7 42\n\n  -----\n\n     56   (28 \u00d7 2)\n\n   112    (28 \u00d7 4, shifted one place to the left)\n\n  -----\n\n```\n\nNext, I need to add these two results together: 56 + 112.\n\n56 + 112 = 168\n\nSo, according to this method, 28 \u00d7 42 should be 168.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Looking back at the options, 168 isn't one of them. The options are 420, 816, 1,166, and 1,176. So, clearly, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I didn't shift the numbers correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the vertical method, where I multiply each digit and add the carries as I go.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSet it up vertically:\n\n```\n\n    28\n\n  \u00d7 42\n\n  -----\n\n```\n\nFirst, multiply 28 by 2 (the ones place of 42):\n\n28 \u00d7 2 = 56\n\nWrite down the 56 below the line.\n\nThen, multiply 28 by 4 (the tens place of 42), but remember to shift it one place to the left and add a zero.\n\nSo, 28 \u00d7 4 = 112, then shift it to 1120.\n\nNow, add these two products:\n\n56 + 1120 = 1176\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, 28 \u00d7 42 = 1,176.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\n28 \u00d7 40 = 1,120\n\n28 \u00d7 2 = 56\n\n1,120 + 56 = 1,176\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the distributive property to verify:\n\n28 \u00d7 42 = 28 \u00d7 (40 + 2) = (28 \u00d7 40) + (28 \u00d7 2) = 1,120 + 56 = 1,176\n\nPerfect, that matches.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 1,176.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 420\n\nB. 816\n\nC. 1,166\n\nD. 1,176\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. 1,176.\n\nI think that's it. I'm glad I was able to figure it out by breaking it down step by step.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1176} \\]"
