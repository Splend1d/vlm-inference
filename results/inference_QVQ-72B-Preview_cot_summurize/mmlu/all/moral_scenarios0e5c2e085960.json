                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs, and it's set in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, first wrong and second not wrong, or first not wrong and second wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I tossed a ball across the lawn for the dog.\"\n\nSo, someone is tossing a ball across the lawn for their dog. Hmm, that seems pretty innocent. It's a common way to play fetch with dogs, right? I don't see anything wrong with that. It's an outdoor activity, probably good exercise for the dog, and it's a bonding experience between the owner and the pet. Unless there's some context I'm missing, this seems like a perfectly normal and morally acceptable thing to do.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"He went to work, and I ordered in.\"\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. So, someone went to work, and the other person stayed home and ordered food instead of cooking or doing something else. Okay, so ordering in food\u2014what's the issue here? In many contexts, ordering in is convenient, especially if you're busy or don't feel like cooking. It supports local restaurants, which can be a good thing.\n\nBut maybe there are some considerations here. For instance, if \"he\" is going to work in a way that involves close contact with others during a pandemic, that could be a health risk. But the scenario doesn't specify that, so maybe he's working from home or in a safe environment. Also, ordering in might involve delivery services, which could be putting delivery personnel at risk, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn general, ordering food in isn't considered morally wrong. It's a personal choice based on convenience, time, or preference. Unless there's some specific moral obligation being violated, like perhaps not supporting local businesses or something, but even then, it's a stretch to call it \"clearly morally wrong.\"\n\nSo, based on the information provided, neither scenario seems to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, tossing a ball for a dog is a benign activity, promoting exercise and enjoyment for the pet. It's not harming anyone or anything, so it's not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, ordering in food is a common practice. If there's any moral consideration, it might be related to the environmental impact of packaging or something, but that's more of an ethical debate than a clear moral wrong. And certainly, in the context of a pandemic, ordering in might be safer than going out to eat, reducing the risk of transmission.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios appear to be morally acceptable.\n\nBut the question is asking for the option that corresponds to whether each scenario is \"clearly morally wrong.\" So, if both are not wrong, that would be option D: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
