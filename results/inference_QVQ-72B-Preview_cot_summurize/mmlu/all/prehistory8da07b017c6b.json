                    "text": "So I have this question here about social integration and hierarchies. It says that a pattern of social integration where individuals are placed into a hierarchy of social levels is called... and then there are four options: A. urbanization, B. a social system, C. social stratification, D. a necropolis. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what social integration means. Social integration, from what I recall, refers to the way individuals and groups are connected and interact within a society. So, it's about how people fit together socially.\n\nNow, the question mentions a hierarchy of social levels. A hierarchy suggests that there are different ranks or levels of importance, power, or status. So, in a social context, this would imply that some people have more status, power, or resources than others.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: urbanization. I know that urbanization is the process where more and more people move from rural areas to cities. It's about the growth of urban areas and the concentration of population in them. That doesn't seem directly related to a hierarchy of social levels. Maybe indirectly, urbanization can lead to increased social stratification, but it's not the same thing. So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B: a social system. A social system is a broad term that refers to the structure and organization of a society, including its institutions, norms, and values. While a social system can include hierarchies, it's not specifically about the ranking of individuals into social levels. It's more about the overall structure of society. So, this seems a bit too general for the specific description in the question.\n\nOption C: social stratification. This sounds familiar. Social stratification is, as I remember, the system by which a society ranks categories of people in a hierarchy. It involves the distribution of resources, power, and prestige unevenly across different social groups. This seems to match the description in the question pretty closely. So, this could be the correct answer.\n\nOption D: a necropolis. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. A necropolis is a large cemetery or burial ground, often associated with ancient cities. It's related to the dead, not to social hierarchies among living individuals. So, this doesn't seem relevant to the question.\n\nAfter considering all the options, it appears that social stratification is the term that best fits the description provided in the question. It's specifically about the hierarchical arrangement of individuals based on various factors like wealth, power, and status.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Social stratification is a fundamental concept in sociology that refers to the layers of social positioning that create inequalities among individuals or groups. These layers can be based on class, caste, gender, race, or other factors. So, yes, it aligns perfectly with the idea of placing individuals into a hierarchy of social levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. social stratification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. social stratification}} \\]"
