                    "text": "Let's see here. So, there's this researcher who wants to study long-term confidence in the U.S. economy among adults. She takes a simple random sample of 30 adults as they leave a Wall Street office building one afternoon. Almost all of them, except two, agreed to participate in the survey. And now, we have to pick which conclusion is correct from the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. A simple random sample means that every person in the population has an equal chance of being selected, right? But in this case, the sample is from people leaving a Wall Street office building. That sounds like a convenience sample because it's easy to access people there, but it might not be representative of the entire adult population in the U.S.\n\nOption A says that the proper use of chance, as evidenced by the simple random sample, makes this a well-designed survey. But wait, even if it's a simple random sample, if the sample isn't representative of the population, then it might not be a well-designed survey. So, is this really a simple random sample of the entire adult population?\n\nOption B says that the high response rate makes this a well-designed survey. The response rate is high because out of 30, only two didn't participate, so 28 did participate. That's about 93% response rate, which is good. But does that make the whole survey well-designed? Maybe not, because the sample itself might have issues.\n\nOption C says that selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey. Selection bias occurs when the sample isn't representative of the population due to how the sample was chosen. Since the sample is from a Wall Street office building, these people might have different views on the economy compared to the general adult population. Maybe they're more knowledgeable about economics or have a different perspective. So, this could be a case of selection bias.\n\nOption D mentions a voluntary response study, but in this scenario, it's not a voluntary response study. A voluntary response study is when people choose whether to participate, like responding to an online survey or something. Here, the researcher selected a sample and asked them to participate, and most agreed. So, this doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nGiven all that, it seems like option C is the correct conclusion: selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey. The sample isn't representative of the entire adult population because it's drawn from people leaving a Wall Street office building, who might have different levels of knowledge or opinions about the economy.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. The simple random sample sounds good, but it's only random within the group of people leaving that specific building at that time. It's not a random sample of the entire adult population. So, yes, there's selection bias there.\n\nAlso, the high response rate is good, but it doesn't fix the issue of the sample not being representative of the broader population. So, option B isn't correct for that reason.\n\nOption A is tricky because it mentions proper use of chance with the simple random sample. But again, it's only random within a convenience sample, not the whole population. So, it's not truly a simple random sample of the entire population.\n\nOption D is definitely not applicable here since it's not a voluntary response study.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is option C: selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
