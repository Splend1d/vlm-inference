                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which festival is the most important for Sikhs. The options are Holi, Divali, Baisakhi Day, and Hola Mahalla. I know a bit about some of these festivals, but I'm not entirely sure which one is the most significant in Sikhism.\n\nLet me start by eliminating the ones that I know aren't primarily Sikh festivals. Holi, for instance, is a Hindu festival celebrated mainly in India. It's known as the festival of colors and involves a lot of joy and celebration. While Sikhs might participate in Holi due to cultural influences, it's not a Sikh festival per se.\n\nSimilarly, Divali is another Hindu festival, often called the festival of lights. It's celebrated across India and by Hindus around the world. Sikhs do have their own celebration called Bandi Chhor Divas, which coincides with Divali, but Divali itself is a Hindu festival.\n\nNow, that leaves me with Baisakhi Day and Hola Mahalla. These sound more familiar in the context of Sikhism.\n\nBaisakhi Day is a significant festival in Sikhism. I believe it marks the establishment of the Khalsa Panth by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. The Khalsa is a community of initiated Sikhs who pledge to follow the teachings of the Gurus. So, this festival has a lot of historical and religious importance for Sikhs.\n\nHola Mahalla is another festival in Sikhism. It was also established by Guru Gobind Singh and is celebrated on the full moon day of the lunar month of Chet, which is usually in March. It's known for its displays of martial arts and sports, which are an important part of Sikh tradition.\n\nBetween Baisakhi Day and Hola Mahalla, I think Baisakhi Day is considered more important because it marks the creation of the Khalsa, which is central to Sikh identity and community. It's a day when Sikhs renew their commitment to their faith and remember the sacrifices of their Gurus.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if there's any other festival that might be considered more important. For example, in some traditions, the birth anniversaries of the Gurus are highly significant.\n\nWait a minute, Guru Nanak Jayanti is the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru. It's a major festival in Sikhism, celebrated with processions, readings from the Guru Granth Sahib, and community meals. Similarly, Guru Gobind Singh Jayanti marks the birth of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru, who established the Khalsa.\n\nHowever, I don't see these options in the list. Maybe the question is trying to test knowledge beyond just these four options. If that's the case, then perhaps Baisakhi Day is still the most important among the given choices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the most important festival is the one that involves the largest gatherings or the most significant historical events. In that case, Baisakhi Day again stands out because of its historical significance.\n\nLet me consider another angle. In Sikhism, the concept of Vaisakhi, which is another name for Baisakhi, is deeply rooted in their history. It was on this day that Guru Gobind Singh initiated the first members into the Khalsa. This act was transformational for the Sikh community, giving it a distinct identity and code of conduct.\n\nHola Mahalla, while important, seems to be more of a cultural and sporting event, whereas Baisakhi Day is more about spiritual and communal renewal.\n\nPerhaps I should also consider the way these festivals are celebrated. For Baisakhi Day, there are nagar kirtans (processions through the streets), readings from the Guru Granth Sahib, and langars (community meals), all of which are central to Sikh practice. Hola Mahalla also involves these elements but adds martial arts demonstrations, which, while important, might not carry the same weight in terms of religious significance.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards Baisakhi Day being the most important festival for Sikhs among the options provided.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that there isn't another festival that holds equal or greater importance. For example, in some Sikh traditions, the death anniversaries of the Gurus are also observed, though they might not be as widely celebrated as birth anniversaries.\n\nAlso, the Sikh New Year is observed on the same day as Baisakhi Day, which adds to its significance.\n\nI think I've covered most of the major Sikh festivals here. Among the options given\u2014Holi, Divali, Baisakhi Day, and Hola Mahalla\u2014the first two are not Sikh festivals, and between the latter two, Baisakhi Day seems to hold more importance due to its historical and spiritual significance.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be C. Baisakhi Day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
