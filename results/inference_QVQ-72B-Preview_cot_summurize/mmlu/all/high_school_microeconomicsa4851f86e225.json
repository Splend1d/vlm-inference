                    "text": "So I have this question about cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y, and it says the cross-price elasticity is +2.0. I need to figure out what that means. The options are:\n\nA. Goods X and Y are normal goods.\n\nB. Goods X and Y are inferior goods.\n\nC. Goods X and Y are complementary goods.\n\nD. Goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what cross-price elasticity is. I think it measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. So, if the price of good Y changes, how does the quantity demanded of good X change?\n\nThe formula for cross-price elasticity is:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{xy} = \\frac{\\%\\ \\text{change in quantity demanded of X}}{\\%\\ \\text{change in price of Y}}\n\\]\n\nAnd it's given that \\(\\eta_{xy} = +2.0\\).\n\nNow, I need to interpret what this positive value means in terms of the relationship between X and Y.\n\nOption A says they are normal goods. Normal goods are those where demand increases when income increases, and decreases when income decreases. But here, we're talking about cross-price elasticity, which involves changes in price of one good and quantity demanded of another good. So, this seems more related to substitution or complementarity, not directly to income effects. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption B is inferior goods. Inferior goods are the opposite of normal goods; demand decreases when income increases. Again, this seems more about income effects rather than cross-price elasticity. So, probably not relevant here.\n\nOption C is complementary goods. Complementary goods are pairs where an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the other. For example, if the price of gasoline goes up, people might drive less, so the quantity demanded of cars might decrease. So, in this case, the cross-price elasticity should be negative because quantity demanded moves in the opposite direction to the price of the complementary good.\n\nOption D is substitute goods. Substitute goods are pairs where an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other. For example, if the price of beef goes up, people might buy more chicken instead. So, here, the cross-price elasticity should be positive because quantity demanded moves in the same direction as the price of the substitute good.\n\nGiven that the cross-price elasticity is +2.0, which is positive, it suggests that when the price of Y increases, the quantity demanded of X increases. This sounds like the behavior of substitute goods.\n\nLet me double-check this understanding.\n\nFor complementary goods:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{xy} < 0\n\\]\n\nFor substitute goods:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{xy} > 0\n\\]\n\nSo, with \\(\\eta_{xy} = +2.0\\), it should indicate that X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options again.\n\nA. Normal goods: This relates to income elasticity of demand, not cross-price elasticity.\n\nB. Inferior goods: Again, this is about income elasticity, not cross-price elasticity.\n\nC. Complementary goods: This would require a negative cross-price elasticity, which is not the case here.\n\nD. Substitute goods: This matches the positive cross-price elasticity.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
