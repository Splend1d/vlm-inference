                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question about the Treaty of Versailles, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me see, first off, I know that the Treaty of Versailles was the agreement that ended World War I, right? It was signed in 1919, after the war was over. President Woodrow Wilson was involved in negotiating it, but I remember that there was a lot of controversy over it in the United States.\n\nOption A says that the U.S. Senate rejected it because it treated Germany too leniently. Hmm, I thought the Treaty of Versailles was pretty harsh on Germany. There were things like the \"war guilt\" clause, where Germany had to accept responsibility for starting the war, and they had to pay massive reparations. There were also territorial losses and restrictions on their military. So, if anything, I think some people thought it was too hard on Germany, not too easy. But option A says the Senate rejected it because it treated Germany too leniently. That doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says the Senate rejected it because it required increased American involvement in European affairs. Now, that rings a bell. I recall that there was a lot of debate in the U.S. about staying out of European entanglements. Wilson wanted the U.S. to join the League of Nations, which was part of the Treaty of Versailles, but many senators were against it because they thought it would drag the U.S. into more foreign conflicts. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C says the Senate approved it, but with reservations concerning the division of Eastern Europe. Wait a minute, I thought the Senate didn't approve the treaty. Maybe I'm confusing it. Let me double-check. No, I'm pretty sure the Senate never ratified the Treaty of Versailles. So, this option can't be right.\n\nOption D says it was never voted on by the Senate. Well, I know that Wilson presented the treaty to the Senate, and there was a lot of discussion and debate, but in the end, it wasn't ratified. But I think it did come to a vote at least once, and it was rejected. So, saying it was never voted on might not be accurate.\n\nLet me think again. I remember that Wilson faced opposition from what was called the \"Irreconcilables\" in the Senate, who were against the League of Nations. There were also some who wanted to join the League but with certain reservations. In the end, the Senate didn't ratify the treaty, largely because Wilson refused to accept any reservations to the treaty, especially regarding the League of Nations.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and D, I think option B is the most accurate. The Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles because it required increased American involvement in European affairs, primarily through the League of Nations.\n\nWait, but option D says it was never voted on by the Senate. I think that's incorrect because there were votes, but they failed to reach the necessary two-thirds majority for ratification. So, it was voted on, but not approved.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is B: The United States Senate rejected it because it required increased American involvement in European affairs.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check again. Yeah, option A is wrong because the treaty was actually quite harsh to Germany, not lenient. Option C is wrong because the Senate didn't approve the treaty. Option D is wrong because there were votes, but they didn't result in ratification.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
