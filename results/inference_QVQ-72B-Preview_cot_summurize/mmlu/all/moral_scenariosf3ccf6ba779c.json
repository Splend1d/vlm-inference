                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I sold exotic wild animals at the farmer's market.\n\nScenario 2: I was able to cloak my new discovery that I found while working late.\n\nAlright, so in Scenario 1, someone is selling exotic wild animals at a farmer's market. Now, I need to think about whether this is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet me consider some background information. In the US, there are laws and regulations regarding the sale of exotic animals, especially at public places like farmer's markets. Farmer's markets are typically places where local farmers sell their produce and products, and they might have specific rules about what can be sold there. Exotic wild animals might not be something you'd usually find at a farmer's market.\n\nMoreover, the trade of exotic animals can be controversial due to concerns about conservation, animal welfare, and potential health risks. There might be restrictions on selling certain species without proper permits or licenses.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, selling exotic wild animals could be seen as wrong because it might contribute to the exploitation of these animals, harm their populations, or pose risks to public health.\n\nBut, to be fair, I should consider whether the person selling these animals has the necessary permits or is doing it in a responsible way. However, the scenario doesn't provide that information, so I have to assume that selling exotic wild animals at a farmer's market is likely against ordinary moral standards.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: I was able to cloak my new discovery that I found while working late.\n\nThis one is a bit more vague. It seems like someone made a new discovery while working late and then cloaked it, meaning maybe kept it hidden or didn't share it immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"cloaking\" means in this context. Cloaking could mean hiding, concealing, or not disclosing information. So, the person found something new and didn't reveal it right away.\n\nNow, whether this is morally wrong depends on several factors:\n\n1. **Ownership of the discovery:** If the person was working for a company or an organization, the discovery might belong to the employer, and not disclosing it immediately could be seen as wrong.\n\n2. **Potential harm:** If keeping the discovery secret could harm others or put them at risk, then it could be morally wrong.\n\n3. **Intentions:** Why did the person cloak the discovery? Was it for personal gain, to think things through, or for another reason?\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't provide specifics about the context, I have to consider general moral standards.\n\nIn many workplaces, especially in research and development, employees are expected to report their discoveries promptly. Not doing so could be seen as\u8fdd\u80cc\u804c\u8d23 or against company policy, which might be considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there might be situations where cloaking a discovery could be justifiable, like if the person needed time to protect intellectual property or to ensure that the information was shared responsibly.\n\nBut again, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves selling exotic wild animals at a farmer's market, which is likely against moral standards due to potential harm to animals and possible legal issues.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves not disclosing a new discovery immediately, which might be against moral standards depending on the context, but it's less clear-cut compared to Scenario 1.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose among the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 seems more clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more ambiguous. Therefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the main character's actions in these two scenarios, and I need to judge whether they did something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, selling exotic wild animals is likely wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cloaking a discovery might or might not be wrong, depending on the context.\n\nTherefore, the first part is wrong, and the second part is not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that cloaking a discovery could be considered clearly morally wrong? Well, if the discovery was something critical that needed to be shared immediately for safety reasons, then yes, it could be wrong. But the scenario doesn't provide that information.\n\nSimilarly, if the person was contractually obligated to report discoveries immediately and failed to do so, that could be wrong.\n\nHowever, since the scenario doesn't specify these details, I have to base my judgment on the information given.\n\nTherefore, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
