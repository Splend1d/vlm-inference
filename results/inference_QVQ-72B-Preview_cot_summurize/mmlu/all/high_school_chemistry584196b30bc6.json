                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a 25 g sample of a liquid that's heated to 100 \u00b0C and then quickly moved to an insulated container with 100 g of water at 22 \u00b0C. After mixing, the final temperature is 35 \u00b0C. We need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on this information.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening here. When the hotter sample is added to the cooler water in an insulated container, heat will flow from the hotter sample to the cooler water until they reach a common final temperature. The insulation ensures that no heat is lost to the surroundings, so the total heat lost by the sample equals the total heat gained by the water. That's the principle of heat equilibrium in calorimetry.\n\nSo, the equation we can write is:\n\nHeat lost by the sample = Heat gained by the water\n\nOr, in terms of energy:\n\nq_sample = -q_water\n\nBecause heat lost is negative and heat gained is positive.\n\nNow, let's think about the temperatures and the changes in temperature.\n\nThe sample starts at 100 \u00b0C and ends at 35 \u00b0C, so its temperature change is 35 \u00b0C - 100 \u00b0C = -65 \u00b0C. That means it cooled down by 65 degrees.\n\nThe water starts at 22 \u00b0C and ends at 35 \u00b0C, so its temperature change is 35 \u00b0C - 22 \u00b0C = +13 \u00b0C. That means it warmed up by 13 degrees.\n\nSo, the sample's temperature decreased by 65 \u00b0C, and the water's temperature increased by 13 \u00b0C. Clearly, the sample's temperature change is larger in magnitude.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\n\nWell, in a closed system like this, the heat lost by the sample should equal the heat gained by the water, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings. So, even though the sample's temperature change is larger, the heat transferred should still be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\nWait, but does the magnitude of the temperature change directly determine the heat transferred? Not necessarily, because heat transfer also depends on the specific heat capacity (CP) and the mass of the substances.\n\nThe formula for heat is:\n\nq = m * CP * \u0394T\n\nWhere:\n\n- q is heat\n\n- m is mass\n\n- CP is specific heat capacity\n\n- \u0394T is change in temperature\n\nSo, for the sample:\n\nq_sample = m_sample * CP_sample * \u0394T_sample\n\nAnd for water:\n\nq_water = m_water * CP_water * \u0394T_water\n\nGiven that q_sample = -q_water (in a perfect insulated system), we have:\n\nm_sample * CP_sample * \u0394T_sample = - m_water * CP_water * \u0394T_water\n\nWe know the masses and the temperature changes, but not the specific heat capacities.\n\nGiven that, let's plug in the known values:\n\n25 g * CP_sample * (-65 \u00b0C) = - 100 g * 4.184 J/(g\u00b7\u00b0C) * 13 \u00b0C\n\nWait, I think I need to be careful here. The equation should be:\n\nm_sample * CP_sample * \u0394T_sample = - m_water * CP_water * \u0394T_water\n\nPlugging in:\n\n25 g * CP_sample * (-65 \u00b0C) = - 100 g * 4.184 J/(g\u00b7\u00b0C) * 13 \u00b0C\n\nSimplify:\n\n25 * CP_sample * (-65) = -100 * 4.184 * 13\n\nFirst, calculate the numerical values on the right side:\n\n100 * 4.184 = 418.4 J/\u00b0C\n\n418.4 * 13 = 5439.2 J\n\nSo:\n\n25 * CP_sample * (-65) = -5439.2\n\nNow, the negative signs on both sides will cancel out:\n\n25 * CP_sample * 65 = 5439.2\n\nNow, solve for CP_sample:\n\nCP_sample = 5439.2 / (25 * 65)\n\nCalculate numerator and denominator separately:\n\n25 * 65 = 1625\n\nSo:\n\nCP_sample = 5439.2 / 1625 \u2248 3.34 J/(g\u00b7\u00b0C)\n\nSo, CP_sample \u2248 3.34 J/(g\u00b7\u00b0C)\n\nNow, compare this to water's CP, which is 4.184 J/(g\u00b7\u00b0C).\n\nSo, CP_sample < CP_water\n\nNow, let's look back at the options.\n\nOption A says: The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\n\nBut according to the principle of conservation of energy in a closed system, the heat lost by the sample should equal the heat gained by the water. So, even though the sample's temperature change is larger, the heat transferred should be equal in magnitude.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect because it assumes that a larger temperature change implies more heat transfer, but that's not necessarily true when considering different specific heat capacities.\n\nOption B: The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\n\nThis seems correct based on the principle of conservation of energy. The \"but\" here might be a bit misleading because it's stating a contrast, but in reality, the heat lost by the sample does equal the heat gained by the water.\n\nSo, this option is essentially stating the same as option A but correcting the conclusion.\n\nOption C: The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\n\nBut from our calculation, CP_sample \u2248 3.34 J/(g\u00b7\u00b0C), which is less than water's CP of 4.184 J/(g\u00b7\u00b0C). So, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D: The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average starting temperature.\n\nSample: 100 \u00b0C, 25 g\n\nWater: 22 \u00b0C, 100 g\n\nTotal mass: 25 g + 100 g = 125 g\n\nAverage temperature = (25 g * 100 \u00b0C + 100 g * 22 \u00b0C) / 125 g\n\n= (2500 + 2200) / 125 = 4700 / 125 = 37.6 \u00b0C\n\nBut the final temperature is 35 \u00b0C, which is indeed less than the average starting temperature of 37.6 \u00b0C.\n\nNow, the conclusion is that the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n\nBut in an insulated container with no heat exchange with the surroundings, the total energy should remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy.\n\nSo, unless there's some other process occurring that's releasing energy, the total energy shouldn't change.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the correct conclusion.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nOption B states: The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\n\nThis is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy in a closed system. The heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water.\n\nOption A incorrectly concludes that the sample lost more heat than the water gained, which isn't the case.\n\nOption C suggests that the sample has a higher specific heat capacity than water, which our calculation shows is not true.\n\nOption D makes an incorrect conclusion about the total energy decreasing, when in reality, it should remain constant in an insulated system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
