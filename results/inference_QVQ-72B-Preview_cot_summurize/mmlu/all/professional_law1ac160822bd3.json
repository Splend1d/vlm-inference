Let me try to understand all the details first.\n\nThe landlord owns a piece of land with an office building on it. They lease it to a tenant for seven years, starting on August 1, 2001, and ending on July 31, 2008. The tenant has to pay $750 per month on the first day of each month. After three years, which would be August 1, 2004, the tenant assigns the rest of the lease to an attorney, who takes possession right away. Then, in 2005, the attorney assigns his interest to a doctor, who also takes possession but doesn't pay rent for two months. Because of this, the landlord sues the original tenant for the unpaid rent.\n\nNow, I need to figure out who should win this case. The options are:\n\nA. The landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.\n\nB. The landlord, because he didn't object to the assignments.\n\nC. The tenant, because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable.\n\nD. The tenant, because his assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what an assignment of a lease means. When a tenant assigns the lease to someone else, they're transferring their rights and obligations under the lease to that new person. So, in this case, the original tenant assigned the lease to an attorney after three years, and then the attorney assigned it to a doctor.\n\nGenerally, when you assign a lease, the assignee steps into the shoes of the assignor and takes over the responsibilities of the lease. But does the original tenant still have any obligations?\n\nI think there's a concept called \"privity of contract\" and \"privity of estate.\" Privity of contract means the direct relationship between the landlord and the tenant who signed the lease. When a tenant assigns the lease, the assignee steps into the tenant's shoes regarding the leasehold interest, which is privity of estate.\n\nBut in terms of privity of contract, the original tenant might still be liable to the landlord for the rent, depending on the terms of the assignment and whether there was a novation.\n\nNovation is when the original contract is extinguished, and a new contract is created in its place. For a novation to occur, there needs to be an agreement between all parties involved to substitute the original obligor with the new one.\n\nIn this case, the original tenant assigned the lease to an attorney, who then assigned it to a doctor. There's no mention of the landlord agreeing to release the original tenant from their obligations. So, unless there's an agreement to the contrary, the original tenant might still be liable for the rent.\n\nBut wait, the question says that after three years, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to an attorney, who took immediate possession. Then, in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor.\n\nI need to consider if these assignments were with the landlord's consent or if there are any clauses in the lease that allow assignments without consent.\n\nThe lease provisions only include the rent amount and the term, so there's no mention of assignment clauses. If there's no clause in the lease requiring the landlord's consent for assignment, then generally, the tenant can assign the lease without the landlord's approval.\n\nHowever, even if the tenant assigns the lease, in many jurisdictions, the original tenant remains secondarily liable for the rent unless there's a novation or a specific agreement releasing them from liability.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose the original tenant assigns the lease to the attorney. Unless there's a novation where the landlord agrees to look only to the attorney for rent payments, the original tenant might still be on the hook if the attorney doesn't pay.\n\nSimilarly, when the attorney assigns to the doctor, the same principle applies. Unless there's a novation, the original tenant and the attorney might still be liable if the doctor doesn't pay.\n\nBut in this scenario, the landlord is suing the original tenant directly for the unpaid rent.\n\nOption A says the landlord should win because the tenant's contractual obligation survived the assignments.\n\nOption B says the landlord should win because he didn't object to the assignments.\n\nOption C says the tenant should win because only the doctor, as the current assignee, would be liable.\n\nOption D says the tenant should win because the assignment to the attorney was a novation that extinguished the tenant's obligation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if there was a novation when the tenant assigned the lease to the attorney.\n\nNovation requires the agreement of all parties\u2014the landlord, the original tenant, and the new tenant\u2014to substitute the original tenant's obligations with the new tenant's.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify any such agreement, I can't assume that a novation occurred. Therefore, option D seems unlikely.\n\nOption C suggests that only the doctor is liable. But the doctor is the last assignee, and unless there's a novation at each step, the original tenant might still be liable.\n\nOption B mentions that the landlord didn't object to the assignments. Is that relevant?\n\nWell, if the lease required the landlord's consent to assign, and the landlord didn't object, that might imply consent. But again, the lease provisions aren't clear on that.\n\nWait, the lease provisions only include the rent amount and the term, so there's no clause about assignment. Therefore, the tenant could assign the lease without the landlord's consent unless there's a default rule in law requiring consent.\n\nBut even if the assignments were valid, the question is about who is liable for the unpaid rent.\n\nIn many lease assignments, unless there's a novation, the original tenant remains secondarily liable for the rent.\n\nSo, if the doctor didn't pay the rent, and there was no novation, the landlord could sue the doctor first, and if the doctor can't pay, then the landlord could sue the attorney, and so on up the chain to the original tenant.\n\nBut in this case, the landlord is suing the original tenant directly.\n\nSo, unless there's a specific agreement releasing the original tenant from liability upon assignment, the landlord can hold the original tenant responsible for the rent.\n\nTherefore, options A and B suggest the landlord should win, while options C and D suggest the tenant should win.\n\nGiven that there's no mention of a novation or any agreement releasing the original tenant from liability, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\nThe landlord should win because the tenant's contractual obligation survived the assignments.\n\nOption B says the landlord should win because he didn't object to the assignments. But that seems like a weaker reason compared to the direct contractual obligation.\n\nOption C says the tenant should win because only the doctor is liable. But without a novation, the original tenant might still be liable.\n\nOption D claims there was a novation, but there's no evidence to support that in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A: the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
