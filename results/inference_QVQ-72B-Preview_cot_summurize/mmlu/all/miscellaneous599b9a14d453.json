Atlantis, B. Mount Olympus, C. Saturn, D. in a saxophone. Hmm, interesting choices. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that Sun Ra was a prominent figure in jazz, especially known for his avant-garde style and his obsession with outer space themes. He often incorporated science fiction and Egyptian mythology into his music and performances, which makes him quite unique.\n\nNow, the question is about where he claimed to be born. I recall that Sun Ra was known for his eccentric statements and mysterious persona. He sometimes made claims that were outlandish, but that was part of his charm.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Atlantis: Atlantis is a legendary lost city mentioned by ancient philosophers like Plato. It's a place shrouded in mystery and myth, often associated with advanced knowledge and civilization. Sun Ra was fond of mythical and otherworldly references, so claiming to be from Atlantis would fit his image.\n\nB. Mount Olympus: This is the home of the ancient Greek gods. It's a real mountain in Greece but mythologically significant. Again, Sun Ra had an affinity for mythical and divine themes, so this could be a possibility.\n\nC. Saturn: Sun Ra was deeply interested in space and often referred to himself as coming from outer space. He even wrote a song called \"Saturn\" and frequently used space imagery in his performances. This seems like a strong possibility.\n\nD. In a saxophone: This one is a bit humorous and playful. While Sun Ra was a saxophonist and had a deep connection to the instrument, claiming to be born inside a saxophone seems more like a metaphorical statement rather than a literal one.\n\nI need to consider which of these places Sun Ra most frequently associated himself with. I remember that he often referred to himself as an alien and claimed to be from another planet, particularly Saturn. He even said that he was not from Earth and that his true home was elsewhere.\n\nGiven that, option C. Saturn seems the most plausible. His connection to Saturn was not just musical but also philosophical and spiritual. He saw Saturn as a symbol of infinity and used its imagery extensively in his work.\n\nHowever, I should double-check this information to be sure.

The question is: \"Where did jazz great Sun Ra claim he was born?\" and the options are A. Atlantis, B. Mount Olympus, C. Saturn, D. in a saxophone. Hmm, interesting choices.

His music often had themes related to space exploration and cosmic consciousness, which aligns with his claims of extraterrestrial origin.\n\nWhile he did incorporate elements of mythology and ancient civilizations like Atlantis and Mount Olympus into his work, his personal claims about his birthplace seem to point more towards Saturn.\n\nAs for the option D. in a saxophone, although Sun Ra had a profound connection to the saxophone and it was his primary instrument, claiming to be born inside one seems more like a playful remark rather than a serious claim about his birthplace.\n\nTherefore, based on the information I have, it appears that Sun Ra claimed to be born on Saturn.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
