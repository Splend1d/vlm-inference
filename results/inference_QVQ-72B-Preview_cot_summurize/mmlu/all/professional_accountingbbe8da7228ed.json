                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Greene is the sole shareholder of Seagull, which is an S corporation. That means Seagull's income passes through to Greene, and he reports it on his personal tax return. His initial basis in Seagull is $15,000. During the year, Seagull had an ordinary loss of $5,000 and received $2,000 in municipal bond interest. Also, Seagull distributed $6,000 in cash to Greene on November 1. We need to find out what Greene's basis is at the end of the year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how each of these events affects Greene's basis in Seagull. Starting with the initial basis of $15,000.\n\n1. Ordinary loss: Seagull had an ordinary loss of $5,000. For S corporations, losses reduce the shareholder's basis. So, I should subtract this loss from the basis.\n\n$15,000 - $5,000 = $10,000\n\n2. Municipal bond interest: Seagull received $2,000 in municipal bond interest. Now, municipal bond interest is generally tax-exempt, but I need to confirm how it affects the shareholder's basis in an S corporation.\n\nI recall that in S corporations, certain items are added to or subtracted from the shareholder's basis. Tax-exempt income like municipal bond interest is typically added to the basis because it increases the corporation's equity without being taxed at the shareholder level.\n\nSo, I should add the $2,000 municipal bond interest to the basis.\n\n$10,000 + $2,000 = $12,000\n\n3. Cash distribution: Seagull distributed $6,000 in cash to Greene on November 1. Cash distributions generally reduce the shareholder's basis.\n\nSo, I should subtract the $6,000 distribution from the basis.\n\n$12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I should double-check if there are any special rules regarding the timing of the distribution or any other considerations.\n\nI know that in S corporations, distributions are generally tax-free to the extent of the shareholder's basis. So, if the basis is reduced to zero, any excess distribution would be treated as a capital gain. But in this case, after the adjustments, the basis is $6,000, which is still positive.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if the municipal bond interest is indeed added to the basis. According to IRS regulations, tax-exempt income received by an S corporation increases the shareholder's basis because it's considered as contributing to the corporation's capital.\n\nLet me look that up quickly. Yes, per IRS Section 1367, certain items, including tax-exempt income, are added to the shareholder's basis.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct: $15,000 - $5,000 + $2,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. $4,000\n\nB. $6,000\n\nC. $14,000\n\nD. $15,000\n\nOption B is $6,000, which matches my calculation. But let's make sure there isn't something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the municipal bond interest isn't added to the basis? Or that the loss isn't fully deductible against the basis?\n\nI don't think so in this scenario. The loss is ordinary and doesn't exceed the adjusted basis before considering the distribution.\n\nAlso, since Greene is the sole shareholder, there are no other shareholders' bases to consider.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the distribution was made before or after the loss and the interest were allocated. But the problem states that the distribution was on November 1, and the losses and interest are for the entire year. Assuming it's a calendar-year corporation, the loss and interest would be allocated to the shareholder based on their ownership percentage, which is 100% in this case.\n\nSo, again, starting basis $15,000, minus loss $5,000, plus tax-exempt interest $2,000, minus distribution $6,000 equals $6,000.\n\nI think the answer is $6,000, which is option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any ordering rule that might affect the basis calculation. For example, does the loss reduce the basis before the distribution is made?\n\nYes, generally, losses reduce the basis first, and then distributions reduce the basis afterward.\n\nSo, in this sequence:\n\n1. Adjust basis for income and losses.\n\n2. Adjust basis for any distributions.\n\nWhich aligns with our calculation: $15,000 - $5,000 + $2,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be $6,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
