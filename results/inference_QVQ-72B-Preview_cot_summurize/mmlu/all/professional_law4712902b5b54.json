                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out what the court will decide about a right-of-way dispute. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are three parcels of land: western, central, and eastern, all abutting each other with the central parcel in the middle. The business owner owns the central parcel in fee simple and lives there. He has a right-of-way over the eastern parcel, which allows him to cross it on foot, by bike, or by car. The landscaper owns the eastern parcel, and the investor owns the western parcel but sells it to the business owner, who then builds a big 15-story office building on both the western and central parcels. This building houses 6,000 people during working hours each day.\n\nNow, all these office workers are using the right-of-way to cross the eastern parcel, and the business owner is also using it to deliver up to 30 loads of supplies per day. The landscaper is suing to stop both the business owner and the office workers from using this right-of-way.\n\nI need to determine what the court will most likely decide in this case. The options are:\n\nA. The business owner's right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers.\n\nB. The business owner's right-of-way would be forfeited due to the unauthorized use by the office workers.\n\nC. The business owner, by making use of the right-of-way beyond the scope of the original privilege, would permanently be enjoined from using the servient tenement.\n\nD. Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use.\n\nAlright, let's recall some basics about easements and rights of way. A right-of-way is a type of easement that gives someone the right to pass over another's land for a specified purpose. Easements can be appurtenant or in gross. An easement appurtenant is typically tied to the land and benefits the dominant tenement (the land that has the right) over the servient tenement (the land that bears the burden).\n\nIn this case, the business owner has a right-of-way over the eastern parcel, which is owned by the landscaper. The business owner originally owned only the central parcel but then acquired the western parcel and built an office building that covers both parcels.\n\nNow, the issue is the increased use of the right-of-way by both the business owner and the office workers. The original agreement allowed the business owner to cross the eastern parcel on foot, by bike, or by car. It doesn't specify any limits on the frequency or the purpose beyond personal use for accessing his property.\n\nWhen the business owner built the office building and started using the right-of-way for delivering 30 loads of supplies per day, and allowed 6,000 office workers to use it daily, this is likely beyond the original scope of the easement.\n\nIn property law, the scope of an easement is determined by its original terms. If the use exceeds those terms, it can be considered an overburdening of the easement, which may lead to legal action by the servient tenement owner (the landscaper).\n\nOption A suggests that the right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers. Extinction of an easement is a pretty severe measure, usually reserved for cases where the easement has been abandoned, released, or merged. Simply exceeding the scope of the easement might not lead to its extinction.\n\nOption B mentions forfeiture due to unauthorized use by the office workers. Forfeiture is another extreme remedy, often related to non-payment of rent or breach of lease conditions. In the context of an easement, it's not clear if forfeiture would apply.\n\nOption C says the business owner would be permanently enjoined from using the servient tenement because of use beyond the original privilege. An injunction is a possible remedy, but it's severe and would likely only be used if lesser remedies, like limiting the use to the original terms, were not feasible.\n\nOption D proposes that while the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from using it. This seems like a middle ground, where the original use by the business owner is still allowed, but the expanded use by others is restricted.\n\nGiven that the original right-of-way was likely intended for personal access by the business owner, not for commercial use by thousands of people and heavy deliveries, it's reasonable to assume that the increased use by the office workers and the deliveries are beyond the scope of the original easement.\n\nTherefore, the court might rule that the business owner can still use the right-of-way as originally agreed, but the office workers' use and the excessive deliveries are not permitted under the original terms.\n\nSo, option D seems the most plausible outcome: the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way personally, but the office workers would be enjoined from using it.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this more carefully. The business owner now has a large office building with thousands of employees. If the right-of-way was originally for personal access, but now the property is being used commercially, does that change things?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, when the character of the dominant tenement changes significantly, the easement may be expanded to accommodate the new use, but only to the extent necessary and within reason.\n\nHowever, without specific language in the original easement agreement allowing for such expansion, the servient tenement owner (the landscaper) is not obligated to accommodate the increased use.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the business owner is now using the right-of-way for commercial deliveries further complicates things. If the original easement was strictly for personal access, commercial use might be a violation.\n\nAdditionally, the increased traffic from 6,000 office workers could impose a significant burden on the eastern parcel, both in terms of wear and tear and potential interference with the landscaper's use of their property.\n\nThe landscaper is likely seeking to prevent this increased use because it negatively impacts their property.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the court would likely consider the terms of the original easement agreement, the intention of the parties at the time of granting the easement, and whether the increased use is consistent with that intention.\n\nGiven that the original easement was likely intended for personal access, not for a large commercial office building with thousands of employees and heavy deliveries, the court might rule that the business owner can only use the right-of-way as originally intended.\n\nTherefore, the business owner could continue to use the right-of-way for personal access on foot, by bike, or by car, but the expanded use by office workers and deliveries would be enjoined.\n\nSo, option D seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility that the easement could be expanded to accommodate the new use.\n\nOne concept that might come into play is the doctrine of necessity or implication of easements. If the business owner can show that the continued use of the right-of-way is necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the dominant tenement, the court might allow some expansion of the easement's use.\n\nBut in this case, the office building was built after the business owner acquired the western parcel, so the necessity might not be as strong as if the easement were created to access land that was landlocked or had no other means of access.\n\nMoreover, the increased use might be seen as a foreseeable consequence of building a large office building, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the original easement automatically expands to cover it.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the increased use constitutes an actionable nuisance or trespass. If the increased traffic and deliveries are causing significant harm to the landscaper's property or interfering with their use and enjoyment, the court might grant an injunction to prevent such use.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided, it seems most likely that the court would allow the business owner to continue using the right-of-way personally as originally agreed but would enjoin the office workers from using it, as their use exceeds the scope of the original easement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
