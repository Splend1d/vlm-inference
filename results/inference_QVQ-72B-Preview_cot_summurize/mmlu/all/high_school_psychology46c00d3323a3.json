                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about measures of central tendency when there are outliers in a distribution of scores. The options are standard deviation, range, median, and mean. I need to choose which one is most appropriate to use in this situation.\n\nFirst off, I should probably recall what each of these terms means. The standard deviation and range are both measures of spread or variability in the data, not central tendency. So, maybe they aren't the right choices here. Central tendency is about finding a typical or central value in the data, and the two main measures for that are the mean and the median.\n\nNow, the mean is just the average of all the scores. It's calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. The median, on the other hand, is the middle value when the data is ordered from least to greatest. If there's an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nThe question mentions that there are outliers in the distribution. Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from the rest of the data. They can skew the data and affect the measures of central tendency.\n\nI think I remember that the mean can be heavily influenced by outliers. If there are very high or very low scores, the mean can be pulled in the direction of those outliers. For example, if most scores are around 70, but there's one score of 100, the mean would be higher than it would be without that outlier.\n\nOn the other hand, the median is less affected by outliers because it's based on the position of the middle value. So, even if there are extreme values, once the data is ordered, the median will still be the middle value, which represents the center of the data pretty well.\n\nLet me think of an example to illustrate this. Suppose I have the following scores: 65, 70, 72, 75, 80, 85, 100. There are seven scores, and the median would be the fourth one, which is 75. The mean would be (65+70+72+75+80+85+100)/7 = 457/7 \u2248 65.2857. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculation.\n\n65 + 70 = 135\n\n135 + 72 = 207\n\n207 + 75 = 282\n\n282 + 80 = 362\n\n362 + 85 = 447\n\n447 + 100 = 547\n\nSo, 547 divided by 7 is indeed approximately 78.14. So, the mean is about 78.14, and the median is 75. In this case, the outlier of 100 has pulled the mean up higher than the median.\n\nIf there were no outliers, say scores: 65, 70, 72, 75, 80, 85, 87, then the mean would be (65+70+72+75+80+85+87)/7 = 534/7 \u2248 76.2857, and the median would be 75. Here, the mean is only slightly higher than the median, which makes sense because there are no extreme outliers.\n\nSo, when there are outliers, the mean can be misleading because it's being pulled by those extreme values. The median, however, remains closer to the typical value in the dataset.\n\nTherefore, in the presence of outliers, the median is a better measure of central tendency because it's less affected by extreme values.\n\nWait a minute, let's consider another scenario. Suppose I have scores: 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102. Here, the median is 96, and the mean is (90+92+94+96+98+100+102)/7 = 662/7 \u2248 94.57, which is slightly lower than the median. So, in this case, the outlier is higher than the other values, and the mean is still being pulled upwards, but not as much as in the previous example because the scores are generally higher.\n\nNow, if I have a distribution with a low outlier, say scores: 50, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85. The median is 70, and the mean is (50+60+65+70+75+80+85)/7 = 485/7 \u2248 69.2857, which is slightly lower than the median. So, here, the low outlier is pulling the mean downwards.\n\nThis reinforces that the mean is sensitive to outliers, whether they are high or low, and the median is more resistant to such extreme values.\n\nTherefore, when dealing with a distribution that has outliers, the median is the more appropriate measure of central tendency to use because it provides a better representation of the typical value in the dataset.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. median.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Are there any cases where using the mean might still be preferable even with outliers?\n\nWell, the mean uses all the data points, which can be an advantage in some situations, but when there are outliers, it can be misleading. In such cases, the median is generally preferred because it's robust to outliers.\n\nAdditionally, in some fields, people might use trimmed means, which involve removing a certain percentage of the highest and lowest scores before calculating the mean, to reduce the impact of outliers. However, that's not one of the options here.\n\nAnother consideration is the purpose of analyzing the data. If the outlier is a valid data point and should be included in the analysis, then deciding between mean and median depends on the context and the importance of robustness against outliers.\n\nBut given the options provided\u2014standard deviation, range, median, and mean\u2014the best choice for measuring central tendency in the presence of outliers is the median.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. median.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
