                    "text": "So Manuel bought a used car for six thousand forty-nine dollars, and I need to write that as a numeral. Let me see, I'm a bit rusty on my numbers, but I'll try to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"six thousand forty-nine\" means. I know that numbers have places, like thousands, hundreds, tens, and units. So, six thousand is 6,000, and forty-nine is 49. If I add them together, it should be 6,000 + 49, which is 6,049.\n\nLet me double-check that. In the number 6,049:\n\n- The '6' is in the thousands place, so it's six thousand.\n\n- The '0' is in the hundreds place, so that's zero hundreds.\n\n- The '4' is in the tens place, which is forty.\n\n- The '9' is in the units place, which is nine.\n\nSo, combining these, it's six thousand and forty-nine, which is $6,049.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $649\n\nB. $6,049\n\nC. $6,409\n\nD. $6,490\n\nIt seems like option B is the correct one. But just to be sure, let's consider if there could be any confusion.\n\nMaybe someone would misinterpret \"six thousand forty-nine\" as six thousand and forty-nine, which would be 6,049, or perhaps six thousand forty-nine could be misunderstood as 6,490, but that doesn't seem right because forty-nine should be the last two digits.\n\nWait, maybe thinking in terms of thousands and hundreds. Six thousand is 6,000. Forty-nine is 49. Adding them gives 6,049. So, option B is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can visualize counting up to six thousand forty-nine. Starting from six thousand, then adding forty-nine would bring me to 6,049.\n\nAlternatively, if I look at the number 6,490, that would be six thousand four hundred ninety, which is different from six thousand forty-nine. Similarly, 6,409 would be six thousand four hundred nine, and 649 is just six hundred forty-nine, which is way less than six thousand.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be option B: $6,049.\n\nI don't think there's any other way to interpret \"six thousand forty-nine\" other than 6,049. It's straightforward once you break it down into the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 6,049} \\]"
