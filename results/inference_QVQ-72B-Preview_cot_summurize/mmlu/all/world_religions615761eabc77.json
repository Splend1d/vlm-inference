Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that icons are like religious images, usually paintings, that are used for veneration or as focal points in worship. They're especially associated with Eastern Christianity, but I think they're also used in some other traditions.\n\nLet me think about the Anglican Church first. Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition, and from what I recall, while they might have some imagery in their churches, icons aren't necessarily a central feature. Maybe in some Anglican churches, but I don't think they're as prevalent as in other denominations.\n\nNext, the Catholic Church. Catholics are known for using a lot of art and imagery in their worship spaces, including statues and paintings. But when I think of icons, I tend to think more of the Orthodox tradition. Catholics do have devotional images, but again, I don't think they're as integral to their worship as they are in Orthodoxy.\n\nThen there's the Orthodox Church. This seems like a strong candidate. Orthodox Christianity has a rich tradition of iconography, and icons are a central part of their worship and theology. They're used in churches, homes, and are often kissed or venerated during services. The Orthodox Church places a high value on icons as a way to connect with the divine.\n\nLastly, the Lutheran Church. Lutherans are a Protestant denomination, and while they might have some decorative elements in their churches, icons aren't typically a part of their tradition. I think their focus is more on the Word of God and the sacraments, rather than on iconic representations.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the Orthodox Church is the one where icons are a main feature. I remember learning that the Orthodox Church has a long history with iconography, and there have even been controversies and debates about the use of icons, like during the Iconoclast Controversy in the Byzantine Empire.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or variations within these denominations. For example, in some Catholic churches, especially those with Eastern Rites, icons might be used more prominently. But even then, the Orthodox Church still seems to place a higher emphasis on icons across the board.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in the Anglican Communion, there is a wide range of practice, from very traditional and ceremonial to quite simple and modern. So, while some Anglican churches might use icons, it's not a universal practice within the denomination.\n\nIn contrast, in the Orthodox Church, the use of icons is universal and deeply ingrained in their liturgical life. They're not just decorative; they serve a theological purpose, acting as windows to the heavenly realm.\n\nI think I've got it now. The correct answer should be C. Orthodox.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Orthodox}} \\]"
