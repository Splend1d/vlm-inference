                    "text": "Okay, so I need to find out Baxter Co's inventory turnover for the year. The information given is:\n\n- Beginning inventory: $200,000\n\n- End of year inventory: $300,000\n\n- Cost of goods sold (COGS) during the year: $500,000\n\nFirst, I need to recall what inventory turnover is. I think it's a measure of how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory over a certain period, usually a year. So, higher turnover is generally better because it means the company is selling its inventory quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe formula for inventory turnover that I remember is:\n\nInventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nSo, I need to find the average inventory for the year.\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + End Inventory) / 2\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nAverage Inventory = ($200,000 + $300,000) / 2\n\nAverage Inventory = $500,000 / 2\n\nAverage Inventory = $250,000\n\nNow, plug this into the inventory turnover formula:\n\nInventory Turnover = $500,000 / $250,000\n\nInventory Turnover = 2\n\nSo, Baxter's inventory turnover for the year is 2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm using the correct formula. Sometimes, different sources might have slightly different ways of calculating inventory turnover.\n\nI recall that another way to calculate inventory turnover is:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / (Beginning Inventory)\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because it doesn't account for the ending inventory. Using average inventory makes more sense because it smoothes out fluctuations during the year.\n\nAlternatively, some companies might use the ending inventory in the denominator, but again, average inventory is more accurate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the inventory turnover is calculated using the cost of goods sold or sales revenue. In this case, it's clearly stated as COGS, so I think I'm on the right track.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I can calculate the inventory turnover period, which is another related metric, but that's not what the question is asking for.\n\nInventory turnover period = 365 days / Inventory turnover ratio\n\nBut again, that's not necessary here since the question just asks for the inventory turnover.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the gross profit or other factors, but no, the cost of goods sold is directly given, so that shouldn't be necessary.\n\nLet me verify my calculation once more:\n\nAverage Inventory = ($200,000 + $300,000) / 2 = $250,000\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory = $500,000 / $250,000 = 2\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 1.5\n\nC. 2\n\nD. 2.5\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other information or potential pitfalls in the question.\n\nIs there any possibility of inventory write-downs, returns, or other adjustments that might affect the inventory figures? The problem doesn't specify any such events, so I assume the given inventory figures are accurate.\n\nAlso, is the cost of goods sold inclusive of beginning inventory and purchases? Again, the problem provides the COGS directly, so I don't need to adjust for that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the inventory turnover is being calculated on a yearly basis or another period, but the problem specifies \"for the year.\"\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and my calculation stands.\n\nInventory Turnover = 2\n\nSo, the answer is C. 2\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
