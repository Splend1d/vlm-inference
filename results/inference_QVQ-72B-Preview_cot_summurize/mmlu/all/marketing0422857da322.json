I'm not entirely sure about what a trade discount is, but I think it has something to do with discounts given between businesses, not directly to consumers. Let me see.\n\nOption A says a lumberyard offers a discount to a homeowner for buying lumber. Hmm, a homeowner is probably the end-user here, right? So, that sounds like a discount to the consumer, not necessarily a trade discount.\n\nOption B mentions a retailer offering a discount to a consumer for buying out-of-season merchandise. Again, that seems like a direct discount to the consumer based on the timing of the purchase. Not sure if that's considered a trade discount.\n\nOption C says a producer offers a discount to retailers for promoting its product during the month of June. This one seems interesting. It's about a producer giving a discount to retailers, which suggests it's a business-to-business transaction, not directly involving the final consumer. The discount is tied to promoting the product in a specific month, which could be an incentive for the retailers to push that product more during that time.\n\nOption D is about a car dealer offering a discount to a customer in exchange for a used car. This seems like a trade-in scenario, where the customer is exchanging their old car for a discount on a new one. This is more about the customer's transaction with the dealer, not a trade discount between businesses.\n\nFrom what I can gather, a trade discount is typically offered by manufacturers or wholesalers to retailers or other businesses in the supply chain, often based on the quantity purchased or for performing certain marketing activities. So, in this context, option C seems to fit the bill best. It's a discount offered by the producer to the retailers for promoting the product, which is likely to increase sales and benefit the producer's marketing efforts.\n\nI think the answer is C. A producer offers a discount to retailers for promoting its product during the month of June.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
