                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find all positive integer values of \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\) is a factor of 1200, and then sum those values up. Okay, first things first, I should probably start by factoring 1200 to understand its divisors better.\n\nSo, let's factorize 1200:\n\n1200 = 120 \u00d7 10 = 24 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 = 24 \u00d7 50 = Wait, that's not the prime factorization. Let me try again.\n\n1200 can be divided by 2:\n\n1200 \u00f7 2 = 600\n\n600 \u00f7 2 = 300\n\n300 \u00f7 2 = 150\n\n150 \u00f7 2 = 75\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25\n\n25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 1200 is \\( 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\nNow, I need \\( n^2 \\) to be a factor of 1200. That means that \\( n^2 \\) must divide 1200 evenly. Since \\( n^2 \\) is a square, every prime in its factorization must have an even exponent.\n\nSo, let's consider the exponents in the prime factorization of \\( n \\). If \\( n = 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c \\), then \\( n^2 = 2^{2a} \\times 3^{2b} \\times 5^{2c} \\).\n\nFor \\( n^2 \\) to be a factor of 1200, we must have:\n\n\\( 2^{2a} \\times 3^{2b} \\times 5^{2c} \\) divides \\( 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\nThis means that:\n\n2a \u2264 4\n\n2b \u2264 1\n\n2c \u2264 2\n\nSo, dividing by 2:\n\na \u2264 2\n\nb \u2264 0.5\n\nc \u2264 1\n\nSince a, b, c are non-negative integers (because they're exponents in the prime factorization), and a, c must be integers, but b can only be 0 because 0.5 isn't an integer.\n\nWait a minute, but b can be 0 or 1, but since 2b must be even, and 2(0.5) = 1, which is odd, b cannot be 0.5. So, b must be 0.\n\nTherefore, b can only be 0 because exponents must be integers.\n\nSo, b = 0.\n\nFor a, since a \u2264 2, a can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nFor c, since c \u2264 1, c can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo, possible values for a: 0, 1, 2\n\nPossible values for b: 0\n\nPossible values for c: 0, 1\n\nNow, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. a=0, b=0, c=0\n\nn = 2^0 \u00d7 3^0 \u00d7 5^0 = 1\n\nn^2 = 1, which divides 1200.\n\n2. a=0, b=0, c=1\n\nn = 2^0 \u00d7 3^0 \u00d7 5^1 = 5\n\nn^2 = 25, which divides 1200.\n\n3. a=1, b=0, c=0\n\nn = 2^1 \u00d7 3^0 \u00d7 5^0 = 2\n\nn^2 = 4, which divides 1200.\n\n4. a=1, b=0, c=1\n\nn = 2^1 \u00d7 3^0 \u00d7 5^1 = 10\n\nn^2 = 100, which divides 1200.\n\n5. a=2, b=0, c=0\n\nn = 2^2 \u00d7 3^0 \u00d7 5^0 = 4\n\nn^2 = 16, which divides 1200.\n\n6. a=2, b=0, c=1\n\nn = 2^2 \u00d7 3^0 \u00d7 5^1 = 20\n\nn^2 = 400, which divides 1200.\n\nSo, the possible n values are 1, 5, 2, 10, 4, and 20.\n\nNow, I need to sum these up: 1 + 5 + 2 + 10 + 4 + 20.\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1 + 5 = 6\n\n6 + 2 = 8\n\n8 + 10 = 18\n\n18 + 4 = 22\n\n22 + 20 = 42\n\nSo, the sum is 42.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, 42 is one of them. But let me double-check if I've missed any possible n values.\n\nIs there any other combination where a, b, c could be different?\n\nWait, b is always 0 because b can only be 0.\n\nIs there any possibility of higher exponents for a or c?\n\nWell, a can be up to 2, and c up to 1, as per the earlier constraints.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all possible n values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem without listing all possible n values.\n\nLet me think about the general approach.\n\nIf \\( n^2 \\) divides 1200, then \\( n^2 \\) is a divisor of 1200.\n\nGiven that, the number of possible \\( n^2 \\) divisors corresponds to the number of perfect squares that divide 1200.\n\nIn general, the number of divisors of a number is found by taking the exponents in its prime factorization, adding one, and multiplying them.\n\nFor 1200, which is \\( 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\), the total number of divisors is (4+1)(1+1)(2+1) = 5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 30.\n\nBut we're interested in the number of square divisors.\n\nThe number of square divisors is found by taking the floor of each exponent divided by 2, adding one, and multiplying them.\n\nSo, for \\( 2^4 \\), floor(4/2) + 1 = 3\n\nFor \\( 3^1 \\), floor(1/2) + 1 = 1\n\nFor \\( 5^2 \\), floor(2/2) + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the number of square divisors is 3 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 = 6.\n\nWhich matches the six n values I found earlier: 1, 5, 2, 10, 4, 20.\n\nNow, summing these up again: 1 + 5 + 2 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 42.\n\nSo, the answer should be 42.\n\nBut let me check if there's a formula or a smarter way to compute this sum without listing all n values.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's a formula for the sum of n where \\( n^2 \\) divides m, for some m.\n\nI recall that the sum of n where \\( n^2 \\) divides m is equal to the product of sums for each prime factor.\n\nSpecifically, for m = \\( p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_k^{a_k} \\), the sum is:\n\n\\( \\prod (p_i^{0} + p_i^{1} + \\dots + p_i^{\\lfloor a_i/2 \\rfloor}) \\)\n\nFor 1200 = \\( 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\), the sum would be:\n\nFor 2: \\( 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \\)\n\nFor 3: \\( 3^0 = 1 \\)\n\nFor 5: \\( 5^0 + 5^1 = 1 + 5 = 6 \\)\n\nSo, the sum is 7 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 6 = 42.\n\nWhich confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the sum is indeed 42.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 42\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 36\n\nD. 39\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 42.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]"
