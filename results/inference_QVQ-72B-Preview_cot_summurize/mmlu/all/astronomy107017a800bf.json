                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which constellation is a bright W-shaped one in the northern sky. The options are Centaurus, Cygnus, Cassiopeia, and Cepheus. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that constellations are groups of stars that form recognizable patterns in the sky. They have names and are used to help navigate or tell stories about the heavens. But which one is specifically known for having a bright W-shape in the northern sky?\n\nLet me think about Centaurus. I recall that Centaurus is actually a southern hemisphere constellation, famous for containing Alpha Centauri, which is one of the nearest stars to the Sun. But since it's in the southern sky, it probably isn't the one being referred to here. So, maybe I can eliminate option A.\n\nNext is Cygnus. I think Cygnus is in the northern sky and is known for its shape resembling a cross or a swan in flight. It's a prominent summer constellation. But I don't remember it having a W-shape. Maybe it's not the right one either.\n\nThen there's Cassiopeia. Now, Cassiopeia is definitely in the northern sky and is known for its distinctive W-shape. In fact, it's one of the easiest constellations to recognize because of that bright W. It's almost always visible in the northern hemisphere, circling around the North Star, Polaris. So, that seems like a strong candidate.\n\nLastly, Cepheus. I'm less familiar with Cepheus. I think it's also in the northern sky, but I don't recall it having a bright W-shape. Maybe it has a different shape altogether.\n\nSo, based on this, Cassiopeia seems to be the constellation that fits the description: bright and W-shaped in the northern sky. I think the answer should be C. Cassiopeia.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should double-check. Let's see, if I imagine the night sky in the north, Cassiopeia is indeed up there, rotating around Polaris. Its W-shape is made up of five bright stars, which are easy to spot. On the other hand, Cygnus is more towards the east and west during the summer, and its shape is more like a cross or a swan, not really a W.\n\nCentaurus, as I thought earlier, is in the southern sky and is not visible from places too far north. Cepheus, while in the northern sky, has a shape that's more like a house or a castle, I believe, not a W.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Cassiopeia is the correct answer. It's a bright, easily recognizable W-shaped constellation in the northern sky.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Cassiopeia}} \\]"
