Robbie Chip Ernie, D. Huey Dewey Louie. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that Donald Duck is a famous cartoon character from Disney. He's known for his temperamental personality and distinctive speech. He has three nephews, and I think their names are Huey, Dewey, and Louie. But let me make sure I'm not confusing them with other characters.\n\nOption A is Quick Quack Quock. That sounds made up, doesn't it? I don't recall any of Donald's nephews having such names. Maybe it's a trick option.\n\nOption B is Alvin Simon Theodore. Wait a minute, that sounds familiar, but I think that's the name of the Chipmunks, not Donald's nephews. Alvin and the Chipmunks is a different franchise, isn't it? So, probably not the right answer.\n\nOption C is Robbie Chip Ernie. Hmm, I don't recognize these names in relation to Donald Duck's nephews. Maybe Robbie and Chip are related to some other characters, but I'm not sure. Ernie sounds like another character altogether.\n\nOption D is Huey Dewey Louie, which is what I initially thought. I remember Huey, Dewey, and Louie being Donald's nephews. They are known for their mischievous behavior and often get into adventures with their uncle.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that in the Disney comics and cartoons, Donald has these three nephews who are identical and always wear different-colored shirts to tell them apart. Huey is usually wearing orange, Dewey has blue, and Louie has red. That helps distinguish them.\n\nAlso, I think Huey, Dewey, and Louie first appeared in a comic story in 1937, and they've been prominent characters in the Disney universe ever since. They've been featured in various animated series, including \"DuckTales,\" where they go on exciting quests with their wealthy great-uncle Scrooge McDuck.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other characters that might be confused with Donald's nephews. For example, in some adaptations, there might be similar characters, but I'm pretty confident that Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the canonical names of Donald's nephews.\n\nI should also consider if there are any regional variations or translations that might affect the names, but since the question is in English, I assume it's referring to the English names as they are commonly known.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe the correct answer is D. Huey Dewey Louie. It just makes the most sense, given my knowledge of Disney characters and their relationships.\n\nTo wrap it up, Donald Duck's three nephews are Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Therefore, the correct choice is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
