                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about experimental design and observational studies, and I need to figure out which statement is true. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nOption A says that while properly designed experiments can strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships, a complete census is the only way of establishing such a relationship. Hmm, I thought that experiments were the way to establish cause and effect. In an experiment, you manipulate one variable and see how it affects another, right? Like, if you want to know if studying more leads to better grades, you might assign different amounts of study time to different groups and see who scores higher. That seems to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nBut option A is saying that only a complete census can establish cause and effect. Wait, what's a complete census? Is that when you survey or measure the entire population? Like, instead of doing an experiment, you collect data from everyone and see if there's a relationship. But I thought that even with a census, you might not be able to establish cause and effect because you're not controlling variables. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In statistics, there's a saying that correlation doesn't imply causation. So, just because two things happen together, it doesn't mean one causes the other. Experiments are designed to control for other variables, so you can be more confident about causation. But does a complete census somehow overcome that? I don't think so. Maybe option A is false, but I should double-check.\n\nMoving on to option B: it says that if properly designed, observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments. Observational studies are where you observe what's happening without manipulating anything. So, in the studying and grades example, you might just look at how much people study and their grades without assigning them to study more or less.\n\nI thought that while observational studies can show correlations, they're not as strong as experiments in establishing causation because you can't control for all possible confounding variables. Even if the study is well-designed, there might be factors you haven't accounted for that could influence the results. So, I'm skeptical about this statement. Probably, experiments are still better for establishing cause and effect.\n\nOption C says that controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies. This seems plausible. Often, researchers will notice a pattern in observational data and then design an experiment to test whether there's a causal relationship.\n\nFor example, maybe an observational study finds that people who eat more fruits and vegetables have lower rates of heart disease. Then, researchers might conduct a controlled experiment where one group is told to eat more fruits and veggies and another group continues with their usual diet, to see if there's a difference in heart health markers. So, this seems like a reasonable approach, and therefore, this statement might be true.\n\nLastly, option D says that a useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size. I know that increasing the sample size can help make the results more precise and reduce the margin of error, but does it directly overcome bias? Bias is systematic error, meaning it's consistently off in one direction, unlike random error, which can go either way.\n\nIncreasing the sample size helps with random error because more data points can give a better estimate of the true population parameters. However, if there's bias in how the data is collected or if there are systematic differences in the groups being compared, increasing the sample size won't necessarily fix that. So, I think this statement is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on my thinking, option C seems to be the true statement. Controlled experiments are indeed often used to confirm cause-and-effect relationships suggested by observational studies. Options A, B, and D seem to be misleading or incorrect based on my understanding.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me summarize why I think C is correct:\n\n- Observational studies can suggest associations or correlations between variables.\n\n- Controlled experiments allow researchers to manipulate variables and observe the effects, thereby establishing cause-and-effect relationships more confidently.\n\n- Thus, it makes sense to use experiments to confirm the causal relationships hinted at by observational data.\n\nI think that's a solid reasoning. So, my final answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
