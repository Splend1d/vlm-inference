                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, as of December 1, year 2, the company has several debts:\n\n1. A $1,000,000 line of credit maturing in one year, of which $250,000 has been drawn.\n\n2. A $750,000 secured note due in five annual installments.\n\n3. A $300,000 three-year balloon note.\n\nAnd it's mentioned that the company has no other liabilities. We need to figure out how to present these debts in the classified balance sheet as of December 31, year 2, assuming no debt repayments were made in December.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a classified balance sheet is. It typically classifies assets and liabilities into current and non-current (or long-term) categories. Current liabilities are those due within one year, while long-term liabilities are due beyond that.\n\nLet's look at each debt:\n\n1. **Line of credit:** $1,000,000 maturing in one year, with $250,000 drawn.\n\nSince the entire line of credit matures in one year, the amount drawn ($250,000) should be classified as a current liability. The undrawn portion ($1,000,000 - $250,000 = $750,000) isn't a liability yet because it hasn't been borrowed. So, only the drawn amount should be considered as a current liability.\n\n2. **Secured note:** $750,000 due in five annual installments.\n\nThis is a note payable with annual payments over five years. Since it's paid in installments, each payment would be a current liability if it's due within one year. But I need to know how much is due in the next year.\n\n3. **Balloon note:** $300,000 due in three years.\n\nA balloon note typically requires the entire amount to be paid at the end of the term, which in this case is three years from December 1, year 2. So, the payment is due in three years, which makes it a long-term liability.\n\nNow, the problem states that no debt repayments were made in December, so the amounts remain the same as of December 1.\n\nLet's calculate the current and long-term liabilities.\n\n**Current liabilities:**\n\n- Drawn amount on the line of credit: $250,000\n\n- First installment of the secured note: need to find out how much that is.\n\nThe secured note is $750,000 due in five annual installments. So, each installment would be $750,000 / 5 = $150,000. Therefore, the first installment of $150,000 is due within the next year.\n\nSo, current liabilities would be:\n\n- Line of credit drawn: $250,000\n\n- First installment of secured note: $150,000\n\nTotal current liabilities: $250,000 + $150,000 = $400,000\n\n**Long-term liabilities:**\n\n- Remaining secured note after the first installment: $750,000 - $150,000 = $600,000\n\n- Balloon note: $300,000\n\nTotal long-term liabilities: $600,000 + $300,000 = $900,000\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Current liabilities of $1,000,000; long-term liabilities of $1,050,000\n\nB. Current liabilities of $500,000; long-term liabilities of $1,550,000\n\nC. Current liabilities of $400,000; long-term liabilities of $900,000\n\nD. Current liabilities of $500,000; long-term liabilities of $800,000\n\nBased on my calculations, option C seems correct: current liabilities of $400,000 and long-term liabilities of $900,000.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst, confirming the line of credit: $250,000 drawn, maturing in one year, so correctly classified as current.\n\nSecured note: $750,000 in five annual installments. Each installment is $150,000, so the first installment is current, and the remaining $600,000 is long-term.\n\nBalloon note: $300,000 due in three years, which is long-term.\n\nSo, total current liabilities: $250,000 + $150,000 = $400,000\n\nTotal long-term liabilities: $600,000 + $300,000 = $900,000\n\nYes, option C matches this calculation.\n\nI think the other options might be distractors or based on misclassifications, but based on standard accounting principles, this seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
