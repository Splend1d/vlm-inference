                    "text": "So I have this question here about the relationship between the vapor pressure of a liquid and the heat of vaporization. It's asking which equation expresses this relationship, and the options are the Rydberg equation, the Gibbs free energy equation, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and the Arrhenius equation. Hmm, I need to recall which one of these equations relates vapor pressure and heat of vaporization.\n\nFirst, let's think about what vapor pressure and heat of vaporization are. Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid at a given temperature. It increases with temperature because higher temperatures allow more molecules to escape into the vapor phase. The heat of vaporization, on the other hand, is the amount of energy required to transform a unit mass of a substance from liquid to gas without changing its temperature. It's usually expressed in joules per gram or kilojoules per mole.\n\nSo, I need to find the equation that shows how these two quantities are related.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is the Rydberg equation. I remember that the Rydberg equation is used in atomic physics to predict the wavelengths of spectral lines of hydrogen-like atoms. It doesn't seem relevant to vapor pressure or heat of vaporization.\n\nOption B is the Gibbs free energy equation. Gibbs free energy is a thermodynamic potential that measures the useful work obtainable from a system at constant temperature and pressure. It's related to entropy and enthalpy, but I don't recall it directly relating vapor pressure and heat of vaporization.\n\nOption C is the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Now, this rings a bell. I think it's used to describe the relationship between the vapor pressure of a substance and its temperature. It involves the heat of vaporization as well. Let me try to recall the equation. I think it's something like dP/dT = \u0394H_vap / (T \u0394V), where P is the vapor pressure, T is the temperature, \u0394H_vap is the heat of vaporization, and \u0394V is the change in volume during vaporization. Yes, that sounds familiar. So, this equation shows that the vapor pressure increases exponentially with temperature, and the slope of the ln(P) versus 1/T plot is related to the heat of vaporization.\n\nOption D is the Arrhenius equation. I know this equation is used in chemical kinetics to describe the temperature dependence of reaction rates. It relates the rate constant of a reaction to the activation energy and temperature. While it does involve temperature and energy, it's not directly about vapor pressure or heat of vaporization.\n\nComparing all these options, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation seems to be the one that directly relates vapor pressure and heat of vaporization. It describes how the vapor pressure changes with temperature and includes the heat of vaporization as a key parameter.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about the units. In the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, vapor pressure P is usually in units like atmospheres or pascals, temperature T in Kelvin, heat of vaporization \u0394H_vap in joules per mole, and \u0394V in cubic meters per mole. The equation makes sense dimensionally.\n\nI don't think the other equations directly relate to vapor pressure and heat of vaporization. The Rydberg equation is for atomic spectra, the Gibbs free energy equation is more general for thermodynamic processes, and the Arrhenius equation is for reaction rates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C: the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
