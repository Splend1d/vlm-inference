Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what the Exxon Valdez was. It was an oil tanker that ran aground and leaked a massive amount of crude oil into the environment. That was in March 1989. Now, where was that?\n\nLet me think about the geography. Monterey Bay is in California, right? I think it's more on the Pacific coast, and I don't recall any major oil spills there around that time.\n\nPrince William Sound is in Alaska. That rings a bell. I think the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound, causing a big oil spill in the Arctic region. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nCape Cod is in Massachusetts, on the East Coast of the United States. Again, I don't remember any major oil spills there in 1989.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is another option. It's a large body of water bordering the southern coast of the U.S., and there have been oil spills there, but I think the big one was the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, not in 1989.\n\nSo, based on my recollection, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound in Alaska in March 1989. That seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe I'm confusing it with another oil spill. Let's see if I can recall any details.\n\nThe Exxon Valdez was carrying crude oil from the Alaska Pipeline when it ran aground. I think it was bound for California, but it ran aground in Alaska. So, that makes sense. Prince William Sound is in Alaska.\n\nMonterey Bay is in California, which is where the tanker was heading, but the spill happened in Alaska, not California.\n\nCape Cod is on the East Coast, nowhere near the path of the tanker.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is in the southern U.S., and while there have been oil spills there, the Exxon Valdez spill was in Alaska.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Prince William Sound.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there was any other significant oil spill in one of these locations around the same time. I don't think so. The Exxon Valdez spill was pretty prominent, and I'm pretty sure it was in Prince William Sound.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The answer is B. Prince William Sound.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
