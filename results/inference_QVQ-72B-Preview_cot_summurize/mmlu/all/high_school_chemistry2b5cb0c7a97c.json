                    "text": "So I have this question about what happens when a solid melts. It's asking about entropy and enthalpy changes. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what entropy and enthalpy are. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. So, if something becomes more disordered, entropy increases, right? Enthalpy is related to heat energy in a system at constant pressure. If something absorbs heat, the enthalpy increases.\n\nNow, when a solid melts into a liquid, what's happening? A solid has a fixed shape and structure, everything is in place, ordered. When it melts into a liquid, the molecules start moving around more freely, which seems more disordered. So, I think entropy should increase here. That would be a positive entropy change.\n\nAs for enthalpy, melting usually requires energy, right? Like, you need to heat up the solid to melt it. So, the system is absorbing heat, which should lead to an increase in enthalpy. That sounds like a positive enthalpy change.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I take ice melting into water, for example, it's endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings, which should make the enthalpy change positive. And the liquid state is more disordered than the solid state, so entropy increases.\n\nWait, but is there any exception? Like, are there solids that become more ordered when they melt? I don't think so. Generally, liquids are more disordered than solids.\n\nMaybe I should look at the options again to be sure.\n\nOption A: positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change.\n\nOption B: negative entropy change and negative enthalpy change.\n\nOption C: negative entropy change and positive enthalpy change.\n\nOption D: negative enthalpy change and positive entropy change.\n\nBased on my reasoning, A seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any cases where melting leads to a decrease in entropy. I can't think of any right now. Maybe in some unusual substances, but generally, melting increases entropy.\n\nSimilarly, for enthalpy, melting is typically endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat, so enthalpy increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be A: positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the sign conventions properly. In thermodynamics, for enthalpy change (\u0394H), if the system absorbs heat, it's positive (endothermic). If it releases heat, it's negative (exothermic). For entropy change (\u0394S), if disorder increases, it's positive, and if disorder decreases, it's negative.\n\nGiven that, melting is indeed endothermic (positive \u0394H) and increases disorder (positive \u0394S), so option A is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about the opposite process, freezing. When a liquid freezes into a solid, it releases heat (exothermic, negative \u0394H) and decreases disorder (negative \u0394S). That makes sense.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that for melting, it's positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
