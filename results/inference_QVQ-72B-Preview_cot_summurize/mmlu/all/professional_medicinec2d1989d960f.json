                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this case to diagnose. Let's see, there's a 29-year-old male who's been experiencing a pounding heart, poor sleep, and general restlessness. He moved two months ago for a job promotion but is having trouble concentrating on his new duties. He's worried about handling his increased responsibilities at work and has already called in sick three times in the past two weeks. I need to figure out what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the symptoms he's presenting with. A pounding heart could indicate anxiety or perhaps some cardiac issue, but given the context, it seems more likely related to anxiety. Poor sleep is common in anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, so that's a bit nonspecific, but still important. Generalized restlessness also points towards anxiety.\n\nHe's having trouble concentrating on his new job duties, which could be due to the stress of the promotion or underlying cognitive difficulties. The fact that he's worried about his ability to adapt to increased responsibility suggests that he might be experiencing performance anxiety or perhaps feeling overwhelmed by the new demands.\n\nCalling in sick three times in two weeks is noteworthy. It could be that he's physically unwell, but combined with his other symptoms, it might be more related to his mental state\u2014maybe he's avoiding work because of his anxiety or because he's not feeling up to it mentally.\n\nNow, let's look at the diagnostic options:\n\nA. Adjustment disorder with anxious mood\n\nB. Generalized anxiety disorder\n\nC. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate\n\nD. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\n**Option A: Adjustment disorder with anxious mood**\n\nAdjustment disorders are typically responses to identifiable stressors, and the symptoms develop within three months of the stressor's onset. In this case, the stressor is the job promotion and relocation two months ago. The symptoms align with anxious mood, given the pounding heart, poor sleep, and restlessness. However, adjustment disorders are usually milder and don't meet the full criteria for other mental disorders like anxiety disorders or depression.\n\nBut, he's having significant impairment in his work, as evidenced by his inability to concentrate and calling in sick multiple times. So, it's possible, but maybe there's something more going on.\n\n**Option B: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**\n\nGAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about various topics, difficulty controlling the worry, and associated symptoms like restlessness, fatigue, problems with concentration, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances. The symptoms must be present for at least six months.\n\nIn this case, he's been experiencing symptoms for two months, which is shorter than the required six months for GAD. However, the duration requirement can be flexible in some circumstances, especially if the symptoms are severe and impacting his functioning significantly.\n\nHis symptoms\u2014pounding heart, poor sleep, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and worry about work responsibilities\u2014all fit well with GAD. But, the duration might be a sticking point.\n\n**Option C: Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate**\n\nMajor depressive disorder involves persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep, low energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.\n\nIn this case, the patient doesn't seem to be describing feelings of sadness or loss of interest as primary symptoms. His main complaints are more related to anxiety and restlessness. While anxiety can be a symptom of depression, the predominant picture here seems to be anxiety rather than depression.\n\nHowever, sometimes, especially in younger individuals, depression can present with more irritable or restless features rather than typical sadness. But, without more information about his mood, it's hard to make a definitive call.\n\n**Option D: Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD)**\n\nOCPD is characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. People with OCPD may be excessively devoted to work and have difficulty delegating tasks to others.\n\nIn this case, the patient is worried about his ability to handle his increased responsibilities, but there's no clear indication of perfectionism, rigidity, or excessive devotion to work in a way that aligns with OCPD. He seems to be struggling with the new demands rather than exhibiting a long-standing pattern of behavior typical of OCPD.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the most likely diagnosis is **generalized anxiety disorder**. His symptoms fit well with the criteria for GAD, despite the relatively short duration. It's possible that with further evaluation, the symptoms could be ongoing longer than realized, especially if they started before the promotion and relocation.\n\nAdjustment disorder is a possibility, but given the severity of his symptoms and their impact on his functioning, it might be underestimating the situation. Major depressive disorder seems less likely given the primary presentation of anxiety rather than depressive symptoms. And OCPD doesn't seem to fit the current picture.\n\nSo, my choice would be B. Generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
