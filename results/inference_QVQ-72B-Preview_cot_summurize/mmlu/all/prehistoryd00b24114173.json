                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"At its height, only about _______ of the Incan empire was composed of ethnic Inca.\" And the options are A. 1 percent, B. 10 percent, C. 30 percent, D. 50 percent.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out what percentage of the Incan empire's population was actually ethnic Inca during its peak. I remember learning about the Inca empire in history class, but I don't recall the exact percentage. Maybe I can recall some details about the empire's demographics.\n\nFirst, the Inca empire, also known as the Inca Empire or Inka Empire, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. It was centered in modern-day Peru and spanned along the western coast of South America. The capital was Cusco.\n\nNow, the Inca people were the ruling elite of the empire, but I think they made up a relatively small portion of the total population. The Inca empire was known for its ability to integrate different cultures and peoples through conquest and administration.\n\nLet me think about the subject. I recall that the Inca empire was multi-ethnic, consisting of various indigenous groups that were conquered and incorporated into the empire. The Inca themselves were from the Cusco region and imposed their culture and language, Quechua, on the subjected peoples.\n\nBut what was the percentage of ethnic Inca in the entire empire? Was it as low as 1 percent, or was it higher?\n\nOption A is 1 percent. That seems really low. Even if the Inca were a minority, having only 1 percent seems unlikely for an empire that was able to exert such extensive control.\n\nOption B is 10 percent. This might be more plausible. If the Inca were a minority but still managed to rule over a large empire, 10 percent could make sense.\n\nOption C is 30 percent. That seems substantial. If 30 percent of the empire's population were ethnic Inca, that would mean that they were a significant portion, though still a minority.\n\nOption D is 50 percent. If the Inca made up half of the empire's population, that would suggest a balanced distribution, but I doubt that was the case.\n\nI need to recall if I've ever come across specific figures about the population composition of the Inca empire. I think that the Inca were a minority, but I'm not sure how minority. Maybe 10 percent is a reasonable estimate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Inca made up a larger percentage, like 30 percent, but I'm not confident about that.\n\nLet me consider the span of the Inca empire. At its largest, under Emperor Pachacuti and his successors, it stretched from present-day Colombia and Ecuador in the north to Chile and Argentina in the south. That's a vast area with many different indigenous groups.\n\nGiven the diversity of the empire, it's probable that the Inca themselves were not the majority everywhere. They likely relied on local administrators and elites to govern the conquered territories.\n\nBut even if they were a minority, they must have had a significant presence to maintain control. So, perhaps 10 percent is a feasible number.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe 30 percent is more accurate. If the Inca made up around a third of the population, that would still allow for a diverse empire but with a substantial Inca presence.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think about it differently. Perhaps I can consider the population of the central regions, like Cusco, where the Inca were originally from, and compare it to the peripheral regions.\n\nBut that might be too complicated for this question. I need a straightforward answer.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific numbers. I think that at its height, the Inca empire had a population of around 12 to 16 million people. If the Inca made up 10 percent, that would be 1.2 to 1.6 million Inca. If they made up 30 percent, that would be 3.6 to 4.8 million Inca. And if they made up 50 percent, that would be 6 to 8 million Inca.\n\nConsidering that the Inca were primarily from the Cusco region, having 30 to 50 percent of the entire empire's population seem high. Maybe 10 percent is more realistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Inca were more numerous than that. I need to double-check my knowledge.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the language spoken in the empire. Quechua was the official language, imposed by the Inca, and it was spoken widely across the empire. But that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone was ethnic Inca; it just means that Quechua was the lingua franca.\n\nSo, even if many people spoke Quechua, they might not have been ethnic Inca but rather local peoples who adopted the language for administrative and commercial purposes.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of ethnic Inca could still be relatively low, say 10 percent.\n\nBut I'm still unsure. Maybe I should consider the administrative structure of the Inca empire. It was divided into four regions, each governed by an official reporting to the emperor in Cusco. Perhaps the Inca made up the administrative and military elite, while the majority of the population consisted of various indigenous groups.\n\nThis would suggest that the Inca were a minority, possibly around 10 percent, which aligns with option B.\n\nMoreover, the Inca practiced a system of mita, which was a form of mandatory labor service provided by subject peoples. This further indicates that the majority of the population was not ethnic Inca but rather conquered peoples who were required to support the empire through labor.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, it seems that the Inca were a minority, probably around 10 percent of the total population.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. 10 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
