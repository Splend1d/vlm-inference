                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Sikhism. It's asking about the purpose of hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning. The options are:\n\nA. Prayers on behalf of people outside of the Sikh community\n\nB. Communal confession to cleanse the community\n\nC. Inspiration for personal meditation throughout the day\n\nD. Doctrinal instruction for discussion in the community\n\nHmm, I'm not super familiar with Sikh terminology, but let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that Sikhism is a religion that originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region, which is now divided between India and Pakistan. It was founded by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and there are ten Gurus in total who shaped the religion.\n\nNow, the term \"Guru's Vak\" \u2013 I think \"Vak\" means word or statement. So, Guru's Vak would refer to the words or teachings of the Guru. In Sikhism, the primary source of teachings is the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the holy scripture that contains the writings of the Gurus and other saints.\n\nSo, hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning probably refers to reciting or reading from the Guru Granth Sahib early in the day as part of daily prayers or meditations.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the purpose of doing this. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Prayers on behalf of people outside of the Sikh community.\n\nWell, Sikhism emphasizes equality and community service, so praying for others, including those outside the faith, seems plausible. However, I'm not sure if this is the primary purpose of hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning.\n\nB. Communal confession to cleanse the community.\n\nSikhism does have the concept of repentance and seeking forgiveness through prayer, such as the Nitnem prayers, which include the Mool Mantar and Japji Sahib. However, communal confession might not be the exact fit here. Maybe this isn't the main purpose.\n\nC. Inspiration for personal meditation throughout the day.\n\nThis seems plausible. In Sikhism, daily meditation is important, and reading from the Guru Granth Sahib in the morning could provide guidance and inspiration for one's thoughts and actions throughout the day.\n\nD. Doctrinal instruction for discussion in the community.\n\nWhile Sikhism does involve community discussions and learning, I don't think that the primary purpose of hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning is for doctrinal instruction or discussion. That might be more related to other practices like the Sunday school or community gatherings.\n\nGiven these options, C seems the most fitting. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that in Sikhism, the morning prayers, known as Nitnem, are very important. These prayers include reading specific passages from the Guru Granth Sahib. These readings are meant to set a spiritual tone for the day, provide guidance, and help in personal reflection and meditation.\n\nSo, if I'm hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning, it's likely to draw inspiration and spiritual strength for the day ahead, which aligns with option C.\n\nOption A suggests praying for others, which is certainly a part of Sikhism, but I don't think it's the primary purpose of reading the Guru's teachings in the morning.\n\nOption B mentions communal confession. While Sikhism does emphasize community and collective responsibility, I'm not sure if the morning readings are specifically for communal confession.\n\nOption D talks about doctrinal instruction for discussion. While discussion and learning are important, I think the morning readings are more personal and meditative in nature.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, option C \u2013 inspiration for personal meditation throughout the day \u2013 is the most accurate answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any specific Sikh practice that might make another option more appropriate.\n\nFor example, in some religions, morning prayers include intercessions for others, which might relate to option A. However, in Sikhism, while prayers for the welfare of all humanity are common, I don't think that's the primary purpose of hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning.\n\nOption B \u2013 communal confession \u2013 makes me think of practices like the Ardas, which is a prayer that can include requests for forgiveness. But again, this seems more related to collective prayer rather than the specific act of hearing the Guru's Vak.\n\nOption D \u2013 doctrinal instruction \u2013 might be more relevant to educational settings or community discussions, but not necessarily the individual act of reading the Guru's teachings in the morning.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
