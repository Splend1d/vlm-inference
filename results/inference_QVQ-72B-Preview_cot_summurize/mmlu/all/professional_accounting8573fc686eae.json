                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer. I'm not super familiar with all the audit terms, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what audit sampling risks are. I know that audits involve examining a sample of transactions or items from a population to draw conclusions about the entire population. So, there are risks associated with selecting and evaluating samples that might lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nHmm, I thought that sampling risk is related to the risk that the sample is not representative of the population, which could lead to different conclusions if the entire population were tested. But this option attributes that to nonsampling risk. Maybe I'm confusing the two.\n\nOption B says that nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n\nThis seems plausible. Nonsampling risk is about human error or judgment calls that can lead to mistakes in the audit process, like not identifying errors or misstatements in the financial statements. So, if an auditor misses something, that would be a nonsampling risk.\n\nOption C states that sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Sampling risk is generally about the risk that the sample selected may not be representative of the population, which could lead to incorrect conclusions. It's about the inherent uncertainty in sampling. So, it's not so much about applying audit procedures to specific risks, but about the selection of the sample itself.\n\nOption D says that sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nWait a minute, that sounds more like nonsampling risk. Sampling risk is about the sample selection, not about choosing the wrong audit procedures. Choosing inappropriate procedures would be more of a judgment error by the auditor, which is nonsampling risk.\n\nLet me try to summarize:\n\n- Sampling risk: risk related to selecting a sample that isn't representative of the population, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\n- Nonsampling risk: risk due to human error, inadequate audit procedures, or failure to recognize misstatements.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be describing sampling risk, not nonsampling risk. So, probably not correct.\n\nOption B seems to correctly describe a aspect of nonsampling risk\u2014failing to recognize misstatements.\n\nOption C is a bit unclear, but it seems to mix sampling risk with the application of audit procedures.\n\nOption D appears to describe nonsampling risk because it's about choosing inappropriate audit procedures.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the correct statement about nonsampling risk.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn audit terminology, nonsampling risk includes:\n\n- Inadequate definition of the audit objectives.\n\n- Inappropriate selection of audit procedures.\n\n- Failure to carry out audit procedures properly.\n\n- Incorrect interpretation of audit evidence.\n\n- Failure to recognize misstatements.\n\nYes, option B directly refers to failing to recognize misstatements, which is indeed a component of nonsampling risk.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, seems to describe sampling risk, where conclusions based on a sample may differ from what would be concluded if the entire population were examined.\n\nOption C is a bit vague, but it seems to suggest that sampling risk is about uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks, which might be confusing sampling risk with assessment risk or something else.\n\nOption D is likely describing nonsampling risk, as it pertains to selecting inappropriate audit procedures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B, as it accurately describes a aspect of nonsampling risk in auditing for nonissuers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
