                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about appraised house values and standard deviation. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, the mean appraised value is $125,000 with a standard deviation of $23,000. Then, because of a new teachers' contract, the school district needs an extra 10% in funds compared to the previous year. To raise this money, the city tells the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000. The question is, what will be the new standard deviation of these appraised values.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the new standard deviation after adding $5,000 to each house's appraised value.\n\nI remember that standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of data points from the mean. But does adding a constant to each data point change the spread?\n\nLet me think about this. If I have a set of data points and I add the same constant to each one, does the spread change? For example, if all house values are increased by the same amount, wouldn't the spread remain the same?\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose I have three houses with appraised values of $100,000, $125,000, and $150,000. The mean is $125,000, and the deviations are -$25,000, $0, and $25,000. The standard deviation would be $25,000.\n\nNow, if I add $5,000 to each value, they become $105,000, $130,000, and $155,000. The new mean is $130,000, and the deviations are -$25,000, $0, and $25,000. The standard deviation is still $25,000.\n\nHmm, so in this case, adding a constant to each data point doesn't change the standard deviation.\n\nIs this always true? Let me think about the formula for standard deviation. It's the square root of the variance, where variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nWhen you add a constant to each data point, you're shifting all the values up by that constant, but the differences from the mean remain the same because the mean also increases by that constant.\n\nSo, in the formula, adding a constant to each data point doesn't change the squared differences, and thus doesn't affect the standard deviation.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem, there's an extra 10% funds needed, and they're raising all appraised house values by $5,000. Is there any connection between the extra funds and the standard deviation?\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is straightforward: if you add $5,000 to each appraised value, what happens to the standard deviation?\n\nBased on my earlier reasoning, it should remain the same, which would be $23,000. So, option A.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here. The problem mentions that the school district needs an extra 10% in funds, and they're raising appraised values by $5,000 to get that extra money. Is there a relationship between the percentage increase and the standard deviation?\n\nWell, if the appraised values are increased by a flat amount, as in adding $5,000 to each, it's a constant shift, which shouldn't affect the standard deviation. If they were increasing the values by a percentage, say 10%, that might change the standard deviation because it's a proportional increase.\n\nBut in this case, it's a flat $5,000 increase to all houses, regardless of their current appraised value. So, the spread should remain the same.\n\nLet me double-check with another example. Suppose the appraised values are $110,000, $125,000, and $140,000. The mean is $125,000, and the standard deviation is $15,000.\n\nIf I add $5,000 to each, they become $115,000, $130,000, and $145,000. The new mean is $130,000, and the deviations are -$15,000, $0, and $15,000. So, the standard deviation is still $15,000.\n\nThis seems consistent. Adding a constant to each data point doesn't change the standard deviation.\n\nTherefore, the new standard deviation should be $23,000, which is option A.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption B is $25,300. That seems like the original standard deviation plus $2,300. But since adding a constant shouldn't change the standard deviation, this doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C is $28,000, and option D is $30,300. Neither of these seems relevant based on my understanding.\n\nUnless there's something else going on, I think the answer is A. $23,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 23,000} \\]"
