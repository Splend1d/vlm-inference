                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is about how the body compensates for an increased environmental temperature. So, when it's hot outside, the body needs to cool down to maintain its normal temperature. I remember something about sweating, but let's look at each option.\n\nOption A says decreasing salt retention. Hmm, I thought that when it's hot, we might sweat more, and sweat has salt in it. If we're losing salt through sweat, maybe the body tries to conserve salt by decreasing its retention, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption B is increasing respiration rate. When it's hot, if we breathe faster, does that help cool us down? I know that panting helps dogs cool down because they don't sweat much, but for humans, maybe increasing respiration rate could help evaporate moisture from the lungs or something. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption C is increasing heart rate. I know that when it's hot, the heart might beat faster to pump blood to the skin's surface to dissipate heat. So, that seems plausible. But I should consider all options.\n\nOption D is increasing water lost through skin. That sounds like sweating. Sweat evaporates from the skin, which helps cool the body down. So, that also seems like a likely compensation mechanism.\n\nBut the question is asking for the body's compensation for increased environmental temperature. So, it's probably more than one of these, but I have to pick one.\n\nLet me think about the process. When it's hot, the body senses that its core temperature is rising. To counteract this, it needs to lose heat. The main ways it does this are by increasing blood flow to the skin (vasodilation) and by sweating.\n\nSo, increasing heart rate (option C) would help pump more blood to the skin for heat dissipation, and increasing water lost through skin (sweating, option D) would help cool down through evaporation.\n\nDecreasing salt retention (option A) might not directly help with cooling down, although it might be a consequence of sweating, but I don't think it's the primary compensation mechanism.\n\nIncreasing respiration rate (option B) might help a bit, but again, it's not the main way humans cool down. Panting in dogs is effective because it helps evaporate moisture from the airways, but in humans, the surface area for evaporation in the lungs is much smaller.\n\nSo, between options C and D, both seem relevant. But if I had to choose one that's directly involved in thermoregulation in response to heat, I'd probably go with option D: increasing water lost through skin, because sweating is a key mechanism for heat loss in humans.\n\nWait, but increasing heart rate is also important for distributing heat to the skin. Maybe both are correct. But since I have to pick one, and the question is about compensating for increased environmental temperature, I think sweating is more directly related to cooling the body down.\n\nSo, my answer is D. increasing water lost through skin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
