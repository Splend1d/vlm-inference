                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and it's asking which of these systems cannot have its Schr\u00f6dinger equation solved exactly. The options are:\n\nA. Simple harmonic oscillator\n\nB. Particle in a one-dimensional box\n\nC. Rigid rotor\n\nD. Helium atom\n\nOkay, I need to recall for each of these systems whether an exact analytical solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is possible.\n\nStarting with the simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). I remember that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the SHO is exactly solvable. In fact, it's a standard problem in quantum mechanics textbooks, and the solutions are well-known harmonic oscillator wave functions. So, I think option A can be solved exactly.\n\nNext, a particle in a one-dimensional box. This is even simpler. The potential is zero inside the box and infinite outside. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation reduces to a second-order differential equation inside the box, and the wave function is zero outside. The solutions are sinusoidal inside the box, and the energy levels are quantized. So, this is also exactly solvable. Option B should be solvable exactly.\n\nNow, the rigid rotor. This is typically a model for molecular rotation, where the molecule is treated as two atoms separated by a fixed distance. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation for this system is separable in spherical coordinates, and the solutions are spherical harmonics. So, again, this is exactly solvable. Option C seems to be solvable exactly.\n\nFinally, the helium atom. This is where things get tricky. A helium atom has two electrons interacting with each other and with the nucleus. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation for this system is a partial differential equation in three dimensions, and because of the electron-electron interaction, it's not separable in a straightforward way. I recall that for the hydrogen atom, which has only one electron, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is exactly solvable, but for helium with two electrons, it's not.\n\nTo confirm, I think the helium atom does not have an exact analytical solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Instead, approximations like the Hartree-Fock method or variational principles are used to estimate its energy levels and wave functions.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be D. Helium atom.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Are there any exact solutions for the helium atom? I don't think so. The electron-electron repulsion term makes the equation non-separable, and thus, no exact solution exists. Therefore, the answer is D. Helium atom.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
