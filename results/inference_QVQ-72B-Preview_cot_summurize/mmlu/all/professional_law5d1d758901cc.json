                    "text": "A husband is charged with the murder of his wife. The prosecution alleges that on December 17, the husband murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinyicholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. Further allegations claim that the husband's principal motive was to collect his wife's $500,000 life insurance policy under which he was the named beneficiary. The defense called the physician who signed the wife's death certificate as its first witness. The defendant's attorney asked her, \"Is it not true that the cause of death was a heart attack?\" The physician answered in the negative and stated that the cause of death was unknown. The husband's attorney then assailed her testimony as a recent fabrication and asked her if she had not stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack. The prosecution immediately objected to this question. The trial judge should rule that this question is\n\nA. objectionable, because a party may not impeach its own witness.\nB. objectionable, because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.\nC. unobjectionable, because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\nD. unobjectionable, because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. It's about a husband who's been charged with murdering his wife by injecting her with a massive dose of succinylcholine while she was asleep. The prosecution says he did this to collect her $500,000 life insurance policy, of which he was the beneficiary. The defense called the physician who signed the wife's death certificate as their first witness. The defense attorney asked if the cause of death was a heart attack, and the doctor said no, it was unknown. Then the defense attorney suggested that this was a recent fabrication and asked if the doctor had previously stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack. The prosecution objected to this question.\n\nNow, I need to determine whether this objection is valid or not. The options are:\n\nA. Objectionable, because a party may not impeach its own witness.\n\nB. Objectionable, because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.\n\nC. Unobjectionable, because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nD. Unobjectionable, because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what impeachment means in this context. Impeachment of a witness involves challenging their credibility or the truthfulness of their testimony. So, the defense attorney is trying to show that the doctor's current testimony is different from what she said before, specifically at the coroner's inquest.\n\nNow, can a party impeach its own witness? I thought that generally, a party cannot impeach its own witness, but there might be exceptions, especially if the witness is hostile or if they make statements that are contrary to the party's case.\n\nLet me look up the rule about impeaching one's own witness. I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, generally, a party cannot impeach its own witness by prior inconsistent statements. However, there are exceptions, such as when the witness is hostile or when the statement was made before the witness had an opportunity to converse with others who might have influenced their current testimony.\n\nIn this case, the defense called the doctor as their witness, and now they're trying to impeach her with a prior inconsistent statement from the coroner's inquest. The defense attorney is suggesting that her current statement is a recent fabrication, implying that she might have changed her story after the inquest.\n\nSo, according to the options:\n\nA. Objectionable, because a party may not impeach its own witness.\n\nBut I think there are exceptions to this rule, especially if the witness is hostile or if there's evidence that their testimony has been recently fabricated.\n\nB. Objectionable, because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.\n\nI need to understand what laying a proper foundation entails. Generally, to impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement, you have to establish that the statement was indeed made, that it's inconsistent with the current testimony, and that the witness had an opportunity to observe or know the facts at the time of the prior statement.\n\nIn this scenario, the defense attorney is asking if the doctor had stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack. The prosecution objects, but I'm not sure if the foundation has been fully laid or not.\n\nC. Unobjectionable, because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nThis seems to contradict what I know about the general rule, which is that a party cannot impeach its own witness by prior inconsistent statements. However, as I mentioned earlier, there are exceptions.\n\nD. Unobjectionable, because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.\n\nThis option suggests that the earlier testimony is more reliable because it was given closer in time to the event. This could be a valid argument, as memories can fade or be influenced over time.\n\nGiven these options, I need to think carefully. I recall that under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 607, a party may attack the credibility of any witness, including its own, but there might be limitations on how that can be done.\n\nLet me consider the specific rules. Rule 607 allows a party to attack the credibility of any witness, but Rule 608(b) allows specific instances of a witness's conduct to be inquired into on cross-examination if they are probative of the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, provided that the conduct did not result in a conviction.\n\nHowever, Rule 609 allows impeachment by evidence of a criminal conviction, under certain conditions.\n\nBut in this case, it's about a prior inconsistent statement. Rule 613 addresses prior statements, and it allows for impeachment by prior inconsistent statements, provided that the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to examine the witness about it.\n\nBut, does this apply to a party's own witness?\n\nI think that generally, a party cannot introduce evidence to impeach its own witness, especially with prior inconsistent statements, because it would be against the party's interest to do so. However, if the witness's testimony is contrary to the party's position or if the witness becomes hostile, the party may be allowed to impeach their own witness.\n\nIn this scenario, the defense called the doctor as their witness, and she testified that the cause of death was unknown, contrary to what the defense attorney suggested (a heart attack). So, her testimony is not aligning with the defense's theory.\n\nTherefore, the defense attorney is trying to impeach her by showing that she previously stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack.\n\nNow, to impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement, the party must lay a proper foundation by showing that the prior statement was indeed made and that it is inconsistent with the current testimony.\n\nIn this case, the defense attorney is asking if she made the statement at the coroner's inquest, which is an attempt to establish the prior statement.\n\nThe prosecution objects, but based on what, I'm not sure.\n\nOption A says that it's objectionable because a party may not impeach its own witness. But, as I thought earlier, there are exceptions, especially if the witness is hostile or if their testimony is adverse to the party's case.\n\nOption B says it's objectionable because the attorney did not lay a proper foundation. But in this case, by asking if she stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack, the attorney is trying to lay the foundation for the prior inconsistent statement.\n\nOption C says it's unobjectionable because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement. But, as I thought earlier, this contradicts the general rule.\n\nOption D says it's unobjectionable because the physician's testimony at the coroner's inquest, being closer in time to the death, would be more reliable.\n\nThis seems like a plausible argument. If the coroner's inquest occurred shortly after the death, the doctor's memory would be fresher, and thus her testimony there might be more reliable than her current testimony.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the defense attorney is allowed to impeach their own witness in this manner.\n\nI think that under certain circumstances, a party may impeach its own witness, especially if the witness's testimony is adverse to the party's position or if the witness becomes hostile.\n\nIn this case, the doctor's testimony that the cause of death is unknown contradicts the defense's position that it was a heart attack. Therefore, it could be considered adverse to the defense's case.\n\nSo, perhaps the defense attorney is allowed to impeach her with a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nBut, I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me look up Rule 607 again. It says that \"the credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness.\"\n\nWait, that seems to suggest that any party can attack the credibility of any witness, including their own.\n\nBut, I've also heard that generally, a party cannot impeach its own witness with prior inconsistent statements, because it would be against the party's interest.\n\nHowever, Rule 607 seems to allow for attacking the credibility of any witness by any party.\n\nBut, Rule 608 allows impeachment by specific instances of conduct only under certain conditions, and Rule 609 allows impeachment by evidence of a criminal conviction.\n\nBut in this case, it's about a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nRule 613 addresses prior statements, and it allows for impeachment by prior inconsistent statements, provided that the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to examine the witness about it.\n\nSo, if the defense attorney is trying to impeach the doctor with a prior inconsistent statement, and they follow the procedures in Rule 613, it should be allowed.\n\nTherefore, the objection should be overruled, and the question should be allowed.\n\nBut, according to the options, Option C says it's unobjectionable because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nOption D says it's unobjectionable because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.\n\nBoth options suggest that the question is unobjectionable, but for different reasons.\n\nI think that the primary reason is that a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement, as per Rule 613.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, Option D also makes a valid point about the reliability of the earlier testimony, but that might be more of an argument for why the prior statement should be considered, rather than a reason why the impeachment is allowed.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is Option C: unobjectionable, because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
