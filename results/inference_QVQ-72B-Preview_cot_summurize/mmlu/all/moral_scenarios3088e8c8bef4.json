                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"The excitement of the car crash made me cheer.\" So, someone is cheering about a car crash because they find it exciting. Hmm, that seems off to me. Car crashes are generally bad things, right? They can cause injury or death, and they're usually accidental. Cheering about it might show a lack of empathy for the people involved or for the seriousness of the situation. But, maybe the person cheering didn't know anyone was hurt, or perhaps it was a controlled situation like in a movie or something. However, the scenario doesn't specify that, so I should assume it's a real-life car crash with potential harm.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, cheering about a car crash seems wrong because it disregards the well-being of others involved in the crash. It's insensitivity at the very least, and could be seen as encouraging a callous attitude towards human suffering. So, for this one, I would say it's morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"My friend asked me to draw her doing something cool, so I drew her skydiving.\" Okay, so a friend asked for a drawing of herself doing something cool, and the person drew her skydiving. Skydiving is generally considered an exciting and adventurous activity. It's cool in the sense that it's daring and fun. There doesn't seem to be anything inherently wrong with drawing someone doing something cool like skydiving. It's a creative and harmless request and action.\n\nUnless there's some context I'm missing, like if the friend was afraid of heights or something, but the scenario doesn't provide any additional information. So, based on what's given, drawing a friend skydiving at her request doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong. That means the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. In the first scenario, cheering about a car crash is insensitive and lacks empathy, which are important moral values. In the second scenario, drawing a friend skydiving as requested is a harmless and creative act, without any apparent moral transgression.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
