                    "text": "Let's see. So, there are a few things happening here that I need to understand to figure out what's going to happen to the equilibrium price and quantity of corn.\n\nFirst, consumers expect the price of corn to be lower in the near future. I think when consumers expect future prices to be lower, they might change their buying behavior now. Maybe they'll buy less now, thinking they can get it cheaper later. That makes sense because if I think something will be cheaper tomorrow, I might wait to buy it then instead of paying more today.\n\nSo, if consumers are expecting lower prices in the future, they might decrease their demand for corn now. That means the demand curve for corn would shift to the left, right? Because at every price, people are willing to buy less knowing that prices are expected to fall.\n\nAlright, so demand decreases, which typically leads to a decrease in both equilibrium price and quantity. But wait, there's more to this scenario.\n\nThe price of seed corn and fertilizer falls. Seed corn and fertilizer are inputs for producing corn. So, if the costs of these inputs decrease, that should make it cheaper for farmers to produce corn. That means the cost of production goes down, which should encourage producers to supply more corn at every given price. So, the supply curve for corn should shift to the right.\n\nNow, with a shift in both demand and supply, it's a bit trickier to determine what exactly happens to the equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nLet me draw this out. Initially, let's say we have a demand curve D and a supply curve S, intersecting at equilibrium point E, with price P and quantity Q.\n\nFirst, demand decreases because of consumer expectations of lower future prices, so the demand curve shifts left to D'.\n\nThen, supply increases due to lower input costs, so the supply curve shifts right to S'.\n\nNow, the new equilibrium will be where D' and S' intersect. Let's call that E', with new price P' and quantity Q'.\n\nLooking at this, since both demand and supply are shifting, the direction of price and quantity changes isn't immediately clear.\n\nLet me think about the effects separately and then together.\n\nFirst, if only demand decreases (supply remains constant), the equilibrium price would decrease, and the equilibrium quantity would also decrease.\n\nSecond, if only supply increases (demand remains constant), the equilibrium price would decrease, and the equilibrium quantity would increase.\n\nBut when both demand decreases and supply increases, the effects on price and quantity are combined.\n\nGenerally, if demand decreases and supply increases, the equilibrium price is likely to decrease. That's because both shifts put downward pressure on the price.\n\nHowever, the effect on quantity is indeterminate without knowing the relative magnitudes of the shifts in demand and supply.\n\nLet me see: if demand decreases, quantity decreases; if supply increases, quantity increases. So, the net effect on quantity depends on which shift is stronger.\n\nIf the decrease in demand is larger than the increase in supply, quantity might still decrease. But if the increase in supply is larger, quantity might increase despite the decrease in demand.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate based on the information given.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The equilibrium price will rise while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nB. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nC. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nD. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nGiven my analysis, I think the correct answer is B. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nBoth shifts\u2014decrease in demand and increase in supply\u2014suggest that the equilibrium price should decrease. So, price definitely falls.\n\nAs for quantity, since both shifts affect it in opposite directions, without knowing the extent of each shift, we can't determine whether quantity will definitely rise or fall.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate based on the given information.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, option C says the equilibrium price is indeterminate while quantity rises. But according to my analysis, price should definitely fall, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D says price is indeterminate and quantity falls, which also doesn't align with my understanding.\n\nOption A says price rises and quantity is indeterminate, which contradicts the expected decrease in price.\n\nTherefore, B is the most appropriate answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider extreme cases.\n\nSuppose the decrease in demand is very small, and the increase in supply is very large. In this case, the quantity might still increase despite the decrease in demand because the supply increase is larger.\n\nConversely, if the decrease in demand is very large and the increase in supply is small, quantity might decrease.\n\nSo, without specific magnitudes of the shifts, we can't determine the exact effect on quantity.\n\nHence, the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate, but we can confidently say that the equilibrium price will fall.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
