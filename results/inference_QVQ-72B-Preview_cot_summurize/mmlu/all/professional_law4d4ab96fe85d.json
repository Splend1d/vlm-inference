                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the best response to the manufacturer's motion for summary judgment in this construction worker's lawsuit. The worker claims he developed a health condition from exposure to the manufacturer's insulation over 20 years, but the manufacturer says they never supplied insulation to the worker's employer. Now, the manufacturer is moving for summary judgment because the worker supposedly has no evidence showing that the insulation was ever used by the employer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a summary judgment is. It's when a court decides the outcome of the case without a trial because there are no genuine disputes of material fact, and one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. So, the manufacturer is arguing that there's no evidence linking their insulation to the worker's employer, hence no need for a trial.\n\nNow, as the worker's attorney, I need to counter this motion effectively. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.\n\nHmm, this suggests that more time is needed to gather evidence. Maybe we haven't had enough opportunity to investigate yet. But, in the context of summary judgment, if the manufacturer is right that there's no evidence now, and I believe that more time could help, this could be a viable option. However, I need to make sure that I have a good faith basis for believing that further discovery will yield relevant evidence.\n\nB. Argue that the motion should be denied because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\n\nThis touches on the idea that credibility is at issue. If the manufacturer's president testified under oath that they never supplied insulation to the worker's employer, but there might be other evidence or witnesses that contradict this, then credibility becomes a key factor. Juries are typically the ones who determine credibility, not judges. So, if there's a dispute over whether the manufacturer did supply insulation to the employer, and this dispute involves questions of credibility, summary judgment might not be appropriate.\n\nC. Argue that the motion should be denied because the manufacturer failed to attach any evidence to its motion to show that the insulation was not used by the worker's employer.\n\nThis is interesting. In many jurisdictions, a motion for summary judgment must be supported by evidence that shows there's no genuine issue of material fact. If the manufacturer only made a bare assertion that the worker has no evidence without actually presenting any evidence to that effect, then perhaps the motion is deficient. However, I need to check the local rules and case law to see what's required in this particular court.\n\nD. Make a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that the manufacturer has introduced no evidence to show that its insulation did not harm the worker.\n\nThis seems a bit aggressive. The manufacturer is arguing that there's no evidence their insulation was used by the employer, which is a separate issue from whether the insulation harmed the worker. Making a cross-motion for summary judgment would require showing that there's no dispute of material fact regarding the manufacturer's liability, which seems premature at this stage, especially since the worker is alleging harm from exposure to the insulation.\n\nConsidering these options, I think the strongest response would be to combine elements from options B and C.\n\nFirst, regarding credibility: if the manufacturer's president testified that they never supplied insulation to the worker's employer, but there might be other evidence or witnesses that suggest otherwise, then this is a classic case where credibility is in dispute. Judges are generally reluctant to make credibility determinations on summary judgment, leaving that to the jury.\n\nSecond, if the manufacturer's motion for summary judgment is based solely on the assertion that the worker has no evidence without presenting any affirmative evidence to support their claim that they never supplied insulation to the employer, then the motion may be insufficient. In many courts, a party moving for summary judgment must present evidence showing that there's no genuine dispute of material fact, not just argue that the opposing party has no evidence.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that the motion should be denied because:\n\n1. The manufacturer has not met its burden of showing that there's no genuine issue of material fact regarding the use of their insulation by the worker's employer. They have only made a bare assertion without providing any evidence to support it.\n\n2. Even if the manufacturer has provided some evidence, such as the deposition testimony of their president, there is conflicting evidence or potential for conflicting evidence that raises questions of credibility, which should be decided by a jury.\n\nAdditionally, I might consider option A if I truly believe that more time for discovery could uncover evidence that currently isn't available. However, I need to be cautious about using this as a delaying tactic and ensure that I have a reasonable basis for believing that further discovery will yield relevant information.\n\nOption D seems less appropriate because it jumps straight to seeking a summary judgment in the worker's favor based on an assertion that the manufacturer hasn't proven lack of harm. That might not be the strongest position at this stage, especially since the central issue seems to be whether the manufacturer's insulation was used by the employer in the first place.\n\nIn summary, the best response would be to argue that the motion for summary judgment should be denied because:\n\n- The manufacturer has failed to present sufficient evidence to show that there's no genuine dispute of material fact regarding the use of their insulation by the worker's employer.\n\n- Credibility is a key issue in the case, and such determinations are properly left to the jury.\n\nThis approach addresses both the procedural requirements for summary judgment and the substantive issues of fact in the case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
