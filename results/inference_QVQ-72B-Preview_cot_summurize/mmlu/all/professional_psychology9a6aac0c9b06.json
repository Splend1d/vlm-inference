                    "text": "So I have this question about variance. It says, \"When the spread of scores increases, the variance...\" and then there are four options: A. decreases, B. increases, C. stays the same, D. can increase or decrease. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what variance is. Variance is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean, right? So, if the scores are all close to each other, the variance should be small. Conversely, if the scores are spread out over a larger range, the variance should be larger.\n\nLet me think about an example. Suppose I have two sets of scores. The first set is {10, 10, 10, 10}, and the second set is {5, 10, 15}. Both have a mean of 10, but the second set has a wider spread.\n\nFor the first set, since all scores are exactly 10, the variance should be zero because there's no spread.\n\nFor the second set, the scores vary from 5 to 15, which is a spread of 10 points.\n\nSo, in this case, as the spread increases, the variance also increases.\n\nWait, but is there a scenario where the spread increases but the variance decreases or stays the same?\n\nLet me think about that. Maybe if I add an outlier to the first set, like {10, 10, 10, 20}, the mean would shift a bit, but the variance would increase because of the increased spread.\n\nAlternatively, if I have a set like {9, 10, 11} and I change it to {8, 10, 12}, the spread increases from 2 to 4, and the variance should increase.\n\nWhat if I have {9, 10, 11} and change it to {9, 10, 10}, so {9, 10, 10}? Wait, that decreases the spread because now the scores are closer to the mean.\n\nIn this case, the spread decreases, and variance decreases.\n\nBut the question is about when the spread increases. So, in the example where I changed {9, 10, 11} to {8, 10, 12}, spread increased from 2 to 4, and variance increased.\n\nAnother example: {10, 10, 10} to {5, 10, 15}, spread increases, variance increases.\n\nIs there any way the spread increases but variance decreases? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I have {9, 10, 11}, spread is 2. If I change it to {8, 10, 12}, spread is 4. Variance should be larger in the second case.\n\nWait, maybe if I add a value that's far away but also adjust other values to keep the mean the same or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the formula for variance. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nSo, if the scores are more spread out, the differences from the mean are larger, and when squared, they become even larger, leading to a higher variance.\n\nTherefore, it seems logical that as spread increases, variance increases.\n\nBut let me check if there's any exception to this.\n\nSuppose I have a set where the spread increases but the variance decreases. That would imply that, despite the scores being more spread out, the average of the squared differences decreases. That doesn't seem possible because if the spread increases, the differences from the mean should generally be larger, leading to a higher variance.\n\nMaybe I can look at it mathematically.\n\nLet's take two sets:\n\nSet A: {9, 10, 11}, mean = 10, variance = ((9-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (11-10)^2)/3 = (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.6667\n\nSet B: {8, 10, 12}, mean = 10, variance = ((8-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (12-10)^2)/3 = (4 + 0 + 4)/3 = 8/3 \u2248 2.6667\n\nHere, the spread increased from 2 to 4, and variance increased from approximately 0.6667 to 2.6667.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSet C: {10, 10, 10}, mean = 10, variance = 0\n\nSet D: {5, 10, 15}, mean = 10, variance = ((5-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (15-10)^2)/3 = (25 + 0 + 25)/3 = 50/3 \u2248 16.6667\n\nAgain, spread increased and variance increased.\n\nWhat if I have a set where spread increases but variance doesn't increase?\n\nLet me try {9, 10, 11} to {9, 11, 11}. Wait, spread is still 2, but variance is ((9-10)^2 + (11-10)^2 + (11-10)^2)/3 = (1 + 1 + 1)/3 = 1\n\nComparing to previous variance of 2/3, it's higher, which makes sense because the spread is the same but the variance increased.\n\nWait, in this case, spread didn't increase; it stayed the same. So, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, {9, 10, 11} to {9, 10, 12}, spread increases to 3, variance becomes ((9-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (12-10)^2)/3 = (1 + 0 + 4)/3 = 5/3 \u2248 1.6667, which is higher than previous 2/3.\n\nAgain, spread increases, variance increases.\n\nI can't think of a scenario where spread increases but variance decreases.\n\nMaybe I should consider adding more extreme values.\n\nFor example, {9, 10, 11} to {9, 10, 20}, spread increases to 11, variance = ((9-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (20-10)^2)/3 = (1 + 0 + 100)/3 = 101/3 \u2248 33.6667\n\nVariance increased significantly.\n\nAlternatively, {9, 10, 11} to {9, 10, 10}, spread decreases to 1, variance = ((9-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (10-10)^2)/3 = (1 + 0 + 0)/3 \u2248 0.3333, which is less than previous 2/3.\n\nHere, spread decreased, variance decreased.\n\nBut the question is about when spread increases.\n\nSo, based on these examples, it seems that when spread increases, variance increases.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. increases.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Is there any situation where spread increases but variance doesn't increase?\n\nI don't think so, because increasing spread means that the data points are more dispersed from the mean, leading to larger squared differences, hence larger variance.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
