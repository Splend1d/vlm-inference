                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out who has the right to the property after all these transfers. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a man who owns real estate in fee simple. That means he has absolute ownership of the property, right? He can do pretty much whatever he wants with it, including selling it or transferring it to someone else.\n\nThen, he transfers a life estate in that property to a friend. A life estate, from what I remember, is an interest in property that lasts for the lifetime of a particular person. So, in this case, the friend has the right to use and benefit from the property for as long as he lives.\n\nBut, the original owner still has what's called a remainder interest. That's the right to possess the property after the life estate ends, which would be after the friend dies.\n\nNow, the fee simple owner dies before the life estate owner. That's an important detail. When the fee simple owner dies, the life estate owner is still alive and has his life estate.\n\nThen, the life estate owner conveys his interest to his children. So, he's giving his right to use the property for the rest of his life to his kids.\n\nThe deceased fee simple owner's son sues the children, claiming that the life estate is now broken because the fee simple owner died, and that he, the son, owns the property absolutely.\n\nI need to figure out if the children have an enforceable interest in the property.\n\nOption A says no, the life estate was broken when the owner of the fee simple interest died.\n\nOption B says no, the life estate owner is not allowed to convey his interest to other persons.\n\nOption C says yes, the life estate owner became the owner in fee simple when the original fee simple owner predeceased him.\n\nOption D says yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nAlright, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, does the life estate end when the fee simple owner dies?\n\nI don't think so. A life estate is based on the life of the life tenant, which is the friend in this case. It doesn't depend on the life of the original fee simple owner. So, even if the fee simple owner dies, the life estate should still continue as long as the life tenant is alive.\n\nSo, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says the life estate owner can't convey his interest to others.\n\nBut, I think life tenants can generally convey their interests, like sell or gift them, to other people. It's their property interest, at least for their lifetime. So, unless there's some restriction in the deed or will that created the life estate, the life tenant should be able to transfer their interest.\n\nSo, option B also seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says that the life estate owner became the owner in fee simple when the original fee simple owner predeceased him.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure about that. Just because the fee simple owner dies before the life tenant doesn't automatically convert the life estate into a fee simple interest. The life estate should still end when the life tenant dies, and then the remainder interest would pass to whoever has the remainder interest.\n\nIn this case, the remainder interest was probably in the original fee simple owner's heirs, which would be his son since he died.\n\nBut, the life tenant conveyed his life estate to his children. So, does that mean the children now hold the life estate, or is there something else going on?\n\nOption D says yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nAs I thought earlier, I believe that's generally possible. So, the children could have a valid interest in the property as transferees of the life estate.\n\nBut, the son of the original fee simple owner is claiming that the life estate is broken and he owns the property absolutely. Why would he think that?\n\nMaybe he thinks that since his father died, the life estate ended, but that doesn't make sense because the life estate is based on the life tenant's lifetime, not the original owner's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he thinks that since his father died, the remainder interest passed to him, and now he should have the property entirely.\n\nBut, if the life tenant is still alive, his life estate should still be in place, unless there's some condition in the transfer that says otherwise.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the type of life estate that was created.\n\nIn property law, there are different types of life estates. There's a life estate absolute, which is just a life estate, and then there's a life estate determinable or a life estate pur autre vie, which can have different conditions.\n\nBut in this scenario, it just says a life estate in it over to a friend for the friend's lifetime. That sounds like a straightforward life estate.\n\nSo, the life tenant has the right to use the property for his lifetime, and then the property goes to the remainderman, which would be the original owner's heirs, i.e., his son.\n\nBut, the original owner died before the life tenant, so the life tenant conveyed his interest to his children.\n\nI think the key here is whether the life tenant can convey his life estate to others.\n\nI believe he can, unless there's some restriction preventing it.\n\nSo, the children would have a valid interest in the property as transferees of the life estate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nBut, I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIs there any way that the life estate could be terminated before the life tenant's death?\n\nWell, life estates can be terminated by release, by the life tenant conveying the estate, by the life tenant and remainderman agreeing to terminate it, or by the life tenant's death.\n\nIn this case, the life tenant conveyed his interest to his children, which should effectively transfer his life estate to them.\n\nSo, the children would now hold the life estate, meaning they have the right to use and benefit from the property for the remainder of what would have been the life tenant's lifetime.\n\nThe son of the original fee simple owner might argue that since his father died, the life estate is somehow invalid, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nUnless there's some condition in the transfer that says the life estate is only valid if the life tenant outlives the original owner, which isn't stated here.\n\nNo, the transfer was a life estate in the property to the friend for the friend's lifetime, without any conditions about the original owner's lifespan.\n\nTherefore, the life estate should still be valid, and the conveyance to the children should be enforceable.\n\nSo, the children have an enforceable interest in the property.\n\nI think the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
