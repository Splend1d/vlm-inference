                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out if the court should grant the subsidiary's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Let me try to understand all the parts involved.\n\nFirst, there's a plaintiff who lives in State A. They're bringing a wrongful death lawsuit in a federal court in State A against two defendants: a State B parent corporation and its foreign subsidiary. The claim is that a tire made by the subsidiary in Europe caused the plaintiff's wife's death in an automobile accident, also in Europe.\n\nNow, the parent corporation does a lot of business in the United States, including in State A. But the subsidiary doesn't have any employees or bank accounts in State A. However, 2% of the subsidiary's tires are distributed in State A by the parent corporation. The subsidiary makes tires for the European market, but some end up in State A through the parent.\n\nThe subsidiary is saying the court doesn't have personal jurisdiction over it because it doesn't have enough connections to State A. So, I need to figure out if that's true.\n\nOption A says no, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce. So, even if the subsidiary didn't intentionally ship them there, the fact that some of its products end up in State A might be enough for the court to have jurisdiction.\n\nOption B says no, because of the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation. Maybe there's some principle where if the parent is subject to jurisdiction in State A, the subsidiary is too, especially if they're closely related.\n\nOption C says yes, because the accident didn't happen in the United States. So, maybe the court thinks it shouldn't get involved in something that happened overseas.\n\nOption D says yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A. Even though some of its tires are sold there, maybe it's not enough to establish jurisdiction.\n\nI need to think about personal jurisdiction in federal courts. I recall that federal courts can exercise personal jurisdiction based on the rules of the state where the court is located, which in this case is State A.\n\nSo, for a court in State A to have personal jurisdiction over the subsidiary, the subsidiary must have sufficient minimum contacts with State A such that maintaining the suit doesn't offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n\nThe subsidiary doesn't have any employees or bank accounts in State A, which suggests it doesn't have a physical presence there. But, 2% of its tires are distributed in State A by the parent corporation. That might be considered part of the stream of commerce.\n\nI remember the stream of commerce doctrine allows for personal jurisdiction when a manufacturer knows or should know that its products will be distributed in the forum state. Here, the subsidiary manufactures tires for the European market, but 2% end up in State A via the parent corporation.\n\nSo, even if the subsidiary didn't intend to sell in State A, if it was foreseeable that some of its products would end up there, that might be enough for personal jurisdiction.\n\nBut, I should consider if this is direct or indirect jurisdiction. Direct jurisdiction would be if the subsidiary itself is doing business in State A, which it's not. Indirect jurisdiction might be through the parent corporation.\n\nOption B mentions general personal jurisdiction over the parent corporation. If the parent is subject to general jurisdiction in State A because it does significant business there, does that mean the subsidiary is also subject to jurisdiction?\n\nI think there might be some principle of agency law or veil-piercing where the subsidiary's activities could be attributed to the parent, but the other way around might not necessarily hold true.\n\nAlso, the fact that the accident occurred in Europe might be relevant. The harm occurred there, not in State A, which could affect the court's decision on jurisdiction.\n\nBut, in international cases, it's common for courts to have long-arm jurisdiction over foreign defendants if there are sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state.\n\nLet me think about the case of Burger King v. Rudzewicz. There, the Supreme Court held that a defendant's deliberate, though minimal, contacts with the forum state are sufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.\n\nIn this scenario, the subsidiary's tires are being distributed in State A, even if it's only 2%. That could be seen as minimal but deliberate contacts with State A.\n\nOn the other hand, the subsidiary itself doesn't have any employees or bank accounts in State A, which suggests it doesn't have a significant presence there.\n\nMaybe the court would look at the relationship between the parent and the subsidiary. If the parent is exercising control over the subsidiary, perhaps the subsidiary's activities can be imputed to the parent, but again, not necessarily the other way around.\n\nOption C suggests that because the accident didn't occur in the United States, the court shouldn't get involved. But I don't think that's necessarily the case. Personal jurisdiction is about the defendant's contacts with the forum state, not where the harm occurred.\n\nHowever, the location of the harm might be relevant in determining specific jurisdiction, but in this case, it's a wrongful death action based on an accident in Europe.\n\nWait, but the tire was manufactured by the subsidiary in Europe and caused the accident in Europe. The only connection to State A is that the parent corporation, which is being sued separately, does business there.\n\nBut the subsidiary's tires are being distributed in State A by the parent corporation. So, perhaps there's a connection through the distribution channel.\n\nI need to consider if the subsidiary should have foreseen that its products would be sold in State A and therefore should be subject to jurisdiction there.\n\nAlso, if the subsidiary is part of a larger corporate structure that does business in State A, maybe there's some theory of jurisdiction that allows the court to exercise power over the subsidiary.\n\nBut, generally, courts look for specific jurisdiction when the claim arises from the defendant's contacts with the forum state.\n\nIn this case, the claim arises from a tire manufactured by the subsidiary and used in Europe, not in State A.\n\nSo, maybe specific jurisdiction isn't present because the act that caused the harm didn't occur in State A.\n\nThen, general jurisdiction would require the subsidiary to have continuous and systematic general business contacts with State A.\n\nGiven that the subsidiary has no employees or bank accounts in State A and only 2% of its tires are distributed there by the parent corporation, it seems like those contacts are minimal.\n\nThe parent corporation has significant business in State A, but that's separate from the subsidiary.\n\nUnless there's some showing that the subsidiary and the parent are so intertwined that they're effectively one entity, I don't think the subsidiary's lack of presence in State A can be overlooked just because the parent is there.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is correct: yes, the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A, and therefore the motion to dismiss should be granted.\n\nBut, I'm a bit unsure because of the stream of commerce argument. If 2% of the subsidiary's tires are distributed in State A, maybe that's enough to establish jurisdiction.\n\nI need to look at some case law on stream of commerce jurisdiction.\n\nIn Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, the Supreme Court held that the mere fact that a product is sold in the forum state by a third party is not enough to establish jurisdiction over the foreign manufacturer.\n\nBut, if the manufacturer knows or should know that its products will be sold in the forum state, then jurisdiction might be appropriate.\n\nIn this scenario, the subsidiary manufactures tires for the European market, but 2% end up in State A via the parent corporation.\n\nSo, does the subsidiary know or should it know that its products will be distributed in State A?\n\nIf the parent corporation is distributing 2% of the subsidiary's tires in State A, perhaps the subsidiary should have foreseen that its products would end up there.\n\nHowever, the subsidiary manufactures for the European market, so maybe it didn't intend for its products to be sold in State A.\n\nBut, if the parent is distributing them in State A, and the subsidiary is part of the same corporate group, maybe there's some imputation of knowledge.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider whether the subsidiary and the parent are so closely related that the subsidiary's lack of direct contacts with State A can be overlooked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court will look at the subsidiary's minimal contacts and decide that they're not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.\n\nGiven that, option D seems plausible.\n\nBut, option A argues that no, because of the stream of commerce, jurisdiction should be established.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the subsidiary had reason to know that its products would be sold in State A.\n\nIf the subsidiary is part of a larger corporate structure and the parent is distributing its products in State A, maybe that's enough for the court to say that the subsidiary should have foreseen its products being sold there.\n\nOn the other hand, if the subsidiary had no role in the distribution to State A and didn't target State A in any way, maybe it's not fair to subject it to jurisdiction there based solely on the 2% distribution by the parent.\n\nI need to think about the fairness aspect. Would it be unfair to require the subsidiary to defend itself in State A when its primary operations and the alleged wrongful act occurred in Europe?\n\nProbably, yes. It might be more appropriate for the subsidiary to be sued in a European court where the accident occurred and where its primary operations are based.\n\nMoreover, the plaintiff is suing both the parent and the subsidiary. If the parent has sufficient contacts with State A, perhaps the court can hear the claims against both defendants together for efficiency.\n\nBut, again, that might not be a strong enough reason to establish personal jurisdiction over the subsidiary.\n\nI think, on balance, option D is the correct answer. The subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A, and therefore, the court should grant its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
