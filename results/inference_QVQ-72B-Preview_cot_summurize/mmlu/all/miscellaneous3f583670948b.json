But I'm not entirely sure why this happens. Let's see what these options are saying.\n\nOption A says it's because of the amount of the Moon's surface that's in Earth's shadow. Hmm, I think the Moon gets illuminated by the Sun, not Earth. So, if the Moon is in Earth's shadow, that would be during a lunar eclipse, but that's not something that happens every month. Maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B mentions the amount of the illuminated side of the Moon that can be seen from Earth. That sounds interesting. The Moon is illuminated by the Sun, and depending on where it is in its orbit around Earth, we see different portions of its lit side. So, during a full moon, we see the fully illuminated side, and during a new moon, we don't see any illumination because the lit side is facing away from us.\n\nOption C talks about the part of the Moon that faces Earth as the Moon rotates on its axis. I recall that the Moon rotates on its axis in such a way that it always shows the same face to Earth. This is called synchronous rotation. So, if that's the case, then the part of the Moon facing Earth doesn't change much. That might not be the main reason for the phases.\n\nOption D mentions the tilt of the Moon on its axis. I know that the tilt of Earth's axis affects our seasons, but I'm not sure about the Moon's tilt. Let me think. The Moon's axis is tilted by about 1.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane. I don't think this has a significant impact on the phases we see from Earth.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most plausible. The phases of the Moon are due to the changing angle between the Sun, Earth, and the Moon as the Moon orbits Earth. This affects how much of the illuminated side we can see at any given time.\n\nLet me try to explain this a bit more to make sure I understand. The Moon orbits Earth in an elliptical path, and as it moves, the amount of its surface that is illuminated by the Sun and visible from Earth changes. For example:\n\n- At new moon, the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, so the side facing Earth is dark, and we can't see any illumination.\n\n- At first quarter, the Moon has moved further in its orbit, and we can see one-quarter of its illuminated surface.\n\n- At full moon, the Earth is between the Moon and the Sun, so the entire side facing Earth is illuminated.\n\n- At last quarter, we see the other one-quarter of the illuminated surface.\n\nSo, this clearly shows that the phases are related to how much of the illuminated side we can see from Earth at different points in the Moon's orbit.\n\nI think I've got it now. The correct answer should be B. The amount of the illuminated side of the Moon that can be seen from Earth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
