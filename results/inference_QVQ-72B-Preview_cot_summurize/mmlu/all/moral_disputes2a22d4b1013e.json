                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Little's argument regarding the norms that govern the moral permission of abortion. The options are:\n\nA. Impersonal and categorical.\n\nB. Merely a matter of the mother's preferences.\n\nC. A complex matter of the mother's personal integrity and her ideals about motherhood and creation.\n\nD. None of the above.\n\nI need to figure out which one correctly represents Little's view.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand who Little is and what his argument is about. Since the question is about Little's argument, I assume that Little is a philosopher or an author who has written on the topic of abortion ethics. I might need to recall or look up some of his works to get a better understanding.\n\nAssuming that Little is discussing the moral norms that govern abortion, I need to comprehend what he believes these norms are based on.\n\nOption A says that the norms are impersonal and categorical. Impersonal might suggest that the norms are objective and apply universally, without considering individual circumstances. Categorical would imply that these norms are absolute and brook no exceptions.\n\nOption B suggests that it's merely a matter of the mother's preferences. This seems more subjective, indicating that the morality of abortion depends solely on what the mother personally feels or prefers.\n\nOption C presents a more nuanced view, stating that it's a complex matter involving the mother's personal integrity and her ideals about motherhood and creation. This seems to combine both personal and possibly broader ethical considerations.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which might be relevant if Little's argument doesn't fit neatly into any of these categories.\n\nGiven that the question is to identify Little's argument, I need to determine which of these options accurately represents his position.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: impersonal and categorical.\n\nIf Little argues that the norms governing abortion are impersonal and categorical, he might be advocating for a deontological ethical framework, where certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of the circumstances. For example, if he believes that abortion is always morally permissible or always impermissible, without exception, that would fit into this category.\n\nHowever, abortion is a highly complex issue with many grey areas, and arguing that it's simply a matter of impersonal and categorical norms might oversimplify the ethical considerations involved.\n\nMoving on to Option B: merely a matter of the mother's preferences.\n\nThis seems more aligned with a subjective or preference-based ethical approach, where the morality of abortion is determined solely by the mother's desires or preferences. This could be related to ethical subjectivism or individualism.\n\nBut, this option might be too simplistic because it doesn't account for other factors that could be morally relevant, such as the potential life of the fetus, the mother's health, or societal impacts.\n\nNext, Option C: a complex matter of the mother's personal integrity and her ideals about motherhood and creation.\n\nThis option appears more comprehensive, recognizing that the decision to have an abortion is multifaceted and involves the mother's personal values, integrity, and ideals about what constitutes good motherhood and creation.\n\nPersonal integrity suggests that the decision should align with the mother's moral character and principles, while ideals about motherhood and creation indicate that broader ethical considerations are at play.\n\nThis option seems to acknowledge both the personal and the ethical dimensions of the abortion decision, making it perhaps a more balanced view than the previous options.\n\nFinally, Option D: none of the above.\n\nChoosing this would imply that Little's argument doesn't fit into any of the provided categories, which might be the case if his argument is unique or combines elements in a way not reflected in the options.\n\nHowever, based on the options provided, it's likely that one of them captures Little's argument adequately.\n\nGiven this analysis, I need to decide which option best represents Little's position.\n\nIf Little is presenting a nuanced view that considers the mother's personal integrity and her ideals about motherhood and creation, then Option C seems to be the most accurate representation of his argument.\n\nOption A suggests a more rigid, universal approach, while Option B reduces the issue to mere personal preference, which may not capture the full complexity of Little's argument.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that Little argues that the norms governing the moral permission of abortion are a complex matter of the mother's personal integrity and her ideals about motherhood and creation.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
