                    "text": "So I have this problem here: five capacitors, each with a capacitance of 5 microfarads, are connected in series. I need to find the equivalent capacitance of the system. The options are 5 \u00b5F, 25 \u00b5F, 10 \u00b5F, and 1 \u00b5F.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how capacitors behave when they're connected in series. I remember that when capacitors are in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. In formula terms, for n capacitors in series:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{C_i}\n\\]\n\nSince all the capacitors here are the same, each being 5 \u00b5F, this should simplify things.\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC_{eq} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1 \\text{ \u00b5F}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a different way to approach this or some concept I'm missing.\n\nI know that when capacitors are in series, the charge on each capacitor is the same, and the voltages add up across them. The equivalent capacitance formula should be correct, but perhaps there's a trick here because the number of capacitors is five.\n\nLet me think about the general formula for n identical capacitors in series. I think it's:\n\n\\[\nC_{eq} = \\frac{C}{n}\n\\]\n\nWhere C is the individual capacitance and n is the number of capacitors. But that would give:\n\n\\[\nC_{eq} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1 \\text{ \u00b5F}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. But wait, that can't be right because I recall that when capacitors are in series, the equivalent capacitance is less than any individual capacitance. Here, all capacitors are 5 \u00b5F, and the equivalent is 1 \u00b5F, which is indeed less, so that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret \"connected in series.\" Maybe it's not a simple linear series connection; perhaps they're arranged in a different configuration, like some series and some parallel. But the problem states they are connected in series, so I should take it at face value.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each additional capacitor in series reduces the overall capacitance by adding more \"resistance\" to the flow of charge, so to speak. It's analogous to resistors in parallel, where the equivalent resistance decreases as more resistors are added in parallel. Wait, no, actually, that's the opposite. For resistors in parallel, equivalent resistance decreases, but for capacitors in parallel, equivalent capacitance increases. For capacitors in series, it's the opposite: equivalent capacitance decreases.\n\nSo, yeah, my initial calculation seems correct. The equivalent capacitance should be 1 \u00b5F.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider the formula for two capacitors in series:\n\n\\[\nC_{eq} = \\frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}\n\\]\n\nFor two identical capacitors of 5 \u00b5F each:\n\n\\[\nC_{eq} = \\frac{5 \\times 5}{5 + 5} = \\frac{25}{10} = 2.5 \\text{ \u00b5F}\n\\]\n\nWhich is indeed less than 5 \u00b5F. So, for five capacitors in series, the equivalent capacitance should be even smaller, which aligns with my earlier result of 1 \u00b5F.\n\nWait, but is there a general formula for n identical capacitors in series? I think it's:\n\n\\[\nC_{eq} = \\frac{C}{n}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems to be the case. So, for five capacitors each of 5 \u00b5F, the equivalent capacitance is indeed 1 \u00b5F.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. So, the correct choice is D. 1 \u00b5F.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}"
