            "content": "To determine what the dorsal roots of all spinal nerves contain, we need to understand the structure and function of spinal nerves.\n\nSpinal nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system and are responsible for transmitting signals between the spinal cord and the rest of the body. Each spinal nerve is formed by the combination of a dorsal root and a ventral root.\n\n1. **Dorsal Root**: This root is primarily involved in carrying sensory information from the body to the spinal cord. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root carry signals related to touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception (the sense of body position).\n\n2. **Ventral Root**: This root is responsible for carrying motor information from the spinal cord to the muscles, allowing for voluntary movement.\n\nGiven this information, the dorsal root specifically contains sensory neuronal processes. These processes are crucial for the sensory functions of the nervous system, such as detecting stimuli and relaying this information to the central nervous system for processing.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A: Sensory neuronal processes.** This is correct because the dorsal root is specifically involved in carrying sensory information.\n\n- **Option B: Sensory and autonomic neuronal processes.** This is incorrect because the dorsal root does not contain autonomic processes. Autonomic functions are typically associated with the ventral root.\n\n- **Option C: Motor neuronal processes.** This is incorrect because motor processes are carried by the ventral root, not the dorsal root.\n\n- **Option D: Motor and autonomic neuronal processes.** This is incorrect because the dorsal root does not contain motor or autonomic processes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. sensory neuronal processes**.",
