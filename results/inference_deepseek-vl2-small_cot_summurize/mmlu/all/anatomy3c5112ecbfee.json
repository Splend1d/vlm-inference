The skull is the bony structure that encases the brain, but the dura mater itself is not directly between the skull and the dura mater.\n\nB. **Dura mater and arachnoid mater**: The dura mater is the tough outermost layer, and the arachnoid mater is the middle layer. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates between these two layers, not between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater.\n\nC. **Arachnoid and pia mater**: The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges, and the pia mater is the innermost layer. The CSF circulates between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. This is the correct arrangement.\n\nD. **Pia mater and brain surface**: The pia mater is the innermost layer of the meninges, and the brain surface is the surface of the brain itself. The CSF does not circulate between the pia mater and the brain surface.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. **Arachnoid and pia mater**.",
