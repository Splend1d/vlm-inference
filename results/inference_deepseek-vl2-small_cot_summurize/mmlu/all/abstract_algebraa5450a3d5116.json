This means it can be written as a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order. For example, the free abelian group on two generators is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nTo show that every free abelian group is torsion-free, consider the following:\n- If a free abelian group \\(G\\) has a non-trivial torsion subgroup, say \\(H\\), then \\(G\\) must have a non-trivial element \\(g\\) such that \\(g^n \\in H\\) for some \\(n > 0\\).\n- Since \\(G\\) is free, there exists an element \\(h\\) in \\(G\\) such that \\(h \\neq g\\).\n- Consider the element \\(gh\\). Since \\(g^n \\in H\\), we have \\(gh^n \\in H\\).\n- However, \\(gh^n = h(g^n) \\in H\\), which contradicts the fact that \\(h \\neq g\\).\n\nThus, every free abelian group is torsion-free. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.**\n\nTo show that every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group, consider the following:\n- Let \\(G\\) be a finitely generated torsion-free abelian group.\n- Since \\(G\\) is torsion-free, it cannot have a non-trivial torsion subgroup.\n- By the First Isomorphism Theorem, there exists a short exact sequence:\n  \\[\n  0 \\to \\ker(\\phi) \\to G \\to \\text{im}(\\phi) \\to 0\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\phi: G \\to \\mathbb{Z}\\) is the homomorphism defined by \\(\\phi(g) = \\text{ord}_p(g)\\) for some prime \\(p\\).\n- Since \\(G\\) is torsion-free, \\(\\ker(\\phi) = \\{0\\}\\).\n- Therefore, \\(G\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\text{im}(\\phi)\\).\n- Since \\(\\text{im}(\\phi)\\) is a free abelian group, \\(G\\) is also a free abelian group.\n\nThus, every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
