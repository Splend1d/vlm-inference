Collagen: Collagen is a major structural protein found in the dermis, providing strength and elasticity to the skin. It is a fibrous protein that forms a dense network, contributing to the skin's resilience and ability to withstand stretching.\n\nB. Heparin: Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and anticoagulant drug, not a fibrous protein. It is involved in blood clotting and does not contribute to the structural integrity of the dermis.\n\nC. Lipocyte: Lipocytes are cells that store fat and are not proteins. They are not structural components of the dermis.\n\nD. Melanin: Melanin is a pigment that gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. It is not a protein and does not contribute to the structural composition of the dermis.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Collagen, as it is the structural, fibrous protein found in the dermis.",
