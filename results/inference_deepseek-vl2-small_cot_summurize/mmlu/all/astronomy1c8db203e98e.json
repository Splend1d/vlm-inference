            "content": "To determine what makes asteroids stand out in sky surveys, we need to consider the characteristics that distinguish them from other celestial objects.\n\nA. Asteroids emit pulsed radiation: This option is incorrect. Asteroids do not emit pulsed radiation. They are composed of rock and metal, and their emissions are not pulsed.\n\nB. Asteroids emit a lot of their own radiation: This option is also incorrect. Asteroids do not emit significant amounts of their own radiation. They are not active sources of radiation like some comets.\n\nC. They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars: This option is correct. Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that reflect sunlight. When they are close to the Earth, they can appear brighter than most background stars. This is why they are often visible to the naked eye and can be detected in sky surveys.\n\nD. Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars: This option is incorrect. Asteroids do not have substantial motion relative to the background stars. They move in a relatively stable orbit around the Sun, and their motion is not significant enough to be detected in sky surveys.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars.",
