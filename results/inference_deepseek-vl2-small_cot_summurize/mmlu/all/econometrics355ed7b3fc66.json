            "content": "To determine which statements are correct, let's analyze each option:\n\ni) Antithetic variates work by reducing the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space.\n\n- Antithetic variates are a technique used in Monte Carlo simulations to improve the efficiency of the simulation. By using a pair of variables that are opposites, the simulation can cover the entire probability space more effectively with fewer replications. This is because the negative of one variable can be used to explore the opposite region of the probability space, effectively doubling the number of simulations needed to cover the space. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nii) Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically.\n\n- Antithetic variates do not involve a variable with known analytical properties. Instead, they use a variable that is the negative of the random variable used in the simulation. This negative variable is not necessarily known analytically; it is simply a mathematical operation applied to the random variable. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\niii) Antithetic variates involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\n\n- This statement accurately describes the use of antithetic variates. By taking the negative of each random draw, the simulation can explore the opposite region of the probability space, effectively doubling the number of simulations needed to cover the space. This is a key aspect of using antithetic variates in Monte Carlo simulations. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\niv) Antithetic variates involve taking one over each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\n\n- This statement is incorrect. Antithetic variates do not involve taking the reciprocal of each random draw. Instead, they involve taking the negative of each random draw. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only",
