(\u2200x)[Kx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Lxy)]\n- This option correctly translates the statement into predicate logic. It states that for all kings (Kx), if a person is a pauper (Py), then the person is luckier than the pauper (Lxy).\n\nB. (\u2200x)[Kx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Lxy \u2283 Py)]\n- This option is incorrect because it reverses the direction of the implication. It states that for all kings (Kx), if a person is luckier than a pauper (Lxy), then the person is a pauper (Py). This does not match the original statement.\n\nC. (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[(Kx \u2022 Py) \u2283 Lyx]\n- This option is incorrect because it uses a conjunction (\u2022) instead of a disjunction (\u2192) in the implication. It states that for all kings (Kx) and all paupers (Py), if a person is a king and a pauper, then the person is luckier than the pauper (Lxy). This does not match the original statement.\n\nD. (\u2200x)[(Kx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Py)) \u2283 Lxy]\n- This option is incorrect because it uses a conjunction (\u2022) instead of a disjunction (\u2192) in the implication. It states that for all kings (Kx), if a person is a king and a pauper (Py), then the person is luckier than the pauper (Lxy). This does not match the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\nA. (\u2200x)[Kx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Py \u2283 Lxy)]",
