The named nurse: Nurses are integral to patient care, providing direct care and support. However, while they are crucial, they do not have the overall legal responsibility for a patient's care.\n\nB. The named consultant: Consultants are specialists who provide expert medical advice and treatment. They are responsible for the overall medical care of the patient, including diagnosis, treatment, and management of the patient's condition. This makes them the most appropriate choice for legal responsibility during hospital admission, stay, and discharge.\n\nC. The ward manager: The ward manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the ward, ensuring that the ward runs smoothly and that patient care is delivered effectively. While they play a significant role in patient care, they do not have the same level of legal responsibility as a consultant.\n\nD. The GP: General Practitioners (GPs) are responsible for the patient's ongoing care outside of hospital. They provide primary care and manage chronic conditions. However, they do not have legal responsibility for a patient's care during hospital admission, stay, and discharge.\n\nAfter considering the roles and responsibilities of each option, the correct answer is B.
