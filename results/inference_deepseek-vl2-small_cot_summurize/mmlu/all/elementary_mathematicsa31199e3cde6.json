Conducting the survey at one shoe store: This option is limited to a specific type of store and may not represent the diversity of shoppers at the mall. It might not capture the preferences, behaviors, or demographics of the broader customer base.\n\nB. Conducting the survey at all shoe stores: This option is more comprehensive as it includes a variety of stores within the mall. It can provide a more representative sample of the mall's shoppers, as it covers different types of stores and potentially different customer segments.\n\nC. Conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall: This option is limited to the immediate area where people enter the mall. It may not capture the full range of shoppers who are inside the mall, as it only includes those who have already entered.\n\nD. Conducting the survey a mile away from the mall: This option is even more limited, as it captures only those who are outside the mall. It may not represent the preferences, behaviors, or demographics of the shoppers who are inside the mall.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most representative sample would be obtained by conducting the survey at all shoe stores (Option B). This option provides a more comprehensive and diverse sample of shoppers at the mall, as it includes a variety of stores and potentially different customer segments.",
