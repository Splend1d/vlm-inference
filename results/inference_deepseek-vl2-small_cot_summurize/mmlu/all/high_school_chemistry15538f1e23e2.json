            "content": "To determine the number of moles of oxygen gas formed, we need to use the balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of mercury(II) oxide:\n\n\\[ \\text{HgO} \\rightarrow \\text{Hg} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{O}_2 \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of mercury(II) oxide (HgO) in 4.32 g. The molar mass of HgO is given as 216 g/mol.\n\n1. Calculate the number of moles of HgO:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Moles of HgO} = \\frac{\\text{mass of HgO}}{\\text{molar mass of HgO}} = \\frac{4.32 \\, \\text{g}}{216 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 0.0200 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the moles of oxygen gas (O\u2082) formed. According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of HgO produces \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mole of O\u2082.\n\n3. Calculate the moles of O\u2082:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Moles of O}_2 = \\text{Moles of HgO} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 0.0200 \\, \\text{mol} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 0.0100 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of moles of oxygen gas formed is 0.0100 mol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.0100 mol",
