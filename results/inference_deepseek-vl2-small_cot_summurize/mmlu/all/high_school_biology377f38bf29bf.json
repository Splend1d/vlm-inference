They all share a recent common ancestor.\n- While it is true that these animals are related, the streamlined body shape is not a result of a recent common ancestor. Instead, it is a result of convergent evolution, where unrelated species develop similar traits due to similar environmental pressures.\n\nB. They all sustained the same set of mutations.\n- This option is incorrect because mutations are random and not necessarily the same across different species. The streamlined body shape is not due to a single set of mutations but rather the result of evolutionary processes that favor certain traits.\n\nC. They acquire a streamlined body type to survive in their particular environment.\n- This option is partially correct but not the best explanation. While environmental pressures can influence body shape, the streamlined appearance is not solely due to survival in a particular environment.\n\nD. The streamlined body has a selective advantage in that environment.\n- This is the most accurate explanation. Streamlined bodies reduce drag and increase speed, which is advantageous for swimming efficiently in water. This selective advantage has led to the development of streamlined body shapes in tuna, sharks, and dolphins, despite their different environments.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for the similar streamlined appearance of tuna, sharks, and dolphins is that the streamlined body has a selective advantage in their aquatic environments, making option D the correct answer.",
