            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Becomes an atom of a different element always.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. When an atom emits an alpha particle or a beta particle, it does not necessarily become an atom of a different element. The emitted particles are subatomic particles that are part of the nucleus, and they do not change the identity of the element.\n\nB. **May become an atom of a different element.**\n   - This statement is also incorrect. The emitted particles (alpha or beta) are not sufficient to change the identity of the element. They are simply subatomic particles that are part of the nucleus, and they do not alter the chemical properties of the element.\n\nC. **Becomes a different isotope of the same element.**\n   - This statement is correct. When an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which results in a different isotope of the same element. Similarly, when an atom emits a beta particle, it loses or gains a neutron, resulting in a different isotope of the same element.\n\nD. **Increases its mass.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The mass of an atom does not change when it emits an alpha or beta particle. The mass remains the same because the emitted particles are subatomic and do not contribute to the overall mass of the atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. When an atom emits an alpha particle or a beta particle, it becomes a different isotope of the same element.",
