            "content": "To determine how the stars will appear to your eyes, we need to consider the concept of angular resolution. Angular resolution is the ability of an optical system to distinguish two closely spaced objects as separate entities. It is determined by the diameter of the eye's pupil and the wavelength of light.\n\n1. **Angular Resolution and Eye Size**: The angular resolution of the human eye is approximately 1 minute of arc. This means that if two objects are separated by less than 1 minute of arc, they will appear to merge into a single point of light.\n\n2. **Effect of Small Angular Separation**: If the angular separation between the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of the eye, the stars will appear to merge into a single point of light. This is because the eye cannot distinguish the two stars as separate entities due to their close proximity.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The eye can see stars if they are separated by a distance greater than the angular resolution.\n   - **Option B**: Incorrect. If the stars are too close, they will not appear as distinct entities.\n   - **Option C**: Correct. The stars will appear as a single point of light because their angular separation is less than the eye's angular resolution.\n   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The stars will not appear to be touching; they will merge into a single point of light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. The two stars will look like a single point of light.**",
