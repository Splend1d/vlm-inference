            "content": "To understand why people can digest starch but not cellulose, we need to consider the structural differences between these two polysaccharides.\n\nStarch and cellulose are both composed of glucose monomers, but they differ in the way these monomers are linked together. Starch is a storage polysaccharide, primarily composed of two types of glucose molecules: amylose and amylopectin. In amylose, the glucose units are linked by \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds, while in amylopectin, the glucose units are linked by both \u03b1(1\u21924) and \u03b1(1\u21926) glycosidic bonds. This branching structure makes starch more accessible to enzymes like amylase, which can break down the \u03b1(1\u21924) bonds.\n\nCellulose, on the other hand, is a structural polysaccharide composed entirely of \u03b2(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds. This linear structure makes cellulose much more rigid and less accessible to digestive enzymes.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose.\n- This is correct. The \u03b1(1\u21924) and \u03b1(1\u21926) bonds in starch are different from the \u03b2(1\u21924) bonds in cellulose, affecting their digestibility.\n\nB. Molecules of starch are much smaller than molecules of cellulose.\n- This is incorrect. Both starch and cellulose are large molecules, and their size does not directly affect their digestibility.\n\nC. Starch is an intracellular molecule, while cellulose is an extracellular molecule.\n- This is incorrect. Both starch and cellulose are found in plants, and their digestibility is not determined by their location.\n\nD. Starch is hydrated by water, but cellulose is not.\n- This is incorrect. While starch is more hydrated than cellulose, this difference does not affect their digestibility.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is:\n\nA. The bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose.",
