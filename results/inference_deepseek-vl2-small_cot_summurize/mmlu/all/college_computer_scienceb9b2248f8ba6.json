This is known as the TCP connection-oriented model.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Routing packets through the network: This is typically the responsibility of the network layer protocols, such as IP (Internet Protocol), which are part of the OSI model.\n\nB. Reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines: This is the responsibility of the transport layer protocols, such as UDP (User Datagram Protocol) or the specific implementation of TCP, which is not the primary focus of TCP.\n\nD. Dealing with differences among operating system architectures: This is more related to the application layer and the operating system's ability to handle different network protocols and architectures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected.",
