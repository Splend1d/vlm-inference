            "content": "To understand why the man experiences fewer symptoms and recovers more quickly the second time he contracts the flu, we need to consider the role of different immune cells in the adaptive immune response.\n\n1. **Helper T cells (A)**: These cells are crucial for coordinating the immune response. They help activate other immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and B cells, by releasing cytokines. However, they do not directly contribute to the rapid recovery from the flu.\n\n2. **Cytotoxic T cells (B)**: These cells are responsible for killing infected cells. They play a role in the initial immune response by targeting and destroying virus-infected cells. However, they are not primarily responsible for the rapid recovery phase.\n\n3. **Memory cells (C)**: These cells are the key to rapid recovery. When the body encounters a pathogen for the first time, memory cells are generated. These cells \"remember\" the pathogen and can quickly recognize and respond to it upon subsequent exposures. This leads to a faster and more effective immune response, resulting in fewer symptoms and quicker recovery.\n\n4. **Plasma cells (D)**: These cells are responsible for producing antibodies. While they play a role in the immune response, they are not directly involved in the rapid recovery phase.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **C. Memory cells**. These cells are responsible for the rapid recovery experienced by the man in the second flu infection.",
