            "content": "The correct answer is C. radioactivity.\n\nThe Earth's internal energy is primarily generated by the decay of radioactive isotopes within the Earth's core. These isotopes, such as uranium and thorium, undergo radioactive decay, releasing heat in the process. This heat is then transferred to the surrounding rock and mantle, contributing to the Earth's internal energy.\n\nTidal friction (A) and gravitational pressure (B) are processes that occur on the Earth's surface and do not contribute to the Earth's internal energy. Tidal friction is the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's oceans, causing tides, while gravitational pressure is the force exerted by the Earth's mass on its surface.\n\nSolar radiation (D) is the energy received from the Sun, which is a source of external energy for the Earth's climate and weather systems, but it does not contribute to the Earth's internal energy.",
