            "content": "To find the total number of strawberries Max and Jonathon have left, we need to subtract the number of strawberries they ate from the total number of strawberries they picked.\n\nMax picked 187 strawberries and Jonathon picked 223 strawberries. Together, they picked \\(187 + 223 = 410\\) strawberries.\n\nThey ate 26 strawberries. So, the number of strawberries they have left is \\(410 - 26 = 384\\).\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. \\(190 + 220 - 30 + 4\\)\nB. \\(185 + 225 - 25 + 1\\)\nC. \\(200 + 200 - 30 - 4\\)\nD. \\(200 + 200 - 25 - 1\\)\n\nThe correct expression is \\(410 - 26 = 384\\). However, none of the options directly match this calculation. But, if we consider the closest option, it would be \\(200 + 200 - 25 - 1\\), which is closest to \\(410 - 26\\).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ D \\]",
