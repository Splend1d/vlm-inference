The teams do not need to be equally sized.\n\nLet's denote the number of students in the class as \\( n \\).\n\nSince each student dislikes three classmates, the total number of dislikes is \\( 3n \\).\n\nTo ensure that no student is teammates with someone they dislike, we need to create teams such that the total number of dislikes is minimized.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the worst-case scenario, where each student is teammates with someone they dislike. In this case, the total number of dislikes would be \\( 3n \\).\n\nHowever, we can do better than this. We can create teams such that each team has at least one student who is not teammates with anyone they dislike.\n\nLet's consider the minimum number of teams required. Since each team has at least one student who is not teammates with anyone they dislike, we can create at least \\( n \\) teams.\n\nHowever, this is not enough. We need to ensure that each team has at least one student who is not teammates with anyone they dislike.\n\nTo do this, we can create teams such that each team has at least one student who is teammates with someone they dislike. This way, each team will have at least one student who is not teammates with anyone they dislike.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of teams required. Since each team has at least one student who is teammates with someone they dislike, we can create at most \\( n \\) teams.\n\nHowever, this is not possible. If we create \\( n \\) teams, each team will have at least one student who is teammates with someone they dislike. This means that each team will have at least one student who is teammates with someone they dislike, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of teams required is \\( n-1 \\).\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the minimum number of teams required.\n\nTo find the minimum number of teams required, we need to consider the number of dislikes.
