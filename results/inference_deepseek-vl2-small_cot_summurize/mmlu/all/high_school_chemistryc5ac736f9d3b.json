            "content": "To determine the correct order of intermolecular attractive forces, we need to understand the nature of each type of force:\n\n1. **Induced Dipole**: This occurs when a polar molecule is placed near a nonpolar molecule, causing a temporary dipole in the nonpolar molecule. The attraction between the induced dipole and the polar molecule is relatively weak.\n\n2. **Dipole-Dipole**: This force occurs between two polar molecules. The positive end of one polar molecule is attracted to the negative end of another, resulting in a stronger attraction than induced dipole interactions.\n\n3. **Hydrogen Bond**: This is a strong type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when a hydrogen atom, covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom like nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, is attracted to another electronegative atom. Hydrogen bonds are significantly stronger than both induced dipole and dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option A**: Induced dipole < dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond. This order is incorrect because induced dipole is the weakest, not the strongest.\n\n- **Option B**: Hydrogen bond < dipole-dipole < induced dipole. This order is incorrect because hydrogen bonds are the strongest, not the weakest.\n\n- **Option C**: Induced dipole < hydrogen bond < dipole-dipole. This order is incorrect because hydrogen bonds are stronger than dipole-dipole interactions.\n\n- **Option D**: Dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond < induced dipole. This order is incorrect because hydrogen bonds are the strongest, not the weakest.\n\nThe correct order of intermolecular attractive forces from strongest to weakest is:\n\n**Hydrogen bond > Dipole-dipole > Induced dipole**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Hydrogen bond < dipole-dipole < induced dipole**.",
