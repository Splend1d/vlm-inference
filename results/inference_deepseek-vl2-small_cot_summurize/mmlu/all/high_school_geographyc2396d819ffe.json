            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Zero population growth**: This refers to a situation where the number of people in a population remains constant over time, meaning the birth rate equals the death rate. This is not about continued growth after replacement fertility is achieved.\n\nB. **Rapid growth rate**: This describes a situation where the population is growing quickly, but it doesn't specifically address the concept of continued growth after replacement fertility is met.\n\nC. **Homeostatic plateau**: This term is used to describe a stable state in a population where the birth and death rates are balanced, leading to no net change in population size. It does not imply continued growth.\n\nD. **Demographic momentum**: This is the tendency for a population to continue growing even after the birth rate has fallen below the replacement level. It occurs because the existing population size provides a base that continues to grow, often due to factors like a large number of young people or a high birth rate.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **D. demographic momentum**. This concept explains how a population can maintain or even increase in size despite a decline in birth rates, due to the existing population size providing a foundation for continued growth.",
