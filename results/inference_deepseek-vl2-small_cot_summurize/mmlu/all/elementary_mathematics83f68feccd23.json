            "content": "The expression 6 x 2 can be interpreted as multiplying 6 by 2, which results in 12. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days.\n- This situation involves multiplying the number of miles hiked each day by the number of days, which is 6 x 2 = 12 miles. This matches the expression 6 x 2.\n\nB. Rocco had six baseballs and gave away two of them.\n- This situation involves subtracting 2 from 6, which is 6 - 2 = 4 baseballs. This does not match the expression 6 x 2.\n\nC. Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans.\n- This situation involves adding 6 and 2, which is 6 + 2 = 8 tennis balls. This does not match the expression 6 x 2.\n\nD. Rocco biked six miles and then continued for two more miles.\n- This situation involves adding 6 and 2, which is 6 + 2 = 8 miles. This does not match the expression 6 x 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days.",
