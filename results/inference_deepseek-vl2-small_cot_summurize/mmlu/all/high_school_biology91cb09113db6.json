If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?\n\nA. There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.\nB. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\nC. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\nD.

            "content": "To determine the expected result, we need to understand the principles of osmosis and dialysis.\n\nOsmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration. Dialysis, on the other hand, is a process where water moves across a semipermeable membrane to balance solute concentrations on both sides.\n\nIn this scenario, the dialysis bag contains a 0.5 M solution, and the beaker contains a 0.6 M solution. The concentration of solute in the beaker is higher than in the dialysis bag.\n\n- **Option A**: There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.\n  - This is incorrect. Since the concentration of solute is higher in the beaker, water will move into the beaker, not out of the bag.\n\n- **Option B**: There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n  - This is correct. Water will move into the bag to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides of the dialysis membrane. As a result, the bag will swell.\n\n- **Option C**: The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\n  - This is incorrect. Water will move to balance the solute concentrations, causing the bag to swell.\n\n- **Option D**: The solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker.\n  - This is incorrect. Dialysis is a process that allows water to move, not solute. The solute remains inside the bag.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.**",
