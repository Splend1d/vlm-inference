            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. They serve four-year terms that coincide with the presidential term.\n- This statement is incorrect. Federal judges do not serve terms that coincide with the presidential term. Instead, they serve for life, which means they can remain on the bench for many years after the president's term has ended.\n\nB. They are appointed for life and can only be removed by impeachment.\n- This statement is partially correct. Federal judges are indeed appointed for life, which means they serve until they retire or are removed from office. However, they can be removed from office through impeachment, which is a process that involves both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nC. They are elected by Congress and serve ten-year terms.\n- This statement is incorrect. Federal judges are not elected by Congress. Instead, they are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Additionally, they serve for life, not ten-year terms.\n\nD. They are appointed for life and cannot be removed from office.\n- This statement is correct. Federal judges are appointed for life, meaning they serve until they retire or are removed from office. They cannot be removed from office through impeachment, as this process is reserved for federal officials, not judges.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Federal judges are appointed for life and cannot be removed from office.",
