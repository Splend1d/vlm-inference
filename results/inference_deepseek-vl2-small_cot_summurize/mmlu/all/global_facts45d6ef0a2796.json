The global death rate from HIV/AIDS varies by age due to factors such as vulnerability, access to healthcare, and social determinants.\n\n2. **Analyzing Age Groups**:\n   - **Under 5**: This age group generally has lower mortality rates from HIV/AIDS compared to older age groups. Young children are less likely to be exposed to the virus, and healthcare systems are often better equipped to manage and treat them.\n   - **14-May**: This age group is not a standard age category used in public health data. It might be a typographical error or a specific term not widely recognized in the context of HIV/AIDS mortality.\n   - **15-49**: This age group is often referred to as the \"working-age\" population. While this group is affected by HIV/AIDS, the mortality rate is generally lower compared to older age groups due to better access to healthcare and preventive measures.\n   - **Over 50**: This age group is typically the most affected by HIV/AIDS mortality. Older adults are more vulnerable due to factors such as weakened immune systems, higher prevalence of co-infections, and less access to healthcare.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the age group with the highest global HIV/AIDS death rate is the one most affected by the virus and its complications.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. over 50",
