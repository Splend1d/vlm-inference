            "content": "To understand how a competitive inhibitor exerts its effect, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Irreversibly forming covalent links with the enzyme: This would mean the inhibitor permanently changes the enzyme's structure, which is not typical for competitive inhibitors. Competitive inhibitors usually do not form covalent bonds with enzymes.\n\nB. Irreversibly modifying some of the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site: This describes a covalent modification, which is not characteristic of competitive inhibition. Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the active site.\n\nC. Competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site: This is the correct description of competitive inhibition. Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme, competing with the substrate for the same binding site. This prevents the substrate from binding, thus inhibiting the enzyme's activity.\n\nD. Reversibly decreasing the number of enzyme molecules that are available to bind substrates: This describes a decrease in enzyme concentration, not a competitive inhibition mechanism. Competitive inhibition involves the same enzyme molecules competing for the same substrate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the active site of the enzyme, competing with the substrate for the same binding site.",
