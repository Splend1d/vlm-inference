            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which equation correctly represents the relationship between the number of pennies in Nick's stack and the height of the stack.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information:\n- A stack of 7 pennies has a height of 1 centimeter.\n- Nick has a stack of pennies with a height of 4 centimeters.\n\nWe need to find the number of pennies, \\( n \\), in Nick's stack.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( n = 7 + 4 \\)\n- This equation suggests that the number of pennies is the sum of 7 and 4. However, this does not account for the height of the stack. The height of the stack is not directly related to the number of pennies in a simple additive manner.\n\nB. \\( n = 7 - 4 \\)\n- This equation suggests that the number of pennies is the difference between 7 and 4. Again, this does not account for the height of the stack. The height of the stack is not directly related to the number of pennies in a simple subtractive manner.\n\nC. \\( n = 7 \\times 4 \\)\n- This equation suggests that the number of pennies is the product of 7 and 4. This could be a correct representation if the height of the stack is directly proportional to the number of pennies. However, the height of the stack is given as 4 centimeters, not 7 centimeters.\n\nD. \\( n = 7 \\div 4 \\)\n- This equation suggests that the number of pennies is the quotient of 7 divided by 4. This could be a correct representation if the height of the stack is directly proportional to the number of pennies. Let's verify this:\n\nIf the height of the stack is directly proportional to the number of pennies, then:\n\\[ \\text{Height} = \\text{Number of pennies} \\times \\text{Height per penny} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Height of 7 pennies = 1 cm\n- Height of 4 pennies = 4 cm\n\nLet \\( h \\) be the height per penny. Then:\n\\[ 1 = 7h \\]\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{7} \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nNow, for 4 pennies:\n\\[ 4 = 4h \\]\n\\[ h = 1 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThis confirms that the height per penny is 1 cm. Therefore, the number of pennies in Nick's stack can be calculated as:\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\text{Height of 4 pennies}}{\\text{Height per penny}} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4 \\]\n\nThus, the correct equation is:\n\\[ n = 7 \\div 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]",
