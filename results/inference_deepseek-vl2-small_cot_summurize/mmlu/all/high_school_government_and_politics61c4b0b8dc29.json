Framers' unqualified commitment to individual rights\n\nThe correct answer is A. The Framers of the Constitution were deeply committed to individual rights and liberties. They believed that a strong Bill of Rights was essential to protect these rights from government overreach. The rapid adoption of the Bill of Rights, which includes the first ten amendments to the Constitution, reflects their unwavering commitment to safeguarding individual freedoms and ensuring that the government would not infringe upon them. This commitment was a cornerstone of the American Revolution and the early American Republic, and it continues to be a fundamental aspect of American democracy.",
