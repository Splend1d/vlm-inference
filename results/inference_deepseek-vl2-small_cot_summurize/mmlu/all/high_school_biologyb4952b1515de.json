            "content": "To understand why most animal cells are relatively small, we need to consider the relationship between cell size and surface-to-volume ratio.\n\n- **Option A: Smaller cells avoid excessive osmosis and subsequent lysis.**\n  - While smaller cells might be more resistant to osmotic pressure, the primary reason for their size is not to avoid lysis. Lysis occurs when a cell absorbs too much water, causing it to burst, which is more related to the cell's internal environment than its size.\n\n- **Option B: Smaller cells have a smaller surface-to-volume ratio.**\n  - This is the correct answer. The surface-to-volume ratio is a measure of how much surface area a cell has relative to its volume. A smaller surface-to-volume ratio means that the cell has less surface area relative to its volume. This is crucial because it allows for more efficient exchange of materials (like oxygen and nutrients) with the environment. In smaller cells, the surface area is more concentrated, facilitating efficient gas exchange and nutrient uptake.\n\n- **Option C: Smaller cells have a larger surface-to-volume ratio.**\n  - This is incorrect. A larger surface-to-volume ratio would mean that the cell has more surface area relative to its volume, which is not typical for animal cells.\n\n- **Option D: Smaller cells fit together more tightly.**\n  - While smaller cells might fit together more tightly in tissues, this is not the primary reason for their size. The size of cells is more related to their functional needs rather than their ability to pack together.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is **B. Smaller cells have a smaller surface-to-volume ratio.** This characteristic is essential for efficient exchange of materials, which is vital for the cell's survival and function.",
