Pioneer settlement to 1870\u2014Germans, British, Scotch-Irish, Africans: This is correct. During the pioneer period, many immigrants from Germany, Britain, the Scotch-Irish, and Africans settled in the United States.\n\nB. 1870\u20131914\u2014Asians: This is incorrect. During this period, the U.S. did not experience a significant influx of Asian immigrants. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and other restrictive laws limited Asian immigration.\n\nC. 1870\u20131914\u2014Eastern and southern Europeans: This is correct. This period saw a large influx of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe, including Italians, Poles, and Greeks.\n\nD. 1965\u2013present\u2014Hispanics: This is correct. Since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, there has been a significant increase in Hispanic immigration to the United States.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1870\u20131914\u2014Asians, as this period did not see a significant increase in Asian immigration.",
