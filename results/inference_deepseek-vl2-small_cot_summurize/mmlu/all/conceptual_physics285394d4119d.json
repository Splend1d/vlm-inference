Atoms with a definite geometrical arrangement:\n- Minerals are composed of crystals, which are made up of atoms arranged in a specific, repeating pattern. This arrangement is known as a crystal lattice. The regular, repeating structure of atoms in a crystal is a defining characteristic of minerals.\n\nB. Molecules that perpetually move:\n- This description is more characteristic of gases or liquids, where molecules are in constant motion. In contrast, minerals are solid substances with a fixed structure.\n\nC. X-ray patterns:\n- X-ray patterns are a result of the interaction of X-rays with matter, often used in crystallography to study the structure of crystals. However, X-ray patterns themselves are not the composition of minerals; they are a method used to analyze them.\n\nD. 3-dimensional chessboards:\n- This description is metaphorical and not a scientific term. It does not accurately describe the composition of minerals.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Atoms with a definite geometrical arrangement.",
