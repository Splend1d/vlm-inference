            "content": "The correct answer is B. under the \"double jeopardy\" provision of the Constitution.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Double Jeopardy**: This is a constitutional protection that prevents a person from being tried twice for the same crime. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to both state and federal prosecutions. This means that if a person is acquitted of a crime at the state level, they cannot be retried for the same crime at the federal level.\n\n- **A. on appeal by state prosecutors**: This is incorrect because the retrial at the federal level is not an appeal. An appeal is a process where a higher court reviews a lower court's decision to determine if there was an error in the application of the law.\n\n- **C. because new evidence has voided the state-level verdict**: This is incorrect because the Double Jeopardy Clause does not allow for retrials based on new evidence. The protection against double jeopardy is a complete bar to further prosecution, not just a bar to retrial based on new evidence.\n\n- **D. as civil liberties violations**: This is incorrect because the Double Jeopardy Clause is a constitutional protection, not a civil liberties violation. Civil liberties violations typically refer to violations of individual rights protected by the Bill of Rights, such as freedom of speech or the right to a fair trial.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. under the \"double jeopardy\" provision of the Constitution.",
