This process allows them to derive energy from inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen, rather than relying on light energy.\n\nA. Oxidizing inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen: This is the correct answer. Chemosynthetic bacteria use the energy from the oxidation of inorganic substances to produce organic compounds, which they can then use as food.\n\nB. Reducing inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen: This is not the correct answer. Reducing inorganic substances is a process that involves the gain of electrons, which is not the primary method by which chemosynthetic bacteria produce their own food.\n\nC. Oxidizing organic compounds: This is not the correct answer. Chemosynthetic bacteria do not oxidize organic compounds to produce their own food. Instead, they use inorganic substances to produce organic compounds.\n\nD. Transducing light energy into chemical energy: This is not the correct answer. Chemosynthetic bacteria do not use light energy to produce their own food. They use inorganic substances to produce organic compounds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Oxidizing inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen.",
