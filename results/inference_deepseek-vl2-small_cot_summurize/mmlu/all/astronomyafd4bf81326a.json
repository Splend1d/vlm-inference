            "content": "To determine the correct order of electromagnetic radiation from shortest to longest wavelength, we need to understand the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is a range of all types of electromagnetic radiation, organized by wavelength or frequency.\n\n1. **Gamma Rays**: These have the shortest wavelengths and the highest frequencies. They are produced by nuclear reactions and are used in medical treatments and in the study of atomic nuclei.\n\n2. **X Rays**: These have slightly longer wavelengths than gamma rays. They are used in medical imaging and in the study of materials at the atomic level.\n\n3. **Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation**: UV radiation has longer wavelengths than X rays. It is responsible for causing sunburn and is used in sterilization processes.\n\n4. **Visible Light**: This is the range of electromagnetic radiation that can be seen by the human eye. It has wavelengths longer than UV radiation.\n\n5. **Infrared Radiation**: Infrared radiation has even longer wavelengths than visible light. It is felt as heat and is used in remote sensing and thermal imaging.\n\n6. **Microwaves**: These have longer wavelengths than infrared radiation and are used in communication technologies and in cooking.\n\n7. **Radio Waves**: These have the longest wavelengths and the lowest frequencies. They are used in radio and television broadcasting, as well as in radar and other communication technologies.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct order from shortest to longest wavelength is:\n\n- Gamma rays\n- X rays\n- Ultraviolet radiation\n- Visible light\n- Infrared radiation\n- Microwaves\n- Radio waves\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. radio infrared visible light ultraviolet X rays gamma rays",
