            "content": "To understand the differences and similarities between incomplete dominance and epistasis, let's analyze each term:\n\n1. **Incomplete Dominance**: This occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygote is a blend of the phenotypes of the two homozygotes. For example, in pea plants, the F1 generation may have a purple flower color, but the F2 generation can show a range of flower colors from white to deep purple. This blending is due to the interaction of two alleles at a single locus, where neither allele completely masks the other.\n\n2. **Epistasis**: This is a type of interaction where the effect of one gene is modified by one or more other genes. In epistatic relationships, the presence of one allele can mask the effect of another allele at a different locus. For example, in some plants, the presence of one allele can cause a flower color to be hidden by another allele.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: Both terms describe inheritance controlled by the interaction of multiple alleles at different loci. This is correct because both incomplete dominance and epistasis involve interactions between multiple alleles at different loci.\n\n- **Option B**: Both terms describe inheritance controlled by the interaction of multiple genes at different loci. This is incorrect because epistasis specifically involves the interaction of multiple genes, not just alleles.\n\n- **Option C**: Incomplete dominance describes the interaction of two genes at different loci; epistasis describes the interaction of two alleles. This is incorrect because incomplete dominance involves the interaction of two alleles at one locus, not two genes.\n\n- **Option D**: Incomplete dominance describes the interaction of two alleles on one gene; epistasis describes the interaction of two genes and their respective alleles. This is incorrect because incomplete dominance involves the interaction of two alleles at one locus, not two genes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. Both terms describe inheritance controlled by the interaction of multiple alleles at different loci.**",
