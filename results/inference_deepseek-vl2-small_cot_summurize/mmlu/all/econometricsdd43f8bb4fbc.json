            "content": "To determine the statistical significance of the autocorrelation coefficients, we need to calculate the standard errors and then use a t-test to compare the calculated t-values to the critical t-values from the t-distribution table.\n\nThe formula for the standard error of the autocorrelation coefficient is:\n\nSE = sqrt(1 - r^2) / n\n\nwhere r is the autocorrelation coefficient and n is the sample size.\n\nFor lag 1, the autocorrelation coefficient is 0.2, and the sample size is 250. So, the standard error is:\n\nSE1 = sqrt(1 - 0.2^2) / 250 = sqrt(0.76) / 250 \u2248 0.087\n\nFor lag 2, the autocorrelation coefficient is -0.15, and the sample size is 250. So, the standard error is:\n\nSE2 = sqrt(1 - (-0.15)^2) / 250 = sqrt(0.9025) / 250 \u2248 0.095\n\nFor lag 3, the autocorrelation coefficient is -0.1, and the sample size is 250. So, the standard error is:\n\nSE3 = sqrt(1 - (-0.1)^2) / 250 = sqrt(0.91) / 250 \u2248 0.095\n\nNow, we need to calculate the t-values for each lag:\n\nt1 = 0.2 / 0.087 \u2248 2.29\nt2 = -0.15 / 0.095 \u2248 -1.58\nt3 = -0.1 / 0.095 \u2248 -1.05\n\nNext, we need to find the critical t-values for a 5% level of significance with 249 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 250 - 1 = 249). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-values:\n\nt(0.025, 249) \u2248 1.66\nt(0.05, 249) \u2248 1.96\n\nNow, we compare the calculated t-values to the critical t-values:\n\n- For lag 1 (t1 = 2.29), the calculated t-value is greater than the critical t-value (1.66), so it is statistically significant at the 5% level.\n- For lag 2 (t2 = -1.58), the calculated t-value is less than the critical t-value (1.96), so it is not statistically significant at the 5% level.\n- For lag 3 (t3 = -1.05), the calculated t-value is less than the critical t-value (1.96), so it is not statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\nTherefore, the statistically significant autocorrelation coefficients are lag 1 only.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 1 only.",
