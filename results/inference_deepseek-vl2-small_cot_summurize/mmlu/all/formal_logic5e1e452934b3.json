T \u00b7 U\n\nLet's construct the truth table:\n\n| S | T | U | ~S | ~T | ~S \u2228 T | ~S \u00b7 U | ~T \u2228 U | T \u00b7 U |\n|---|---|---|----|----|---------|--------|---------|-------|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |  1 |  1 |    0     |   1     |   1     |  1    |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |  1 |  0 |    0     |   0     |   1     |  0    |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |  1 |  0 |    0     |   0     |   1     |  0    |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 |  1 |  0 |    0     |   0     |   1     |  0    |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |  0 |  1 |    1     |   0     |   1     |  0    |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |  0 |  1 |    1     |   0     |   1     |  0    |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 |  0 |  1 |    1     |   0     |   1     |  0    |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |  0 |  1 |    1     |   0     |   1     |  0    |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth values of the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. ~S \u2228 T: This is true when either S is false or T is true.\n2. ~S \u00b7 U: This is true when either S is false or U is true.\n3. ~T \u2228 U: This is true when either T is false or U is true.\n4. T \u00b7 U: This is true when both T and U are true.\n\nThe conclusion is T \u00b7 U, which is true when both T and U are true.\n\nNow, let's check the validity of the argument:\n\n- If S is false and T is true, then ~S \u2228 T is true, ~S \u00b7 U is true, and ~T \u2228 U is true. However, T \u00b7 U is not necessarily true in this case.\n- If S is false and U is true, then ~S \u00b7 U is true, ~T \u2228 U is true, and T \u00b7 U is true.\n- If S is true and T is false, then ~S \u2228 T is true, ~S \u00b7 U is true, and ~T \u2228 U is true. However, T \u00b7 U is not necessarily true in this case.\n- If S is true and U is true, then ~S \u00b7 U is true, ~T \u2228 U is true, and T \u00b7 U is true.\n\nSince there are cases where the conclusion is not necessarily true, the argument is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when S, T, and U are true",
