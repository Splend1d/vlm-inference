This statement is true.\n\nii) The results may be affected by unrepresentative combinations of random draws.\n- With fewer replications, the results may not be representative of the population due to the limited number of random draws. This statement is true.\n\niii) The standard errors on the estimated quantities may be unacceptably large.\n- Smaller sample sizes generally lead to larger standard errors, making the estimates less reliable. This statement is true.\n\niv) Variance reduction techniques can be used to reduce the standard errors.\n- Variance reduction techniques are often used to improve the precision of estimates when the number of replications is small. This statement is true.\n\nGiven the analysis, all four statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)",
