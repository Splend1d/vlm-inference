A buffer overflow involves writing beyond the allocated space, not accessing a freed pointer.\n\nB. **when copying a buffer from the stack to the heap**: This is not a buffer overflow. Copying a buffer from the stack to the heap is a normal operation in memory management, not a vulnerability.\n\nC. **when a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it**: This is a classic scenario for a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it is designed to hold. If the program uses a pointer to access memory outside the buffer's allocated space, it can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.\n\nD. **when the program notices a buffer has filled up, and so starts to reject requests**: This describes a buffer underflow, not a buffer overflow. Buffer overflow involves writing more data than the buffer can hold, while underflow involves reading less data than the buffer can hold.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. when a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it.",
