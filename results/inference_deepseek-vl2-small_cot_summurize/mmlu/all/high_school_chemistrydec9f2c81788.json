            "content": "To determine which condition indicates a spontaneous reaction, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. **At equilibrium there are more products than reactants**: This statement describes a state of equilibrium, not spontaneity. At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, and the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant. This does not indicate that the reaction is spontaneous.\n\nB. **The value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero**: The Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G\u00b0) is a measure of the energy change in a reaction. A positive \u0394G\u00b0 indicates that the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions, as it requires an input of energy to proceed. Therefore, this option does not indicate spontaneity.\n\nC. **The value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero**: The entropy change (\u0394S\u00b0) measures the disorder or randomness of a system. A positive \u0394S\u00b0 indicates that the disorder of the system increases, which is a driving force for spontaneity. Thus, this option correctly indicates that a reaction is spontaneous.\n\nD. **The value of Keq is less than one**: The equilibrium constant (Keq) is a measure of the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium. A Keq less than one indicates that the equilibrium lies to the left, favoring reactants, which means the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero.",
