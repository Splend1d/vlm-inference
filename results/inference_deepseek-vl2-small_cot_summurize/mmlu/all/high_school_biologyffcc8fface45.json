            "content": "To determine which statement is an inference of natural selection, we need to understand the concept of natural selection and how it operates within a population.\n\nNatural selection is a process where individuals with traits that are better suited to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully than those with less advantageous traits. Over time, this leads to an increase in the frequency of these advantageous traits in the population.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Subsequent generations of a population should have greater proportions of individuals that possess traits better suited for success.\n- This statement directly reflects the principle of natural selection. It suggests that traits that confer a survival or reproductive advantage will become more common in successive generations, as these individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nB. An individual organism undergoes evolution over the course of its lifetime.\n- This statement is not an inference of natural selection. Evolution refers to the long-term changes in the genetic makeup of a population, not the changes that occur within an individual's lifetime.\n\nC. Habitats do not generally have unlimited resources.\n- This statement is a general observation about the environment but does not directly infer the process of natural selection. It is more of a fact about the ecological context rather than a conclusion drawn from the process of natural selection.\n\nD. Natural populations tend to reproduce to their full biological potential.\n- This statement is about reproductive strategies and does not specifically relate to the process of natural selection. It does not describe how advantageous traits become more common in a population.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Subsequent generations of a population should have greater proportions of individuals that possess traits better suited for success.",
