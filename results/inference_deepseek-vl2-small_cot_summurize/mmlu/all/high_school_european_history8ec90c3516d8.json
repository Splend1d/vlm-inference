One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\n\nA. Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.\nB. They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\nC. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.\nD. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n",

            "content": "Voltaire's quote reflects a belief in the power of science and reason to explain natural phenomena, including the Lisbon earthquake. He uses the example of the earthquake to illustrate the unpredictability of nature and the potential for human life to be destroyed by natural disasters. This suggests that he believed that scientific discoveries could provide a more objective and rational understanding of the world, which could lead to a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nTherefore, the ideas expressed by Voltaire best illustrate the characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals that many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
