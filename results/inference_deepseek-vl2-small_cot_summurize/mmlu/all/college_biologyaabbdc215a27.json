            "content": "To determine which statement is true about cancer cells grown in culture, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Divide an indefinite number of times**: Cancer cells, unlike normal cells, have the ability to divide indefinitely. This is a hallmark of cancer cells, which can continue to grow and divide without the normal regulatory mechanisms that limit cell division in healthy cells.\n\nB. **Do not display contact inhibition**: Contact inhibition is a process where cells stop dividing when they come into contact with each other. Normal cells exhibit this behavior, but cancer cells often bypass this inhibition, allowing them to grow uncontrollably.\n\nC. **Require a surface for attachment in order to grow**: This statement is incorrect. Cancer cells can grow on various surfaces, including plastic, glass, and even in liquid cultures. They do not require a specific surface for attachment to grow.\n\nD. **Proliferate to the same cell density**: While cancer cells can proliferate rapidly, they do not necessarily proliferate to the same cell density as normal cells. The density at which cancer cells grow can vary depending on the type of cancer and the environment.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. **Divide an indefinite number of times**. This is the characteristic feature of cancer cells that allows them to form tumors and spread throughout the body.",
