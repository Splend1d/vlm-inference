The expression should reflect the number of cookies eaten each week and then sum them up.\n\n- The expression for the total number of cookies eaten in two weeks is \\( 2x + 2x \\), where \\( x \\) represents the number of cookies eaten each week.\n\nThus, the correct expression is:\n\\[ 2x + 2x \\]\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
