The pelicans in the question are not geographically isolated; they are from the same species and have been in contact for 150 years.\n\nB. **Sympatric speciation**: This occurs when a population becomes reproductively isolated from other populations while still being in the same geographic area. This is the scenario described in the question. The pelicans separated due to an unsuccessful migration, became reproductively isolated, and then were reunited 150 years later, leading to the inability to produce offspring.\n\nC. **Genetic drift**: This is a random change in the frequency of alleles in a population. While genetic drift can contribute to changes in allele frequencies, it does not explain the inability to produce offspring in this context.\n\nD. **Gene flow**: This is the transfer of genetic material between populations. In the scenario described, the pelicans were reproductively isolated, so gene flow did not occur.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. sympatric speciation.",
