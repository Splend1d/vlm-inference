Additionally, proteins are not the principal components of all viruses.\n\nB. nucleic acid and a capsid: This option is correct. Viruses consist of a nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA) and a protein shell called a capsid. The nucleic acid carries the genetic information necessary for replication, while the capsid protects the nucleic acid and aids in the delivery of the virus to a host cell.\n\nC. DNA and cell membrane: Viruses do not have cell membranes. They are not capable of independent movement and rely on host cells for replication.\n\nD. RNA and cell wall: Viruses do not have cell walls. They are not cells and do not have cell walls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. nucleic acid and a capsid.",
