            "content": "The proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. This means that the proton has a velocity in the +z-direction.\n\nWhen the proton passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, the proton's trajectory is not affected. This is because the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the proton's velocity, so they do not exert any force on the proton.\n\nIf the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would be accelerated in the +z-direction with a velocity of 2V/m. The electric field would still be in the +x-direction and the magnetic field would still be in the +y-direction.\n\nSince the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the proton's velocity, the proton would be deflected in the +x-direction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. deflected in the +x-direction",
