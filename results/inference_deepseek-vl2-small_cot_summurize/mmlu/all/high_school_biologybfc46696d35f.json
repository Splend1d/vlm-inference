            "content": "To understand which factors must exist for natural selection to act upon a population, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Genetic variation among individuals: Natural selection operates on the principle that individuals with traits better suited to their environment have a higher chance of survival and reproduction. Genetic variation provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon. Without genetic variation, there would be no differences in traits to be selected for or against.\n\nB. Variation among individuals caused by environmental factors: Environmental factors can cause variation in traits, but this variation is not sufficient on its own. It is the genetic variation that is crucial for natural selection to act upon. Environmental factors can lead to different selective pressures, but they do not create the genetic diversity needed for natural selection to function.\n\nC. Sexual reproduction: Sexual reproduction is a mechanism for producing genetic variation. It introduces new combinations of genes, which can lead to new traits. However, sexual reproduction alone does not ensure that there is genetic variation. It is the genetic variation that is necessary for natural selection to act upon.\n\nD. B and C only: This option suggests that both environmental variation and sexual reproduction are necessary for natural selection to act. While sexual reproduction is necessary for genetic variation, environmental variation alone is not sufficient. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A. Genetic variation among individuals. This is because natural selection requires genetic variation to act upon, as it relies on the differences in traits to drive the process of natural selection.",
