This means that the tax multiplier becomes more negative, increasing in magnitude.\n\nB. **The spending multiplier falls.**\n   - The spending multiplier is related to the tax multiplier through the equation:\n     \\[ \\text{Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{MPS} + \\text{MPC}} \\]\n   - If the spending multiplier falls, it implies that the tax multiplier increases in magnitude.\n\nC. **The MPC increases.**\n   - If the MPC increases, the denominator of the tax multiplier formula becomes smaller. This means that the tax multiplier becomes less negative, decreasing in magnitude.\n\nD. **Government spending increases.**\n   - An increase in government spending does not directly affect the tax multiplier. The tax multiplier is determined by the relationship between the MPS and MPC, not by changes in government spending.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are:\n\n- A. The MPS increases.\n- B. The spending multiplier falls.\n\nThese options correctly describe scenarios where the tax multiplier increases in magnitude.",
