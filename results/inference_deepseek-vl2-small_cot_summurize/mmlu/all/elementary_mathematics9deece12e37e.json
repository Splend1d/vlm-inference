The practice range charges $4.00 for a bucket of 40 golf balls.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost per golf ball:**\n   - The cost for 40 golf balls is $4.00.\n   - Therefore, the cost per golf ball is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per golf ball} = \\frac{\\$4.00}{40} = \\$0.10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost for 100 golf balls:**\n   - With the cost per golf ball known, we can now find the cost for 100 golf balls.\n   - Multiply the cost per golf ball by the number of golf balls:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost for 100 golf balls} = \\$0.10 \\times 100 = \\$10.00\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The cost of a bucket of 100 golf balls is $10.00.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. $10.00.",
