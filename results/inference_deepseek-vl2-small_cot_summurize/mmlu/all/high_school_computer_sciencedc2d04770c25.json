If the item is found, it is appended to `resultList`.\n\nThe `isFound` procedure is designed to return true if the item is found in `inputList2` and false otherwise. Therefore, the items that are appended to `resultList` are the ones that appear in `inputList2` but not in `inputList1`.\n\nThe `inputList1` is initially empty, so the only items that can be appended to `resultList` are those that appear in `inputList2`. Therefore, the contents of `resultList` after the code segment is executed are the elements that appear in `inputList2` but not in `inputList1`.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
