            "content": "The correct answer is C. Both A and B.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. With normal frequency supply, the electromagnetic forces cause severe stirring action in the molten metal.\n- This statement is true. In direct core type induction furnaces, the induction coil is placed inside the furnace, and the primary circuit is connected to the power supply. The alternating current (AC) in the primary circuit creates a magnetic field that induces an alternating current in the secondary coil. This alternating current induces eddy currents in the molten metal, causing it to stir and mix. This stirring action is necessary to ensure uniform heating and to prevent hot spots.\n\nB. Magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor.\n- This statement is also true. In direct core type induction furnaces, the primary and secondary circuits are closely coupled, but the coupling is not perfect. The primary coil is placed inside the furnace, and the secondary coil is placed outside the furnace. The magnetic field generated by the primary coil induces a current in the secondary coil, but the coupling is not as efficient as in other types of induction furnaces, such as shell-type or open-core type. This poor magnetic coupling can lead to inefficiencies and reduced performance.\n\nTherefore, both statements A and B are true, and the correct answer is C. Both A and B.",
