            "content": "To determine which constant De Broglie proposed as the relationship between the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle, we need to consider the historical context and the mathematical formulation of his hypothesis.\n\nDe Broglie's hypothesis, known as the de Broglie hypothesis, was introduced in 1924. It suggested that particles, such as electrons, exhibit wave-like properties. This idea was revolutionary at the time and was a precursor to the development of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe de Broglie hypothesis is mathematically expressed as:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{h}{L} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( p \\) is the linear momentum of the particle,\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant,\n- \\( L \\) is the wavelength of the particle.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Planck\u2019s constant**: This is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics, representing the smallest unit of energy and is crucial in the quantization of energy levels. It is indeed the constant that appears in the de Broglie equation, linking momentum and wavelength.\n\nB. **Boltzmann\u2019s constant**: This constant is used in statistical mechanics to relate the average kinetic energy of particles to the temperature of a system. It is not involved in the de Broglie hypothesis.\n\nC. **The Rydberg constant**: This constant is used in atomic physics to describe the wavelengths of spectral lines of hydrogen. It is not related to the de Broglie hypothesis.\n\nD. **The speed of light**: While the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics, it is not the constant in the de Broglie equation. The speed of light appears in the equation as a conversion factor between momentum and wavelength.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Planck\u2019s constant\n\nThe de Broglie hypothesis established a direct relationship between the momentum and wavelength of particles, which was a significant step in the development of quantum theory.",
