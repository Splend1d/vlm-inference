            "content": "When two charged particles are released from rest and both increase in acceleration, it indicates that they are experiencing a force that is causing them to accelerate in the same direction. This force is the electric force, which is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ F = qE \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force, \\( q \\) is the charge, and \\( E \\) is the electric field.\n\nSince both particles are experiencing the same electric field \\( E \\), and the force \\( F \\) is the same for both, it follows that the charges \\( q \\) must be the same for both particles. This is because the force is directly proportional to the charge, and since the electric field is the same for both particles, the force must be the same for both.\n\nTherefore, the sign of the charge of the particles is the same.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. the same",
