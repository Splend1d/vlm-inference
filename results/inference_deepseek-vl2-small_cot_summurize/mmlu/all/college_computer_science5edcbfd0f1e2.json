            "content": "A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is\n\nA. 0.8 microseconds\nB. 1.2 microseconds\nC. 1.6 microseconds\nD. 2.4 microseconds\n",

            "content": "To determine the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, we need to consider the time required for each step in the process.\n\n1. **Digitization of one input signal**:\n   - Time for one digitization: 12 microseconds\n   - Time for five CPU instructions (including the triggering instruction): 5 * 12 microseconds = 60 microseconds\n\n2. **Averaging of four samples**:\n   - Time for averaging four samples: 10 CPU instructions * 12 microseconds = 120 microseconds\n\n3. **Output of the average value**:\n   - Time for outputting the average value: 12 microseconds\n\nNow, we sum up all these times to find the total time required for one complete cycle of digitization and averaging:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total time per cycle} = 60 \\text{ microseconds} + 120 \\text{ microseconds} + 12 \\text{ microseconds} = 192 \\text{ microseconds} \\]\n\nTo find the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, we need to consider the time it takes for the CPU to execute these instructions. Since the CPU can execute instructions at a maximum rate of 1 microsecond per instruction, the maximum average instruction execution time is 1 microsecond.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, which is the time it takes to complete one cycle of digitization and averaging. Therefore, the maximum average instruction execution time is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maximum average instruction execution time} = 192 \\text{ microseconds} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.6 \\text{ microseconds}} \\]",
