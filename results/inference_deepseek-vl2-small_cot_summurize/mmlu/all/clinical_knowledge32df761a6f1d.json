            "content": "To determine which of the options is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis, let's analyze each one:\n\nA. **Stridor**: Stridor is a high-pitched, wheezing sound that occurs when there is a blockage in the airway. It is a common symptom of anaphylaxis, which can cause swelling in the throat and airway, leading to difficulty breathing.\n\nB. **Bradycardia**: Bradycardia refers to a slower than normal heart rate. While anaphylaxis can cause some cardiovascular symptoms, including a rapid heart rate, bradycardia is not typically associated with anaphylaxis.\n\nC. **Severe wheeze**: Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound that occurs during breathing. Severe wheezing is a common symptom of anaphylaxis, often due to airway swelling.\n\nD. **Rash**: Anaphylaxis can present with a variety of symptoms, including a rash. This is due to the body's allergic response, which can manifest as hives or other skin reactions.\n\nBy examining each option, we can conclude that:\n\n- **Stridor** and **Severe wheeze** are both symptoms of anaphylaxis.\n- **Rash** is also a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n- **Bradycardia** is not typically associated with anaphylaxis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Bradycardia**.",
