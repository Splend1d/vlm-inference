Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in any factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5.\n\nTo find the number of trailing zeros in \\( k! \\), we need to count the number of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., up to \\( k \\).\n\nLet's denote the number of trailing zeros in \\( k! \\) as \\( x \\). Then, we have:\n\\[ x = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\]\n\nWe want to find the number of positive integers \\( k \\) for which \\( x = 99 \\).\n\nLet's analyze the possible values of \\( k \\):\n\n1.
