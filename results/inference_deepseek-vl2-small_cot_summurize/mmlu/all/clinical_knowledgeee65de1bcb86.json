            "content": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true about hepatomegaly:\n\nA. Emphysema is a cause: Emphysema is a condition characterized by the destruction of the alveoli in the lungs, leading to reduced lung capacity and difficulty in breathing. It is not a cause of hepatomegaly, which is the enlargement of the liver. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium: This statement is incorrect. Hepatomegaly typically involves the liver enlarging in size, but it is not specifically limited to the left hypochondrium. The liver can enlarge in various directions, including upwards, downwards, and laterally.\n\nC. The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause: Jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura are indeed associated with alcohol consumption, particularly in chronic alcoholics. These symptoms can indicate liver damage due to excessive alcohol intake. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nD. The liver is usually resonant to percussion: This statement is incorrect. In hepatomegaly, the liver is often dull to percussion due to its enlarged size and potential fluid accumulation. The liver is typically resonant to percussion in cases of normal liver size.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is C. The presence of jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause.",
