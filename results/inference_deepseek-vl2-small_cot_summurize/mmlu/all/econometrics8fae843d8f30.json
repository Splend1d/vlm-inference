            "content": "To determine which statements are true, let's analyze each one:\n\n(i) The standard error will be positively related to the residual variance.\n\nThe standard error of the slope coefficient is calculated as the standard deviation of the residuals divided by the square root of the sample size. The residual variance is a measure of the variability of the residuals, and a higher residual variance means more variability, which increases the standard error. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n(ii) The standard error will be negatively related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value.\n\nThe dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable is measured by the variance of the explanatory variable. A higher variance means more dispersion, which increases the standard error. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n(iii) The standard error will be negatively related to the sample size.\n\nThe standard error is inversely related to the square root of the sample size. As the sample size increases, the standard error decreases. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n(iv) The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate.\n\nThe standard error is a measure of the variability of the coefficient estimate. A smaller standard error indicates a more precise estimate. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nAll four statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
