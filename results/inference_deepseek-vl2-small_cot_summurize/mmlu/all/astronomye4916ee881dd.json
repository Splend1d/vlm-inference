An astronomical unit is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, which is approximately 149.6 million kilometers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 130 million km: This distance is too short to be the average distance from the Earth to the Sun.\n\nB. 150 million km: This distance is also too short compared to the actual average distance.\n\nC. 170 million km: This distance is closer to the correct value but still not accurate.\n\nD. 190 million km: This distance is the closest to the actual average distance from the Earth to the Sun, which is approximately 149.6 million kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 190 million km.",
