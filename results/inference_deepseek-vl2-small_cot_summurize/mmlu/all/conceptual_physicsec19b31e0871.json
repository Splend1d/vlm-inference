            "content": "A step-up transformer in an electrical circuit can step up both voltage and energy.\n\nA step-up transformer increases the voltage of an alternating current (AC) supply. This is useful in applications where a higher voltage is required to drive a load, such as in power distribution systems. By increasing the voltage, the transformer reduces the current, which in turn reduces the power loss due to resistance in the wires.\n\nHowever, a step-up transformer does not increase the energy. Energy is a product of voltage and current, and the power (P) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = V \\times I \\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) is the voltage and \\( I \\) is the current. A step-up transformer increases the voltage but decreases the current, so the power remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both of these",
