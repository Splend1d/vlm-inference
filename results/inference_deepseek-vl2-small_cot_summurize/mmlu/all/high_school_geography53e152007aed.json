Pull factors are those that attract individuals to a particular destination, such as better living conditions, job opportunities, or improved quality of life.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Abject poverty: This is a \"push\" factor, as it is a reason why someone might want to leave their current situation. Poverty in India could be a compelling reason for Riva to seek better opportunities in the United States.\n\nB. Better job and higher wages: This is a \"pull\" factor. The United States is known for its strong economy and high-paying jobs, which can be very attractive to individuals looking to improve their economic situation.\n\nC. India's caste system: This is a \"push\" factor. The caste system in India can be oppressive and limit social mobility, making it a reason for individuals to seek a better life elsewhere.\n\nD. Violence in her neighborhood: This is a \"push\" factor. Violence can be a significant concern for individuals living in unsafe areas, making it a reason to move to a safer environment.\n\nBased on this analysis, the factor that would be considered a \"pull\" factor for Riva when considering a move from India to the United States is:\n\nB. Better job and higher wages.",
