Since the determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of their determinants, and the determinant of a matrix is an integer, the product of two matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant will also have an integer determinant. Therefore, the set is closed under matrix multiplication.\n\n2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative. If \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are in the set, then \\( (AB)C = A(BC) \\).\n\n3. **Identity Element**: The identity element for matrix multiplication is the 2 x 2 identity matrix \\( I \\). The product of any matrix with the identity matrix is the matrix itself, so \\( A \\cdot I = A \\).\n\n4. **Inverse Element**: For any matrix \\( A \\) in the set, there exists an inverse \\( A^{-1} \\) such that \\( AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I \\).\n\nSince the set satisfies all the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses), it is a group under matrix multiplication. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.**\n\n1. **Closure**: For two matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) to be in the set, their product \\( AB \\) must also be in the set. The determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of their determinants. If both matrices have a determinant of 1, then the determinant of their product is also 1. Therefore, the set is closed under matrix multiplication.\n\n2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative. If \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are in the set, then \\( (AB)C = A(BC) \\).\n\n3. **Identity Element**: The identity element for matrix multiplication is the 2 x 2 identity matrix \\( I \\). The product of any matrix with the identity matrix is the matrix itself, so \\( A \\cdot I = A \\).\n\n4. **Inverse Element**: For any matrix \\( A \\) in the set, there exists an inverse \\( A^{-1} \\) such that \\( AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I \\).\n\nSince the set satisfies all the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses), it is a group under matrix multiplication. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nBoth statements are true. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
