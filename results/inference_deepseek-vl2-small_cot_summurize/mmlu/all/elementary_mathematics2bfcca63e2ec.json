Therefore, 3/4 of a complete circle is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFirst, multiply 3 by 360:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 360 = 1080\n\\]\n\nNext, divide 1080 by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1080}{4} = 270\n\\]\n\nThus, the measure of the angle that turns through 3/4 of a complete circle is 270\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 270\u00b0",
