These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) more than longer wavelengths (red and yellow). This is because the shorter wavelengths have higher energy and are more easily deflected by the molecules.\n\nAs a result, the sky appears blue to us. The blue light is scattered in all directions, and because the sky is vast and the light is scattered in all directions, the blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky. The red and yellow light, which is less scattered, is what we see when we look at the sun or the ground.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. scattering.",
