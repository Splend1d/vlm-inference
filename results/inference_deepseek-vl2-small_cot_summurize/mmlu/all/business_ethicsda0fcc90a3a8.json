It also correctly mentions that regulation has increased at both national and international levels.\n\n- **Option C: Cemptor Eaveat, Buyer beware, Regulation, National**\n  - This option incorrectly uses \"Cemptor\" instead of \"Caveat emptor.\"\n\n- **Option D: Cemptor Eaveat, Company Responsibility, Informal Codes, International**\n  - This option incorrectly uses \"Cemptor\" and \"Company Responsibility\" and incorrectly mentions \"Informal Codes.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option B: Caveat emptor, Buyer beware, Regulation, National**.",
