It is passed by Congress and signed by the President. It specifies the amount of money to be allocated to various government departments and programs.\n\n2. **Special Acts and Authorizations**: These are laws that provide funding for specific programs or activities without the need for a full appropriations bill. They are often used for one-time or emergency funding needs.\n\n3. **Federal Budget Entitlements**: These are funds that are allocated to specific programs or individuals based on existing laws, such as Social Security or Medicare. They are not subject to annual appropriations bills.\n\n4. **Department of Defense Funding**: This is typically covered by an appropriations bill, as it involves ongoing military operations and personnel.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Department of Education special acts and authorizations**: This is correct.

The Department of Defense's funding is usually covered by an appropriations bill, as it involves ongoing military operations and personnel.\n\nTherefore, the categories of spending that are paid without an appropriations bill are:\n\nA. Department of Education special acts and authorizations\nC. Federal budget entitlements",
