            "content": "To determine which option best describes a retrotransposon, let's analyze each choice:\n\nA. A DNA sequence that can move from one site in the genome to another without replicating: This describes a transposable element, not a retrotransposon. Transposable elements are DNA sequences that can change their position within the genome.\n\nB. A DNA sequence that can be deleted from the genome without consequence: This describes a gene or a DNA sequence that is not essential for the organism's survival. It does not describe a retrotransposon.\n\nC. A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate: This is the correct description of a retrotransposon. Retrotransposons are a type of transposable element that replicate by first transcribing their DNA into RNA, then using the RNA as a template to synthesize a complementary DNA copy, which is then integrated back into the genome.\n\nD. A DNA sequence that replicates via a protein intermediate: This describes a transposon, not a retrotransposon. Transposons replicate by using a protein intermediate to move from one site to another.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate.",
