            "content": "Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase (ACE) in the synapses of neurons. When DFP binds to ACE, the ACE enzyme is rendered permanently inactive. This makes DFP a potent toxin, with lethal amounts at less than 100 mg. The interaction between DFP and ACE can best be characterized as:\n\nA. Competitive inhibition\nB. Noncompetitive inhibition\nC. Irreversible inhibition\nD. Partially competitive inhibition\n",

            "content": "To determine the type of inhibition DFP exhibits when binding to ACE, we need to understand the characteristics of each type of inhibition:\n\nA. **Competitive inhibition**: In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for binding to the active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration.\n\nB. **Noncompetitive inhibition**: In noncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds to a different site on the enzyme, not the active site, and reduces the enzyme's activity regardless of substrate concentration.\n\nC. **Irreversible inhibition**: This type of inhibition involves the formation of a covalent bond between the inhibitor and the enzyme, permanently inactivating it.\n\nD. **Partially competitive inhibition**: This is a combination of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition, where the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the active site but also binds to a different site, reducing enzyme activity.\n\nGiven that DFP binds to ACE and renders it permanently inactive, it is clear that the enzyme is inactivated permanently. This is characteristic of irreversible inhibition, where the inhibitor forms a covalent bond with the enzyme, leading to permanent inactivation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Irreversible inhibition",
