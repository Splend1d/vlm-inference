It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?\n\nA. Neoplatonism\nB. Antitrinitarianism\nC. Pietism\nD. Rationalism\n",

This is similar to the Southern Renaissance movement, which was characterized by a revival of classical learning and culture, and a focus on the individual and human potential.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Neoplatonism. \n\nNeoplatonism was a philosophical and religious movement that emerged in the 3rd century AD, and it emphasized the importance of the individual and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. It also emphasized the importance of the soul and the afterlife, and it was influenced by the teachings of Plato and other classical philosophers. The Southern Renaissance movement, which was characterized by a revival of classical learning and culture, and a focus on the individual and human potential, was similar to Neoplatonism in its emphasis on the individual and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.",
