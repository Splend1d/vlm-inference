Quebec is a province within Canada, not a nation seeking to reclaim lost territories.\n\nB. **Secession**: This involves a group or region seeking independence from a larger entity, such as a country. Quebec has a history of advocating for greater autonomy within Canada, but it has not sought independence.\n\nC. **Ethnonationalism**: This is a political ideology that emphasizes the importance of a nation's ethnic identity. Quebec's identity is deeply rooted in French-Canadian culture and language, and there is a strong sense of ethnonationalism among its population.\n\nD. **A colony**: A colony is a territory that is under the political control of another country. Quebec is a province within Canada, not a colony.\n\nGiven this analysis, Quebec is best described by option C, **Ethnonationalism**, as it is characterized by a strong sense of identity and cultural heritage that is distinct from the broader Canadian identity.",
