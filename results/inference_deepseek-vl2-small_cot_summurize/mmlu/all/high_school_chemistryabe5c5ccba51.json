            "content": "To determine the best procedure for making up 100.0 mL of 4.0 M sulfuric acid from a 12.0 M stock solution, we need to consider the dilution process.\n\n1. **Understand the concept of dilution**: Dilution involves reducing the concentration of a solution by adding more solvent (water) to the solution. The formula for dilution is:\n   \\[\n   C_1V_1 = C_2V_2\n   \\]\n   where \\( C_1 \\) and \\( V_1 \\) are the initial concentration and volume of the solution, and \\( C_2 \\) and \\( V_2 \\) are the final concentration and volume.\n\n2. **Identify the initial and final concentrations**:\n   - Initial concentration (\\( C_1 \\)) = 12.0 M\n   - Final concentration (\\( C_2 \\)) = 4.0 M\n   - Volume of the final solution (\\( V_2 \\)) = 100.0 mL = 0.100 L\n\n3. **Set up the dilution equation**:\n   \\[\n   12.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times V_1 = 4.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.100 \\, \\text{L}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( V_1 \\) (the volume of the stock solution needed)**:\n   \\[\n   V_1 = \\frac{4.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.100 \\, \\text{L}}{12.0 \\, \\text{M}} = \\frac{0.400 \\, \\text{L}}{12.0 \\, \\text{M}} = 0.0333 \\, \\text{L} = 33.3 \\, \\text{mL}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the volume of water to add**:\n   - Total volume of the final solution = 100.0 mL\n   - Volume of stock solution needed = 33.3 mL\n   - Volume of water to add = 100.0 mL - 33.3 mL = 66.7 mL\n\n6. **Verify the procedure**:\n   - Add 33.3 mL of the 12.0 M sulfuric acid to the flask.\n   - Add 66.7 mL of water to the flask.\n\nThus, the correct procedure is:\n\n**B. Add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.**",
