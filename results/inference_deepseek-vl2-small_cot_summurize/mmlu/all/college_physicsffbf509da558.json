Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Specific heat**: This property measures the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius. It is not directly related to the movement of charge carriers.\n\nB. **Thermal conductivity**: This property measures the ability of a material to conduct heat. It is also not directly related to the movement of charge carriers.\n\nC. **Electrical resistivity**: This property measures how much a material opposes the flow of electric current. It is related to the movement of charge carriers, but it does not directly indicate the sign of the charge carriers.\n\nD. **Hall coefficient**: This property measures the strength of the magnetic field required to produce a certain voltage across a material when a current is passed through it. It is directly related to the movement of charge carriers, and the sign of the Hall coefficient can indicate the type of charge carriers (positive or negative).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Hall coefficient. By measuring the Hall coefficient, we can deduce the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor.",
