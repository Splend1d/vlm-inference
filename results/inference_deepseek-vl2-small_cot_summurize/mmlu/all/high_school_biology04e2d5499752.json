It is crucial in transpiration because it helps water move from the roots to the leaves through the xylem.\n\nB. **Adhesion**: This is the property of water molecules that allows them to stick to the walls of the xylem vessels. Adhesion is essential for water to move upward against gravity, which is necessary for transpiration.\n\nC. **Capillary action**: This is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of external forces. In the context of transpiration, capillary action helps water move from the soil through the roots and up the xylem to the leaves.\n\nD. **Hydrophobicity**: This is the property of water molecules that makes them repel other water molecules. While hydrophobicity is a property of water, it is not directly related to the process of transpiration. Transpiration involves the movement of water, not the repulsion of water molecules.\n\nTherefore, the property of water that is not related to transpiration is **D. hydrophobicity**.",
