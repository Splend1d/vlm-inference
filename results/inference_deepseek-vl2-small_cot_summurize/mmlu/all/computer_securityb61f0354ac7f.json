Authenticated.\n\nA Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack can endanger the security of the Diffie-Hellman method if the two parties involved are not authenticated. In a MitM attack, an attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.\n\nHere's why authentication is crucial:\n\n1. **Key Exchange**: In the Diffie-Hellman method, each party generates a shared secret key. This key is used for symmetric encryption. If the parties are not authenticated, an attacker can intercept the key exchange and use the shared secret key for their own purposes.\n\n2. **Security**: Authentication ensures that the parties are who they claim to be. Without authentication, an attacker can impersonate one or both parties, leading to the compromise of the security of the key exchange.\n\n3. **Data Integrity**: Authentication also helps ensure that the data being exchanged has not been tampered with. If the parties are not authenticated, an attacker can modify the data during transmission, leading to potential data corruption or theft.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Authenticated.",
