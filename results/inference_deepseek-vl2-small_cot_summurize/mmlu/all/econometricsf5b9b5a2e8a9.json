            "content": "To determine the value of the first order autocorrelation coefficient when the Durbin Watson statistic is close to zero, we need to understand the relationship between these two statistical measures.\n\nThe Durbin Watson statistic is used to test the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in a time series. It ranges from 0 to 4, with values close to 0 indicating no autocorrelation.\n\nThe first order autocorrelation coefficient, denoted as \\( \\rho_1 \\), measures the correlation between a time series and lagged versions of itself. It ranges from -1 to 1.\n\n- If the Durbin Watson statistic is close to zero, it suggests that there is no significant autocorrelation in the time series.\n- In this case, the first order autocorrelation coefficient \\( \\rho_1 \\) is also close to zero, indicating no correlation between the series and its lagged values.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Close to zero\n\nThis conclusion is based on the understanding that the Durbin Watson statistic and the first order autocorrelation coefficient are related but independent measures. The Durbin Watson statistic assesses the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals of a regression model, while the autocorrelation coefficient measures the correlation between the series and its lagged values.",
