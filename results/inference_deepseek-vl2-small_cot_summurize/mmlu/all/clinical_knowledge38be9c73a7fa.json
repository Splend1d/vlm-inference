GPs (General Practitioners): While GPs are crucial in the healthcare system, the guide is not specifically tailored for them. It provides general information that could be useful for GPs, but it is not primarily aimed at them.\n\nB. Patient lobby groups: These groups advocate for patients' rights and interests. While they might find the guide informative, it is not specifically designed for them. The guide is more about providing general information.\n\nC. The general public: This option is the most appropriate. The guide is intended to provide information to the general public about the National Health Service (NHS). It aims to educate people about the services, benefits, and how to access healthcare through the NHS.\n\nD. Patients admitted to hospital: Although patients in hospitals might find the guide useful, it is not specifically written for them. The guide is more about providing general information that can be beneficial to anyone who needs to understand the NHS.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the publication \"Your guide to the NHS\" is written for the general public. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The general public.",
