Carbon atoms: Both amino acids and carbohydrates contain carbon atoms. Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, while amino acids are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms. Therefore, carbon atoms are present in both.\n\nB. Oxygen atoms: Carbohydrates contain oxygen atoms, as they are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. However, amino acids also contain oxygen atoms, as they have a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the alpha carbon. Therefore, oxygen atoms are present in both.\n\nC. Nitrogen atoms: Amino acids contain nitrogen atoms, as they have an amino group (-NH2) attached to the alpha carbon. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, do not contain nitrogen atoms. Therefore, nitrogen atoms are not found in carbohydrates.\n\nD. Hydrogen atoms: Both amino acids and carbohydrates contain hydrogen atoms. Carbohydrates are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, while amino acids are made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms. Therefore, hydrogen atoms are present in both.\n\nBased on the analysis, the feature of amino acids that is not found in carbohydrates is the presence of nitrogen atoms. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Nitrogen atoms",
