They are crossing another country's borders.  \n- Migration typically involves moving from one country to another. Johnny and Susie are moving to Scotland, which is another country. This indicates they are crossing international borders, which is a key characteristic of migration.\n\nB. They are not taking anything with them.  \n- While it's true that Johnny and Susie are leaving their current home, this alone does not define a migration. Migration involves moving to a new location, not just leaving one place.\n\nC. They are moving permanently.  \n- Moving permanently is a characteristic of migration, but it is not the defining feature. Migration involves moving to a new country, not just a new location within the same country.\n\nD. They will be gone more than one year.  \n- The duration of time they will be away is not a defining characteristic of migration. Migration can occur over any period, from a few months to several years.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most accurate definition of Johnny and Susie's move as a migration is:\n\nA. They are crossing another country's borders.",
