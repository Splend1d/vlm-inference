Government, Avenue of approach, Breadth of transmission, Content\n- \"Government\" is a means of influence, but it is not a mode of approach.\n- \"Breadth of transmission\" is not a term used in communication theory.\n- \"Content\" is not a mode of approach.\n\nB. Consumers, Avenue of approach, Height of transmission, Content\n- \"Consumers\" is not a means of influence.\n- \"Avenue of approach\" is a term used in communication theory, referring to the various ways in which messages can be delivered.\n- \"Height of transmission\" is not a term used in communication theory.\n- \"Content\" is not a mode of approach.\n\nC. Government, Breath of transmission, Avenue of approach, Content\n- \"Government\" is a means of influence, but it is not a mode of approach.\n- \"Breath of transmission\" is not a term used in communication theory.\n- \"Avenue of approach\" is a term used in communication theory, referring to the various ways in which messages can be delivered.\n- \"Content\" is not a mode of approach.\n\nD. Employees, Breadth of transmission, Content, Avenue of approach\n- \"Employees\" is not a means of influence.\n- \"Breadth of transmission\" is not a term used in communication theory.\n- \"Content\" is not a mode of approach.\n- \"Avenue of approach\" is a term used in communication theory, referring to the various ways in which messages can be delivered.\n\nNone of the options correctly complete the sentence. However, if we consider the context of communication and influence, the most appropriate terms would be \"Government\" as a means of influence, \"Avenue of approach\" as a mode of delivery, and \"Content\" as the message being communicated. Therefore, the correct completion of the sentence should be:\n\n\"There are a number of means by which can influence Government. These include Avenue of approach, varying from very direct modes to indirect modes, Breadth of transmission, being either public or private and Content of communication.\"\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this completion. Therefore, the correct answer is not available from the given options.",
