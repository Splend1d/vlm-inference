(24+4)+6\n- This expression adds 24 and 4, and then adds 6.\n- It does not represent the multiplication of 8 and 6.\n\nB. (2+4)x6\n- This expression adds 2 and 4, and then multiplies the result by 6.\n- It does not represent the multiplication of 8 and 6.\n\nC. (2x4) + 6\n- This expression multiplies 2 and 4, and then adds 6.\n- It does not represent the multiplication of 8 and 6.\n\nD. (2x4)x6\n- This expression multiplies 2 and 4, and then multiplies the result by 6.\n- This correctly represents 8 x 6, as it first multiplies 2 and 4, and then multiplies the result by 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (2x4)x6.",
