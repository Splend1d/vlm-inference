A hexagon has 6 sides, while a triangle has 3 sides.\n\nB. All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides.\n- This statement is true. An octagon has 8 sides, which is more than 3, so it is a polygon.\n\nC. All parallelograms are rectangles because they have 2 sets of parallel sides.\n- This statement is false. While all rectangles are parallelograms, not all parallelograms are rectangles.\n\nD. All rhombi are squares because they have 4 sides that are all the same length.\n- This statement is false. While all squares are rhombi, not all rhombi are squares.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides.",
