            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the effects of an increase in both short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) and aggregate demand (AD) on the economy.\n\n1. **Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)**: This curve represents the total quantity of goods and services that firms are willing and able to produce at a given overall price level in the short run, holding all other factors constant. An increase in SRAS means that firms are willing to produce more at each price level.\n\n2. **Aggregate Demand (AD)**: This curve represents the total quantity of goods and services demanded across all levels of the economy at a given overall price level. An increase in AD means that consumers, businesses, and the government are collectively willing to purchase more goods and services at each price level.\n\n3. **Combined Effect**: When both SRAS and AD increase, the economy experiences a positive shift in both the price level and real GDP. This is because:\n   - The increase in AD leads to higher demand for goods and services, which can drive up prices.\n   - The increase in SRAS allows firms to produce more, which can also contribute to higher output and potentially higher prices.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Incorrect. A rise in the price level does not necessarily mean a fall in real GDP. In fact, both can rise.\n   - **Option B**: Correct. Both the price level and real GDP rise when both SRAS and AD increase.\n   - **Option C**: Incorrect. While the price level is certain to rise, the change in real GDP is not uncertain; it is certain to rise.\n   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While real GDP is certain to rise, the change in the price level is not uncertain; it is certain to rise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Both the price level and real GDP rise**.",
