            "content": "To determine the effect of the Federal Reserve selling $29 million worth of government securities on the money supply, we need to understand the mechanics of open market operations and how they influence the money supply.\n\n1. **Understanding Open Market Operations**: The Federal Reserve conducts open market operations to manage the money supply and interest rates. When the Fed sells government securities, it reduces the amount of money in the banking system. Conversely, when it buys securities, it increases the money supply.\n\n2. **Reserve Requirement**: The reserve requirement is the fraction of deposits that banks must hold in reserve and not loan out. In this scenario, the reserve requirement is 10%.\n\n3. **Calculating the Effect on Money Supply**:\n   - When the Fed sells $29 million worth of government securities, it reduces the reserves of the banks by $29 million.\n   - With a reserve requirement of 10%, the reduction in reserves translates to a reduction in the money supply by 10% of $29 million.\n\n4. **Calculating the Reduction in Money Supply**:\n   - $29 million * 10% = $2.9 million\n\nTherefore, the money supply can decrease by $2.9 million.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. decrease by $2.9 million**.",
