            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Weathering: Weathering is the process by which rocks are broken down into smaller pieces without the movement of the rock itself. It is a physical and chemical process that occurs on the surface of rocks and does not involve the colonization of bare substrates by organisms.\n\nB. Stabilizing succession: Stabilizing succession refers to the process by which pioneer species colonize a bare substrate and establish a stable community. This process is characterized by the establishment of a stable ecosystem where the pioneer species have adapted to the harsh conditions of the bare substrate.\n\nC. Secondary succession: Secondary succession occurs in areas where a disturbance has destroyed an existing community but left the soil intact. This type of succession involves the colonization of the soil by pioneer species, but it does not involve the colonization of bare substrates such as rock, sand, or glacial till.\n\nD. Primary succession: Primary succession occurs in areas where a disturbance has destroyed an existing community and left the soil and substrate bare. This type of succession involves the colonization of the bare substrate by pioneer species, which are adapted to the harsh conditions of the bare substrate.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, the process in which pioneer species colonize a bare substrate such as rock, sand, or glacial till is known as primary succession. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. primary succession",
