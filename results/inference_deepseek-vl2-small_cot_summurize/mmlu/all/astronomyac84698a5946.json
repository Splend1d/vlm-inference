The acceleration of the universe.\n\nDark energy is a mysterious form of energy that is thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. It is called \"dark\" because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. The existence of dark energy was first proposed in the late 1990s as a way to explain why the expansion of the universe is accelerating, rather than slowing down as would be expected due to the gravitational attraction of matter.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. The radiation of black holes is a well-established phenomenon, and it is not related to dark energy.\n\nB. The mass distribution of galaxies is a complex issue that is still being studied, and it is not directly related to dark energy.\n\nD. The microwave background of the universe is the radiation that was emitted when the universe was still very hot and dense, and it is not related to dark energy.",
