We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the unknown number:\n\n35 / ? = 7\n\nMultiplying both sides by ?:\n\n35 = 7 * ?\n\nNow, we can solve for ? by dividing both sides by 7:\n\n35 / 7 = ?\n\n5 = ?\n\nTherefore, the number that makes the equation 35 / ? = 7 true is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 5",
