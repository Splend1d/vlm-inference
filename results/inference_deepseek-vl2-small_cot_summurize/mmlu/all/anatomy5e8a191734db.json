            "content": "To determine the correct statement about the atrioventricular bundle, we need to understand the structure and function of the heart's electrical conduction system.\n\nThe heart's electrical conduction system is responsible for coordinating the contraction of the atria and ventricles. This system includes the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers.\n\n- **Option A** states that the atrioventricular bundle is formed of autonomic nerve processes and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. This is incorrect because the atrioventricular bundle is not formed of autonomic nerve processes. Instead, it is composed of Purkinje fibers, which are specialized cardiac muscle cells that conduct electrical impulses rapidly.\n\n- **Option B** claims that the atrioventricular bundle is formed of Purkinje fibers and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. This is incorrect because the atrioventricular bundle is not the only electrical connection between the atria and ventricles. There are other pathways, such as the bundle of His and the bundle branches, that also conduct electrical impulses between these chambers.\n\n- **Option C** states that the atrioventricular bundle is formed of autonomic nerve processes and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles. This is incorrect because the atrioventricular bundle is not formed of autonomic nerve processes.\n\n- **Option D** states that the atrioventricular bundle is formed of Purkinje fibers and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles. This is correct. The atrioventricular bundle is indeed formed of Purkinje fibers, and it is one of the pathways that conduct electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. It is formed of Purkinje fibres and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.**",
