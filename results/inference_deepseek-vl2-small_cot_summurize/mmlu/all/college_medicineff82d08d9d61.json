They are characterized by their ability to sustain activity over long periods. Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. White, glycolytic, slow contracting.\n- Type I fibres are not white; they are red. Glycolytic fibres are fast-contracting and do not match the characteristics of Type I fibres.\n\nB. White, oxidative, slow contracting.\n- Type I fibres are not white; they are red. While they are oxidative, the colour description is incorrect.\n\nC. Red, oxidative, fast contracting.\n- Type I fibres are red, but they are not fast contracting. They are slow contracting, which contradicts this option.\n\nD. Red, oxidative, slow contracting.\n- This option accurately describes Type I fibres. They are red due to the presence of myoglobin, which allows them to store oxygen. They are oxidative, meaning they rely on oxygen for energy production, and they are slow contracting, which is why they are suited for endurance activities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Red, oxidative, slow contracting.",
