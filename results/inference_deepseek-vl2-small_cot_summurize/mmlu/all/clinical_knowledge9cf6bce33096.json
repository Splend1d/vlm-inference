            "content": "To determine which statement is true about an abdominal mass, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm.\n- A pulsatile mass is typically associated with a vascular structure, such as an aortic aneurysm, because it can be felt as a pulsating mass due to the flow of blood through the aneurysm. However, it is not exclusive to aortic aneurysms. Other vascular structures, like the portal vein, can also cause pulsatile masses. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nB. An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion.\n- An enlarged kidney, or hydronephrosis, is typically tender to percussion due to the increased pressure within the kidney. This is because the increased volume of fluid in the kidney causes it to become more rigid and sensitive to percussion. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst.\n- This statement describes a condition known as a \"dull, floating mass\" or \"dull, floating mass of the pelvis,\" which is often associated with an ovarian cyst. The mass may disappear when the urethral catheter is inserted, as the pressure from the catheter can compress the mass, making it less palpable. This statement is true.\n\nD. An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon.\n- An indentible mass is typically caused by a fluid-filled structure, such as a cyst or abscess, rather than faecal loading. Faecal loading would usually cause a mass that is more rigid and less indentible. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst.",
