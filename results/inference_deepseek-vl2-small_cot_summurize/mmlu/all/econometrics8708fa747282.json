This allows for more precise estimates and tests, increasing the power of statistical tests.\n\n(ii) The use of panel data allows the average value of the dependent variable to vary either cross-sectionally or over time or both.\n- Panel data can capture both cross-sectional and time-series variation, allowing for the analysis of how the dependent variable changes over time for different units. This flexibility is a significant advantage of panel data.\n\n(iii) The use of panel data enables the researcher allows the estimated relationship between the independent and dependent variables to vary either cross-sectionally or over time or both.\n- Panel data allows for the estimation of fixed effects, random effects, or other models that can account for both cross-sectional and time-series variation, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between variables.\n\nGiven this analysis, all three statements (i), (ii), and (iii) are true advantages of using panel data. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. (i), (ii), and (iii)",
