The remaining light is then scattered in all directions by the water molecules and particles. This scattering of light is what gives the ocean its blue color. The greenish tint is due to the presence of phytoplankton and other microscopic organisms that absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others, contributing to the overall color of the water.",
