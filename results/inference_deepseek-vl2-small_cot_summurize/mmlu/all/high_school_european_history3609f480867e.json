At any time the French capital affords rare advantages to the anthropologist. The Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the \u00e9coles de Medicine, and the hospitals give to the comparative anatomist and biologist abundant employment.\"\nOtis T.

The account mentions the work of Bertillon, who conducted anthropometric operations in the Palais de Justice.\n\nThe work of Bertillon was influenced by the scientific pioneer Charles Darwin, who is known for his theory of evolution through natural selection. Darwin's work on the natural history of man and the study of human evolution would have been a significant influence on the scientists at the Paris Exposition.\n\nTherefore, the scientists described in the account of the Paris Exposition would have been most influenced by the work of Charles Darwin.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
