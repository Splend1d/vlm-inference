Therefore, \\(B\\) cannot be connected.\n- **Conclusion**: Statement I is false.\n\n### Statement II: If \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are compact, then \\(B\\) is compact.\n\n- **Compactness Definition**: A topological space \\(X\\) is compact if every open cover of \\(X\\) has a finite subcover.\n- **Given**: \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are compact.\n- **Implication**: Since \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are compact, every open cover of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) has a finite subcover.\n- **Conclusion**: If \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are compact, then \\(B\\) must also be compact because \\(B\\) is a subset of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), and any open cover of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) will have a finite subcover for \\(B\\) as well.\n- **Conclusion**: Statement II is true.\n\n### Statement III: If \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are Hausdorff, then \\(B\\) is Hausdorff.\n\n- **Hausdorffness Definition**: A topological space \\(X\\) is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), there exist disjoint open sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) such that \\(x \\in U\\) and \\(y \\in V\\).\n- **Given**: \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are Hausdorff.\n- **Implication**: Since \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are Hausdorff, for any two distinct points \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), there exist disjoint open sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) such that \\(x \\in U\\) and \\(y \\in V\\).\n- **Conclusion**: If \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are Hausdorff, then \\(B\\) must also be Hausdorff because \\(B\\) is a subset of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), and any open cover of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) will have disjoint open sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) for \\(B\\) as well.\n- **Conclusion**: Statement III is true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, statements II and III are true, while statement I is false.
