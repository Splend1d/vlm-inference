He proposed that the Earth's surface had been shaped by sudden, violent events, such as floods, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes, which could explain the presence of fossils in sedimentary rocks. This idea was a precursor to the concept of uniformitarianism, which suggests that the Earth's features were shaped by gradual, ongoing processes over long periods of time.",
