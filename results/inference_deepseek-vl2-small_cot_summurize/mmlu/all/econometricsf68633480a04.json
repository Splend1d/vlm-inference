            "content": "A. Using a linear specification when y scales as a function of the squares of x\n\nThis is an example of mis-specification of functional form because the relationship between y and x is not linear. The correct functional form should account for the squared relationship, which would be a quadratic or higher-order polynomial.\n\nB. Using a linear specification when a double-logarithmic model would be more appropriate\n\nThis is also an example of mis-specification of functional form. A double-logarithmic model would be more appropriate if the relationship between the variables is logarithmic in nature.\n\nC. Modelling y as a function of x when in fact it scales as a function of 1/x\n\nThis is another example of mis-specification of functional form. The relationship between y and x should be modeled as a function of 1/x, not x itself.\n\nD. Excluding a relevant variable from a linear regression model\n\nThis is not an example of mis-specification of functional form. Excluding a relevant variable from a linear regression model is a common practice to avoid multicollinearity and improve the model's interpretability. However, it is important to note that excluding a relevant variable can lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions.",
