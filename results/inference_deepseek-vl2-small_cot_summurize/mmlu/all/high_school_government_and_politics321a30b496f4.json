Money provided to individuals to fund research projects: This option describes a grant, not a block grant. Research grants are typically given to individuals or organizations for specific projects, not to state or local governments.\n\nB. Funds with few restrictions that are provided to state or local governments for general purpose use: This option accurately describes a block grant. Block grants are federal funds that are given to state or local governments with minimal restrictions, allowing them to use the funds for a wide range of purposes.\n\nC. Funds distributed among states according to a set formula: This option describes categorical grants, not block grants. Categorical grants are distributed based on specific criteria or formulas, such as education or transportation, rather than being given with few restrictions.\n\nD. Money that can only be used for a specific purpose: This option describes a restricted grant, not a block grant. Restricted grants have specific guidelines on how the funds can be used, whereas block grants have fewer restrictions.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the best description of a block grant is:\n\nB. Funds with few restrictions that are provided to state or local governments for general purpose use.",
