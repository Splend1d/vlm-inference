Solid substances do not have a concentration that can be completely used up in a reaction. Therefore, neither S(s) nor O2(g) will be completely used up. This statement is incorrect.\n\nB. **Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation**\n\n- The reaction involves one mole of gas on each side, which means the concentrations of the reactants and products are equal. The reaction quotient \\( Q \\) is calculated as:\n\n  \\[ Q = \\frac{[SO_2]}{[S][O_2]} \\]\n\n  Since the concentrations of \\( S \\) and \\( O_2 \\) are equal, \\( Q \\) will be equal to 1.0. This statement is correct.\n\nC. **this reaction goes to completion**\n\n- The reaction is reversible, meaning it can proceed in both forward and reverse directions. The equilibrium constant \\( K \\) indicates the ratio of product to reactant concentrations at equilibrium. If \\( K > 1 \\), the reaction favors the formation of products, but it does not necessarily go to completion. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. **adding O2 will change the equilibrium constant**\n\n- The equilibrium constant \\( K \\) is a function of temperature only and does not depend on the concentration of reactants or products. Adding more O2 will not change the equilibrium constant. This statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation.",
