            "content": "To determine the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule, we need to understand the structure and composition of DNA.\n\n1. **Structure of DNA**: DNA is composed of two strands that are complementary to each other. Each strand consists of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA.\n\n2. **Nucleotide Composition**: Each nucleotide in DNA consists of three components:\n   - A nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine).\n   - A sugar (deoxyribose).\n   - A phosphate group.\n\n3. **Base Pairing**: The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases:\n   - Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T).\n   - Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G).\n\n4. **Purines and Pyrimidines**:\n   - **Purines**: Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) are purines.\n   - **Pyrimidines**: Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) are pyrimidines.\n\n5. **Ratio Determination**:\n   - Since adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is determined by the base sequence in RNA.\n   - In RNA, adenine is replaced by uracil, and guanine is replaced by cytosine.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is determined by the base sequence in RNA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. determined by the base sequence in RNA.",
