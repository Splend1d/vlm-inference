            "content": "To determine which subshell's electrons have the highest velocity after being ejected, we need to consider the energy levels and the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1. **Energy Levels and Subshells**: Electrons in an atom occupy different energy levels or subshells, which are defined by the principal quantum number \\( n \\). The subshells are labeled as \\( 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, \\ldots \\).\n\n2. **Energy Conservation**: When a photon is absorbed by an atom, it provides energy that can be used to overcome the binding energy of an electron in a particular subshell. The energy of the photon is related to its frequency by the equation \\( E = h\\nu \\), where \\( E \\) is the energy, \\( h \\) is Planck's constant, and \\( \\nu \\) is the frequency.\n\n3. **Binding Energy and Subshell**: The binding energy of an electron in a subshell is given by \\( E_b = -\\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{n^2} \\), where \\( n \\) is the principal quantum number. This energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the subshell.\n\n4. **Ejection of Electrons**: When a photon is absorbed, the energy is used to overcome the binding energy of the electron. The energy of the photon must be greater than the binding energy of the subshell to eject the electron.\n\n5. **Velocity of Ejected Electrons**: The kinetic energy of the ejected electron is given by \\( K = E - E_b \\). Since the binding energy is negative, the kinetic energy is positive. The kinetic energy is also related to the velocity of the electron by \\( K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the electron and \\( v \\) is its velocity.\n\n6. **Comparison of Subshells**: The subshell with the highest binding energy will have the highest kinetic energy and thus the highest velocity of the ejected electron. The binding energy increases with the principal quantum number \\( n \\). Therefore, the 3d subshell, which has the highest \\( n \\), will have the highest binding energy and thus the highest velocity of ejected electrons.\n\nThus, the electrons originally from the 3d subshell would have the highest velocity after being ejected.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 3d",
