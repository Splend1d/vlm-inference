            "content": "To determine where planned communities are most likely to be found, we need to understand the characteristics and functions of each urban setting:\n\nA. **Ghettos**: These are densely populated, often low-income neighborhoods with a high concentration of residents from a particular ethnic or racial group. They are typically characterized by a lack of resources and infrastructure, and are not known for planned communities.\n\nB. **Suburbs**: These are residential areas located outside of a city center. Suburbs often have planned communities, which are designed with specific features such as housing, schools, parks, and shopping centers. They are typically more affluent and have better infrastructure compared to inner-city areas.\n\nC. **CBDs (Central Business Districts)**: These are the central parts of a city where most of the commercial and business activities take place. While CBDs may have planned communities, they are not typically residential areas.\n\nD. **Transition zones**: These are areas that are undergoing significant change, often due to urban renewal or gentrification. They may have planned communities, but they are not inherently planned communities like those found in suburbs.\n\nGiven these explanations, the most likely setting to find planned communities is in suburban areas. Suburbs are designed with a focus on residential living, often featuring planned communities that include amenities and infrastructure tailored to the needs of residents.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Suburbs.",
