Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ E[X(t)] = 0 \\]\nfor all \\( t \\).\n\n(ii) **Constant variance**: This means that the variance of the process is constant over time. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Var}(X(t)) = \\text{Var}(X(0)) \\]\nfor all \\( t \\).\n\n(iii) **Autocovariances that are constant**: This means that the covariance between the process at different times is constant. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Cov}(X(t), X(0)) = \\text{Cov}(X(t), X(s)) \\]\nfor all \\( t \\) and \\( s \\).\n\n(iv) **Autocovariances that are zero except at lag zero**: This means that the covariance between the process at different times is zero except when the time difference is zero. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Cov}(X(t), X(s)) = 0 \\]\nfor all \\( t \\neq s \\), and:\n\\[ \\text{Cov}(X(t), X(0)) = 0 \\]\nfor all \\( t \\neq 0 \\).\n\nGiven these properties, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
