            "content": "The correct answer is C.\n\nWithout a strong magnetic field, the solar wind can strip away most of the atmosphere, significantly reducing the greenhouse effect and cooling Mars down. This is because the solar wind is a stream of charged particles that can interact with the planet's atmosphere, stripping away the gases that help to retain heat. This process is known as atmospheric escape.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ozone layer is not a significant factor in the greenhouse effect on Mars. The greenhouse effect on Mars is primarily due to the presence of carbon dioxide and water vapor in the atmosphere, not ozone.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the greenhouse effect is enhanced by the presence of greenhouse gases, not weakened. The greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, keeping the planet warm.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the planet receives fewer charged particles from the solar wind, not fewer charged particles from the solar wind and therefore is not heated as much. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles that can interact with the planet's atmosphere, stripping away the gases that help to retain heat.",
