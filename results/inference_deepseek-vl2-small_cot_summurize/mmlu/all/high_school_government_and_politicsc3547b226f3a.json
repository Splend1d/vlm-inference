            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A pardon lasts 10 years, while a reprieve lasts one year.\n- This option is incorrect because the duration of a pardon or reprieve is not specified in this manner. Both can last for varying periods, depending on the jurisdiction and the circumstances.\n\nB. A reprieve grants a release from legal punishment, while a pardon postpones it.\n- This option is incorrect because a reprieve does not grant a release from legal punishment; it only delays it. A pardon, on the other hand, grants a release from legal punishment.\n\nC. A pardon grants a release from legal punishment while a reprieve postpones it.\n- This option is correct. A pardon is a formal declaration by a government that an individual's criminal record is erased, effectively granting a release from legal punishment. A reprieve, however, is a delay in the execution of a sentence, not a release from punishment.\n\nD. Only state governors can issue pardons.\n- This option is incorrect because the authority to issue pardons is not limited to state governors. In the United States, the President of the United States, the Governor of a state, and other officials can issue pardons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: A pardon grants a release from legal punishment while a reprieve postpones it.",
