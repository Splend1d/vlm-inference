            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each part of the question:\n\n1. **Gig Economy**: This refers to a labor market characterized by short-term, flexible jobs. Individuals are hired for specific tasks or projects rather than on a long-term basis.\n\n2. **Flexibility**: This is a key benefit of the gig economy. It allows workers to choose when and how much they work, providing them with more control over their schedules.\n\n3. **Risk**: The gig economy often involves higher risks for workers. They may face uncertainty about their income, benefits, and job security.\n\n4. **Autonomy**: Workers in the gig economy often have more autonomy, as they can choose their own projects and work at their own pace.\n\nNow, let's match these concepts with the options provided:\n\n- **Option A**: \"Gig, Flexibility, Risk, Social welfare structures\"\n  - This option correctly identifies the gig economy, flexibility, and risk. However, it incorrectly associates social welfare structures with the gig economy.\n\n- **Option B**: \"Sharing, Risk, Flexibility, Autonomy\"\n  - This option correctly identifies sharing, risk, flexibility, and autonomy. However, it incorrectly associates sharing with the gig economy.\n\n- **Option C**: \"Gig, Risk, Flexibility, Autonomy\"\n  - This option correctly identifies the gig economy, risk, flexibility, and autonomy.\n\n- **Option D**: \"Sharing, Flexibility, Risk, Social welfare structures\"\n  - This option incorrectly associates sharing with the gig economy and social welfare structures with the gig economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Gig, Risk, Flexibility, Autonomy**.",
