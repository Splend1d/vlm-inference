It is not involved in hormone production.\n\nC. **Prostate**: The prostate gland is a part of the male reproductive system that produces fluid that is part of semen. It does not produce male hormones.\n\nD. **Testes**: The testes are the primary organs responsible for producing male hormones, specifically testosterone. Testosterone is crucial for the development of male secondary sexual characteristics and the regulation of various bodily functions.\n\nBy analyzing the roles of each option, we can conclude that the testes are the correct answer. They are the organs that produce male hormones, specifically testosterone, which is essential for the development of male characteristics and overall health.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
