Highways to airports that link cities: This option describes a transportation system that connects cities with airports, typically forming a network of routes radiating from a central hub. This is not the pattern we are looking for, as it does not describe a star shape.\n\nB. Interstate highways that link cities: Interstate highways are major roads that connect cities across states, forming a network of routes that are not typically star-shaped. They are more linear and do not create a star pattern.\n\nC. Beltways around cities: Beltways are circular highways that encircle a city. While they can influence urban development, they do not create a star-shaped pattern.\n\nD. Streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD: This option describes a transportation system where streetcar and trolley lines radiate from the central business district (CBD) of a city. This pattern is characterized by a central hub with lines extending outward, forming a star shape.\n\nBy analyzing each option, we can conclude that the correct answer is D. Streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD. This system creates a star-shaped city pattern, as the lines radiate outward from the central area, forming a star-like structure.",
