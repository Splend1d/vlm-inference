            "content": "To determine the type of immunity the patient is receiving, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: The patient has been bitten by a dog that was foaming at the mouth and acting aggressively. This behavior is indicative of rabies, a viral infection that affects the central nervous system.\n\n2. **Purpose of the Serum**: The serum administered to the patient contains rabies antibodies that were grown inside a horse. These antibodies are produced by the horse's immune system in response to the rabies virus.\n\n3. **Immunity Types**:\n   - **Passive Immunity**: This type of immunity is acquired by exposure to antibodies or antigens from another source. It is typically short-lived and does not involve the body's own immune response.\n   - **Active Immunity**: This involves the body's own immune system being stimulated to produce antibodies or T-cells against a specific antigen. This is the body's natural defense mechanism.\n   - **Natural Immunity**: This is the body's inherent ability to resist infection without any prior exposure to the pathogen.\n   - **Artificial Immunity**: This is induced by the introduction of antibodies or antigens from an external source, such as the horse-grown antibodies in this case.\n\n4. **Applying the Information**: The patient is receiving antibodies that were grown in a horse, which are not the patient's own antibodies. This indicates that the patient is not producing the antibodies themselves but is instead relying on the horse's immune system to produce them.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the patient is receiving antibodies from an external source (the horse), this is an example of artificial immunity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
