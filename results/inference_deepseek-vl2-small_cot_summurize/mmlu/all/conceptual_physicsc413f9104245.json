            "content": "To determine the amount of air drag on the flying squirrel, we need to consider the forces acting on it and the conditions at terminal velocity.\n\n1. **Understanding Terminal Velocity**: Terminal velocity is the constant speed that an object falls through a fluid (such as air) when the force of gravity is balanced by the force of air resistance. At this point, the net force on the object is zero.\n\n2. **Forces at Terminal Velocity**:\n   - **Gravitational Force (Weight)**: This is the force due to gravity acting on the squirrel, which is 0.8 N.\n   - **Air Resistance (Drag Force)**: This is the force opposing the motion of the squirrel through the air.\n\n3. **Balancing Forces**: At terminal velocity, the gravitational force is equal to the air resistance force. Therefore, the air resistance must also be 0.8 N to balance the 0.8 N gravitational force.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the air resistance must be equal to the gravitational force to achieve terminal velocity, the air drag on the squirrel is 0.8 N.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.8 N",
