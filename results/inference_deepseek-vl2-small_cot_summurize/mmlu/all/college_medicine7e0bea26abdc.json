Time of interaction between the sound source and the detector\nIII. Distance between the source and the detector\nIV. Frequency of the emitted sound\n\nThe doppler shift is a change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the wave source. It is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta f = \\frac{v \\cdot f_0}{c} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta f \\) is the change in frequency,\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of the wave in the medium,\n- \\( f_0 \\) is the frequency of the emitted sound,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of sound in the medium.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the doppler shift depends on the speed of sound in the medium (I) and the frequency of the emitted sound (IV). The time of interaction (II) and the distance between the source and the detector (III) are not directly involved in the calculation of the doppler shift.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and IV",
