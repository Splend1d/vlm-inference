            "content": "To determine the false statement, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The densities increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide.\n- Density is mass divided by volume. Since all containers are the same size and temperature, the volume is the same for each. Therefore, the density is directly proportional to the mass. The mass of helium is 4.0 g, nitrogen is 28.0 g, and carbon dioxide is 44.0 g. Thus, the density increases in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide. This statement is true.\n\nB. The number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\n- The number of molecules is determined by the number of moles, which is mass divided by molar mass. The molar mass of helium is approximately 4.0 g/mol, nitrogen is approximately 28.0 g/mol, and carbon dioxide is approximately 44.0 g/mol. The number of moles in each container is:\n  - Helium: 4.0 g / 4.0 g/mol = 1.0 mol\n  - Nitrogen: 28.0 g / 28.0 g/mol = 1.0 mol\n  - Carbon dioxide: 44.0 g / 44.0 g/mol = 1.0 mol\n- Since the number of moles is the same for all containers, the number of molecules is also the same. This statement is true.\n\nC. The pressure in all three containers is the same.\n- Pressure is mass divided by volume and is directly proportional to the number of molecules. Since the number of molecules is the same in all containers, the pressure is the same. This statement is true.\n\nD. The average speed of all the molecules is the same.\n- The average speed of molecules is related to temperature. Since all containers are at the same temperature, the average speed of the molecules is the same. This statement is true.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, none of them are false. Therefore, the question's premise is incorrect, and there is no false statement.",
