They can be used in pulse modulators, frequency modulators, and phase-locked loops (PLLs).\n\n- **Pulse Modulators**: VCOs can generate a wide range of frequencies, which can be used to modulate the pulse width of a signal.\n- **Frequency Modulators**: VCOs can be used to modulate the frequency of a carrier wave, which is a fundamental principle in frequency modulation (FM) systems.\n- **Phase Clocked Loops**: VCOs are essential in phase-locked loops, where they generate a reference frequency that is compared to the input signal to produce a phase-locked output.\n\nGiven this versatility, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
