            "content": "To determine the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l, for the electron in the ground-state aluminum atom, we need to understand the electron configuration and the energy levels involved.\n\n1. **Electron Configuration**: Aluminum has an atomic number of 13, which means it has 13 electrons. The electron configuration for aluminum in its ground state is:\n   \\[\n   [Ne] 3s^2 3p^1\n   \\]\n   This configuration indicates that the first three electrons are in the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals, and the fourth electron is in the 3p orbital.\n\n2. **Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l)**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number, l, describes the shape of the orbital. It can take values from 0 to n-1, where n is the principal quantum number. For the 3p orbital, l = 1.\n\n3. **Ionization Process**: When aluminum is ionized, the outermost electron in the 3p orbital is removed. This electron is the one with the highest energy level, which is the 3p orbital.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the electron in the 3p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number of 1, the electron that is most easily removed during ionization is the one in the 3p orbital.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2",
