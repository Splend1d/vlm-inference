One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nVoltaire is best known for supporting which of the following demands of the Enlightenment philosophes?\n\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\nB. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\nC. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\nD. Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.\n",

            "content": "Voltaire's quote from 1755 is a response to the Lisbon earthquake, which caused widespread destruction and loss of life. In the quote, Voltaire expresses his belief that the earthquake is a cruel act of nature, and he uses the analogy of ants being crushed in an ant-hill to describe the suffering of the people in Lisbon. He also criticizes the Inquisition and suggests that the destruction of the palace of the Inquisition is a form of divine justice.\n\nVoltaire was a prominent figure in the Enlightenment, a period of intellectual and cultural movement that emphasized reason, science, and individualism. The Enlightenment philosophes, including Voltaire, were critical of organized religion and sought to promote religious toleration and freedom of thought.\n\nOption A, \"Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion,\" is not the correct answer because Voltaire was not advocating for a specific religion to be adopted as the only logical one.\n\nOption B, \"Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity,\" is not the correct answer because Voltaire was a strong advocate for religious toleration and believed that it was essential for social unity.\n\nOption C, \"Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information,\" is not the correct answer because Voltaire was a skeptic and believed that skepticism was a valuable tool for examining information.\n\nOption D, \"Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions,\" is the correct answer. Voltaire was a strong advocate for religious toleration and believed that all people should be free to practice their religion without persecution. He believed that religious toleration was essential for social unity and that it was a moral imperative to promote it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
