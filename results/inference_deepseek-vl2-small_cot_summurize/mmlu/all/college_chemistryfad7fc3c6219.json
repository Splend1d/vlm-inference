            "content": "To determine which ion has the smallest radius, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Ion Size and Charge Relationship**: Generally, as the charge of an ion increases, its radius decreases. This is because a higher positive charge means the ion is more tightly held by the nucleus, pulling the electron cloud closer.\n\n2. **Periodic Table Trends**: As we move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius increases due to the addition of electron shells. However, when we move across a period from left to right, the atomic radius decreases because the nuclear charge increases, pulling the electron cloud closer.\n\n3. **Specific Ions**:\n   - **K+ (Potassium ion)**: Potassium is in Group 1, and the K+ ion is the same as the neutral potassium atom, so it has a relatively large radius.\n   - **Ca2+ (Calcium ion)**: Calcium is in Group 2, and the Ca2+ ion is the same as the neutral calcium atom, so it also has a relatively large radius.\n   - **Sc3+ (Scandium ion)**: Scandium is in Group 3, and the Sc3+ ion is the same as the neutral scandium atom, so it has a relatively large radius.\n   - **Rb+ (Rubidium ion)**: Rubidium is in Group 1, and the Rb+ ion is the same as the neutral rubidium atom, so it has a relatively large radius.\n\n4. **Comparison**: Among the given ions, the Rb+ ion has the highest positive charge (+1), which means it is the most tightly held by the nucleus, resulting in the smallest radius.\n\nTherefore, the ion with the smallest radius is **D. Rb+**.",
