It is thought to be a captured asteroid.\n\nDeimos is the smaller moon, with a diameter of about 12 kilometers, and orbits Mars in 30 hours and 18 minutes. It is believed to be a captured comet.\n\nBoth moons are irregularly shaped and have a very thin atmosphere. They are also tidally locked to Mars, meaning that they always show the same face to the planet.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Phobos and Deimos.",
