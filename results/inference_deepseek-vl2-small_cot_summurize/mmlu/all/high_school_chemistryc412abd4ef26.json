A conjugate acid along with its conjugate base. This pair will react with added base to neutralize it.\n\nC. A buffer capacity sufficient to react with added acid or base. This ensures that the buffer can effectively neutralize added acids or bases.\n\nD. Triple-distilled water. While water is necessary for the buffer solution, it is not a component of the buffer itself. The buffer is made up of the acid, its conjugate base, and the water in which they are dissolved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Triple-distilled water.",
