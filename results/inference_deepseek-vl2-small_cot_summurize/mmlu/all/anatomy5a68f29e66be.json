            "content": "To determine which gland is the master gland of the endocrine system, we need to understand the roles and functions of each gland listed:\n\nA. **Adrenal**: The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and are responsible for producing hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. They play a crucial role in the body's response to stress and in regulating metabolism. However, they are not considered the master gland.\n\nB. **Pancreas**: The pancreas produces insulin and glucagon, which are vital for regulating blood sugar levels. It also produces other hormones like somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide. While the pancreas is essential for metabolic regulation, it is not the master gland.\n\nC. **Pineal**: The pineal gland produces melatonin, which is involved in regulating sleep-wake cycles. It is not a primary endocrine gland in terms of hormone production.\n\nD. **Pituitary**: The pituitary gland, also known as the hypophysis, is often referred to as the \"master gland\" because it controls the function of other endocrine glands. It produces several hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, and reproductive functions. The pituitary gland releases hormones that stimulate or inhibit the release of hormones from other glands, making it the central regulatory hub of the endocrine system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Pituitary.",
