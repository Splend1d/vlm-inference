            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the given graph collection and the conditions provided.\n\n1. **Graph Collection Properties**:\n   - The collection consists of undirected graphs.\n   - Each graph has 10 nodes.\n   - Each graph has 6 edges.\n   - There are no self-loops.\n   - There is at most one edge between any pair of nodes.\n\n2. **Connected Components**:\n   - A connected component is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.\n   - The maximum number of connected components (M) occurs when the graph is as fragmented as possible, meaning each component is as small as possible.\n   - The minimum number of connected components (m) occurs when the graph is as connected as possible, meaning there is only one large component.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Conditions**:\n   - Since there are 10 nodes and 6 edges, the average degree of a node is \\( \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6 \\).\n   - The condition that there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes implies that the graph is not fully connected.\n\n4. **Maximum Number of Connected Components (M)**:\n   - To maximize the number of connected components, we want to minimize the size of each component.\n   - The smallest possible size for a component is 1 (a single node).\n   - With 10 nodes, the maximum number of components is 10.\n\n5. **Minimum Number of Connected Components (m)**:\n   - To minimize the number of components, we want to have as many nodes as possible in a single component.\n   - With 10 nodes and 6 edges, the minimum number of components is 1 (all nodes in one component).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the conditions and the properties of the graph collection, the maximum number of connected components (M) is 10, and the minimum number of connected components (m) is 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. M = 10, m = 10",
