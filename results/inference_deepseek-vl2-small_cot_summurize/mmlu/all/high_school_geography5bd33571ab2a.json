It is primarily spoken in the Basque Country, which spans parts of northern Spain and southwestern France.\n\n2. **Geographical Distribution**: The Basque Country is divided into two main regions:\n   - **Spain**: The northern part of the Basque Country is located in the autonomous community of the Basque Country in northern Spain.\n   - **France**: The southern part is in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques department in southwestern France.\n\n3. **Language Use**: In Spain, the Basque language is predominantly spoken in the northern region, particularly in the provinces of Gipuzkoa, Biscay, and \u00c1lava. In France, it is mainly spoken in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques department.\n\n4. **Population**: The majority of Basque speakers reside in Spain, particularly in the northern regions. According to various sources, including the Basque Government, the majority of Basque speakers are found in Spain.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical and linguistic distribution, the country with the highest concentration of Basque speakers is Spain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
