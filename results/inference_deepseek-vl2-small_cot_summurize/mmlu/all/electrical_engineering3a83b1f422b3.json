This means that the output state changes from 0 to 1 and back to 0 with each clock cycle.\n\nTo achieve this toggle behavior, the J and K inputs must be set to 1 and 0, respectively, or vice versa. This is because when both J and K are 1, the flip-flop will toggle its output state with each clock cycle. When J is 1 and K is 0, the flip-flop will toggle its output state in the opposite direction (from 0 to 1 and back to 0).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. J = 1, K = 1.",
