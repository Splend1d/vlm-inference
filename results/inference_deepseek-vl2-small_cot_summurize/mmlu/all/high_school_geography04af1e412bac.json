            "content": "To determine which geographer viewed the US urban community of the 1920s as a set of concentric rings radiating outward from a central core, we need to analyze the theories of each option:\n\nA. **Rostow**: E.H. Rostow was an American economist and historian known for his work on economic development and growth. He is not primarily known for urban geography or the concentric ring model.\n\nB. **Ravenstein**: Friedrich Ludwig von Ravenstein was a German geographer who is best known for his work on the concentric zone model of urban geography. This model describes urban areas as expanding in rings around a central core, with each ring representing a different socio-economic class. Ravenstein's model was influential in understanding urban growth patterns.\n\nC. **Von Th\u00fcnen**: Carl von Th\u00fcnen was a German-American economist who developed the theory of agricultural land use, known as the \"Isolated State\" model. This model is not related to urban geography or the concentric ring model.\n\nD. **Burgess**: Ernest Burgess was an American geographer who developed the concentric zone model of urban geography. His model describes urban areas as expanding in rings around a central core, with each ring representing a different socio-economic class. This model is widely recognized and has been influential in urban studies.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Burgess\n\nBurgess's concentric zone model is the one that describes the US urban community of the 1920s as a set of concentric rings radiating outward from a central core.",
