The least common multiple of 9 and 12 is 36. So, we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 36:\n\nDistance walked in the morning = (7/9) * (4/4) = 28/36 mi\nDistance walked in the afternoon = (5/12) * (3/3) = 15/36 mi\n\nNow, we can subtract the distance walked in the afternoon from the distance walked in the morning:\n\nDistance walked in the morning - Distance walked in the afternoon = (28/36) - (15/36)\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need to have the same denominator. Since 36 is the least common multiple, we can subtract the numerators directly:\n\n28 - 15 = 13\n\nSo, the distance walked in the morning is 13/36 mi more than the distance walked in the afternoon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 13 over 36.",
