A compact set can have functions that are not bounded. For example, consider the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\). This function is continuous and bounded on the interval, but the set \\([1, \\infty)\\) is not compact.\n\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A set can have functions that are bounded but not compact. For example, consider the set \\( K = \\{0\\} \\times [0, 1] \\). This set is not compact, but every continuous real-valued function defined on \\( K \\) is bounded.\n\nIII.
