            "content": "To determine the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy in Economy X, which is an open economy with flexible exchange rates, we need to consider how such a policy affects net exports.\n\n1. **Understanding Expansionary Monetary Policy**: This policy involves increasing the money supply to lower interest rates, which encourages borrowing and spending. In an open economy, this can lead to an increase in net exports because lower interest rates make domestic goods cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially increasing exports.\n\n2. **Impact on Net Exports**: In an open economy, net exports are calculated as exports minus imports. If the domestic currency depreciates due to increased money supply, exports become cheaper for foreign buyers, which can increase the quantity of exports sold abroad. Conversely, imports become more expensive for domestic consumers, potentially reducing the quantity of imports.\n\n3. **Effectiveness in an Open Economy**: In an open economy with flexible exchange rates, the depreciation of the domestic currency due to expansionary monetary policy can lead to an increase in net exports. This is because the lower exchange rate makes domestic goods cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting export volumes.\n\n4. **Comparison with a Closed Economy**: In a closed economy (Economy Y), expansionary monetary policy does not affect net exports because there is no exchange rate to adjust. The policy primarily affects domestic interest rates and money supply, but not the balance of trade.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. more effective in X because the policy will increase net exports.",
