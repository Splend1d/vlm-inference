            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the anatomy and function of the muscles involved in the movement of the mandible.\n\n1. **Anterior Fragment Displacement**: The anterior fragment of the mandible is primarily influenced by the action of the digastric muscle. The digastric muscle is a paired muscle that originates from the body of the mandible and the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. It inserts into the body of the mandible and the ramus of the mandible. When the digastric muscle contracts, it elevates the mandible, which can lead to anterior displacement of the mandible.\n\n2. **Posterior Fragment Displacement**: The posterior fragment of the mandible is influenced by the lateral pterygoid muscle. This muscle originates from the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone and inserts into the body of the mandible. When the lateral pterygoid muscle contracts, it depresses the mandible, which can lead to posterior displacement of the mandible.\n\n3. **Temporalis Muscle**: The temporalis muscle is a masseter-like muscle that originates from the temporal fossa of the skull and inserts into the coronoid process of the mandible. It is primarily responsible for elevating the mandible, which can lead to anterior displacement. However, it does not typically cause posterior displacement.\n\n4. **Medial Pterygoid Muscle**: This muscle is responsible for elevating the mandible and is located on the medial side. It does not typically cause posterior displacement.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. anterior fragment to be displaced downwards by the action of the digastric muscle.\n\nThis option correctly describes the action of the digastric muscle on the anterior fragment of the mandible, leading to its downward displacement.",
