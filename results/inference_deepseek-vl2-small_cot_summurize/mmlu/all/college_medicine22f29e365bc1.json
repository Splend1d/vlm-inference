While many mutations can be harmful, some are neutral or even beneficial. For example, certain mutations can lead to beneficial traits, such as increased resistance to diseases or improved nutritional content in plants.\n\nB. **only occur in the presence of carcinogens.**\n   - This is also incorrect. Mutations can occur spontaneously without the presence of carcinogens. Spontaneous mutations are a natural part of the DNA replication process and can occur due to errors during DNA replication or exposure to environmental factors.\n\nC. **increase tumour growth.**\n   - This is partially correct but not entirely accurate. While some mutations can lead to tumour growth, not all mutations cause cancer. Some mutations are benign and do not lead to tumour development.\n\nD. **occur spontaneously at a low rate.**\n   - This is the correct answer. Mutations are errors in the DNA sequence that can occur spontaneously during DNA replication. They occur at a relatively low rate, which is why they are considered rare events.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate.",
