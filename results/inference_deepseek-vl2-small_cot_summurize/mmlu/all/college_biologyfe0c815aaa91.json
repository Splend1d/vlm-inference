            "content": "To determine which characteristic the rodents are most likely to exhibit, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Moderate sexual size dimorphism: This refers to a difference in size between males and females of a species. While size dimorphism can be a characteristic of some rodents, it does not directly relate to litter size.\n\nB. High parental investment: This characteristic involves the amount of time and energy parents invest in their offspring. High parental investment often results in larger litter sizes, as parents provide more resources and care for more offspring. This is consistent with the unusual small litter sizes observed in the rodents.\n\nC. Precocial young: This term describes young animals that are relatively mature and mobile at birth. While precocial young can be found in some rodents, it does not directly explain the litter size.\n\nD. Frequent extrapair matings: This refers to mating outside of the primary pair bond. While this can occur in some species, it does not directly relate to litter size.\n\nGiven the unusual small litter sizes observed in the rodents, the most likely characteristic is high parental investment. This is because high parental investment often results in larger litter sizes, as parents invest more time and resources in caring for more offspring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. High parental investment.",
