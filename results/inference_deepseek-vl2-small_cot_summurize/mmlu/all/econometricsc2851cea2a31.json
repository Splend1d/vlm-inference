It is the outcome or response variable that we are trying to understand or forecast.\n\n(ii) The regressor: This term is often used interchangeably with the dependent variable in regression analysis. The regressor is the variable that is being used to predict or explain the dependent variable.\n\n(iii) The explained variable: This term is also used to describe the dependent variable in regression analysis. It refers to the variable that is being explained or predicted by the independent variables.\n\n(iv) The explanatory variable: This term is another way to describe the dependent variable in regression analysis. It refers to the variable that is used to explain or predict the dependent variable.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can see that all four terms (i, ii, iii, and iv) are alternative names for the dependent variable in linear regression analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)",
