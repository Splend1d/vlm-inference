This is a property of commutative groups.\n\nIn a commutative group, the group operation is commutative, meaning that for all elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the group, \\(ab = ba\\). This property is crucial for the given condition to hold.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Commutative semi group**: A semi-group is a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. While the given condition is true for a semi-group, it is not sufficient to classify the group as a semi-group alone.\n\nB. **Abelian group**: An abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative. The given condition \\((ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\\) is a direct consequence of commutativity. Therefore, the group \\(G\\) must be an abelian group.\n\nC. **Non-abelian group**: A non-abelian group is a group in which the group operation is not commutative. The given condition implies commutativity, so this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **None of these**: Since the given condition implies that the group is abelian, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. **abelian group**",
