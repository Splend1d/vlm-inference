Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties intelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path. Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.\nIsabella Beeton, Book of Household Management, 1861\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the subject of Beeton's book was\n\nA. the role of women in army regiments\nB. the running of a school for domestic servants\nC. the running of a school for girls\nD. the role of a woman in running her own domestic household\n",

It says that just like a Commander of the Army or a leader of any enterprise, a woman's spirit is seen through the whole establishment. It also says that the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family depend on how well she performs her duties. So, the subject of Beeton's book is about the role of a woman in running her own domestic household.\n\nSo, the answer is D. the role of a woman in running her own domestic household.",
