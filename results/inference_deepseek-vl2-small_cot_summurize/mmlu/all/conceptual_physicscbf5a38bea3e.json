            "content": "To determine the lowest possible temperature, we need to understand the concept of absolute zero. Absolute zero is the theoretical temperature at which the entropy of a perfect crystal is zero. It is the point where the kinetic energy of the particles in a substance is zero, and they are at rest.\n\nThe Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale, where absolute zero is defined as 0 K. This means that 0 K is the lowest possible temperature.\n\nThe Celsius scale, on the other hand, is an empirical temperature scale that is based on the freezing and boiling points of water. The freezing point of water is 0\u00b0C, and the boiling point is 100\u00b0C. Therefore, -273\u00b0C is the lowest possible temperature on the Celsius scale.\n\nSince absolute zero is defined as 0 K, and -273\u00b0C is the lowest possible temperature on the Celsius scale, the lowest possible temperature is absolute zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both are the same\n\nThis means that absolute zero is the same as -273\u00b0C, and both represent the lowest possible temperature.",
