            "content": "To determine which germ layer develops the lining of the digestive tract and the respiratory tract, we need to understand the embryonic development process.\n\n1. **Embryonic Germ Layers**: During early embryonic development, the embryo forms from three primary germ layers:\n   - **Ectoderm**: This is the outermost layer, which gives rise to the nervous system, skin, and hair.\n   - **Mesoderm**: This middle layer forms structures such as muscles, bones, and the circulatory system.\n   - **Endoderm**: This innermost layer develops into the lining of the digestive and respiratory tracts, as well as the liver and pancreas.\n\n2. **Development of the Digestive and Respiratory Tracts**: The lining of the digestive and respiratory tracts is derived from the endoderm. This is because the endoderm forms the inner lining of the digestive and respiratory systems, providing a protective barrier and facilitating absorption and secretion.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A (I only)**: This is incorrect because the endoderm is involved in forming the digestive and respiratory tract linings, not just the endoderm.\n   - **Option B (II only)**: This is incorrect because the mesoderm is not involved in forming the digestive and respiratory tract linings.\n   - **Option C (III only)**: This is incorrect because the ectoderm is not involved in forming the digestive and respiratory tract linings.\n   - **Option D (I and II)**: This is incorrect because neither the ectoderm nor the mesoderm is involved in forming the digestive and respiratory tract linings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D (I and II)**, as the endoderm is responsible for forming the lining of the digestive and respiratory tracts.",
