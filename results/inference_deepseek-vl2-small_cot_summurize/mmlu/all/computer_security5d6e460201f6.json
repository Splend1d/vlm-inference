It uses a different mechanism to achieve communication between services and the client web browser. The design is based on a socket-based communication model, where services can establish a TCP connection with the client web browser using a socket. This allows for secure and reliable communication between the services and the client.\n\nThe OKWS design does not require the services to run as non-root users. The services can run with any user, including root, as long as they have the necessary permissions to access the resources they need. The design is focused on providing a secure and reliable communication model between services and the client web browser, rather than on the user permissions of the services.",
