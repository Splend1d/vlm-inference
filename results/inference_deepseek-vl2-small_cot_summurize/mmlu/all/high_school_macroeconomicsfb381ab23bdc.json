This is not a measure of national income.\n\nB. **Income earned by the factors of production**: This includes income earned by land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. It is a component of national income but not the entire measure.\n\nC. **GDP minus depreciation and indirect business taxes**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period. GDP minus depreciation (the reduction in value of capital goods) and indirect business taxes (taxes on production and consumption) gives a more accurate measure of national income. This is a common measure of national income.\n\nD. **(B) (C) and (D)**: This option combines the components of national income (B) and the GDP measure (C). It is not a complete measure of national income.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. GDP minus depreciation and indirect business taxes.",
