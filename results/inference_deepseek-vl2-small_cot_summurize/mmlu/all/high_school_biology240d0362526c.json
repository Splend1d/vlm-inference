            "content": "To determine the initial condition when a piece of potato is dropped into pure water, we need to understand the concept of water potential. Water potential (\\( \\phi \\)) is a measure of the potential energy of water in a system. It is defined as the pressure of water at a given point, which is the product of the height of the water column above that point and the density of water.\n\n1. **Water Potential of Pure Water**: Pure water has a water potential of 0 because it is at the standard reference level. This is because the pressure of water at the surface of the Earth is zero, and the density of water is 1 g/cm\u00b3.\n\n2. **Water Potential of the Potato**: When a potato is dropped into pure water, it is submerged. The water potential of the potato is determined by the height of the water column above the potato. Since the potato is submerged, the water potential of the potato is positive. This is because the pressure of the water above the potato is greater than the pressure of the water below it.\n\n3. **Initial Condition**: The initial condition when the potato enters the water is that the water potential of the potato is positive. This is because the potato is submerged, and the water above it has a higher pressure than the water below it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The water potential of the potato is positive.",
