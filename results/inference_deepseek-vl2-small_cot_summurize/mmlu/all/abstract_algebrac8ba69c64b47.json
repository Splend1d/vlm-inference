If \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) < 1 \\), it means \\( V \\) is a finite-dimensional vector space with dimension less than 1, and \\( W \\) is a vector space with dimension less than 1.\n\n- **Injective Transformation:** A linear transformation \\( T \\) is injective if and only if for any \\( u, v \\in V \\), \\( T(u) = T(v) \\) implies \\( u = v \\).\n\n- **Implication:** If \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) < 1 \\), it implies that \\( V \\) is a finite-dimensional vector space with dimension less than 1, and \\( W \\) is a vector space with dimension less than 1. In such cases, the only linear transformations that are injective are those that map \\( V \\) to \\( W \\) and map \\( W \\) to \\( 0 \\) (the zero vector space). This is because the only linear transformation that maps a vector space of dimension less than 1 to a vector space of dimension less than 1 and maps that vector space to the zero vector space is the zero transformation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, if \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) < 1 \\), \\( T \\) must be injective.\n\n**Statement 2:** Let \\( \\dim(V) = n \\) and suppose that \\( T: V \\to V \\) is linear. If \\( T \\) is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\n- **Injective Linear Transformation:** A linear transformation \\( T \\) is injective if and only if for any \\( u, v \\in V \\), \\( T(u) = T(v) \\) implies \\( u = v \\).\n\n- **Bijection:** A linear transformation \\( T \\) is a bijection if and only if it is both injective and surjective.\n\n- **Conclusion:** If \\( T \\) is injective, it is not necessarily surjective. For example, consider the linear transformation \\( T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) defined by \\( T(x, y) = (x, 0) \\). This transformation is injective but not surjective because it maps all points in the \\( y \\)-direction to the \\( x \\)-axis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, if \\( T \\) is injective, it is not necessarily a bijection.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",
