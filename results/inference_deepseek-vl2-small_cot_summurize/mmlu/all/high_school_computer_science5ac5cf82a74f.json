            "content": "To determine which statement is true about program documentation, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Program documentation should not be changed after it is first written.\n- This statement is incorrect. Program documentation is dynamic and should be updated as the program evolves. Changes in the program's functionality, design, or structure often require corresponding updates to the documentation to ensure it remains accurate and useful.\n\nB. Program documentation is only needed for programs in development; it is not needed after a program is completed.\n- This statement is also incorrect. While documentation is crucial during the development phase to guide programmers and ensure they understand the codebase, it remains important even after a program is completed. Documentation helps maintain the program, supports future maintenance, and assists new team members in understanding the system.\n\nC. Program documentation is useful when programmers collaborate but not when a programmer works individually on a project.\n- This statement is incorrect. Documentation is beneficial for all stages of a project, whether a programmer is working alone or in a team. It provides a reference for understanding the code, which is essential for both individual and collaborative work.\n\nD. Program documentation is useful during initial program development and also when modifications are made to existing programs.\n- This statement is correct. Documentation serves as a critical resource throughout the lifecycle of a program. During development, it helps new team members understand the code and design. Even after the program is completed, documentation remains valuable for maintenance, troubleshooting, and future enhancements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Program documentation is useful during initial program development and also when modifications are made to existing programs.",
