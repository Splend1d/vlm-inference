The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more heat energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy.\n",

The sample did not lose more heat energy than the water gained. The heat lost by the sample is equal to the heat gained by the water.\n   - **Option B:** Incorrect. The final temperature is not less than the average starting temperatures. The final temperature is 37 \u00b0C, which is higher than the average of 26 \u00b0C and 95 \u00b0C.\n   - **Option C:** Incorrect. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but this does not necessarily mean the heat capacity of the sample is greater than the heat capacity of the water.\n   - **Option D:** Correct. The sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained, which is consistent with the law of conservation of energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**.",
