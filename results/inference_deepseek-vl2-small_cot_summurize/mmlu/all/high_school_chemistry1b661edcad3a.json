An electrolyte is a substance that dissociates into ions in a solution, allowing it to conduct electricity. Strong electrolytes completely dissociate into ions, while weak electrolytes only partially dissociate.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. CH3COOH (Acetic acid): This is a weak acid. When dissolved in water, it partially dissociates into CH3COO\u207b (acetate ion) and H\u207a (hydrogen ion). Therefore, it is not a strong electrolyte.\n\nB. HC2H3O2 (Acetic acid): This is the same as option A, acetic acid, which is a weak acid and does not fully dissociate in water.\n\nC. PCl5 (Phosphorus pentachloride): This is a molecular compound and does not dissociate into ions in water. It is not an electrolyte.\n\nD. HBr (Hydrogen bromide): This is a strong acid. When dissolved in water, it completely dissociates into H\u207a (hydrogen ion) and Br\u207b (bromide ion). This complete dissociation makes it a strong electrolyte.\n\nTherefore, the molecule that is a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water is:\n\nD. HBr",
