            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen defective chip came from Company Y.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability that a randomly chosen chip is defective. There are 9 chips in total, and 2 of them are defective. So, the probability of choosing a defective chip is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{defective}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of defective chips}}{\\text{Total number of chips}} = \\frac{2}{9} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the chosen chip is defective and came from Company Y. There are 2 defective chips from Company Y out of a total of 4 chips from Company Y. So, the probability that the chosen chip is defective and came from Company Y is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{defective and from Y}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of defective chips from Y}}{\\text{Total number of chips from Y}} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the probability of choosing a defective chip by the probability that the chosen chip is defective and came from Company Y to get the final probability:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{defective and from Y}) = P(\\text{defective}) \\times P(\\text{defective and from Y}) = \\frac{2}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{9} \\]\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen chip is defective is still \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\). The probability that the chosen chip is defective and came from Company Y is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe probability that the chosen chip is defective and came from Company Y is the product of the probability that the chip is defective and the probability that it came from Company Y. Since the chip is chosen uniformly at random, the probability that it came from Company Y is \\(\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the probability that the chosen chip is defective and came from Company Y is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{defective and from Y}) = P(\\text{defective}) \\times P(\\text{defective and from Y}) = \\frac{2}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{9} \\]\n\nHowever, this is still not one of the options provided.
