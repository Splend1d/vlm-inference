In a p-type material, the majority carriers are holes, which are created when an electron is removed from its valence band, leaving behind a positive charge.\n\nD. **valance carriers**: This option is incorrect because valance carriers are not specific to p-type material. Valence carriers are the electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. **majority carriers**.",
