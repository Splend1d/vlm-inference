This is a common tool used in meteorology to visualize pressure systems, such as high and low-pressure areas.\n\nB. **Surface temperature**: While surface temperature can be represented on a map, it is not typically shown using isobar lines. Surface temperature maps usually use color gradients or contour lines to indicate temperature variations.\n\nC. **Elevation**: Elevation maps use contour lines to represent the height of the terrain. These lines connect points of equal elevation, not pressure.\n\nD. **Precipitation**: Precipitation maps often use color gradients or isohyet lines to indicate areas of equal precipitation. However, isobar maps specifically refer to lines of equal atmospheric pressure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. atmospheric pressure\n\nIsobar maps are specifically designed to show lines of equal atmospheric pressure, making this the correct choice.",
