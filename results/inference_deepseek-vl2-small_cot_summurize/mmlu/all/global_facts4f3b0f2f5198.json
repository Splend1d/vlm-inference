While growth rates vary, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced growth over the past years. For example, countries like Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Ghana have seen notable economic growth.\n\nB. **The Democratic Republic of Congo has become poorer than it initially was in 1980.**\n   - This statement is also incorrect. The Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced economic growth in recent years, particularly in sectors like mining and agriculture. It has not become poorer than in 1980.\n\nC. **Some countries have had relatively significant growth rates.**\n   - This statement is correct. Many Sub-Saharan African countries have experienced significant economic growth, driven by factors such as increased foreign investment, improved infrastructure, and agricultural productivity.\n\nD. **Some countries have had relatively significant growth rates, but the Democratic Republic of Congo has become poorer than it initially was in 1980.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. As mentioned earlier, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced growth and has not become poorer than in 1980.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Some countries have had relatively significant growth rates.",
