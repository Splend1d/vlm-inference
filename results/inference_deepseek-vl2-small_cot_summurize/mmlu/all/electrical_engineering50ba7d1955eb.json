They are not typically used for storing intermediate results or data that needs to be processed by the ALU.\n\nB. **Decoders**: Decoders are responsible for interpreting the instructions received by the CPU. They do not store data; instead, they help in executing the instructions by directing the data flow.\n\nC. **Accumulators**: Accumulators are used to hold intermediate results during the execution of instructions. The ALU uses accumulators to store the results of arithmetic and logical operations. The control section also uses accumulators to hold flags and other control information needed for instruction execution.\n\nD. **Registers**: Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU. While they are crucial for data processing, they are not used by the ALU and control section in the same way as accumulators.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is C. **Accumulators**. Accumulators are specifically designed to hold data temporarily during the execution of instructions, making them essential for both the ALU and the control section of the CPU.",
