The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{COP} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{out}}}{W} \\]\n\nwhere \\( Q_{\\text{out}} \\) is the heat delivered to the indoor environment and \\( W \\) is the work input.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( Q_{\\text{out}} = 27,000 \\, \\text{J} \\) (since the indoor temperature is 27\u00b0C, which is equivalent to 300 K)\n- \\( Q_{\\text{out}} = 15,000 \\, \\text{J} \\) (since the outdoor temperature is 7\u00b0C, which is equivalent to 280 K)\n\nWe need to find the smallest amount of work \\( W \\) that must be supplied to the heat pump for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors.\n\nFirst, let's find the COP:\n\n\\[ \\text{COP} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{out}}}{W} = \\frac{15,000 \\, \\text{J}}{W} \\]\n\nWe know that \\( Q_{\\text{out}} = 15,000 \\, \\text{J} \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\text{COP} = \\frac{15,000 \\, \\text{J}}{W} \\]\n\nTo find the smallest amount of work \\( W \\), we need to find the smallest value of \\( W \\) that satisfies the given conditions.
