The computation C lasts for at least n steps.\n\nThis problem is decidable. A Turing machine is a decider if it can determine whether a given input belongs to a certain class. In this case, the class is the set of all possible computations of M that last at least n steps. Since M is a single-tape, deterministic Turing machine, it can determine whether a computation lasts at least n steps by simply counting the number of steps it takes to reach a halting state. If the number of steps is at least n, the computation lasts at least n steps.\n\nII. The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.\n\nThis problem is also decidable. The first part of the problem is the same as in I, so we can determine whether the computation lasts at least n steps. The second part of the problem is also decidable because M can print a 1 at some point after the nth step by simply printing a 1 at the nth step.\n\nIII. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.\n\nThis problem is decidable. A Turing machine is a decider if it can determine whether a given input belongs to a certain class. In this case, the class is the set of all possible computations of M that scan at least n distinct tape squares. Since M is a single-tape, deterministic Turing machine, it can determine whether a computation scans at least n distinct tape squares by simply counting the number of distinct tape squares it scans. If the number of distinct tape squares is at least n, the computation scans at least n distinct tape squares.\n\nTherefore, all three problems are decidable. The correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{A}$",
