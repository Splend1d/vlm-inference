These phosphors are excited by the electron beam from the cathode ray tube (CRT) to produce the various colors seen on the screen.\n\nWhen the color yellow is seen on your TV screen, it is produced by a combination of red and green phosphors. This is because the human eye is more sensitive to green light than to red light, so a higher intensity of green light is needed to produce the same brightness as red light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. red and green.",
