            "content": "When a proton is plucked from an atomic nucleus, the atom experiences a decrease in all of the following:\n\nA. Charge: The removal of a proton from the nucleus results in a net loss of one positive charge, which decreases the overall positive charge of the atom.\n\nB. Energy: The energy of the atom decreases because the nucleus is now less stable without the proton. The energy required to remove the proton is typically provided by the kinetic energy of the plucking mechanism.\n\nC. Mass: The mass of the atom decreases because the mass of a proton is approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu). The mass defect, which is the difference between the mass of the nucleus with the proton and the mass of the nucleus without the proton, is released as energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle (E=mc\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. all of these.",
