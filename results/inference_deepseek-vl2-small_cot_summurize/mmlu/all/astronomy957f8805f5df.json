The ability to breathe oxygen: Oxygen is a critical component of life. Most organisms, including humans, require oxygen to produce energy through cellular respiration. Without oxygen, cells cannot efficiently produce energy, leading to cellular death.\n\nB. The ability to make energy from sunlight or to eat things that do: Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and some bacteria to convert sunlight into chemical energy. This energy is stored in the form of glucose, which can be used by the organism for various functions. Additionally, many organisms, including animals, consume other organisms to obtain energy.\n\nC. A source of organic molecules: Organic molecules are the building blocks of life. They are necessary for the synthesis of complex molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, which are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of cells.\n\nD. A and B: This option combines the essential requirements for life as we know it. Both the ability to breathe oxygen and the ability to make energy from sunlight or to eat things that do are fundamental to the survival and functioning of most living organisms.\n\nBased on the analysis, options A, B, and C are essential requirements for life. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as it is not an essential requirement for life as we know it.",
