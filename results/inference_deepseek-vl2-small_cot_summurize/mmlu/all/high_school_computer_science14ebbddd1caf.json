When a user logs in using a stolen login and password, the system is verifying the user's identity, which is a part of authentication. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nB. **Confidentiality**: This pillar ensures that data is accessible only to those authorized to have access. While a stolen login and password could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, the immediate compromise is in the verification process, not the confidentiality of data.\n\nC. **Integrity**: This pillar ensures that data is accurate and has not been altered. A stolen login and password do not directly affect the integrity of data; the issue is with the user's identity verification.\n\nD. **Nonrepudiation**: This pillar ensures that a user cannot deny the authenticity of their actions. While a stolen login and password could be used to deny actions, the immediate issue is with the verification process, not the user's ability to deny actions.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
