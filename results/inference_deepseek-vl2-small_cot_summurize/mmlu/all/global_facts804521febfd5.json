This is supported by studies that show a positive correlation between economic development and well-being. For example, the Gallup Global Emotions Report has found that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher levels of life satisfaction.\n\nStatement (2): \"Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact.\"\n\n- This statement aligns with findings from psychological research. While significant life events like marriage and divorce can have immediate effects on happiness, studies suggest that these impacts tend to diminish over time. For instance, the Harvard Study of Adult Development found that while life events can influence happiness, their long-term effects are relatively small compared to other factors like personality and social connections.\n\nGiven this analysis, both statements are supported by evidence. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
