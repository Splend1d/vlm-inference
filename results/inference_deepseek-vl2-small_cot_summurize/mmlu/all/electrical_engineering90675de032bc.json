It is measured in units such as degrees Celsius, degrees Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, and it can be represented on a continuous scale. This means that temperature can be measured with a high degree of precision and can take on any value within its range, making it an analog quantity. Analog quantities are those that can take on any value within a continuous range, unlike digital quantities, which are discrete and can only take on specific, distinct values.",
