            "content": "To understand the role of surfactant in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), we need to consider the structure and function of the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs.\n\nSurfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces surface tension within the alveoli. This is crucial because the alveoli are prone to collapsing due to surface tension, especially in premature infants who have underdeveloped lungs.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Increases surface permeability: This is incorrect. Surfactant actually decreases surface tension, not increases it. By reducing surface tension, surfactant prevents the alveoli from collapsing, which would otherwise impede gas exchange.\n\nB. Maintains alveoli in an open state: This is correct. Surfactant reduces surface tension, keeping the alveoli open and preventing them from collapsing. This is essential for efficient gas exchange, as it ensures that the alveoli remain open and functional, allowing oxygen to diffuse into the blood and carbon dioxide to diffuse out.\n\nC. Depresses cilia of the lung: This is incorrect. Surfactant does not affect the cilia. Instead, it primarily affects the alveoli's surface tension.\n\nD. Dilates blood vessels: This is incorrect. Surfactant does not affect blood vessels. Its primary function is to maintain the structural integrity of the alveoli.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is B. Surfactant maintains alveoli in an open state, which is vital for effective oxygen diffusion in neonates.",
