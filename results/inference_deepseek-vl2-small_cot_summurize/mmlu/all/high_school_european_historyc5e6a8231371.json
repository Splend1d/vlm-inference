The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was the fateful essence of 1848.\nA. J. P. Taylor, The Course of German History, 1945\nWhy might it be important to note that Taylor was writing his analysis in 1945?\n\nA.

A historian writing at the end of World War II might be inclined to look for, and find, the origins of perceived German belligerence. This is because Taylor was writing his analysis in 1945, which was at the end of World War II. During this time, there was a lot of focus on the origins of the war and the role of Germany in it. Taylor's analysis might have been influenced by this focus, and he might have looked for the origins of perceived German belligerence in the events of 1848.",
