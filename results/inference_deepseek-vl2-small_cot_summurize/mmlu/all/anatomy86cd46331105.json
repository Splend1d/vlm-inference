In the context of the foot, abduction is the movement of the foot away from the body's center line.\n\n2. **Direction of Abduction**: When the foot is abducted, it moves away from the body's midline. This means that the foot is moved outward, away from the center of the body.\n\n3. **Visualization**: Imagine the body as a vertical line down the center. If you move the foot to the side, away from this line, you are abducting the foot.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **A. Inward**: This would mean moving towards the center of the body, which is the opposite of abduction.\n   - **B. Outward**: This is the correct direction for abduction, as it involves moving away from the body's midline.\n   - **C. Upward**: This would involve moving the foot away from the ground, which is not the definition of abduction.\n   - **D. Downward**: This would involve moving the foot towards the ground, which is not the definition of abduction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Outward**.",
