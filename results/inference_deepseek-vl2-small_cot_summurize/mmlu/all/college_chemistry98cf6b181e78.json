HCl (Hydrogen Chloride) is a molecular compound with hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds are relatively strong intermolecular forces, which generally result in higher melting points.\n\nB. AgCl (Silver Chloride) is a ionic compound. Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic forces between ions, which also result in higher melting points.\n\nC. CaCl2 (Calcium Chloride) is an ionic compound. Like AgCl, it has strong electrostatic forces between ions, leading to a higher melting point.\n\nD. CCl4 (Carbon Tetrachloride) is a molecular compound with London dispersion forces. London dispersion forces are the weakest type of intermolecular forces, resulting in the lowest melting points among the options.\n\nTherefore, the compound with the lowest melting point is D. CCl4.",
