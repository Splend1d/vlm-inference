            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the relationship between household income and the demand for DVD players.\n\n1. **Understanding Normal Goods**: A normal good is one for which demand increases as consumer income increases. This is because consumers have more purchasing power and are likely to buy more of the good.\n\n2. **Demand Curve Analysis**: The demand curve for DVD players slopes downward, indicating that as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.\n\n3. **Income Effect on Demand**: When household income increases, consumers are likely to purchase more DVD players because they can afford to buy more. This is due to the income effect, where an increase in income leads to an increase in the quantity demanded at every price level.\n\n4. **Market Equilibrium**: In a competitive market, the equilibrium is determined where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. An increase in demand (due to higher income) will shift the demand curve to the right.\n\n5. **Impact on Price and Quantity**:\n   - **Price**: With a rightward shift in the demand curve, the new equilibrium will have a higher price because the quantity demanded at the new equilibrium is greater.\n   - **Quantity**: The increase in demand also leads to an increase in the equilibrium quantity, as more DVD players are sold at the new higher price.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.",
