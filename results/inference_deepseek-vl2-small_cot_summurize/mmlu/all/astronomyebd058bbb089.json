Pieces of comets rather than of asteroids.\n- Comets are primarily composed of ice and dust, with a small amount of rocky material. They are not typically known for having high metal content. Therefore, this option is unlikely.\n\nB. Chunks of large differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions.\n- Differentiated asteroids have a core of heavier materials, such as iron and nickel, surrounded by a mantle of lighter materials. When these asteroids collide, they can shatter, and the resulting fragments can have high metal content. This option is plausible.\n\nC. Chunks of rock chipped off the planet Mars.\n- Mars is known for its rocky surface, but it does not have a significant amount of metal content. This option is unlikely.\n\nD. Leftover chunks of rock from the earliest period in the formation of the solar system.\n- The earliest period in the solar system's formation is not well-documented, and meteorites from this period are rare. Additionally, the composition of these meteorites is not well-understood. This option is unlikely.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible answer is:\n\nB. Chunks of large differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions.",
