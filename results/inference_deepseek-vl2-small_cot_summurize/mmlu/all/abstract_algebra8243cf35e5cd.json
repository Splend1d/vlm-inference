Specifically, if \\( G \\) is a group of order \\( p^2 \\), then \\( G \\) can be written as \\( G = \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p \\). The direct product of two cyclic groups of prime order is always Abelian. Therefore, every group of order \\( p^2 \\) is Abelian.\n\nThus, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n**Statement 2: For a fixed prime \\( p \\) a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of a group \\( G \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) if and only if it is the only Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( G \\).**\n\nTo determine the truth of this statement, we need to understand the properties of Sylow subgroups. A Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of a group \\( G \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) that is of order \\( p^k \\) for some integer \\( k \\) and is not the entire group \\( G \\). The number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups of \\( G \\) is denoted by \\( n_p \\), and it satisfies:\n\\[ n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\]\nand\n\\[ n_p \\mid \\frac{|G|}{p} \\]\n\nA Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup is normal in \\( G \\) if and only if it is the unique Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( G \\). This is a consequence of the Sylow Theorems. If a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup is normal, then it must be the only one, and if it is the only one, then it must be normal.\n\nThus, **Statement 2 is true**.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
