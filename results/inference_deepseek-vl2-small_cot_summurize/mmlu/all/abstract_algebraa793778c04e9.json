Therefore, the unity of \\( R \\) must be the same as the unity of \\( S \\).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every field is an integral domain.**\n\n- A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\n- An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse and there are no zero divisors.\n\nA field is a special type of integral domain where every non-zero element is invertible. Therefore, every field is indeed an integral domain.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
