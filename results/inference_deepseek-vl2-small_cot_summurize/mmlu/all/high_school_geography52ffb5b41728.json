They have thriving, clean residential areas.\n- Many African cities face challenges with urban planning and infrastructure, leading to overcrowded and often unsanitary living conditions. While some cities have improved, the majority do not have thriving, clean residential areas.\n\nB. There are jobs for most rural-to-urban migrants.\n- Many African cities experience rapid urbanization, leading to a significant influx of rural-to-urban migrants. However, the availability of jobs is often limited, and unemployment rates can be high, making this statement less characteristic of most African cities.\n\nC. They have three separate business districts.\n- The concept of having three separate business districts is not typical in most African cities. Urban planning in many African cities tends to be more integrated, with business activities often concentrated in a single central area.\n\nD. They have a well-developed infrastructure.\n- While some African cities have made significant strides in infrastructure development, many still struggle with inadequate water supply, sanitation, and transportation systems. Therefore, this statement is not characteristic of most African cities.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, none of the statements accurately describe most African cities. However, if we must choose the closest characteristic, option B might be considered somewhat true, as there are jobs available for many rural-to-urban migrants, albeit not in sufficient numbers to meet demand.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. There are jobs for most rural-to-urban migrants.",
