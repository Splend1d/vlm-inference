            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the balanced chemical equation and the given information about the reactants.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction of ethane (C2H4) with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) is:\n\nC2H4 + O2 \u2192 CO2 + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of ethane reacts with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 1 mole of carbon dioxide and 1 mole of water.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of ethane (C2H4). The atomic weights of carbon and hydrogen are 12 amu and 1 amu, respectively. Therefore, the molar mass of ethane is:\n\n(2 \u00d7 12 amu) + (4 \u00d7 1 amu) = 24 amu + 4 amu = 28 amu\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2). The atomic weight of carbon is 12 amu, and the atomic weight of oxygen is 16 amu. Therefore, the molar mass of carbon dioxide is:\n\n(1 \u00d7 12 amu) + (2 \u00d7 16 amu) = 12 amu + 32 amu = 44 amu\n\nNow, we can use the molar mass of ethane to find the number of moles of ethane in 84 grams. The molar mass of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance. Therefore, the number of moles of ethane is:\n\n84 g / 28 amu = 3 moles\n\nSince the balanced equation tells us that 1 mole of ethane reacts with 1 mole of oxygen to produce 1 mole of carbon dioxide, we can use the number of moles of ethane to find the number of moles of carbon dioxide. Therefore, the number of moles of carbon dioxide is also 3 moles.\n\nFinally, we can use the molar mass of carbon dioxide to find the mass of carbon dioxide produced. The mass of a substance is the number of moles of that substance multiplied by the molar mass of that substance. Therefore, the mass of carbon dioxide is:\n\n3 moles \u00d7 44 amu = 132 amu\n\nTherefore, the mass of carbon dioxide produced is 132 grams. However, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems that there may be an error in the answer choices provided.",
