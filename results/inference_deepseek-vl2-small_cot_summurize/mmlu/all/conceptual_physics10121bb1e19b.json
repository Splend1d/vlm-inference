            "content": "To understand the behavior of a spinning system contracting in the absence of an external torque, we need to consider the principles of angular momentum and conservation of angular momentum.\n\n1. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: Angular momentum (\\(L\\)) is a vector quantity defined as the product of the moment of inertia (\\(I\\)) and the angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)):\n   \\[\n   L = I \\cdot \\omega\n   \\]\n   In the absence of external torques, the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.\n\n2. **Effect of Contraction**: When a spinning system contracts, its moment of inertia (\\(I\\)) decreases because the radius of rotation decreases.\n\n3. **Impact on Angular Velocity**: According to the conservation of angular momentum, if the moment of inertia decreases, the angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)) must increase to maintain the constant angular momentum.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the angular momentum is conserved, and the moment of inertia decreases while the angular velocity increases, the angular momentum itself must increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. increases",
