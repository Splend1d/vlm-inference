In hypothesis testing, rejecting the null hypothesis does not mean accepting the alternative hypothesis. Instead, it means that there is sufficient statistical evidence to support the alternative hypothesis over the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is not accepted; it is merely considered plausible given the data.\n\nB. The null hypothesis is the statement being tested while the alternative encompasses the remaining outcomes of interest.\n- This statement is correct. The null hypothesis is the statement that is tested against the alternative hypothesis, which represents the outcomes of interest.\n\nC. The test of significance and confidence interval approaches will always give the same conclusions.\n- This statement is incorrect. The test of significance and confidence intervals can sometimes give different conclusions. The test of significance provides a binary decision (reject or not reject), while confidence intervals provide a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to lie.\n\nD. Hypothesis tests are used to make inferences about the population parameters.\n- This statement is correct. Hypothesis tests are designed to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is:\n\nC. The test of significance and confidence interval approaches will always give the same conclusions.",
