It could be a result of a change in leadership or policy.\n\nC. **Places his or her department's priorities above the president's**: This option directly aligns with the concept of \"going native.\" When a cabinet member prioritizes the interests of their department over the president's, it suggests a shift in loyalty and a failure to act in the best interest of the executive branch as a whole.\n\nD. **Accepts bribes or expensive favors from businesses regulated by his or her department**: While this could indicate corruption, it does not necessarily mean the official has \"gone native.\" Accepting bribes is a criminal act and not a reflection of alignment with the department's interests.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate description of \"going native\" is:\n\nC. **Places his or her department's priorities above the president's**\n\nThis option directly reflects the idea of prioritizing departmental interests over the broader executive branch, which is a hallmark of \"going native.\"",
