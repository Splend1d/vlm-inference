            "content": "Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is not true.\n\nA. When there is a strong front-runner in a state, people in that state are less likely to vote.\n- This statement is true. When a candidate is perceived as a strong front-runner, it can lead to a phenomenon known as the \"undecided voter\" effect. Voters may feel less motivated to participate in the election if they believe their vote won't significantly impact the outcome.\n\nB. White-collar workers are more likely to vote than are blue-collar workers, with the exception of blue-collar workers who belong to unions.\n- This statement is true. Generally, white-collar workers have higher voter turnout rates compared to blue-collar workers. However, blue-collar workers who are union members might have higher turnout rates due to union-organized voting efforts and the influence of union leaders.\n\nC. Voters who are registered as independent are less likely to vote than those who are registered Democrats or Republicans.\n- This statement is true. Independent voters often have lower voter turnout compared to those affiliated with major political parties. This could be due to a variety of factors, including the perception that their vote won't influence the election outcome or a lack of engagement with the political process.\n\nD. There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.\n- This statement is not true. Studies have shown that individuals with postgraduate degrees tend to have higher voter turnout rates compared to those with only an undergraduate degree. This could be due to increased political engagement and awareness among postgraduate students.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is:\n\nD. There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.",
