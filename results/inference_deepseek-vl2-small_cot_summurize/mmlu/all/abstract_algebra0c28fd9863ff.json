The only possibility is 1.\n3. **Normal Subgroup**: Since there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup, it must be normal.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.**\n\n1. **Order of the Group**: The order of the group is 42, which can be factored as \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n2. **Subgroups**: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 2) must divide 21 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1 and 21.\n3. **Normal Subgroup**: If there is a Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal. However, the order of this subgroup is 2, which is not 8.\n\nThus, there are no normal subgroups of order 8 in a group of order 42. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
