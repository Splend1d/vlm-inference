This is a common occurrence in many species, including fruit flies.\n\nFruit flies are a model organism in genetics, and they exhibit a wide range of genetic variation. They are also known for their rapid reproduction and short generation times, which allows for the observation of genetic variation and selection over a relatively short period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
