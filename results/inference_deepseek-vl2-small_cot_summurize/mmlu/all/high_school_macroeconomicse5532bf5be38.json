            "content": "To close an expansionary gap, the economy needs to move from a state of over-performance (where the actual output exceeds potential output) to a state of equilibrium where actual output equals potential output. This typically involves reducing the level of economic activity to match the economy's productive capacity.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the right.\n- Shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right would increase the overall demand for goods and services, which could lead to higher output and potentially an expansionary gap. This is not the correct action to close an expansionary gap.\n\nB. The aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left.\n- Shifting the aggregate demand curve to the left would decrease the overall demand for goods and services, which would help reduce output to match potential output. This is the correct action to close an expansionary gap.\n\nC. The aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the right.\n- Shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right would increase the overall supply of goods and services, which could lead to lower prices and higher output, potentially widening the expansionary gap. This is not the correct action to close an expansionary gap.\n\nD. The aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the left.\n- Shifting the aggregate supply curve to the left would decrease the overall supply of goods and services, which would help reduce output to match potential output. This is the correct action to close an expansionary gap.\n\nTherefore, the correct options to close an expansionary gap are:\n\nB. The aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left.\nD. The aggregate supply curve should be shifted to the left.",
