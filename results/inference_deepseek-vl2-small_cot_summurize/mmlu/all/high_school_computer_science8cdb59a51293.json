O(n^2).\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe notation O(n^2) represents a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that the running time of an algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the input. This is the largest time complexity among the given options, as it grows faster than O(1), O(n), and O(log n).\n\nO(1) represents a constant time complexity, which means that the running time of an algorithm does not change with the size of the input.\n\nO(n) represents a linear time complexity, which means that the running time of an algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.\n\nO(log n) represents a logarithmic time complexity, which means that the running time of an algorithm grows logarithmically with the size of the input.\n\nTherefore, O(n^2) is the largest asymptotically, as it grows faster than the other time complexities.",
