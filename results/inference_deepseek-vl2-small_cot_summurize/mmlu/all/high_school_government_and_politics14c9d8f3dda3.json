The doctrine of original intent is a legal principle that suggests that the Constitution should be interpreted based on the original understanding of its framers. This means that the Constitution should be read in the context of the time it was written, considering the language, the historical background, and the intentions of those who drafted it.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This option suggests that the Supreme Court may consider both the intent of a law and the letter of the law, but not both. This is not accurate because the doctrine of original intent specifically emphasizes interpreting the Constitution based on the original intent of its framers, not considering both intent and letter of the law.\n\nB. This option discusses copyright laws, which are unrelated to the doctrine of original intent. Copyright laws are designed to protect the rights of creators, not to interpret the Constitution.\n\nC. This option suggests that appellate judges should respect the original decisions of trial judges. While this is a principle of judicial respect for precedent, it does not directly address the doctrine of original intent.\n\nD. This option states that the Constitution should be interpreted in light of the intent of those who wrote it. This directly aligns with the doctrine of original intent, which emphasizes interpreting the Constitution based on the original understanding of its framers.\n\nTherefore, the best articulation of the doctrine of original intent is option D: The Constitution should be interpreted in light of the intent of those who wrote it.",
