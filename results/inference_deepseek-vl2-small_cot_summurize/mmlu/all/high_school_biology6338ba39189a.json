            "content": "To determine which biome the researcher is most likely to be in, we need to understand the concept of \"35 percent more species\" in the context of the given options.\n\n1. **Understanding the Options**:\n   - **Tundra**: This biome is characterized by cold temperatures and limited plant and animal life. It is not known for high biodiversity.\n   - **Tundra**: This is a repetition of the previous option, which is incorrect.\n   - **Tropical rainforest**: Known for its high biodiversity, with a vast array of plant and animal species.\n   - **Temperate deciduous forest**: While it has a significant amount of biodiversity, it is generally not as high as that of a tropical rainforest.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Percentage**:\n   - A 35 percent increase in species means that the number of species is 135 percent of what it is in the other biomes.\n   - This implies that the researcher is observing a biome with a significantly higher number of species compared to the other biomes listed.\n\n3. **Comparing the Biomes**:\n   - **Tundra**: Low biodiversity.\n   - **Tundra**: Low biodiversity.\n   - **Tropical rainforest**: High biodiversity.\n   - **Temperate deciduous forest**: Moderate biodiversity.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the researcher is observing a biome with 35 percent more species than in any other biome, the only biome that fits this description is the tropical rainforest, which is known for its extremely high biodiversity.\n\nTherefore, the researcher is most likely to be in the **Tropical rainforest**.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC.
