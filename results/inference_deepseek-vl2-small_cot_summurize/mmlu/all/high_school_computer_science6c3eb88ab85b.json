The procedure will find \"Ben\" in the list and return its index, which is 1. This is correct.\n\nB. FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\" ], \"Diane\" )\n- The target name is \"Diane\". The procedure will not find \"Diane\" in the list, so it will return 0. This is correct.\n\nC. FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\", \"Chris\"], \"Ben\")\n- The target name is \"Ben\". The procedure will find \"Ben\" in the list and return its index, which is 1. This is correct.\n\nD. FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Chris\", \"Diane\"], \"Ben\")\n- The target name is \"Ben\".
