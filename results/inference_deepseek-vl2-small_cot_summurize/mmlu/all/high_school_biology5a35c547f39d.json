In this case, the lamprey benefits by absorbing nutrients from the lake trout, but the lake trout is harmed because it loses nutrients and energy.\n\n2. **Parasitism** involves a relationship where one organism benefits at the expense of the other. The lamprey benefits by feeding on the lake trout, while the lake trout is harmed. This fits the description of parasitism.\n\n3. **Mutualism** is a relationship where both organisms benefit. This does not apply here, as the lake trout is harmed.\n\n4. **Gravitropism** is a plant response to gravity, not a type of biological relationship between organisms.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **B. parasitism**, because the lamprey benefits by feeding on the lake trout, which is harmed in the process.",
