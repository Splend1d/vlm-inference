            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas.\n\n1. **Option A: q = 0**\n\n   - In an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy (\u0394E) of an ideal gas is equal to the heat added to the system (q) minus the work done by the system (w).\n   - Since \u0394E = 0 (temperature is constant), the equation becomes: 0 = q - w.\n   - Solving for q, we find q = w.\n   - Therefore, q \u2260 0, so this option is incorrect.\n\n2. **Option B: w = 0**\n\n   - In an isothermal expansion, the gas does work on the surroundings. The work done by the gas is given by the equation w = -P\u0394V, where P is the pressure and \u0394V is the change in volume.\n   - Since the gas expands, \u0394V is positive, and thus w is negative.\n   - Therefore, w \u2260 0, so this option is incorrect.\n\n3. **Option C: E = 0**\n\n   - The internal energy (E) of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature. Since the temperature is constant in an isothermal process, the internal energy remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, E = 0, making this option correct.\n\n4. **Option D: q = -w**\n\n   - As previously analyzed, q = w in an isothermal process.\n   - Therefore, q \u2260 -w, so this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. E = 0",
