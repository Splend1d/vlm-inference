This characteristic is not unique to either group.\n\nB. **True roots**: Gymnosperms typically have a root system that is not true roots, but rather a modified stem called a rhizome or a root-like structure called a stele. Angiosperms, on the other hand, have true roots, which are a fundamental characteristic that differentiates them from gymnosperms.\n\nC. **Apical growth**: Both groups can exhibit apical growth, where the main stem or shoot grows in length. This is not a distinguishing feature between angiosperms and gymnosperms.\n\nD. **Seeds enclosed in ovaries**: Both angiosperms and gymnosperms produce seeds, but the key difference lies in the structure of the ovary. Angiosperms have seeds enclosed within a fruit, while gymnosperms have seeds that are not enclosed in a fruit. This is a significant characteristic that differentiates angiosperms from gymnosperms.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the characteristic that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms is:\n\n**B. True roots**\n\nAngiosperms have true roots, which are a defining feature that sets them apart from gymnosperms.",
