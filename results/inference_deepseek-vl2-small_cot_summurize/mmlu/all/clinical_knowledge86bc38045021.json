This is a common sign of phlebitis.\n\nB. **Redness**: The inflammation of a vein typically causes redness in the affected area. This is due to increased blood flow and the presence of inflammatory cells.\n\nC. **Exudate**: Phlebitis can cause exudate, which is a fluid that leaks from the blood vessels into the surrounding tissues. This is another typical sign of phlebitis.\n\nD. **Cool to the touch**: Unlike the other signs, which are due to increased blood flow and inflammation, a cool to the touch area is not a typical sign of phlebitis. This is because inflammation usually causes warmth due to increased blood flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Cool to the touch.",
