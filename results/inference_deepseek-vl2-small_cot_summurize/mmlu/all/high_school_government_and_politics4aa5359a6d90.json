This means that the protections and rights outlined in the Bill of Rights, such as freedom of speech, religion, and due process, are also enforceable against state governments. This doctrine was established by the Supreme Court in the case of West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943).\n\nA. Mandamus: This is a legal term that refers to a court order to a public official to perform a specific act. It is not related to the application of the Bill of Rights to state governments.\n\nB. Habeas corpus: This is a legal term that refers to a court order to a person who is being detained or imprisoned, requiring the authorities to bring the person before the court to determine the legality of the detention. It is not related to the application of the Bill of Rights to state governments.\n\nC. Strict constructionism: This is a legal philosophy that emphasizes the literal interpretation of the Constitution and laws. It is not related to the application of the Bill of Rights to state governments.",
