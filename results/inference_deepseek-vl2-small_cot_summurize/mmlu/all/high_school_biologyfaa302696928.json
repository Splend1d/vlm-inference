            "content": "To determine which developmental process results in the formation of the three primary germ layers, we need to understand the sequence of events in vertebrate embryonic development.\n\n1. **Cleavage**: This is the first stage of embryonic development, where the single-celled zygote undergoes rapid cell division to form a multicellular structure known as a blastula. This process does not directly lead to the formation of the three primary germ layers.\n\n2. **Blastula formation**: The blastula is a hollow sphere of cells that forms after cleavage. It is a crucial stage for the initial organization of the embryo, but it does not directly result in the formation of the three primary germ layers.\n\n3. **Neurulation**: This process involves the formation of the neural tube, which is the precursor to the central nervous system. While neurulation is essential for the development of the nervous system, it does not directly lead to the formation of the three primary germ layers.\n\n4. **Gastrulation**: This is the process where the blastula undergoes significant reorganization to form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. During gastrulation, cells move and differentiate to create these layers, which are the foundation for all tissues and organs in the body.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Gastrulation. This process is crucial for the development of the three primary germ layers, which are essential for the formation of all tissues and organs in the body.",
