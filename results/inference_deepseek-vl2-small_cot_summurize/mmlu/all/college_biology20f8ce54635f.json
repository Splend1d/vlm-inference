Binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3 initiates the sperm\u2019s acrosomal reaction. All of the following experimental observations would be expected EXCEPT:\n\nA. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.\nB. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization.\nC.

            "content": "To determine which observation is not expected, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.\n- This is expected because ZP3 is a critical component of the zona pellucida that facilitates sperm binding and subsequent fertilization. If antibodies against ZP3 are present, they would prevent the sperm from binding to the eggs, thus blocking fertilization.\n\nB. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization.\n- This is also expected. ZP3 is necessary for the sperm to recognize and bind to the eggs. If sperm are incubated with ZP3, they will be unable to bind to the eggs, preventing fertilization.\n\nC. Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.\n- This is expected as well. The presence of antibodies against ZP3 on the eggs would prevent the sperm from binding to the eggs, thus blocking fertilization.\n\nD. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\n- This is not expected. ZP2 is another glycoprotein in the zona pellucida, but it is not the primary receptor for sperm binding. Sperm primarily bind to ZP3, not ZP2. Therefore, coating beads with ZP2 should not prevent sperm aggregation, as ZP2 does not play a role in the binding process.\n\nThus, the observation that is not expected is option D.",
