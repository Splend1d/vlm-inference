            "content": "Gamma radiation is a form of ionizing radiation that can cause changes in the chemical structure of atoms. When food is exposed to gamma radiation, the radiation can cause the atoms in the food to become radioactive. This means that the food will have a small amount of radioactivity, making it slightly radioactive.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Becomes slightly radioactive**: This is the correct answer. Gamma radiation can cause atoms in the food to become radioactive, resulting in a small amount of radioactivity in the food.\n\nB. **Doesn\u2019t become radioactive**: This is incorrect. Gamma radiation can cause atoms in the food to become radioactive, so the food will not remain non-radioactive.\n\nC. **Will spoil faster**: While gamma radiation can affect the chemical structure of food, it does not directly cause food to spoil faster. Spoilage is typically caused by microbial growth, which is not directly affected by gamma radiation.\n\nD. **Should be avoided**: This is not a direct consequence of gamma radiation exposure. While it is true that some foods may be more sensitive to radiation than others, the primary effect of gamma radiation on food is to make it slightly radioactive, not to cause it to be avoided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. becomes slightly radioactive",
