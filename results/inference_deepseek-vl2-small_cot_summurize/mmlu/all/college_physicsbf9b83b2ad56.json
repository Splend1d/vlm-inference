            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the equation of motion under constant acceleration, which is:\n\n\\[ s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( s \\) is the displacement (height),\n- \\( u \\) is the initial velocity,\n- \\( t \\) is the time,\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration.\n\nIn this case, the object is thrown horizontally, so the initial velocity \\( u \\) is 20 m/s. The time \\( t \\) is 2.0 seconds, and the acceleration \\( a \\) is due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ s = 20 \\times 2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 2^2 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 40 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 4 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 40 + 19.6 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 59.6 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nHowever, this result doesn't match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nThe correct approach is to use the equation of motion under constant acceleration, but we need to consider the horizontal distance traveled by the object. Since the object is thrown horizontally, the horizontal distance traveled is equal to the initial velocity multiplied by the time:\n\n\\[ s = u \\times t \\]\n\n\\[ s = 20 \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 40 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the equation of motion to find the height:\n\n\\[ s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 40 = 20 \\times 2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 2^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 40 = 40 + 19.6 \\]\n\n\\[ 40 = 59.6 \\]\n\nThis result is still not correct. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.\n\nThe correct approach is to use the equation of motion under constant acceleration, but we need to consider the vertical distance traveled by the object.
