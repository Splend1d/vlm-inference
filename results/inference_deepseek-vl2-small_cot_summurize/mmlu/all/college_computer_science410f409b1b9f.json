It can be executed immediately.\n\n2. **B := A - B**\n   - This operation depends on the result of `A := B + C`. Therefore, it must be executed after `A := B + C`.\n\n3. **C := A * E**\n   - This operation depends on the result of `A := B + C`. Therefore, it must be executed after `A := B + C`.\n\n4. **D := A/F**\n   - This operation depends on the result of `A := B + C`.
