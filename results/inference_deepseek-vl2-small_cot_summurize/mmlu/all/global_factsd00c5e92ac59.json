While it's possible that some people might feel this way, it's not a universally accepted truth. Happiness is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. Therefore, this statement is not universally true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: In the United States, women\u2019s happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men.**\n\n   - This statement claims that women in the United States have experienced an increase in happiness both in absolute terms and relative to men. Research has shown that women in the U.S. have reported higher levels of happiness compared to men in recent years. This trend is supported by various studies and surveys that indicate improvements in women's well-being and life satisfaction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. True, False\n\nStatement 1 is false because it is not universally true that people in every country think others are less happy than they are. Statement 2 is true because it accurately reflects the trend of increasing happiness among women in the United States compared to men.",
