            "content": "To determine which statement is supported by the information given in the pedigree, we need to analyze the genetic inheritance pattern of alkaptonuria, which is an autosomal recessive disorder.\n\nAlkaptonuria is caused by a mutation in the HGD gene, which is located on chromosome 1. The gene is recessive, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The P generation mother is X-X.\n- This statement is incorrect. In the pedigree, the mother of the affected individual (woman 1) is not X-X. She is X-X, but her mother is not.\n\nB. The P generation father is X-Y.\n- This statement is incorrect. The father of the affected individual is not X-Y. He is X-X, as he is not affected by the disease.\n\nC. If parents 1 and 2 in row II have another child, the chance that the child would be afflicted with alkaptonuria is 25%.\n- This statement is correct. Parents 1 and 2 are both carriers (X-X) of the alkaptonuria allele. If they have another child, the child has a 25% chance of inheriting the two copies of the mutated gene (X-X) and thus being affected by the disease.\n\nD. The genotype of woman 1 is X-X.\n- This statement is incorrect. Woman 1 is affected by alkaptonuria, which means she must have two copies of the mutated gene (X-X).\n\nTherefore, the statement that is supported by the information given in the pedigree is:\n\nC. If parents 1 and 2 in row II have another child, the chance that the child would be afflicted with alkaptonuria is 25%.",
