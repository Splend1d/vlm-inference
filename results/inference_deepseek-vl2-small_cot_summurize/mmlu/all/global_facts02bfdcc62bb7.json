It involved the secret sale of arms to Iran and the use of the proceeds to fund anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua. This operation was conducted without the knowledge or approval of Congress, leading to significant political controversy.\n\nIn 1987, public opinion on the Iran Contra affair was highly divided. Many Americans were critical of the administration's actions, and there was a significant amount of skepticism and distrust towards the government.\n\nAccording to historical polls and surveys from that period, a substantial portion of the American public believed that President Reagan was withholding information about the Iran Contra affair. A common estimate from that time is that around 50% of Americans believed that the administration was not being fully transparent about the situation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 50%",
