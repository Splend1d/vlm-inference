A hash function has been applied to each word in the dictionary, and the appropriate entry in the hash table has been set to true. To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined. Which of the following is (are) correct?\nI. true means the word was in the dictionary.\nII. false means the word was not in the dictionary.\nIII. Hash table size should increase with document size.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. I and II only\nD. II and III only\n",

In a hash table, a true value indicates that the word was found in the dictionary.\n\nII. false means the word was not in the dictionary.\n- This statement is correct. In a hash table, a false value indicates that the word was not found in the dictionary.\n\nIII. Hash table size should increase with document size.\n- This statement is incorrect. The size of the hash table should not necessarily increase with the size of the document. The hash table size is determined by the number of words in the dictionary, not the size of the document.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. I and II only.",
