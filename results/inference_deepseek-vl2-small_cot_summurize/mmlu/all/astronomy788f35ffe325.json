            "content": "To determine the correct order of ingredients in the solar nebula from highest to lowest percentage of mass, we need to consider the composition of the solar nebula. The solar nebula is a cloud of gas and dust that eventually formed the Sun and the planets.\n\n1. **Hydrogen Compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3)**: These are the most abundant compounds in the solar nebula. Water (H2O), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3) are all present in significant amounts.\n\n2. **Light Gases (H, He)**: Hydrogen (H) and helium (He) are the most abundant elements in the solar nebula. They are lighter than the compounds and thus make up a large portion of the nebula's mass.\n\n3. **Metals and Rocks**: These are less abundant compared to hydrogen compounds and light gases. Metals and rocks are heavier and thus occupy a smaller percentage of the nebula's mass.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A**: \"hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) light gases (H He) metals rocks\"\n  - This order is incorrect because it places metals and rocks before hydrogen compounds and light gases, which are more abundant.\n\n- **Option B**: \"hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) light gases (H He) rocks metals\"\n  - This order is incorrect because it places rocks and metals before hydrogen compounds and light gases, which are more abundant.\n\n- **Option C**: \"light gases (H He) hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) metals rocks\"\n  - This order is incorrect because it places light gases before hydrogen compounds and rocks, which are more abundant.\n\n- **Option D**: \"light gases (H He) hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) rocks metals\"\n  - This order is correct. It places light gases and hydrogen compounds before metals and rocks, reflecting their relative abundance in the solar nebula.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**: \"light gases (H He) hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) rocks metals.\"",
