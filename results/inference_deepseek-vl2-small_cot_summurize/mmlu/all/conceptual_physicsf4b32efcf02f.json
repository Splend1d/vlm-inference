            "content": "To determine the frequency of the second harmonic compared to the fundamental tone, we need to understand the concept of harmonics in sound waves.\n\n1. **Fundamental Tone**: This is the lowest frequency of a sound wave. It is the pitch that we hear when we listen to a musical note.\n\n2. **Harmonics**: These are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, the second harmonic is twice the fundamental frequency, the third harmonic is three times the fundamental frequency, and so on.\n\n3. **Frequency Relationship**: The frequency of a harmonic is a simple multiple of the fundamental frequency. Specifically, the frequency of the \\( n \\)-th harmonic is \\( n \\) times the frequency of the fundamental tone.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option A: Half as much** - This would imply that the second harmonic is half the frequency of the fundamental tone, which is incorrect because the second harmonic is a multiple of the fundamental frequency.\n\n- **Option B: Twice as much** - This would imply that the second harmonic is twice the frequency of the fundamental tone, which is correct. The second harmonic is indeed twice the frequency of the fundamental tone.\n\n- **Option C: The same** - This would imply that the second harmonic has the same frequency as the fundamental tone, which is incorrect because the second harmonic is a higher frequency.\n\n- **Option D: Four times as much** - This would imply that the second harmonic is four times the frequency of the fundamental tone, which is incorrect because the second harmonic is a multiple of the fundamental frequency, not a multiple of four.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. twice as much**.",
