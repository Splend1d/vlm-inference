            "content": "To understand the process of double fertilization in flowering plants, we need to break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Pollination and Fertilization**: When a pollen grain lands on the stigma of a flower, it germinates and grows a pollen tube down the style to the ovary. The sperm cells within the pollen tube travel through the pollen tube to reach the ovule.\n\n2. **First Sperm Union**: One of the sperm cells fuses with the egg cell in the ovule, forming a zygote. This zygote will develop into the embryo of the plant.\n\n3. **Second Sperm Union**: The second sperm cell fuses with two polar nuclei located in the center of the ovule. These polar nuclei are part of the embryo sac and will develop into the endosperm, which is a nutrient-rich tissue that provides nourishment to the developing embryo.\n\n4. **Formation of the Endosperm**: The fusion of the second sperm with the polar nuclei results in the formation of the endosperm. This tissue is crucial for the early development of the embryo, providing it with the necessary nutrients to grow.\n\nGiven this detailed explanation, the correct answer is:\n\nD. endosperm\n\nDouble fertilization is a unique feature of angiosperms (flowering plants) and is essential for the development of the plant embryo and the formation of the endosperm.",
