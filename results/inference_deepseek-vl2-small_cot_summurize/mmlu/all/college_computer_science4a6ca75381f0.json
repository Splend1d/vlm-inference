            "content": "To determine which option is NOT a property of bitmap graphics, let's analyze each one:\n\nA. **Fast hardware exists to move blocks of pixels efficiently.**\n   - Bitmap graphics are stored in a grid of pixels, and the hardware is designed to efficiently move and manipulate these pixels. This allows for fast rendering and manipulation of images. Therefore, this is a property of bitmap graphics.\n\nB. **Realistic lighting and shading can be done.**\n   - Bitmap graphics are typically 2D images and do not support the depth or lighting effects that are possible in 3D graphics. While some advanced bitmap techniques can simulate lighting, they are not as realistic as those in 3D graphics. Thus, this is not a property of bitmap graphics.\n\nC. **All line segments can be displayed as straight.**\n   - Bitmap graphics can display line segments as straight lines, which is a fundamental characteristic of these images. Therefore, this is a property of bitmap graphics.\n\nD. **Polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures.**\n   - Bitmap graphics can indeed fill polygons with solid colors and textures, which is a common feature in image editing and graphic design. Therefore, this is a property of bitmap graphics.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Realistic lighting and shading can be done.",
