Let's break down the distance into its place values:\n\n- The first digit (4) is in the hundreds place.\n- The second digit (4) is in the tens place.\n- The third digit (4) is in the ones place.\n- The fourth digit (4) is in the tenths place.\n- The fifth digit (4) is in the hundredths place.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\nA. The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\n   - The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 0.4.\n   - The value of the 4 in the tens place is 4.\n   - 0.4 is not 1/10 of 4.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n   - The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 0.04.\n   - The value of the 4 in the ones place is 4.\n   - 0.04 is not 1/10 of 4.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nC. The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n   - The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 400.\n   - The value of the 4 in the ones place is 4.\n   - 400 is not 10 times greater than 4.\n   - Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\n   - The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 0.4.\n   - The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 0.04.\n   - 0.4 is indeed 10 times greater than 0.04.\n   - Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{D}$",
