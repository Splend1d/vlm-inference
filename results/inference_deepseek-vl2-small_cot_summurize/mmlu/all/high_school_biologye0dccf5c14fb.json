The most widely accepted scientific theory is that the Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, based on radiometric dating of meteorites and the Earth's crust.\n\nB. Amino acid synthesis could have been stimulated by volcanic eruption.\n- This statement is correct. Volcanic eruptions can release organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. These compounds can be deposited in volcanic ash and later incorporated into the Earth's crust.\n\nC. The first cells formed about 3? billion years ago, according to the fossil record.\n- This statement is incorrect. The fossil record indicates that the first complex cells, known as stromatolites, formed around 3.5 billion years ago. The formation of the first cells is a more recent event, and the fossil record does not support the claim that the first cells formed about 3 billion years ago.\n\nD. The presence of free oxygen facilitated the rapid formation of organic molecules.\n- This statement is correct. The presence of free oxygen, which became more abundant as photosynthetic organisms evolved, played a crucial role in the formation of complex organic molecules. Oxygen can oxidize organic compounds, leading to the formation of more complex molecules.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct is C. The first cells formed about 3? billion years ago, according to the fossil record.",
