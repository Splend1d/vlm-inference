Steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\n- This option describes SARMs accurately. SARMs are indeed non-steroidal compounds that bind to androgen receptors, mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones like testosterone.\n\nB. Steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors antagonising the effects of natural steroid hormones.\n- This option describes anti-androgens, not SARMs. Anti-androgens work by blocking the action of androgens, which is the opposite of what SARMs do.\n\nC. Non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\n- This option is also correct. SARMs are non-steroidal compounds that mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones by binding to androgen receptors.\n\nD. Non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors inhibiting the effects of natural steroid hormones.\n- This option describes anti-androgens, not SARMs. Anti-androgens inhibit the effects of androgens, which is the opposite of what SARMs do.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answers are:\n\nA. Steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\nC. Non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.",
