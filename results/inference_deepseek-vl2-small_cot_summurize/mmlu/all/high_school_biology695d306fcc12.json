            "content": "To determine which principle is demonstrated by the cell shriveling up in a hypertonic environment, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Diffusion**: This is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. In a hypertonic environment, the concentration of solutes is higher outside the cell than inside. Therefore, water would move out of the cell to balance the solute concentrations, causing the cell to shrink. This is exactly what happens in plasmolysis, where the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to water loss.\n\nB. **Active transport**: This involves the movement of substances against their concentration gradient, requiring energy. This process is not applicable in the scenario described, as the cell is in a hypertonic environment where water moves out of the cell, not against the gradient.\n\nC. **Facilitated diffusion**: This is a passive transport process that allows certain molecules to move across cell membranes without the use of energy. While facilitated diffusion can occur in various environments, it does not specifically explain the cell's response to a hypertonic solution.\n\nD. **Plasmolysis**: This is the process where the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to water loss in a hypertonic solution. It is a direct result of osmosis, where water moves out of the cell to balance solute concentrations.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Plasmolysis.",
