Amino acids in the muscles: Creatine is a nitrogenous compound that is synthesized in the liver and transported to the muscles. It is not synthesized from amino acids in the muscles.\n\nB. Amino acids in the liver: This is the correct answer. Creatine is synthesized in the liver from the amino acids arginine and methionine. The liver converts these amino acids into creatine, which is then transported to the muscles for storage.\n\nC. Amino acids in the kidneys: The kidneys are involved in the excretion of creatinine, a waste product of muscle metabolism, but they do not synthesize creatine.\n\nD. Creatinine in the kidneys: Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism and is excreted by the kidneys. It is not involved in the synthesis of creatine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Amino acids in the liver.",
