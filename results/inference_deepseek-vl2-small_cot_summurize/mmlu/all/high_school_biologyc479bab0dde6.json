Darwin believed that environmental change plays a significant role in evolution. He emphasized the importance of natural selection, which is driven by changes in the environment. Therefore, this statement aligns with Darwin's views.\n\nB. Darwin proposed that evolution occurs at the level of species, not individual organisms. He believed that evolution is a gradual process that occurs over long periods of time, leading to the formation of new species. Thus, this statement contradicts Darwin's views.\n\nC. Darwin's theory of natural selection involves individuals acquiring new characteristics as they adapt to their environments. This is a fundamental aspect of his theory, so this statement is consistent with Darwin's ideas.\n\nD. Darwin posited that inherited variation in a population is crucial for natural selection to act upon. He believed that genetic differences among individuals provide the raw material for natural selection to favor certain traits over others. Therefore, this statement is in line with Darwin's beliefs.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we can conclude that the statement Darwin would have rejected is:\n\nB. The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism.",
