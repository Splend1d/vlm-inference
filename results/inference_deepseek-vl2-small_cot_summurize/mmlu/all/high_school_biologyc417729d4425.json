            "content": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Lake B is alkaline.**\n   - The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH less than 7 indicates acidity, while a pH greater than 7 indicates alkalinity. Lake B has a pH of 6.0, which is less than 7, indicating that Lake B is acidic, not alkaline. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. **Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A.**\n   - Alkalinity is the ability of a solution to neutralize acids. Since Lake B has a pH of 6.0 and Lake A has a pH of 8.0, Lake B is more acidic than Lake A. The difference in pH is 2.0 (8.0 - 6.0 = 2.0). This means Lake B is not more alkaline; it is more acidic. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. **The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 104 M.**\n   - The concentration of hydrogen ions (H\u207a) in a solution can be calculated using the formula: [H\u207a] = 10^(-pH). For Lake B, with a pH of 6.0, the concentration of hydrogen ions is 10^(-6.0) = 10^-6 M. Therefore, the statement that the hydrogen ion concentration is 104 M is incorrect.\n\nD. **The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain.**\n   - Acid rain is a mixture of water and atmospheric pollutants, primarily sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) and nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093), which react with water to form sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) and nitric acid (HNO\u2083). These acids lower the pH of water bodies, making them more acidic. Therefore, both lakes will experience a decrease in pH due to acid rain. This statement is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain.",
