            "content": "To determine the frequency of the vertical input in a Lissajous pattern, we need to understand the relationship between the horizontal and vertical frequencies in such a pattern.\n\nA Lissajous pattern is formed by the intersection of two sinusoidal waves with different frequencies. The pattern's shape and the number of tangencies depend on the ratio of the frequencies of the two waves.\n\nGiven:\n- Horizontal frequency (\\(f_x\\)) = 100 Hz\n- Number of horizontal tangencies = 5\n- Number of vertical tangencies = 2\n\nThe number of horizontal tangencies is related to the ratio of the horizontal frequency to the vertical frequency by the formula:\n\\[\n\\frac{f_x}{f_v} = \\frac{n_x}{n_v}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n_x\\) is the number of horizontal tangencies and \\(n_v\\) is the number of vertical tangencies.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{f_v} = \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(f_v\\):\n\\[\n100 \\times 2 = 5 \\times f_v\n\\]\n\\[\n200 = 5f_v\n\\]\n\\[\nf_v = \\frac{200}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nf_v = 400 \\text{ Hz}\n\\]\n\nThus, the frequency of the vertical input is 400 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 400 Hz.",
