This power is granted by the Constitution and is not subject to congressional approval.\n\nB. **Appoint Supreme Court justices**: The president has the authority to appoint Supreme Court justices, but this appointment must be confirmed by the Senate. Therefore, while the president can nominate, the appointment process requires congressional approval.\n\nC. **Negotiate and ratify treaties**: The president can negotiate treaties with other nations, but these treaties must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. Thus, the president cannot unilaterally ratify a treaty without congressional approval.\n\nD. **Declare war**: The power to declare war is granted to Congress, not the president. The president can recommend military action, but it is Congress that has the constitutional authority to declare war.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Grant reprieves and pardons.",
