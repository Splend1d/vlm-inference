Metalloids are elements that have properties of both metals and nonmetals. They are typically found in the middle of the periodic table, often in groups 13 to 15.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Cr (Chromium) - Chromium is a transition metal, not a metalloid. It is known for its high melting point and is used in alloys and as a catalyst.\n\nB. Mn (Manganese) - Manganese is also a transition metal. It is used in steel production and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions.\n\nC. Si (Silicon) - Silicon is a metalloid. It is a semiconductor and is widely used in the electronics industry. It is found in the middle of the periodic table and exhibits properties of both metals and nonmetals.\n\nD. S (Sulfur) - Sulfur is a nonmetal. It is a yellow solid at room temperature and is used in the production of sulfuric acid and fertilizers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the element that is a metalloid is:\n\nC. Si (Silicon)",
