            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the behavior of a diode under different biasing conditions.\n\n1. **Forward Bias**:\n   - When a diode is forward biased, it allows current to flow easily through it. This is because the p-n junction is forward-biased, reducing the barrier for electrons to move from the p-side to the n-side.\n   - Under forward bias, the diode exhibits low resistance. This is because the majority carriers (electrons and holes) can move freely across the junction, facilitating the flow of current.\n\n2. **Reverse Bias**:\n   - When a diode is reverse biased, it acts as an insulator. The p-n junction is reverse-biased, which increases the barrier for electrons to move from the n-side to the p-side.\n   - Under reverse bias, the diode exhibits high resistance. This is because the majority carriers are unable to move across the junction, effectively blocking the flow of current.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A**: \"High resistance when forward or reverse biased\" is incorrect because a diode should have low resistance under forward bias and high resistance under reverse bias.\n- **Option B**: \"Low resistance when forward biased, while high resistance when reverse bias\" is correct. This accurately describes the behavior of a diode under these conditions.\n- **Option C**: \"High resistance when forward biased, while low resistance when reverse bias\" is incorrect because the resistance should be low under forward bias and high under reverse bias.\n- **Option D**: \"Low resistance when forward or reverse biased\" is incorrect because a diode should have high resistance under reverse bias.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Low resistance when forward biased, while high resistance when reverse bias**.",
