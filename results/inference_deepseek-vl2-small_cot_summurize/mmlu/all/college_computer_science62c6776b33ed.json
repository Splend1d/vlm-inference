If the input is already sorted, the algorithm performs the same number of operations as if it were unsorted.\n\nB. **Quicksort**: The time complexity of quicksort is O(n log n) on average, but it can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case if the pivot selection is poor. This means that the performance of quicksort can vary significantly depending on the initial ordering of the input.\n\nC. **Merge sort**: The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) in all cases, which means it is not dependent on the initial ordering of the input. Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements, but its time complexity is not affected by the initial order.\n\nD. **Selection sort**: The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, which means it is highly dependent on the initial ordering of the input. If the input is already sorted, the algorithm performs the same number of operations as if it were unsorted.\n\nBased on the analysis, the sorting algorithm with a running time that is least dependent on the initial ordering of the input is:\n\nC.
