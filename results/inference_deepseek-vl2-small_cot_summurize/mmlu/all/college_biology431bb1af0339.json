            "content": "To determine which structure encases the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates to prevent desiccation and injury, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Amnion**: The amnion is a thin membrane that lines the amniotic cavity, which is filled with amniotic fluid. This fluid acts as a cushion, protecting the embryo from mechanical injury and preventing desiccation. The amnion is a critical component of the amniotic sac, which is present in all terrestrial vertebrates.\n\nB. **Chorion**: The chorion is the outermost layer of the embryo, which eventually becomes the placenta. It is involved in nutrient exchange and gas exchange but does not directly encase the embryo in a fluid.\n\nC. **Allantois**: The allantois is a structure that develops into the umbilical cord and placenta. It is involved in waste removal and nutrient transport but does not encase the embryo in a fluid.\n\nD. **Yolk sac**: The yolk sac is a structure that provides nutrients to the developing embryo. It is not involved in encasing the embryo in a fluid.\n\nGiven this analysis, the amnion is the structure that secretes a fluid to encase the embryos, providing protection and preventing desiccation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. amnion",
