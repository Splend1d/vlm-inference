            "content": "When a wire carrying current is bent into a circular loop, the magnetic field around each portion of the wire can be determined using the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field \\( B \\) at a point due to a small current element \\( Idl \\) at a distance \\( r \\) from the element is given by:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I dl \\times r}{4\\pi r^3} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu_0 \\) is the permeability of free space, \\( I \\) is the current, \\( dl \\) is the differential length of the wire, and \\( r \\) is the distance from the wire to the point where the magnetic field is being measured.\n\nFor a circular loop, the magnetic field at any point on the loop can be found by integrating the magnetic field contributions from each small segment of the wire. The magnetic field at a point on the loop is perpendicular to the plane of the loop and to the direction of the current in the wire.\n\nLet's consider a small segment of the wire at a distance \\( r \\) from the center of the loop. The magnetic field due to this segment is given by:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I dl \\times r}{4\\pi r^3} \\]\n\nSince the magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of the current in the wire, it is also perpendicular to the plane of the loop. Therefore, the magnetic field around each portion of the wire is perpendicular to the plane of the wire.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. parallel to the plane of the wire.",
