            "content": "To determine which concept the opening of new stores around a large shopping mall reflects, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Gravity concept**: This concept suggests that the number of stores in a given area is influenced by the number of people in that area. The idea is that more people lead to more stores. This concept is more applicable to urban areas where population density is high, rather than a large shopping mall, which is typically located in a suburban or less densely populated area.\n\nB. **Distance decay**: This concept refers to the idea that the number of stores decreases as the distance from a central point (such as a shopping mall) increases. This is because the convenience of shopping decreases with distance, leading to fewer stores being located further away. The opening of new stores around a large shopping mall is consistent with this concept, as stores are likely to open to attract customers who are traveling to the mall.\n\nC. **Complementarity**: This concept involves the idea that stores complement each other in terms of the types of goods they offer. While complementarity can influence store location, it does not directly explain why stores would open around a large shopping mall.\n\nD. **Movement bias**: This concept suggests that people tend to move in a certain direction when they are shopping, often towards the center of a shopping area. While this can influence store location, it does not explain why stores would open around a large shopping mall.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the opening of new stores around a large shopping mall is best explained by the **Distance decay** concept. This is because stores are likely to open to attract customers traveling to the mall, and the number of stores decreases as the distance from the mall increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Distance decay**.",
