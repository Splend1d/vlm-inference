            "content": "To determine which of the given options represents a frameshift mutation, we need to understand what a frameshift mutation is. A frameshift mutation occurs when a single nucleotide change results in the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides, which alters the reading frame of the genetic sequence. This can lead to a completely different amino acid sequence being produced, often resulting in a nonfunctional protein.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HAS HIT\n- This option shows a single nucleotide change from \"HIS\" to \"HIT.\" The insertion of the nucleotide \"T\" changes the reading frame, resulting in a different sequence of amino acids. This is a classic example of a frameshift mutation.\n\nB. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA\n- This option shows a deletion of the nucleotide \"S\" and an insertion of \"ISA.\" The deletion of \"S\" changes the reading frame, but the insertion of \"ISA\" does not change the reading frame. This is not a frameshift mutation.\n\nC. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HIS HAT\n- This option shows a deletion of the nucleotide \"T\" and an insertion of \"HAT.\" The deletion of \"T\" changes the reading frame, but the insertion of \"HAT\" does not change the reading frame. This is not a frameshift mutation.\n\nD. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT WAS HIT\n- This option shows a deletion of the nucleotide \"S\" and an insertion of \"WAS HIT.\" The deletion of \"S\" changes the reading frame, but the insertion of \"WAS HIT\" does not change the reading frame. This is not a frameshift mutation.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HAS HIT\n\nThis option correctly represents a frameshift mutation due to the insertion of the nucleotide \"T,\" which changes the reading frame of the sequence.",
