In Earth's case, the tectonic plates are divided into several large and small plates that move relative to each other, causing geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountains. Mars, while not as geologically active as Earth, does have evidence of tectonic activity, such as the presence of fault lines and volcanic features.",
