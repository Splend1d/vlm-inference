A palpable left parasternal impulse would not be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nB. **Aortic stenosis**: This condition involves narrowing of the aortic valve, leading to increased pressure in the left ventricle as it has to work harder to eject blood into the aorta. A palpable left parasternal impulse is a classic sign of aortic stenosis, as the increased pressure causes the heart muscle to bulge outward, making the impulse palpable.\n\nC. **Aortic regurgitation**: This condition involves the backward flow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. It is typically associated with a decreased left parasternal impulse, not a palpable one.\n\nD. **Left ventricular hypertrophy**: This condition involves thickening of the left ventricle, often due to increased workload from conditions like hypertension. A palpable left parasternal impulse is not characteristic of left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the palpable left parasternal impulse is most commonly associated with **B.
