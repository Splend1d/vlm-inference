            "content": "To determine which statement is NOT true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.\n- In many species, the presence of yolk can indeed inhibit cleavage. Yolk acts as a nutrient source and can interfere with the development of the embryo by affecting the cytoplasmic environment. This is a common phenomenon in many birds and reptiles. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage.\n- Telolecithal eggs are characterized by having a large amount of yolk at one pole, which can inhibit cleavage. This results in meroblastic cleavage, where only a few cells divide, and the rest of the cells remain unfused. This statement is true.\n\nC. The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole.\n- In many cleavage patterns, the vegetal pole (the side with the yolk) tends to divide more readily than the animal pole (the side without yolk). This is because the yolk can inhibit the animal pole, leading to more efficient cleavage on the side with the yolk. This statement is true.\n\nD. The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres.\n- While cleavage involves rapid mitotic divisions, these divisions do not directly give rise to blastomeres. Instead, they result in the formation of smaller cells called blastomeres, which are the precursors to the blastula. Therefore, this statement is NOT true.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\nD. The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres.",
