            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions under which the three smaller segments can form the sides of a triangle.\n\nLet's denote the length of the segment AB as \\( x \\). The three smaller segments are then \\( x \\), \\( 10 - x \\), and \\( 10 - 2x \\).\n\nFor these three segments to form the sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem.\n\nApplying the triangle inequality theorem to the three segments, we get the following inequalities:\n\n1. \\( x + (10 - x) > 10 - 2x \\)\n2. \\( x + (10 - 2x) > 10 - x \\)\n3. \\( (10 - x) + (10 - 2x) > x \\)\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n\n1. \\( 10 > 2x \\)\n2. \\( 10 > 3x \\)\n3. \\( 20 - 3x > x \\)\n\nFrom the first inequality, we get \\( x < 5 \\).\n\nFrom the second inequality, we get \\( x > \\frac{10}{3} \\).\n\nFrom the third inequality, we get \\( x < 10 \\).\n\nCombining these inequalities, we get \\( \\frac{10}{3} < x < 5 \\).\n\nSince the length of the segment AB is fixed at 10, the only possible value of \\( x \\) is 5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the three smaller segments can form the sides of a triangle is 0, since the only possible value of \\( x \\) is 5, which is not a random value.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ 0 \\]",
