            "content": "To determine where fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon occurs, we need to understand the process of fertilization in the female reproductive system.\n\n1. **Ovulation**: The process begins with ovulation, where a mature egg is released from the ovary. This egg is then transported through the fallopian tube.\n\n2. **Fertilization Location**: Fertilization typically occurs in the fallopian tube. This is because the fallopian tube is the site where the egg meets the spermatozoon. The egg travels from the ovary through the fallopian tube, where it is available for fertilization.\n\n3. **Pathway of the Egg**: After ovulation, the egg travels down the fallopian tube. The cilia on the fallopian tube walls help move the egg towards the uterus.\n\n4. **Sperm Journey**: The spermatozoon, which is the male gamete, travels from the epididymis through the vas deferens and into the fallopian tube.\n\n5. **Fertilization Process**: Once the egg and sperm meet in the fallopian tube, fertilization occurs. The sperm penetrates the egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote.\n\n6. **Post-Fertilization**: After fertilization, the zygote begins to divide and travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus.\n\nGiven this detailed understanding, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Fallopian tube\n\nThis is where the fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon takes place, making the fallopian tube the correct answer.",
