The second cardboard strip is 2/3 feet wide.\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 3 is 6.\n\nConvert each fraction to have a denominator of 6:\n\n- For the first strip: \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n- For the second strip: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n\nConvert \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) to have a denominator of 6:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2 \\times 2}{3 \\times 2} = \\frac{4}{6} \\]\n\nNow, add the two fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{9}{6} \\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{9}{6} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{6} = 1 \\frac{3}{6} = 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nSo, the combined width of the two cardboard strips is \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\) feet.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1 and 1 over 2 ft",
