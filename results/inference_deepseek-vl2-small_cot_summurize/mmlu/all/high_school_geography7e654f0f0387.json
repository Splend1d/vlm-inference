It is not applicable to the Rhine River, which is a natural waterway.\n\nB. **Artificial Boundary**: An artificial boundary is created by human activity, such as walls, fences, or roads. The Rhine River is a natural waterway, not an artificial one, so this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **Natural Boundary**: A natural boundary is formed by natural features such as rivers, mountains, or coastlines. The Rhine River is a natural waterway that separates two regions, making it a natural boundary.\n\nD. **Relict Boundary**: A relict boundary is a boundary that no longer exists but was once significant. The Rhine River is still an active boundary, so this option is not applicable.\n\nBy analyzing the characteristics of each option, we can conclude that the Rhine River is a natural boundary. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Natural",
