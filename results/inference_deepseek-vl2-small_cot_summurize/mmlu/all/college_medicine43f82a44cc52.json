They are not the sequences that are transcribed into mRNA.\n\nB. **Exons**: These are the coding sequences of genes that are retained in the final mRNA after splicing. Exons are the parts of the gene that are expressed in the protein.\n\nC. **Introns**: These are non-coding sequences of DNA that are removed during RNA processing. Introns do not code for proteins and are not part of the final mRNA.\n\nD. **Codons**: These are sequences of three nucleotides in mRNA that code for specific amino acids in proteins. Codons are not sequences of genes themselves.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. **Exons**.\n\nExons are the coding sequences of genes that are included in the final mRNA and are translated into proteins.",
