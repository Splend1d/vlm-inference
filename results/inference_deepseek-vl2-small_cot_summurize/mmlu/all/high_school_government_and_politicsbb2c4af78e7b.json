It allows for trial by jury in common-law cases.\n- The Tenth Amendment does not specifically address trial by jury in common-law cases. This is more related to the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, including the right to a jury trial.\n\nB. It grants voting rights to all American women.\n- The Tenth Amendment does not grant voting rights to women. The right to vote was granted to women through the Nineteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1920.\n\nC. It lowers the legal voting age from 21 to 18.\n- The Tenth Amendment does not affect the voting age. The voting age was lowered to 18 through the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, which was ratified in 1971.\n\nD. It reserves powers to the states.\n- The Tenth Amendment states that \" powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" This means that any powers not explicitly given to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is D. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers to the states.",
