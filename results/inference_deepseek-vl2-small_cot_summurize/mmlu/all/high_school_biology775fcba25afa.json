            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The autosomal gene is initially fixed, meaning that the allele is present in the population at a frequency of 100%.\n\n2. **Mutation and Incomplete Dominance**: A mutation introduces a new allele, which is inherited according to incomplete dominance. This means that the heterozygous genotype (heterozygous) will have a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous genotypes.\n\n3. **Stabilizing Selection**: Natural selection acts on the heterozygous genotype, favoring it over the homozygous genotypes. This is because the heterozygous genotype has a survival advantage, leading to an increase in its frequency in the population.\n\n4. **Effect on Allele Frequencies**: As stabilizing selection favors the heterozygous genotype, the frequency of the homozygous genotypes (both homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive) will decrease. This is because the heterozygous genotype is more fit and thus more likely to be passed on to the next generation.\n\n5. **Heterozygosity**: The heterozygous genotype is favored, so its frequency will increase over time.\n\n6. **Average Heterozygosity**: The average heterozygosity of the population will increase because the heterozygous genotype is more common.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: Incorrect. The proportion of both homozygous types should decrease, not both.\n- **Option B**: Incorrect. The heterozygous proportion should increase, not remain constant.\n- **Option C**: Correct. The heterozygosity of the population should increase.\n- **Option D**: Correct. Both A and C are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Both A and C**.",
