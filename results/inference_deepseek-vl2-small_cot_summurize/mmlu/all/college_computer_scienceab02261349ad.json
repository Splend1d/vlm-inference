            "content": "To determine which policy results in a better hit ratio, we need to understand the impact of each policy on cache performance.\n\n- **Write-through** policy: In this policy, every write operation is immediately written to the main memory. This means that the cache is always in sync with the main memory. As a result, the cache is always up-to-date, and there is no delay in writing back to the main memory. This ensures that the cache is never out of sync with the main memory, which can lead to a higher hit ratio because the cache is more likely to contain the data requested by the CPU.\n\n- **Write-back** policy: In this policy, a write operation to a cache line does not immediately affect the main memory. Instead, the data is written to the cache first, and then the cache is periodically written back to the main memory. This can lead to a lower hit ratio because the cache may not always contain the data requested by the CPU, especially if the cache is not frequently updated.\n\nGiven these explanations, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.** This is incorrect because write-through ensures that the cache is always in sync with the main memory, which typically results in a higher hit ratio.\n\nB. **Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.** This is correct because write-through ensures that the cache is always up-to-date, leading to a higher hit ratio.\n\nC. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.** This is incorrect because write-back can result in a higher percentage of write operations that require a main memory operation, especially if the cache is not frequently updated.\n\nD. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.** This is incorrect because write-through ensures that the cache is always in sync with the main memory, which typically results in a lower percentage of write operations that require a main memory operation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.**",
