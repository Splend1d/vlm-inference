This process involves four steps:\n\n1. **Authentication**: The client sends a request to the AP to authenticate the client. The AP responds with a challenge.\n2. **Response**: The client sends a response to the AP, which includes the client's identity and a challenge response.\n3. **Challenge**: The AP sends a challenge to the client.\n4. **Response**: The client sends a response to the AP, which includes the client's identity and a challenge response.\n\nThis process ensures that both the client and the AP have agreed on a common key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt the data transmitted between them. The 4-way handshake is a critical part of the wireless network's security, as it helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures that only authenticated devices can connect to the network.",
