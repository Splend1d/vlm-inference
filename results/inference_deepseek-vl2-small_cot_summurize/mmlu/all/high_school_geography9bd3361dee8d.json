Decreased dependency on cars\n\nThe correct answer is: D. Decreased dependency on cars.\n\nFreeways are designed to facilitate faster and more efficient travel, which can lead to increased traffic congestion, especially during peak hours. They can also contribute to urban sprawl as they often connect suburban areas to urban centers, encouraging development in those areas. However, they do not necessarily decrease dependency on cars, as they can still be used for personal transportation.",
