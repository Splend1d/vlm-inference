            "content": "The correct answer is C. The Supreme Court has used the practice of selective incorporation to apply most Bill of Rights protections to state law.\n\nSelective incorporation is a legal doctrine that allows the Supreme Court to extend certain constitutional protections to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. This means that the Court can ensure that the Bill of Rights, which originally applied only to the federal government, is also applied to the states. This has been done in various cases, such as Brown v. Board of Education, which declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional, and Miranda v. Arizona, which established the right to an attorney in criminal proceedings.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. The Supreme Court does not limit the number of appeals filed by defendants in state courts.\nB. The Supreme Court has not extended voting rights to racial minorities and women through selective incorporation. This was achieved through the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nD. The Supreme Court has not hastened the integration of public schools. This was achieved through various court rulings and civil rights legislation, including Brown v. Board of Education.",
