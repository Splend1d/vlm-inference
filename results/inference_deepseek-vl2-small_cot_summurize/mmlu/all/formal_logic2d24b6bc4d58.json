(\u2203x){Fx \u2022 (\u2200y)[Dy \u2283 (\u2203z)(Vz \u2022 Rxyz)]}\n\nThis translation captures the meaning of the original statement by defining the predicates and the logical relationships between them. Here's a breakdown of the translation:\n\n- **Fx**: \"x is a firefighter\"\n- **Dy**: \"x is in danger\"\n- **Vz**: \"z is a victim\"\n- **Rxyz**: \"x rescues y from z\"\n\nThe translation uses existential quantifiers (`\u2203x`) to indicate that there exists at least one firefighter, and universal quantifiers (`\u2200y`) to indicate that for every victim, there exists a firefighter who rescues them from danger. The logical relationship is captured by the implication `(\u2200y)[Dy \u2283 (\u2203z)(Vz \u2022 Rxyz)]`, which states that if a person is in danger, then there exists a victim that the firefighter rescues.\n\nThis translation is the most accurate representation of the original statement in predicate logic.",
