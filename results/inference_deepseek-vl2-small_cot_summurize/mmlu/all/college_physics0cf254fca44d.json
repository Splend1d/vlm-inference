            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the frequency of the echo heard by the driver. The frequency of the echo is determined by the speed of sound and the distance the sound travels.\n\n1. **Determine the distance the sound travels:**\n   - The speed of the car is 3.5 m/s.\n   - The speed of sound is 350 m/s.\n   - The time it takes for the sound to travel from the siren to the wall and back is the same for both directions.\n\n   Let \\( t \\) be the time it takes for the sound to travel from the siren to the wall and back. The distance traveled by the sound is twice the distance from the siren to the wall, which is \\( 2 \\times 350 \\, \\text{m} = 700 \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\n   The time \\( t \\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{700 \\, \\text{m}}{350 \\, \\text{m/s}} = 2 \\, \\text{seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the frequency of the echo:**\n   - The frequency of the siren is 600 Hz.\n   - The frequency of the echo is the same as the frequency of the siren because the echo is a reflection of the original sound wave.\n\n   Therefore, the frequency of the echo is also 600 Hz.\n\n3. **Determine the nearest frequency:**\n   - The frequencies given in the options are:\n     - A. 600 Hz\n     - B. 606 Hz\n     - C. 612 Hz\n     - D. 618 Hz\n\n   The frequency 600 Hz is the correct answer.\n\nThus, the frequency of the echo heard by the driver is nearest to:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
