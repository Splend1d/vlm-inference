            "content": "To determine which reaction is best classified as a heterogeneous reaction, we need to understand the definitions of heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions.\n\nA heterogeneous reaction involves the formation of distinct phases or substances, where the reactants and products are not in the same phase. This means that the reactants and products are in different states, such as solid, liquid, or gas.\n\nA homogeneous reaction, on the other hand, involves the formation of a single phase or substance, where the reactants and products are in the same phase. This means that the reactants and products are in the same state, such as all solid, all liquid, or all gas.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. 2C2H2(g) + 5O2(g) \u2192 4CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\nThis reaction involves the formation of gaseous products (CO2 and H2O) from gaseous reactants (C2H2 and O2). Since the products are in the same phase as the reactants, this is a homogeneous reaction.\n\nB. C2H5OH(aq) + O2(aq) \u2192 HC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(aq)\nThis reaction involves the formation of aqueous products (HC2H3O2 and H2O) from aqueous reactants (C2H5OH and O2). Since the products are in the same phase as the reactants, this is a homogeneous reaction.\n\nC. C(s) + H2O(g) \u2192 H2(g) + CO(g)\nThis reaction involves the formation of gaseous products (H2 and CO) from a solid reactant (C) and a gaseous reactant (H2O). Since the products are in different phases than the reactants, this is a heterogeneous reaction.\n\nD. C2H2(g) + 5N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + 5N2(g)\nThis reaction involves the formation of gaseous products (CO2, H2O, and N2) from gaseous reactants (C2H2 and N2O). Since the products are in the same phase as the reactants, this is a homogeneous reaction.\n\nBased on the analysis, the reaction that is best classified as a heterogeneous reaction is:\n\nC. C(s) + H2O(g) \u2192 H2(g) + CO(g)\n\nThe correct answer is C.",
