Phosphate: Phosphate is primarily used in fertilizers and is not a fossil fuel. It is not abundant in the sense of being a primary energy source.\n\nB. Oil: Oil is a fossil fuel, but it is not the most abundant. While it is widely used and has significant reserves, it is not the most abundant compared to other fossil fuels.\n\nC. Petroleum: Petroleum is a type of oil, and while it is abundant, it is not the most abundant fossil fuel.\n\nD. Coal: Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel. It is the most widely used fossil fuel globally, accounting for a significant portion of the world's energy production. Coal reserves are also substantial, making it the most abundant fossil fuel.\n\nTherefore, the most abundant fossil fuel is:\n\nD. Coal",
