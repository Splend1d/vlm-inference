These programs aim to address and rectify past injustices by giving these groups an advantage in areas such as education, employment, and contracting. The other options do not specifically address preferential treatment for historically discriminated groups:\n\nA. The New Federalism refers to a shift in the balance of power between the federal government and the states, not to preferential treatment for historically discriminated groups.\n\nC. Social Security benefits are a form of government assistance provided to individuals, not a means of preferential treatment for historically discriminated groups.\n\nD. Bills of attainder are legislative acts that declare the guilt of a specific person or group, not a means of providing preferential treatment.",
