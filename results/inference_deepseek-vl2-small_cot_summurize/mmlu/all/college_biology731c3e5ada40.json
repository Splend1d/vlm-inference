The Golgi apparatus is not oriented in the cytoplasm with its cis face closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. Instead, the cis face of the Golgi apparatus is oriented towards the endoplasmic reticulum, where newly synthesized proteins and lipids are transported. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. The Golgi apparatus is indeed associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. These vesicles bud off from the cis face and transport proteins and lipids to their final destinations. This statement is correct.\n\nC. The Golgi apparatus consists of a series of flattened, membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. These cisternae are not continuous with one another; instead, they are stacked in a specific manner. The cis face is the side facing the endoplasmic reticulum, and the trans face is the side facing the plasma membrane. This statement is incorrect.\n\nD. Glycosylation, the process of adding carbohydrate groups to proteins, typically occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, not the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell. This statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct statement is:\n\nB. It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face.",
