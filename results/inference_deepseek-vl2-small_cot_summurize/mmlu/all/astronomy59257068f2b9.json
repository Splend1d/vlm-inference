            "content": "To determine the correct formula for the second cosmic velocity, we need to understand the concept of escape velocity. Escape velocity is the minimum speed required for an object to break free from the gravitational pull of a celestial body.\n\nThe formula for escape velocity \\( v_e \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of the celestial body,\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the celestial body.\n\nThe second cosmic velocity is the speed required to escape the gravitational field of a celestial body with a mass \\( M \\) and radius \\( R \\). This is essentially the same as the escape velocity formula, but it is applied to a body with a mass \\( 2M \\) and radius \\( R \\).\n\nThus, the formula for the second cosmic velocity is:\n\n\\[ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\]\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( v = \\sqrt{GM/R} \\) - This is the formula for escape velocity, not the second cosmic velocity.\n\nB. \\( v = 2\\sqrt{GM/R} \\) - This is incorrect because it suggests a factor of 2, which is not applicable here.\n\nC. \\( v = \\sqrt{2GM/R} \\) - This is the correct formula for the second cosmic velocity.\n\nD. \\( v = \\sqrt{GM/2R} \\) - This is incorrect because it suggests a factor of 1/2, which is not applicable here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\( v = \\sqrt{2GM/R} \\).",
