It is a property of the light source and does not change when light reflects off a surface. The frequency remains constant before and after reflection.\n\nB. **Wavelength**: Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks of a wave. It is also a property of the light source and does not change when light reflects off a surface. The wavelength remains constant before and after reflection.\n\nC. **All of these**: Since both frequency and wavelength remain constant during reflection, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **None of these**: This option is incorrect because both frequency and wavelength do not change during reflection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. None of these.",
