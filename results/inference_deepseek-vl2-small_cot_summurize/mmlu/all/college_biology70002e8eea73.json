            "content": "The correct answer is B. histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.\n\nThe target of digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers by DNase is the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. These histones are the acidic proteins that make up the core of the nucleosome, which is the fundamental unit of chromatin structure. The nucleosome consists of a segment of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins, with the DNA forming a double helix around the histone octamer (two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4).\n\nDNase (deoxyribonuclease) is an enzyme that breaks down DNA, and in the context of nucleosome digestion, it specifically targets the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are not directly targeted by DNase. Instead, DNase primarily cleaves the DNA between the nucleosomes, leading to the release of the nucleosome core and the formation of nucleosome monomers.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- A. the H1 histone: H1 histone is not part of the nucleosome core; it is a linker histone that helps to stabilize the nucleosome structure.\n- C. the nucleosome core: The nucleosome core is the histone octamer, not the target of DNase digestion.\n- D. linker DNA: While DNase does target linker DNA, the question specifically asks about the target of digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers, which is the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
