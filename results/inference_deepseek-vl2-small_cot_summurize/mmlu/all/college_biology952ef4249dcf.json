They are found on the surface of mast cells and basophils, but they have light chains and are not associated with epsilon heavy chains.\n\nB. **IgA**: This class is found in mucosal surfaces and secretions, such as saliva, tears, and mucus. It does not have epsilon heavy chains.\n\nC. **IgD**: This class is found on the surface of B cells and is involved in B cell activation and differentiation. It does not have epsilon heavy chains.\n\nD. **IgM**: This class is the first to be produced in response to an infection and is the most abundant antibody in the blood. It has a pentameric structure, which means it has five subunits. The heavy chains of IgM have epsilon heavy chains, which are crucial for its function.\n\nGiven the description of the immunoglobulins having epsilon heavy chains and being located on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes, the correct answer is:\n\nD. IgM\n\nIgM is the class of antibodies that fits this description, as it has epsilon heavy chains and is found on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes.",
