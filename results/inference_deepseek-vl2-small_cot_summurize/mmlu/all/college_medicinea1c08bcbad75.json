At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n",

            "content": "To determine which option best explains the teacher's observation, we need to analyze the characteristics of different reinforcement schedules and how they might influence behavior.\n\n- **Option A: Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.**\n  - Variable ratio schedules provide reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses. This unpredictability can lead to a strong, enduring response because the subject cannot predict when the next reinforcement will occur. This makes the behavior less susceptible to extinction.\n\n- **Option B: The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.**\n  - This option suggests that the students were more motivated by the intrinsic reward of doing well on quizzes rather than the extrinsic reward of showing up on time. However, the question focuses on the effectiveness of the reward system, not the motivation behind the behavior.\n\n- **Option C: The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.**\n  - A fixed-ratio schedule provides reinforcement after a set number of responses, which can lead to a strong response but may also cause extinction if the reinforcement is not given after a certain number of responses.\n\n- **Option D: The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.**\n  - A variable-interval schedule provides reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses, which can lead to a strong, enduring response similar to a fixed-ratio schedule. However, the question does not specify which schedule was used.\n\nGiven the teacher's observation that performance on quizzes has increased significantly while tardiness has decreased slightly, the most plausible explanation is that the variable-ratio schedule created a strong, enduring response to the reward of getting above a 90% on quizzes. This schedule's unpredictability likely contributed to the sustained improvement in quiz performance.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for the teacher's observation is:\n\n**A. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.**",
