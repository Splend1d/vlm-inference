            "content": "To determine the most likely explanation for the similarity in DNA sequences between humans and chimpanzees, we need to consider the evolutionary relationships between these species.\n\n1. **Understanding Evolutionary Relationships**:\n   - Humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor that lived approximately 6 million years ago. This is a well-supported fact in the field of evolutionary biology.\n   - The DNA sequences in humans and chimpanzees are similar because they have inherited many of the same genes from this common ancestor.\n\n2. **Evaluating Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Humans evolved from chimpanzees millions of years ago.\" This statement is incorrect because humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor, not one evolving from the other.\n   - **Option B**: \"Chimpanzees evolved from humans millions of years ago.\" This statement is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.\n   - **Option C**: \"Humans and chimpanzees evolved from a recent common ancestor\u2014about 6 million years ago.\" This statement is correct. It accurately reflects the evolutionary timeline and the genetic similarities between the two species.\n   - **Option D**: \"Humans and chimpanzees evolved from a distant common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\" This statement is incorrect because it suggests a much longer evolutionary time frame than is supported by current scientific evidence.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most accurate explanation for the similarity in DNA sequences between humans and chimpanzees is that they evolved from a recent common ancestor approximately 6 million years ago.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Humans and chimpanzees evolved from a recent common ancestor\u2014about 6 million years ago.**",
