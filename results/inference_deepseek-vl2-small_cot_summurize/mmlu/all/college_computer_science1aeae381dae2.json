            "content": "To determine the cluster centers for the given data points using the k-Means Clustering algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by randomly selecting k points as the initial centroids. In this case, k = 3.\n\n2. **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid. Calculate the distance between each point and each centroid. The point with the smallest distance is assigned to that centroid.\n\n3. **Update Step**: Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all points assigned to each cluster.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n- **Initial Centroids**:\n  - C1: (0,6)\n  - C2: (2,2)\n  - C3: (5,5)\n\n- **First Iteration**:\n  - Assign points to clusters:\n    - C1: {(0,6), (6,0)}\n    - C2: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)}\n    - C3: {(5,5), (7,7)}\n\n  - Calculate distances:\n    - Distance from (0,6) to (0,6): 0\n    - Distance from (6,0) to (0,6): 6\n    - Distance from (2,2) to (0,6): \u221a(4 + 36) = \u221a40 \u2248 6.32\n    - Distance from (4,4) to (0,6): \u221a(16 + 36) = \u221a52 \u2248 7.21\n    - Distance from (6,6) to (0,6): 0\n    - Distance from (5,5) to (2,2): \u221a(4 + 4) = \u221a8 \u2248 2.83\n    - Distance from (7,7) to (2,2): \u221a(49 + 16) = \u221a65 \u2248 8.06\n\n  - Assign points:\n    - C1: {(0,6), (6,0)}\n    - C2: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)}\n    - C3: {(5,5), (7,7)}\n\n  - Recalculate centroids:\n    - C1: Mean of (0,6) and (6,0) = (3,3)\n    - C2: Mean of (2,2), (4,4), (6,6) = (4,4)\n    - C3: Mean of (5,5), (7,7) = (6,6)\n\n- **Second Iteration**:\n  - Recalculate distances and assign points:\n    - C1: {(0,6), (6,0)}\n    - C2: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)}\n    - C3: {(5,5), (7,7)}\n\n  - Recalculate centroids:\n    - C1: Mean of (0,6) and (6,0) = (3,3)\n    - C2: Mean of (2,2), (4,4), (6,6) = (4,4)\n    - C3: Mean of (5,5), (7,7) = (6,6)\n\n- **Third Iteration**:\n  - Recalculate distances and assign points:\n    - C1: {(0,6), (6,0)}\n    - C2: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)}\n    - C3: {(5,5), (7,7)}\n\n  - Recalculate centroids:\n    - C1: Mean of (0,6) and (6,0) = (3,3)\n    - C2: Mean of (2,2), (4,4), (6,6) = (4,4)\n    - C3: Mean of (5,5), (7,7) = (6,6)\n\nThus, the cluster centers after the first iteration are:\n- C1: (3,3)\n- C2: (4,4)\n- C3: (6,6)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A.
