            "content": "To determine which group the Democratic Party is most likely to alienate with liberal social policies, we need to consider the traditional bases of support for the Democratic Party and the implications of these policies.\n\nA. People holding advanced academic degrees: The Democratic Party traditionally has strong support from individuals with advanced degrees, particularly in urban areas. Liberal social policies, such as those supporting abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and progressive taxation, are generally well-received by this demographic. Therefore, alienating this group is unlikely.\n\nB. Northeastern city dwellers: Similar to those with advanced degrees, Northeastern city dwellers often support liberal social policies. Cities in the Northeast are generally more progressive and open to such changes. Thus, alienating this group is also unlikely.\n\nC. Southerners: Southerners have historically been more conservative and less supportive of liberal social policies. Issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and progressive taxation are often viewed negatively in the South. Therefore, pursuing liberal social policies could alienate this group.\n\nD. Jewish Americans: While Jewish Americans are generally more liberal on social issues, they are also more likely to support the Democratic Party due to its alignment with their values on issues like civil rights and foreign policy. Therefore, alienating Jewish Americans is less likely.\n\nConsidering these points, the Democratic Party is most likely to alienate Southerners with liberal social policies.\n\nFinal answer: C. Southerners",
