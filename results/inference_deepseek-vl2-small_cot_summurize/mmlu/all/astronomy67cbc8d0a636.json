While Venus has a heavily cratered surface, indicating past impacts, the question asks for evidence of surface processes, not just the result of impacts.\n\nB. **Erosion**: Erosion involves the wearing away of the surface by wind, water, or ice. Venus has a very thin atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide, which does not support significant erosion processes like those on Earth.\n\nC. **Volcanism**: Volcanism involves the activity of volcanoes, which can create new landforms and alter the surface. Venus has numerous volcanic features, including shield volcanoes and volcanic plains, indicating active or past volcanic activity.\n\nD. **A B and C**: This option suggests that Venus shows evidence of all three processes: impacts, erosion, and volcanism. While impacts and volcanism are evident, erosion is not a significant process on Venus due to its thin atmosphere.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the correct answer is **D. A B and C**, as Venus shows evidence of impacts, volcanism, and lacks significant erosion processes.",
