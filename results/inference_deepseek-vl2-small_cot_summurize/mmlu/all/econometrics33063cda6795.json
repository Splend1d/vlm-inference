            "content": "Let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\ni) The parameters can be validly estimated using separate applications of OLS to each equation.\n\nThis statement is true. In a triangular or recursive system, each equation can be estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) independently. This is because the system is typically estimated using a simultaneous equation model, where each equation is estimated separately, and the parameters are then combined to form a consistent set of estimates.\n\nii) The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in other equations.\n\nThis statement is true. In a triangular or recursive system, the independent variables in one equation can be correlated with the error terms in other equations. This is because the system is estimated using a simultaneous equation model, where the error terms in one equation can be related to the independent variables in other equations.\n\niii) An application of 2SLS would lead to unbiased but inefficient parameter estimates.\n\nThis statement is true. Two-stage least squares (2SLS) is a method for estimating a simultaneous equation model. It can lead to unbiased parameter estimates, but it can also be inefficient, especially if the instruments used in the estimation are weak or if the model is misspecified.\n\niv) The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables.\n\nThis statement is true. In a triangular or recursive system, the independent variables in one equation can be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables. This is because the system is estimated using a simultaneous equation model, where the error terms in one equation can be related to the independent variables in other equations.\n\nTherefore, all four statements are true. The correct answer is:\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) only.",
