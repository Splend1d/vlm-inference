The Galilean moons are the four largest moons of Jupiter: Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, and Io. These moons were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ganymede: Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and is indeed one of the Galilean moons.\n\nB. Callisto: Callisto is another of the Galilean moons. It is the second-largest moon in the solar system and is known for its heavily cratered surface.\n\nC. Europa: Europa is not one of the Galilean moons. It is a moon of Jupiter but was discovered by Galileo's contemporary, Simon Marius, in 1610, a year after Galileo's discovery of the Galilean moons.\n\nD. Dione: Dione is another of the Galilean moons. It is known for its distinctive surface features, including large, bright regions and extensive cratered areas.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Europa, as it was discovered by Simon Marius, not Galileo Galilei.",
