            "content": "To determine the type of mutation that causes sickle cell anemia, we need to understand the effects of each type of mutation on the protein sequence.\n\nA. **Frameshift mutation**: This type of mutation involves the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which changes the reading frame of the genetic sequence. This results in a completely different sequence of amino acids being synthesized, often leading to a nonfunctional protein.\n\nB. **Missense mutation**: This mutation involves a single nucleotide change that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein sequence. This can potentially alter the protein's function, but it does not usually cause a frameshift.\n\nC. **Nonsense mutation**: This mutation introduces a premature stop codon into the sequence, leading to the termination of protein synthesis. This results in a truncated, usually nonfunctional protein.\n\nD. **Thymine dimer mutation**: This mutation involves the formation of a thymine dimer, which can cause a mutation by blocking the replication process. However, it does not directly cause a frameshift or a premature stop codon.\n\nIn sickle cell anemia, the substitution of an incorrect nucleotide into the DNA sequence results in a frameshift mutation. This causes a shift in the reading frame, leading to a completely different sequence of amino acids being synthesized. This change in the protein sequence is responsible for the symptoms of sickle cell anemia, such as the abnormal shape of red blood cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. frameshift mutation.",
