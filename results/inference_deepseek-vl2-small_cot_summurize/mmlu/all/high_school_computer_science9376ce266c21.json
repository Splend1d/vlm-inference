The index is zero-based, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.\n\nIn the given expression `['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1][-3]`, the index `-3` is out of range for the list, which means it will be interpreted as `list_name[-3]`. Since the list has only 4 elements, `-3` is equivalent to `3`, which is the index of the third element.\n\nTherefore, `list_name[-3]` will access the third element of the list, which is `'Chemistry'`.",
