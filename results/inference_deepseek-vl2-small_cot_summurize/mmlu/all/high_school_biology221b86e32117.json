It is not specifically about mimicking a dangerous animal.\n\nB. **Batesian mimicry**: This is a form of mimicry where a harmless species evolves to resemble a dangerous species. The mimic benefits from the predator's fear of the dangerous species, while the dangerous species is not affected. This is the correct answer.\n\nC. **Deceptive markings**: These are patterns or colors that make an animal appear larger, more dangerous, or more intimidating. They are not about mimicking a dangerous species.\n\nD. **Cryptic coloration**: This involves blending into the environment to avoid detection, not mimicking a dangerous species.\n\nThrough this analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is **B. Batesian mimicry**. This is the process where a harmless species mimics the appearance of a dangerous species to deter predators.",
