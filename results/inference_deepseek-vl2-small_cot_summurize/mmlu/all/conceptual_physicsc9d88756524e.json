            "content": "To determine which light is bent more when white light enters a prism, we need to understand how different colors of light are refracted by the prism.\n\n1. **Understanding Refraction**: When light passes through a prism, it bends due to the change in the speed of light as it moves from one medium to another (air to glass). The degree of bending depends on the wavelength of the light.\n\n2. **Color Spectrum**: The colors of light in the visible spectrum are arranged in order of their wavelengths, from shortest to longest. This order is: violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.\n\n3. **Bending of Light**: According to the principle of refraction, shorter wavelengths (like violet and blue) are bent more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange) when passing through a prism. This is because shorter wavelengths have higher refractive indices, causing them to bend more.\n\n4. **Green Light**: Green light has a wavelength longer than violet but shorter than red. Therefore, it is bent less than violet light but more than red light.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the order of wavelengths and the principle of refraction, green light is bent less than violet light but more than red light.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. violet light.",
