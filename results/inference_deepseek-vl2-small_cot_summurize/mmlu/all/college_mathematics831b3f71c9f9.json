A function is uniformly continuous if for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a \\( \\delta > 0 \\) such that for all \\( x, y \\in X \\), if \\( d(x, y) < \\delta \\), then \\( d(f(x), f(y)) < \\epsilon \\).\n\n- **Compactness of \\( X \\)** does not imply uniform continuity of \\( f \\). For example, consider \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) on \\( [0, 1] \\). This function is continuous on \\( [0, 1] \\) but not uniformly continuous because the derivative \\( f'(x) = 2x \\) is not bounded on \\( [0, 1] \\).\n\nThus, the statement is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( f(x), g(x) : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) are everywhere differentiable, \\( f(g(x)) \\) must be everywhere differentiable.\n\n- **Differentiability** of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) implies that for any \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\), \\( f'(x) \\) and \\( g'(x) \\) exist.\n- **Composition of differentiable functions** is differentiable. If \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are differentiable, then \\( f(g(x)) \\) is differentiable.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC.
