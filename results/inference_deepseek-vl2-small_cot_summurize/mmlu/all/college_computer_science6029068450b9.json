            "content": "Virtual memory systems that use pages allow for a virtual address space that can be larger than the amount of physical memory. This is because each page in the virtual address space can be mapped to a physical page in main memory, and the system can use page replacement algorithms to manage the mapping of pages. This allows for more efficient use of physical memory and can improve the performance of programs by allowing them to use more memory than is physically available.\n\nHowever, programs do not necessarily have to be resident in main memory throughout their execution. They can be swapped out to disk and brought back into memory as needed, which allows for more efficient use of physical memory and can improve the performance of programs by allowing them to use more memory than is physically available.\n\nPages do correspond to semantic characteristics of the program. For example, a page can be mapped to a physical page that contains a specific section of the program, such as a function or a data structure. This allows for more efficient use of physical memory and can improve the performance of programs by allowing them to access specific parts of the program quickly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and III.",
