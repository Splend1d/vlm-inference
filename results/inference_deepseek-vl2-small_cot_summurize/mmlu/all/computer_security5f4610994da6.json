The target's response is not acknowledged, and the scan is terminated. This method is useful for identifying open ports without establishing a full connection.\n\nB. **TCP connect**: This scan attempts to establish a full TCP connection by sending a SYN packet followed by an ACK packet. The connection is fully established, and the target's response is acknowledged. This method is not stealthy and is not used for scanning purposes.\n\nC. **XMAS tree scan**: This scan sends a SYN packet to the target port and waits for a response. It then sends a RST packet to close the connection. This method is similar to a SYN stealth scan but is more complex and less commonly used.\n\nD. **ACK scan**: This scan sends an ACK packet to the target port and waits for a response. It then sends a RST packet to close the connection. This method is similar to a SYN stealth scan but is more complex and less commonly used.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. SYN stealth scan\n\nThe SYN stealth scan is the only method that does not completely open a TCP connection, making it the most stealthy and suitable for scanning purposes.",
