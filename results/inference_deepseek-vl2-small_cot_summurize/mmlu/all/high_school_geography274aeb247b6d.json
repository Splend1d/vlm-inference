Ravenstein in 1885, suggests that migration tends to occur in small, incremental steps rather than in large, sudden movements. This theory is based on the observation that migration patterns often involve a series of smaller, more manageable movements rather than large-scale migrations. Ravenstein's work was influential in the study of migration patterns and has been used to explain various migration phenomena, including the movement of birds, fish, and even human populations.",
