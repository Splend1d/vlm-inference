Dissatisfaction with current jobs - This is a push factor because it motivates individuals to seek better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nB. Higher-paying jobs elsewhere - This is also a push factor. The desire for higher income can lead individuals to relocate to areas where better-paying jobs are available.\n\nC. An attractive retirement community elsewhere - This is a pull factor, not a push factor. It attracts individuals to move to a new location.\n\nD. A pleasant climate - This is a pull factor, not a push factor. It attracts individuals to move to a new location.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Dissatisfaction with current jobs and B. Higher-paying jobs elsewhere, as both are push factors.",
