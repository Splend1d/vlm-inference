Inside the loop, it is adding 1 to the result variable y times. Therefore, the total number of additions is 3 + y.\n\nSince the result variable is being incremented by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop, the total number of additions is equal to the number of iterations of the outer loop, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of additions is 3 + y, which is equal to 3^y.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 3^y.",
