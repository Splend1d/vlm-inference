            "content": "To determine the best explanation for why net primary productivity (NPP) increases toward the tropics, we need to consider the factors that influence plant growth and productivity.\n\nA. The higher species diversity in the tropics tends to increase plant growth.\n- While species diversity can influence ecosystem productivity, it is not the primary reason for increased NPP in the tropics. The tropics are known for high biodiversity, but this does not directly explain why NPP is higher there.\n\nB. There are lower metabolic costs to plant growth in the tropics.\n- Metabolic costs refer to the energy required for plant growth processes. While tropical plants may have lower metabolic costs due to favorable conditions, this is not the main reason for increased NPP.\n\nC. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\n- Warm temperatures and abundant water are crucial for photosynthesis, which is the primary process that increases NPP. Photosynthesis is more efficient in warmer temperatures and with adequate water, leading to higher rates of carbon fixation and biomass production.\n\nD. The tropics have more predators that minimize herbivory.\n- While predator presence can affect herbivory, it is not a primary factor in increasing NPP. In fact, high herbivory can sometimes reduce plant growth.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the best explanation for why net primary productivity increases toward the tropics is:\n\nC. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.",
