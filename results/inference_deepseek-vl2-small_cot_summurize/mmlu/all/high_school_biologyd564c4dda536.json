Daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\n- In asexual reproduction, the daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cell. This means they have the same number of chromosomes, which is a defining feature of asexual reproduction.\n\nB. Daughter cells are identical to the parent cell.\n- Asexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent. This is a key characteristic of asexual reproduction, as it ensures that the offspring are clones of the parent.\n\nC. The parent cell produces diploid cells.\n- In asexual reproduction, the parent cell typically produces haploid cells, not diploid cells. Diploid cells are formed through the fusion of two haploid cells during sexual reproduction.\n\nD. The daughter cells fuse to form a zygote.\n- In sexual reproduction, the fusion of two gametes (haploid cells) forms a zygote, which is diploid. In asexual reproduction, the process does not involve the fusion of cells to form a zygote.\n\nBased on this analysis, the characteristic that is NOT a feature of asexual reproduction in animals is:\n\nC. The parent cell produces diploid cells.",
