The central city and its developed areas.\n- This definition focuses solely on the central city and its immediate developed areas. It does not account for the broader region that includes the city's influence and interactions with surrounding areas.\n\nB. The central city and its surrounding suburbs.\n- This definition includes the central city and its suburbs, which are typically characterized by residential areas that are close to the city but not as densely developed as the central city itself. While it provides a broader view than option A, it still does not encompass the entire urban area, which includes the city's influence on a larger region.\n\nC. The central city and its hinterlands.\n- This definition includes the central city and the surrounding rural or less developed areas, known as the hinterlands. This encompasses the entire urban area, including the city's influence and interactions with the surrounding countryside. It provides a comprehensive view of the urban area, considering both the densely populated central city and the more sparsely populated areas around it.\n\nD. The central city and the adjacent counties.\n- This definition includes the central city and the counties immediately surrounding it. While it provides a broader view than options A and B, it does not include the hinterlands, which are also part of the urban area.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the best definition of an urban area is:\n\nC. The central city and its hinterlands.",
