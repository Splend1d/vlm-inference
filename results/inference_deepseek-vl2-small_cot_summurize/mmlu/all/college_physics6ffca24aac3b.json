The selection rules are based on the quantum numbers of the initial and final states.\n\nFor hydrogen, the selection rules are:\n1. The principal quantum number (n) must change by 1 (\u0394n = \u00b11).\n2. The azimuthal quantum number (l) must change by 1 (\u0394l = \u00b11).\n3. The spin quantum number (ms) must change by 1 (\u0394ms = \u00b11).\n\nGiven the initial state of the electron is n = 4, l = 1, we need to find the final states that can be reached by an allowed transition.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. n = 3, l = 2\n- \u0394n = 3 - 4 = -1 (allowed)\n- \u0394l = 2 - 1 = 1 (allowed)\n- \u0394ms = 2 - 1 = 1 (allowed)\n- This transition is allowed.\n\nB. n = 3, l = 1\n- \u0394n = 3 - 4 = -1 (allowed)\n- \u0394l = 1 - 1 = 0 (not allowed)\n- This transition is not allowed.\n\nC. n = 3, l = 0\n- \u0394n = 3 - 4 = -1 (allowed)\n- \u0394l = 0 - 1 = -1 (not allowed)\n- This transition is not allowed.\n\nD. n = 2, l = 0\n- \u0394n = 2 - 4 = -2 (not allowed)\n- \u0394l = 0 - 1 = -1 (not allowed)\n- This transition is not allowed.\n\nFrom the analysis, the final states that cannot be reached by an allowed transition are:\n\nB. n = 3, l = 1\nC. n = 3, l = 0\nD. n = 2, l = 0\n\nTherefore, the final states that cannot be reached by an allowed transition are B, C, and D.",
