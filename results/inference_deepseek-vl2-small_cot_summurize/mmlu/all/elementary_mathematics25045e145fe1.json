This is because the comparison is being made between the proportion of students in each class who ate pizza versus hamburgers, and the total number of students in each class is necessary to calculate these proportions.\n\nWithout knowing the total number of students in each class, we cannot accurately compare the number of students who ate pizza versus hamburgers. The total number of students is a crucial piece of information that allows us to understand the scale of the comparison.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the total number of students in each teacher\u2019s class",
