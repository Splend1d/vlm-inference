This region is characterized by the presence of several tectonic plates, including the Pacific Plate, the North American Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Indo-Australian Plate.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Brazil: Brazil is located in South America, far from the Pacific Ocean. It is not part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nB. Australia: Australia is located in the Southern Hemisphere, east of the Indian Ocean, and is not part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nC. Chile: Chile is a country located along the western coast of South America, bordering the Pacific Ocean. It is situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire, making it a prime example of a country in this tectonically active region.\n\nD. India: India is located in South Asia, not in the Pacific Ocean. It is not part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Chile, as it is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire.",
