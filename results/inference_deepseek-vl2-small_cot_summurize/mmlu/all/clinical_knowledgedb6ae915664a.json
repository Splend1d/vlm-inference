            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **It causes stridor due to compression of the oesophagus**  \nStridor is a high-pitched, wheezing sound caused by airway obstruction. While a large goitre can cause airway compression, it is more commonly associated with stridor due to tracheal compression. The oesophagus is not typically affected by a goitre.\n\nB. **Dysphagia is an indication for surgery**  \nDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, can occur with a large goitre due to compression of the oesophagus. However, it is not the primary indication for surgery. Surgery is usually considered when the goitre is causing significant symptoms or complications, such as airway obstruction or compressive symptoms.\n\nC. **It causes hoarseness due to compression of the trachea**  \nHoarseness is indeed a symptom of tracheal compression by a goitre. However, this is not the most common symptom associated with a large goitre.\n\nD. **It causes a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre**  \nThyrotoxicosis refers to an excess of thyroid hormones in the body. A large goitre can lead to increased production of thyroid hormones, resulting in a more florid (more pronounced) thyrotoxicosis. This is because the larger goitre can exert more pressure on the thyroid gland, stimulating it to produce more hormones.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most accurate statement is:\n\nD. It causes a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre.",
