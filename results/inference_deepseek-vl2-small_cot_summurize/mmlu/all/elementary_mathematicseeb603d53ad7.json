Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector.\n\nLet's denote the position of Kim as \\( K \\).\n\n- Since Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim, Hector's position is \\( K + 2 \\).\n- Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector, so Tonya's position is \\( (K + 2) + 3 = K + 5 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find out how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits. Since Tonya's position is \\( K + 5 \\), Kim's position is \\( K + 5 - 7 = K - 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, Kim sits 2 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ A \\]",
