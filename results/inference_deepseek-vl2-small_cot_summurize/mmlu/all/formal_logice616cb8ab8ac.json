The statement can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. \"All planets\" can be represented as a universal quantifier over the set of planets.\n2. \"are smaller than Jupiter\" can be represented as a statement about the relationship between planets and Jupiter.\n\nGiven the symbols:\n- \\( j: \\text{Jupiter} \\)\n- \\( Px: x \\text{ is a planet} \\)\n- \\( Sxy: x \\text{ is smaller than } y \\)\n\nThe statement \"All planets are smaller than Jupiter\" can be translated into the following predicate logic expression:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x (Px \\land Sxj)\n\\]\n\nThis expression means:\n- For all \\( x \\), \\( x \\) is a planet (\\( Px \\)).\n- For all \\( x \\), \\( x \\) is smaller than Jupiter (\\( Sxj \\)).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. \\( (\\exists x)(Px \\cdot Sxj) \\)\n   - This translates to \"There exists an \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\) is a planet and \\( x \\) is smaller than Jupiter.\"\n   - This does not match the original statement, which is about all planets, not just one.\n\nB. \\( (\\forall x)(Px \\cdot Sxj) \\)\n   - This translates to \"For all \\( x \\), \\( x \\) is a planet and \\( x \\) is smaller than Jupiter.\"\n   - This matches the original statement.\n\nC. \\( (\\forall x)(Px \\to Sxj) \\)\n   - This translates to \"For all \\( x \\), if \\( x \\) is a planet, then \\( x \\) is smaller than Jupiter.\"\n   - This does not match the original statement, which is about all planets, not just one.\n\nD. \\( (\\forall x)(Px \\to Sxj) \\)\n   - This translates to \"For all \\( x \\), if \\( x \\) is a planet, then \\( x \\) is smaller than Jupiter.\"\n   - This does not match the original statement, which is about all planets, not just one.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
