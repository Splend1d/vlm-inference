            "content": "To understand how a file is sent from a Web server to a user's browser, we need to consider the process of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) file transfer. HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting data over the web, and it operates on a request-response model.\n\n1. **Request-Response Model**: When a user requests a file from a Web server, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server. This request includes the URL of the file the user wants to access.\n\n2. **Packetization**: The server processes the request and breaks the file into smaller units called packets. These packets are sent over the network to the user's browser.\n\n3. **Transmission**: The packets are transmitted over the internet, which can involve multiple hops and routers. During this process, packets may be lost or corrupted, which is why they are often sent in a sequence.\n\n4. **Reassembly**: Upon receiving the packets, the browser reassembles them into the original file. This is done by the browser's application layer, which uses the order of the packets to reconstruct the file.\n\n5. **Display**: Once the file is reassembled, the browser displays it to the user.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: This describes the process of sending data over a network, but it does not specifically address the HTTP request-response model or the reassembly of packets.\n\n- **Option B**: This accurately describes the process of HTTP. The browser sends a request, the server breaks the file into packets, and the browser reassembles the packets upon receipt.\n\n- **Option C**: This describes a direct connection attempt, which is not the typical process in HTTP. HTTP involves a request-response model, not direct connections.\n\n- **Option D**: This describes a direct connection attempt, similar to Option C, and does not align with the HTTP protocol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user's browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received.",
