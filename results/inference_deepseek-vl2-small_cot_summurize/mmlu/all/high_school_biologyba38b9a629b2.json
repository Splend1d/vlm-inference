By creating a clear path, it may encourage hatchlings to move inland rather than towards the sea.\n\n- **Option B: Minimizing artificial lighting in the area**\n  - Artificial lighting can confuse hatchlings, leading them to move inland instead of towards the sea. By reducing light pollution, we help maintain the natural orientation of hatchlings.\n\n- **Option C: Scattering preferred turtle foods between the nests and the sea**\n  - While providing food can be beneficial, it does not address the primary issue of orientation. Hatchlings are more likely to be influenced by their natural instincts rather than food availability.\n\n- **Option D: Building low fences on the sand dunes**\n  - Fences can obstruct hatchlings' paths and may also cause injury. They do not address the root cause of the problem, which is the orientation issue.\n\nConsidering these options, the most environmentally sound practice is to minimize artificial lighting in the area. This helps to reduce confusion and encourages hatchlings to move towards the sea, aligning with their natural instincts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Minimizing artificial lighting in the area**.",
