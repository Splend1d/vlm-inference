It does not specifically show the distribution of coal.\n\nB. **Topographic Map**: A topographic map illustrates the physical features of the Earth's surface, including mountains, valleys, and elevation. It does not focus on the distribution of coal.\n\nC. **Thematic Map**: A thematic map is a type of map that represents a specific theme or subject, such as the distribution of coal. It uses symbols, colors, and patterns to show the presence and extent of a particular feature, in this case, coal deposits.\n\nD. **Location Map**: A location map shows the exact positions of places, such as cities, roads, and landmarks. It does not provide information about the distribution of coal.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is C. Thematic map, as it is specifically designed to represent the distribution of coal globally.",
