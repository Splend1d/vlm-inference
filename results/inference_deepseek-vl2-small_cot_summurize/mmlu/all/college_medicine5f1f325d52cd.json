            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **usually remains constant during a race.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The maximum sustainable power, or the maximum rate at which an athlete can perform, typically decreases as the race progresses. This is because the body's energy systems, such as glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, become less efficient as the race continues.\n\nB. **declines with the distance of the race.**\n   - This statement is correct. The maximum sustainable power decreases as the distance of the race increases. This decline is due to the depletion of energy stores and the accumulation of metabolic byproducts, which impair the efficiency of energy production.\n\nC. **is improved by a high fat diet.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. While a high-fat diet can improve endurance by increasing the body's fat-burning capacity, it does not directly improve the maximum sustainable power. Instead, it allows athletes to sustain higher intensities for longer periods.\n\nD. **is inversely related to muscle glycogen content.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The maximum sustainable power is not directly related to muscle glycogen content. While glycogen stores are important for short-term energy, the maximum sustainable power is more influenced by the efficiency of energy production and the body's ability to utilize oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. declines with the distance of the race.**",
