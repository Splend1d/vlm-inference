An ordered field is a field (a set with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, and two additional properties, associativity and distributivity) that is also an ordered set. This means that the field must have a total order such that for any two elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), either \\( a \\leq b \\) or \\( b \\leq a \\).\n\nThe complex numbers \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) are not an ordered field because they do not have a total order that satisfies the properties of an ordered field. Specifically, the complex numbers do not have a total order that is compatible with the operations of addition and multiplication. For example, consider the numbers \\( 1 \\) and \\( -1 \\). There is no total order on \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) that satisfies \\( 1 \\leq -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, it is possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) such that \\( (\\mathbb{C}, +, \\times, \\leq) \\) is not an ordered field. This makes statement A true.\n\n### Statement B: It is possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) which make \\( (\\mathbb{C}, +, \\times, \\leq) \\) an ordered field.\n\nTo make \\( (\\mathbb{C}, +, \\times, \\leq) \\) an ordered field, we need to ensure that the complex numbers are an ordered field. This means that the complex numbers must have a total order that is compatible with the operations of addition and multiplication.\n\nThe complex numbers \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) do not have a total order that is compatible with the operations of addition and multiplication. For example, consider the numbers \\( 1 \\) and \\( -1 \\). There is no total order on \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) that satisfies \\( 1 \\leq -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) that makes \\( (\\mathbb{C}, +, \\times, \\leq) \\) an ordered field. This makes statement B false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
