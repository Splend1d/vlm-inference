The number of bases of a group is the number of ways to choose a basis, which is infinite if the group is infinite.\n\n- If a group is infinite, it has an infinite number of bases because you can always add more generators to the basis.\n- If a group is finite, it has a finite number of bases.\n\nSince a nonzero free abelian group is always infinite, it must have an infinite number of bases. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.**\n\nThe rank of a free abelian group is the number of generators it has. A group of rank at least 2 means it has at least two generators.\n\n- If a group has two generators, it is a free abelian group of rank 2. This group has a finite number of bases because you can choose a basis by selecting two generators.\n- If a group has more than two generators, it is a free abelian group of higher rank. These groups also have a finite number of bases because you can choose a basis by selecting a subset of generators.\n\nSince a free abelian group of rank at least 2 is always finite, it has a finite number of bases. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
