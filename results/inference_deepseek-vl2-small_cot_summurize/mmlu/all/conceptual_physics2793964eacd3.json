            "content": "To determine how the combined surface area changes when small pieces of material are assembled into a larger piece, we need to consider the concept of surface area.\n\nSurface area is the total area covered by the surfaces of a three-dimensional object. When pieces of material are combined, the total surface area of the larger piece is the sum of the surface areas of the individual pieces.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Greatly increases**: This would imply that the surface area of the combined piece is significantly larger than the sum of the individual pieces. This is unlikely because the pieces are being added together, not simply stacked.\n\nB. **Slightly increases**: This suggests a small increase in surface area. While it's possible that the combined surface area could be slightly larger, it's not guaranteed.\n\nC. **Decreases**: This option suggests that the combined surface area is less than the sum of the individual pieces. This is the most likely scenario because the pieces are being added together, which generally reduces the total surface area.\n\nD. **Is unchanged**: This would mean that the combined surface area is the same as the sum of the individual pieces. This is unlikely because the pieces are being combined, not simply added.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most reasonable conclusion is that the combined surface area **decreases** when small pieces of material are assembled into a larger piece.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. decreases",
