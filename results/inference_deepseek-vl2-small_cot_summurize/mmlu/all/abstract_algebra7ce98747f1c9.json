A factor group of \\( G \\) is a group \\( K \\) such that \\( K \\) is a quotient of \\( G \\) by a normal subgroup \\( N \\) of \\( G \\). The isomorphism between \\( H \\) and \\( K \\) is given by the quotient map \\( \\pi: G \\to K \\) defined by \\( \\pi(g) = gN \\).\n\nTo show that every homomorphic image of \\( G \\) is isomorphic to a factor group of \\( G \\), consider the following:\n- If \\( H \\) is a homomorphic image of \\( G \\), then \\( H \\) is isomorphic to \\( G \\) under a homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\to H \\).\n- The kernel of \\( \\phi \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\).\n- The quotient group \\( G/\\ker(\\phi) \\) is a factor group of \\( G \\).\n- Since \\( H \\) is isomorphic to \\( G \\), it is also isomorphic to \\( G/\\ker(\\phi) \\).\n\nThus, every homomorphic image of \\( G \\) is isomorphic to a factor group of \\( G \\). Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: The homomorphic images of a group \\( G \\) are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of \\( G \\).**\n\nThis statement is not true. The homomorphic images of a group \\( G \\) are distinct groups that are isomorphic to \\( G \\) under different homomorphisms. For example, consider the group \\( G = \\mathbb{Z} \\) (the integers under addition) and the homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) defined by \\( \\phi(n) = 2n \\). The homomorphic image of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under \\( \\phi \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), which is a factor group of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under the normal subgroup generated by 2. However, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) is not the only homomorphic image of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\); there are other homomorphic images, such as \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\) under the homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\) defined by \\( \\phi(n) = 4n \\).\n\nTherefore, the homomorphic images of \\( G \\) are not the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of \\( G \\). Thus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",
