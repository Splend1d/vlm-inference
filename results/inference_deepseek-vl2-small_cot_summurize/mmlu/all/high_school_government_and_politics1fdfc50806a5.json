Civil cases typically involve claims for monetary damages or specific performance. They are tried in civil courts, which are part of the state court system.\n\nB. **Criminal Cases**: These involve the state charging an individual with a crime, such as theft, assault, or fraud. Criminal cases are tried in criminal courts, which are part of the state court system.\n\nC. **Federal Court System**: This system is responsible for cases involving federal laws, such as those related to the Constitution, federal contracts, or disputes between states. Federal courts have jurisdiction over cases that involve federal questions or diversity of citizenship (where the parties are from different states).\n\nD. **State Court System**: This system handles cases involving state laws and regulations. State courts have jurisdiction over cases that do not involve federal questions or diversity of citizenship.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n\nA. They are tried in civil court.\n\nThis is because private party lawsuits, which are disputes between individuals or organizations, are handled in civil courts, which are part of the state court system.",
