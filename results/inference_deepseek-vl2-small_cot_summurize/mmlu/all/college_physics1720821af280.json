            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the speed of sound affects the resonance frequency of a pipe open at both ends. The resonance frequency \\( f \\) of a pipe is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{\\mu}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f \\) is the resonance frequency,\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe,\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the linear mass density of the air.\n\nGiven:\n- The resonance frequency at 20\u00b0C is 440 Hz.\n- The speed of sound at 20\u00b0C is approximately 343 m/s.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density \\( \\mu \\) of the air at 20\u00b0C. The linear mass density \\( \\mu \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot c}{v} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of air at 20\u00b0C,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C,\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity of sound.\n\nThe density \\( \\rho \\) of air at 20\u00b0C is approximately 1.204 kg/m\u00b3. The velocity of sound \\( v \\) is 343 m/s. Thus:\n\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{1.204 \\times 343}{343} = 1.204 \\, \\text{kg/m} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the resonance frequency at a temperature where the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20\u00b0C. The speed of sound at a temperature \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ v = v_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\alpha \\cdot (T - T_0)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_0 \\) is the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C,\n- \\( \\alpha \\) is the coefficient of thermal expansion,\n- \\( T_0 \\) is the reference temperature (20\u00b0C).\n\nThe coefficient of thermal expansion \\( \\alpha \\) for air is approximately 0.0035 K\u207b\u00b9. Thus:\n\n\\[ v = 343 \\times \\sqrt{1 - 0.0035 \\times (T - 20)} \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( T \\) such that \\( v = 0.97 \\times 343 \\). Solving for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ 0.97 \\times 343 = 343 \\times \\sqrt{1 - 0.0035 \\times (T - 20)} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.97 \\times 343 = 343 \\times \\sqrt{1 - 0.0035 \\times (T - 20)} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.97 = \\sqrt{1 - 0.0035 \\times (T - 20)} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.97^2 = 1 - 0.0035 \\times (T - 20) \\]\n\n\\[ 0.9409 = 1 - 0.0035 \\times (T - 20) \\]\n\n\\[ 0.0035 \\times (T - 20) = 0.0591 \\]\n\n\\[ T - 20 = \\frac{0.0591}{0.0035} \\]\n\n\\[ T - 20 = 16.6 \\]\n\n\\[ T = 36.6 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the resonance frequency at 36.6\u00b0C. Using the formula for resonance frequency:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{\\mu}} \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( L \\) and \\( \\mu \\) at 36.6\u00b0C. The linear mass density \\( \\mu \\) at 36.6\u00b0C is:\n\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{1.204 \\times 343}{343 \\times 1.0035} = 1.204 \\, \\text{kg/m} \\]\n\nThe length \\( L \\) can be found using the speed of sound at 36.6\u00b0C:\n\n\\[ v = 343 \\times \\sqrt{1 - 0",
