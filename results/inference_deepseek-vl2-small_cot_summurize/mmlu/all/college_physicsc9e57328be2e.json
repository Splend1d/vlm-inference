            "content": "To determine the energy required to ionize helium, we need to understand the concept of ionization energy. Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom in its gaseous state.\n\n1. **Understanding the Ground State**: The ground state of an atom is its most stable state, where it has the lowest possible energy. For helium, this means it has two electrons in its 1s orbital.\n\n2. **Energy Required to Remove Both Electrons**: The problem states that the energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV. This is the total ionization energy for the atom.\n\n3. **Ionization of a Single Electron**: When we consider the ionization of a single electron, we are removing one electron from the atom. Since the atom is in its ground state, removing one electron will leave the atom with one electron in the 1s orbital.\n\n4. **Energy Required for Single Electron Removal**: The energy required to remove one electron from the helium atom is the same as the total ionization energy required to remove both electrons. This is because the removal of one electron does not change the energy level of the remaining electron.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the energy required to ionize helium, which is to remove one electron, is 79.0 eV.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. 39.5 eV**.",
