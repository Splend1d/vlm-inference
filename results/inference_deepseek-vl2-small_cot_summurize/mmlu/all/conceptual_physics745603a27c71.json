            "content": "To determine which statements are true according to general relativity, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity.\n- According to general relativity, light is affected by gravity, but it is not slowed. Instead, it is bent or deflected. This is known as gravitational lensing. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. Light passing the Sun is deflected.\n- General relativity predicts that light passing near a massive object, such as the Sun, will be deflected due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the object's mass. This is known as gravitational lensing. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nC. A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth.\n- In general relativity, time dilation occurs when an object is in a stronger gravitational field. Since the Sun is much more massive than Earth, a clock on the Sun's surface would run slower than a clock on Earth. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. All of these.\n- Since options A and C are incorrect, option D is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Light passing the Sun is deflected.",
