            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of days it takes Kate and John to write a GRE math practice test and how their working patterns affect the total time taken.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes Kate to write the test as \\(k\\) days and the time it takes John to write the test as \\(j\\) days.\n\nWhen Kate and John work in alternating 2-day shifts, the total time taken can be expressed as:\n\\[2(k + j) = 10\\]\n\nWhen John starts, the total time taken is:\n\\[2(k + j) = 10.5\\]\n\nHowever, the first equation is the same as the second equation, which means that the total time taken when Kate starts is the same as when John starts, which is 10 days. This is because the total time taken is the sum of the time Kate takes and the time John takes, and since they work in alternating shifts, the total time is the same regardless of who starts.\n\nNow, let's find the time it takes Kate and John to write the test when they work simultaneously. When they work simultaneously, the time taken is the least common multiple (LCM) of \\(k\\) and \\(j\\).\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\\[2(k + j) = 10\\]\n\\[k + j = 5\\]\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\\[2(k + j) = 10.5\\]\n\\[k + j = 5.25\\]\n\nHowever, the second equation is not necessary to solve the problem because we already know that \\(k + j = 5\\).\n\nThe LCM of \\(k\\) and \\(j\\) is the smallest number that is a multiple of both \\(k\\) and \\(j\\). Since \\(k + j = 5\\), the LCM of \\(k\\) and \\(j\\) is 5.\n\nTherefore, it would take Kate and John 5 days to complete a practice test if they worked simultaneously.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[B\\]",
