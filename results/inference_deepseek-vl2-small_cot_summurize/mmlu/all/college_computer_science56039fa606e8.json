It is particularly useful for defining the syntax of programming languages, including the structure of expressions, statements, and control structures.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Identifier length: This characteristic refers to the maximum number of characters that an identifier can have. While this can be defined using a CFG, it is more commonly specified using a lexical analyzer or a data type definition.\n\nB. Maximum level of nesting: This characteristic refers to the maximum number of nested structures that a language can support. This is a critical aspect of a programming language's syntax, as it affects the complexity and readability of the code. A CFG can be used to define the rules for nested structures, such as loops, conditionals, and function calls.\n\nC. Operator precedence: This characteristic refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. While this can be defined using a CFG, it is more commonly specified using a precedence table or a set of rules.\n\nD. Type compatibility: This characteristic refers to the rules for combining different data types in a program. While this can be defined using a CFG, it is more commonly specified using a type system or a set of rules.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of a programming language that is best specified using a context-free grammar is the maximum level of nesting.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
