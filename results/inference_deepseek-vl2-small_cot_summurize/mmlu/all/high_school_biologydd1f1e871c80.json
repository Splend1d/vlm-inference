            "content": "To determine which concept this scenario represents, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Gene flow**: This refers to the transfer of genetic material between populations, often through migration. It does not account for the change in relative frequencies of two forms of a species due to environmental factors.\n\nB. **Natural selection**: This is the process where individuals with traits that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. This can lead to changes in population traits over time. However, natural selection typically involves changes in the frequency of traits within a population, not a shift in the relative frequencies of two distinct forms.\n\nC. **Genetic drift**: This is a mechanism of evolution that involves random changes in allele frequencies in a population. It can lead to significant shifts in allele frequencies, especially in small populations, and can result in the fixation of alleles or the loss of alleles. In the scenario described, the disproportionate death of long-finned fish leads to a change in the relative frequency of these fish, which is a classic example of genetic drift.\n\nD. **Stabilizing selection**: This type of selection favors the maintenance of the status quo, reducing variation within a population. It does not explain the shift in relative frequencies of two forms of a species.\n\nGiven the scenario, the disproportionate death of long-finned fish leads to a change in their relative frequency, which is a characteristic of genetic drift. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. genetic drift.",
