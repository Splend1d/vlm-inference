A conditional statement is structured as \"if P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.\n\nIn the given proposition:\n- The antecedent is \"The Bees win their first game only if either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games.\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Aardvarks do not win their first game.\n- This is a possible condition under which the Bees win their first game. If the Aardvarks do not win, the Bees can win.\n\nB. The Bees win their first game.\n- This is the consequent of the conditional statement. It is what happens if the antecedent is true.\n\nC. The Chipmunks do not win their first game.\n- This is another possible condition under which the Bees win their first game. If the Chipmunks do not win, the Bees can win.\n\nD. Either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games.\n- This is the condition that must be true for the Bees to win their first game. It is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the conditional proposition is \"Either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games.\"\n\nThe correct answer is D.",
