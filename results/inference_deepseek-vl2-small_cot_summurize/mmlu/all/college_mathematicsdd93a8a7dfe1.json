To maximize the number of acute angles, we want to place the vertices in such a way that as many angles as possible are less than 90 degrees.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to arrange the vertices in a regular pentagon (a 5-sided polygon) and then add two additional vertices inside the pentagon. This arrangement ensures that all angles are acute.\n\nIn this configuration, there are 5 acute angles in the pentagon and 2 additional acute angles, making a total of 7 acute angles.\n\nHowever, we can do better. We can place the two additional vertices on the sides of the pentagon, creating two more acute angles.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is 7.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ 7 \\]",
