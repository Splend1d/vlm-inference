The committee that primarily deals with the procedural aspects of the legislative process is the Rules Committee.\n\n- **A. Ways and Means**: This committee is responsible for taxing and spending legislation, but it does not primarily handle the rules for debate and amendment.\n\n- **B. Judiciary**: This committee focuses on legal matters and judicial issues, not on the procedural rules of the House.\n\n- **C. Ethics**: This committee is concerned with ethical conduct of members and does not have a role in setting the rules for legislative procedures.\n\n- **D. Rules**: The Rules Committee is tasked with establishing the procedures for the House, including the rules for debate, amendment, and the general order of business. It ensures that the legislative process is orderly and fair.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Rules**. The Rules Committee plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and efficiency of the legislative process in the House of Representatives.",
