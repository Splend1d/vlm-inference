All apartments are not bigger than some large house.**\n     - This is true because the statement asserts that no large house is bigger than any apartment.\n   - **B. No apartment is bigger than any large house.**\n     - This is not true because the statement does not assert that no apartment is bigger than any large house.\n   - **C. All large houses are not bigger than some apartment.**\n     - This is not true because the statement does not assert that all large houses are not bigger than some apartment.\n   - **D. No large house is bigger than all apartments.**\n     - This is not true because the statement does not assert that no large house is bigger than all apartments.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The best English interpretation of the given proposition is option A: \"All apartments are not bigger than some large house.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. All apartments are not bigger than some large house.",
