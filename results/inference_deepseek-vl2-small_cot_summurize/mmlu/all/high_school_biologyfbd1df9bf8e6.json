It is not related to the development of an egg without fertilization.\n\nB. **Parthenogenesis**: This is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into an offspring without fertilization. It is a process where the egg develops into a new organism, often resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent. This is the correct answer.\n\nC. **Embryogenesis**: This is the process of development from a fertilized egg to a mature organism. It involves the stages of cleavage, gastrulation, organogenesis, and other developmental processes. It does not describe the development of an egg without fertilization.\n\nD. **Vegetative propagation**: This is a method of asexual reproduction where a plant produces offspring from a part of the parent plant, such as a cutting or a seed. It is not related to the development of an egg without fertilization.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is **B. parthenogenesis**.",
