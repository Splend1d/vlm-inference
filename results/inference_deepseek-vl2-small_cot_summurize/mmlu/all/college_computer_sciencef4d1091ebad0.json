            "content": "To determine which statement is true about interrupts, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. They are generated when memory cycles are \"stolen\".\n- This statement is incorrect. Interrupts are typically generated by hardware devices, such as I/O devices, to signal the CPU that an event has occurred. Memory cycles are not \"stolen\" to generate an interrupt; rather, the CPU is interrupted by the device to handle the event.\n\nB. They are used in place of data channels.\n- This statement is incorrect. Data channels are a method of communication between devices, often used in parallel processing systems. Interrupts are a mechanism for handling events and are not used in place of data channels.\n\nC. They can indicate completion of an I/O operation.\n- This statement is correct. Interrupts are commonly used to signal the completion of an I/O operation. When an I/O device completes a task, it can generate an interrupt to notify the CPU, allowing it to process the result or handle the next task.\n\nD. They cannot be generated by arithmetic operations.\n- This statement is incorrect. While interrupts are often associated with I/O operations, they can also be generated by arithmetic operations. For example, a floating-point division operation might generate an interrupt to indicate that the result is ready.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. They can indicate completion of an I/O operation.",
