            "content": "To determine the chief cause of genetic variation among human individuals, we need to consider the mechanisms that contribute to genetic diversity.\n\nA. New mutations that occurred in the preceding generation: While mutations can introduce new genetic variations, they are relatively rare and do not account for the vast diversity observed in human populations. Mutations are random events and do not significantly contribute to the genetic variation seen in humans.\n\nB. The reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction: Sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation through the combination of alleles from two parents. This process, known as recombination, occurs during meiosis and results in offspring with unique genetic combinations. This is the primary mechanism responsible for the genetic diversity observed in humans.\n\nC. Genetic drift due to the small size of the population: Genetic drift refers to random changes in allele frequencies in a population, often due to small population sizes. While it can contribute to genetic variation, it is generally less significant than the recombination that occurs during sexual reproduction.\n\nD. Geographic variation within the population: Geographic variation can lead to differences in allele frequencies due to adaptation to different environments. However, this variation is a result of genetic drift and natural selection, rather than the primary cause of genetic variation.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the chief cause of genetic variation among human individuals is the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction. This process, through recombination, creates a wide range of genetic combinations in offspring, contributing significantly to the genetic diversity observed in human populations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.",
