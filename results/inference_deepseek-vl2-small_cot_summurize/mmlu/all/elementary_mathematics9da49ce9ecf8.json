However, if we consider the closest range to our estimate, it would be between 100 and 200, which is not an option.\n\nGiven the options, the closest range to our estimate would be between 100 and 200, but since this is not an option, we can say that the sum of 153 and 44 is between 100 and 200, but not exactly in any of the provided options. However, if we had to choose the closest option, it would be between 100 and 200, but since this is not an option, we cannot choose an option from the given choices.",
