These attacks occur when a program writes more data to a buffer (a temporary storage area in memory) than it can hold, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability has been a significant concern in the past, leading to the development of various security measures and patches.\n\nWindows NT-based systems, such as Windows 2000 and Windows XP, also had buffer-overflow vulnerabilities, but the question specifically mentions \"Old operating systems like _______ and NT-based systems.\" Since Windows 7 is not an \"old operating system\" and is not based on NT, it is not the correct answer.\n\nChrome and IOS12 are not operating systems and therefore do not have buffer-overflow vulnerabilities.",
