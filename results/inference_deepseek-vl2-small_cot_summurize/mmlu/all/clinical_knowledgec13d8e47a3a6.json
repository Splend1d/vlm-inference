            "content": "To determine the normal respiratory rate for an adult male, we need to consider the typical range of breaths per minute that is considered healthy and normal for this demographic.\n\n1. **Understanding Respiratory Rate**: The respiratory rate is the number of breaths a person takes in one minute. It is an important indicator of respiratory health.\n\n2. **Normal Range for Adult Males**: According to medical guidelines, the normal respiratory rate for an adult male is typically between 12 and 20 breaths per minute. This range accounts for variations in individual health and physical activity levels.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A (10-12 breaths per minute)**: This is below the normal range for adult males, which suggests a slower breathing rate than what is considered normal.\n   - **Option B (8-10 breaths per minute)**: This is significantly below the normal range, indicating a very slow breathing rate, which could be a sign of respiratory distress or other health issues.\n   - **Option C (20-22 breaths per minute)**: This is within the normal range for adult males, indicating a healthy and typical breathing rate.\n   - **Option D (14-16 breaths per minute)**: While this is within the normal range, it is slightly below the upper limit of the normal range, which might be considered slightly slower than the upper limit.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the normal respiratory rate for an adult male is best represented by Option C, which is 20-22 breaths per minute. This range is considered healthy and typical for adult males.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 20-22 breaths per minute**.",
