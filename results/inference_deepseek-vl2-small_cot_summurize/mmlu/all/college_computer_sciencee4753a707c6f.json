It is used to represent the syntactic structure of the code but does not specifically manage variables or their attributes.\n\nB. **Attribute Grammar**: This is a set of rules that define how attributes are applied to elements in a language. It is not a data structure but rather a set of rules.\n\nC. **Symbol Table**: This is a data structure used in compilers to store information about variables, such as their names, types, and attributes. It is crucial for the compilation process as it helps in resolving variable references and ensuring that the correct data is used.\n\nD. **Semantic Stack**: This is a data structure used in some programming languages to manage the state of a program during execution. It is not specifically used for managing variables and their attributes.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Symbol Table\n\nThe symbol table is essential in a compiler for managing variables and their attributes, ensuring that the correct data is used during the compilation process.",
