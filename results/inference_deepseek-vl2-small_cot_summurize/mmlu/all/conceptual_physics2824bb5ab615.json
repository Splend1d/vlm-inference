This is because the magnetic force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the electrons and the magnetic field. When the magnetic field changes, the direction of the force can change, thus altering the direction of the beam.\n\nB. **Energy**: Magnetic forces do not change the energy of a beam of electrons. Magnetic forces are conservative forces, meaning they do not do work on a particle and therefore do not change its kinetic energy. The energy of the beam remains constant unless an external force (like a magnetic field) does work on it.\n\nC. **Both of these**: Since magnetic forces do not change the energy of a beam of electrons, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Neither of these**: This option is incorrect because magnetic forces do change the direction of a beam of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. direction",
