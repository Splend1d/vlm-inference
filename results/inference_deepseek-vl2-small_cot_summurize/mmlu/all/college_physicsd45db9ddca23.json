            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the work done by the brakes to stop the elevator. The work done by the brakes is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the elevator.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the elevator is 0 J (since it starts from rest). The final kinetic energy of the elevator is also 0 J (since it comes to rest). Therefore, the work done by the brakes is equal to the change in kinetic energy, which is 0 J.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. The problem states that the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest. This means that the initial kinetic energy of the elevator is not 0 J, but rather 1/2 mv^2, where m is the mass of the elevator and v is its initial velocity.\n\nThe initial velocity of the elevator can be calculated using the equation v = sqrt(2gh), where g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the height of the elevator.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m) = sqrt(196) = 14 m/s\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the elevator is:\n\nKE_initial = 1/2 mv^2 = 1/2 * 1000 kg * (14 m/s)^2 = 98000 J\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the elevator is 0 J. Therefore, the work done by the brakes is equal to the change in kinetic energy, which is:\n\nW = KE_final - KE_initial = 0 J - 98000 J = -98000 J\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer. The problem states that the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is 1,000 J. This means that the work done by the brakes is equal to the heat that the brakes must dissipate, which is 1,000 J.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1,000 J",
