            "content": "To determine where the maximum electric stress occurs on a long, smooth, round conductor above a large conducting plane, we need to consider the electric field distribution and the nature of the conductor.\n\n1. **Electric Field Distribution**:\n   - The electric field lines are perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.\n   - The electric field lines are denser near the conductor and become less dense as they move away from the conductor.\n\n2. **Conductor's Surface**:\n   - The electric field lines are perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.\n   - The electric field lines are denser on the surface of the conductor because the field lines are more concentrated near the conductor.\n\n3. **Ground Surface**:\n   - The ground is a large conducting plane, which means it is at a potential of zero.\n   - The electric field lines do not penetrate the ground, so the electric field is zero on the ground surface.\n\n4. **Midway Between the Conductor and Ground**:\n   - The electric field lines are not perpendicular to the midpoint between the conductor and the ground.\n   - The electric field lines are not as dense as on the surface of the conductor.\n\nGiven these considerations, the electric field is most concentrated on the surface of the conductor. Therefore, the maximum electric stress occurs at the upper surface of the conductor.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. upper surface of the conductor.",
