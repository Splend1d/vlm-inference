            "content": "Zero population growth (ZPG) is achieved when the number of people in a population is stable and does not change over time. This typically occurs when the number of births equals the number of deaths, and the number of immigrants equals the number of emigrants.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. CBR \u2013 CDR 5 2.\n- CBR (Crude Birth Rate) and CDR (Crude Death Rate) are measures of birth and death rates, respectively. While these rates are important for understanding population dynamics, they do not directly describe the balance needed for ZPG.\n\nB. Births 1 immigration 5 deaths 1 emigration.\n- This option suggests a scenario where the number of births is equal to the number of deaths, and the number of immigrants is equal to the number of emigrants. This perfectly describes the conditions for ZPG, where the population size remains constant.\n\nC. Total fertility 5 3.\n- Total fertility rate (TFR) is the average number of children a woman would have over her lifetime. A TFR of 3 is considered the replacement level, meaning it would keep the population size stable if there are no other factors affecting it. However, this does not directly describe the balance of births and deaths.\n\nD. Replacement fertility is achieved.\n- Replacement fertility is the level of fertility required to replace the current population size without migration. While it is a necessary condition for ZPG, it does not directly describe the balance of births and deaths.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Births 1 immigration 5 deaths 1 emigration.",
