            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Extravasation: This refers to the leakage of medication or fluid from the vein into the surrounding tissues. This can cause tissue damage, pain, and potentially lead to complications such as tissue necrosis or ulcers. Extravasation is a common complication of IV therapy, especially when medications are vesicants (irritant) or when the IV line is not properly secured.\n\nB. Phlebitis: This is inflammation of the vein, often caused by the introduction of foreign substances or by the use of IV lines. While phlebitis can cause pain and redness, it does not specifically describe leakage into surrounding tissues.\n\nC. Inflammation: This is a general term for the body's response to injury or infection, which can occur in various parts of the body. It does not specifically describe the leakage of medication or fluid into surrounding tissues.\n\nD. Infiltration: This refers to the entry of medication or fluid into the surrounding tissues, but it does not specifically describe the leakage of vesicant medication or fluid into surrounding tissues.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is A. Extravasation, as it specifically describes the leakage of vesicant medication or fluid into surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage.",
