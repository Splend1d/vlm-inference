Monitoring urine output helps assess kidney function and fluid balance.\n\nB. **Temperature**: While temperature is an important parameter in any medical setting, it is not specifically a neurological observation. However, it is often monitored in neurological patients to assess infection or other systemic issues.\n\nC. **Central venous pressure (CVP)**: This parameter is used to assess the pressure in the central venous system, which can provide information about fluid status and cardiac function. It is commonly measured in neurological patients, especially those with suspected or confirmed intracranial pressure changes.\n\nD. **Blood glucose**: This parameter is important in neurological care, particularly in patients with diabetes or those who are at risk for hypoglycemia. Monitoring blood glucose levels helps in managing diabetes and preventing complications.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the parameters that are typically seen on neurological observation charts are:\n\n- **A. Urine output**\n- **C. Central venous pressure**\n- **D. Blood glucose**\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A, C, and D.",
