Since \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11, \\(2x + 3y\\) must also be divisible by 11.\n\nB. \\(x + y + 5\\)\n\nThis option does not depend on \\(3x + 7y\\).\n\nC. \\(9x + 4y\\)\n\nWe can rewrite this as \\(9(3x + 7y) - 23y\\). Since \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11, \\(9(3x + 7y)\\) is also divisible by 11. However, \\(-23y\\) is not necessarily divisible by 11.\n\nD. \\(4x - 9y\\)\n\nWe can rewrite this as \\(4(3x + 7y) - 23y\\). Since \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11, \\(4(3x + 7y)\\) is also divisible by 11. However, \\(-23y\\) is not necessarily divisible by 11.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that option A is the only one that must be divisible by 11.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\text{A} \\]",
