The dead zones result from the rapid growth of photosynthetic phytoplankton (algal blooms) and their subsequent decay by oxygen-depleting microbes in the water column. Which of the following factors most likely triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones?\n\nA. A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice\nB. Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months\nC. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\nD. Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months\n",

            "content": "To determine which factor most likely triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones, we need to consider the environmental conditions that promote the growth of phytoplankton and the subsequent oxygen depletion.\n\nA. A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice: This option suggests a reduction in light, which could potentially limit phytoplankton growth. However, phytoplankton typically thrive in low-light conditions, so this is not a likely trigger for blooms.\n\nB. Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months: While predation can influence phytoplankton populations, it is not a primary cause of algal blooms. The blooms are more directly related to nutrient availability.\n\nC. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus: This option is the most plausible. The Mississippi River and its tributaries carry significant amounts of agricultural runoff, which includes fertilizers. These nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, stimulate the rapid growth of phytoplankton. When these phytoplankton die and decompose, they consume oxygen, leading to hypoxic conditions and the formation of dead zones.\n\nD. Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months: While competition can affect phytoplankton populations, it is not a primary cause of the blooms. The blooms are more directly related to nutrient availability.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most likely factor that triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones is:\n\nC. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus.",
