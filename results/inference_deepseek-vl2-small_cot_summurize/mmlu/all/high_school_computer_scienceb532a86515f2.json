            "content": "The correct answer is C. max(list).\n\nIn Python 3, the `max()` function is used to find the maximum value in a list. It takes a list as an argument and returns the maximum value.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nmy_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\nmax_value = max(my_list)\nprint(max_value)  # Output: 9\n```\nThe `max()` function is a built-in function in Python, so you don't need to define it yourself.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. `cmp(list)` is not a valid function in Python 3. The `cmp()` function was used in older versions of Python, but it's no longer supported.\n\nB. `len(list)` returns the length of the list, not the maximum value.\n\nD. `min(list)` returns the minimum value in the list, not the maximum value.\n\nI hope this helps!
