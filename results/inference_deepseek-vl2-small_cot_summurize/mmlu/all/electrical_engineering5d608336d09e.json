The address bus cycle is responsible for fetching instructions and data from memory, while the data bus cycle is responsible for transferring data between the processor and memory.\n\nThe wait state is a period of time during which the processor is idle and waiting for the bus to be available for data transfer. The wait state is inserted between the address bus cycle and the data bus cycle to allow the processor to wait for the bus to be available for data transfer.\n\nTherefore, the wait state is always inserted between the address bus cycle and the data bus cycle, which corresponds to option B.
