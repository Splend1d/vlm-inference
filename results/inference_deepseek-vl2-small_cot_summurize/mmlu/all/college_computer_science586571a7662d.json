These variables are used within the recursive calls to store intermediate results or maintain state. The presence of local variables does not affect the termination guarantee of the procedure. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement II: \\( P \\) has an execution path where it does not call itself.**\n\nA recursive procedure must call itself to make progress in its computation. If \\( P \\) did not call itself, it would not be a recursive procedure. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement III: \\( P \\) either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.**\n\nRecursive procedures typically need to access global variables or parameters to perform their computations. If \\( P \\) did not refer to a global variable or parameter, it would not be able to make progress in its computation. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true for a recursive procedure \\( P \\) that is guaranteed to terminate is Statement III.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
