            "content": "To determine which statement is correct, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cells.\n- This statement is incorrect. Meiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in four genetically unique haploid cells from a diploid parent cell. Each daughter cell is genetically distinct from the parent cell.\n\nB. Homologues pair during prophase II.\n- This statement is correct. During prophase II of meiosis, homologous chromosomes (chromosomes that have the same genes at the same loci) pair up in a process called synapsis. This pairing is crucial for the subsequent separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase II.\n\nC. DNA replication occurs before meiosis I and meiosis II.\n- This statement is incorrect. DNA replication occurs only once, before the cell enters meiosis. Meiosis itself does not involve DNA replication; instead, it involves two rounds of cell division that result in the production of haploid cells.\n\nD. The number of chromosomes is reduced.\n- This statement is correct. Meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in haploid cells. This reduction is essential for sexual reproduction, as it ensures that the resulting gametes (sperm and egg cells) have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are B and D.",
