It includes:\n\n- **Values of local variables**: These are the variables that are declared within the subroutine and are used during its execution.\n- **A heap area**: This is not part of the activation record frame. The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, which is managed separately from the stack.\n- **The return address**: This is the memory address that the subroutine will return to after execution.\n- **Stack pointer for the calling activation record**: This indicates the current position in the stack for the subroutine that called the current one.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A heap area\n\nThe activation record frame is specifically designed to manage the stack, not the heap. The heap is a separate memory area used for dynamic memory allocation, which is not part of the activation record frame.",
