            "content": "To determine which substance is permeable to the descending loop of Henle, we need to understand the function and structure of this part of the nephron.\n\nThe nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, and it is responsible for filtering blood and forming urine. It consists of several parts, including the glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct.\n\nThe descending loop of Henle is a U-shaped structure that extends into the medulla of the kidney. It plays a crucial role in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The descending loop of Henle is permeable to water but not to ions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Na+: Sodium ions are not permeable to the descending loop of Henle. The loop is impermeable to Na+ ions, which is why the concentration of Na+ in the medulla is higher than in the cortex.\n\nB. H2O: The descending loop of Henle is permeable to water. This permeability allows water to move down its concentration gradient, which is essential for the kidney's ability to concentrate urine.\n\nC. K+: Potassium ions are not permeable to the descending loop of Henle. The loop is impermeable to K+ ions, which is why the concentration of K+ in the medulla is higher than in the cortex.\n\nD. Cl-: Chloride ions are not permeable to the descending loop of Henle. The loop is impermeable to Cl- ions, which is why the concentration of Cl- in the medulla is higher than in the cortex.\n\nBased on this analysis, the descending loop of Henle is permeable to water (H2O). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. H2O",
