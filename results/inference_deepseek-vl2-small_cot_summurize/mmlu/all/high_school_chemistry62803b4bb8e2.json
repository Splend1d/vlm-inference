Which is the best reason for the large difference in boiling points?\n\nA. Bromine is a liquid and boils; iodine is a solid and sublimes.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in I2 are much weaker than those in Br2.\nC. The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of iodine is much greater than the mass of bromine.\n",

            "content": "To determine the best reason for the large difference in boiling points between bromine and iodine, we need to consider the factors that influence boiling points, particularly intermolecular forces.\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid. While this is true, it does not explain the difference in boiling points. The state of matter does not directly determine boiling points.\n\n- **Option B**: This option suggests that the intramolecular bonds in I2 are weaker than those in Br2. This is incorrect because the boiling point is determined by intermolecular forces, not intramolecular forces.\n\n- **Option C**: This option suggests that the electron clouds of I2 are more polarizable than those of Br2, leading to stronger London dispersion forces. This is the correct explanation. London dispersion forces are the primary intermolecular forces in non-polar molecules like I2 and Br2. The larger size of iodine's electron cloud makes it more polarizable, resulting in stronger London forces and thus a higher boiling point.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the mass of iodine is greater than that of bromine. While this is true, it does not explain the difference in boiling points. The boiling point is more related to the strength of intermolecular forces than the mass of the molecule.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the best reason for the large difference in boiling points between bromine and iodine is **Option C**: The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.",
