It is not programmable after manufacturing.\n\nB. PROM (Programmable ROM) - This is the correct answer. PROMs are programmable ROMs where the data is burned into the chip during the manufacturing process. Once programmed, the data cannot be changed.\n\nC. EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) - EPROMs can be erased and reprogrammed using ultraviolet light. They are not programmed during the manufacturing process.\n\nD. EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM) - EEPROMs can be erased and reprogrammed electrically. They are not programmed during the manufacturing process.\n\nSo, the ROM programmed during the manufacturing process itself is called PROM.",
