The residential areas are typically organized in a radial pattern, with streets radiating outward from the center. This pattern is influenced by historical urban planning and the presence of a central boulevard or main street.\n\nB. **Muslim**: Muslim cities, particularly those influenced by Islamic architecture and urban planning, often have a more grid-like structure with a central mosque or religious site. The residential areas may not necessarily follow a distinct spine pattern along a main boulevard.\n\nC. **Sub-Saharan African**: Sub-Saharan African cities often have a more informal and less structured layout, with residential areas spread out in a less organized manner. There is no distinct residential spine along a main boulevard.\n\nD. **Latin American**: Latin American cities can have a mix of urban planning styles, but they often do not have a distinct residential spine along a main boulevard. The layout tends to be more organic and less structured.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
