Boundaryless, Control information, Public spaces.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Boundless: Corporations are often seen as having no clear boundaries, meaning they can operate in various areas and have a wide range of activities. This makes it difficult to define their limits.\n\n- Control information: With the rise of digital technology, corporations have access to vast amounts of personal data. This makes it challenging to control and manage information, especially when it comes to maintaining individual privacy.\n\n- Public spaces: Many corporate activities, such as marketing, advertising, and public relations, take place in public spaces. This can make it difficult to maintain individual privacy, as these activities often involve collecting and using personal data in public settings.",
