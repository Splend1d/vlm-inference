The snubber circuit can be connected in either series or parallel with the thyristor.\n\n- **Series Snubber**: The snubber is connected in series with the thyristor. This configuration is used to protect the thyristor from voltage spikes that occur when the thyristor is switching off. The series snubber helps to reduce the voltage across the thyristor and prevents damage.\n\n- **Parallel Snubber**: The snubber is connected in parallel with the thyristor. This configuration is used to protect the thyristor from voltage surges that occur when the thyristor is switching on. The parallel snubber helps to reduce the voltage across the thyristor and prevents damage.\n\nBoth series and parallel snubber configurations are effective in protecting the thyristor from voltage spikes and surges, depending on the specific application and the type of thyristor being used.",
