            "content": "To determine the concentrations of the ions in the solution, we need to consider the equilibrium reactions of sulfurous acid (H2SO3) in water.\n\n1. **Dissociation of H2SO3**:\n   - H2SO3 can dissociate into H+ and HSO3- ions in water.\n   - The dissociation reaction is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3 \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+ + \\text{HSO}_3^-\n     \\]\n\n2. **Equilibrium Constant (K_a)**:\n   - The equilibrium constant for the dissociation of H2SO3 is given by:\n     \\[\n     K_a = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{HSO}_3^-]}{[\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3]}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Equilibrium Expression**:\n   - At equilibrium, the concentrations of the ions are:\n     \\[\n     [\\text{H}^+] = [\\text{HSO}_3^-] = K_a \\cdot [\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3]\n     \\]\n\n4. **Concentration Relationships**:\n   - Since \\( K_a \\) is a constant, the concentrations of H+ and HSO3- are equal.\n   - Therefore, the relationship between the concentrations of H2SO3, HSO3-, and H+ is:\n     \\[\n     [\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3] = [\\text{HSO}_3^-] = [\\text{H}^+]\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The concentrations of the ions are equal:\n     \\[\n     [\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3] = [\\text{HSO}_3^-] = [\\text{H}^+]\n     \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
