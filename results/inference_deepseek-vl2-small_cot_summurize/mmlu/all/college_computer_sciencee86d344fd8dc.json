            "content": "To determine which option best characterizes memory-mapped I/O, let's analyze each choice:\n\nA. The computer provides special instructions for manipulating I/O ports.\n- This option suggests that the computer has specific instructions for handling I/O operations, which is not characteristic of memory-mapped I/O. Memory-mapped I/O does not require special instructions; it simply maps I/O ports to memory addresses.\n\nB. I/O ports are placed at addresses on the bus and are accessed just like other memory locations.\n- This option accurately describes memory-mapped I/O. In this method, I/O ports are mapped to memory addresses, allowing them to be accessed using standard memory addressing techniques. This is the defining feature of memory-mapped I/O.\n\nC. To perform an I/O operation, it is sufficient to place the data in an address register and call the channel to perform the operation.\n- This option describes a more direct approach to I/O operations, often used in direct memory access (DMA) systems, where data is directly transferred between memory and I/O devices without involving the CPU. This is not characteristic of memory-mapped I/O.\n\nD. Ports are referenced only by memory-mapped instructions of the computer and are located at hardwired memory locations.\n- This option incorrectly suggests that I/O ports are hardwired to memory locations. Memory-mapped I/O does not involve hardwiring; it simply maps I/O ports to memory addresses.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. I/O ports are placed at addresses on the bus and are accessed just like other memory locations.",
