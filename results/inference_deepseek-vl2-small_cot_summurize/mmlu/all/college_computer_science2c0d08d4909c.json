This means that each node has at most two children, and all nodes are either leaves or have two children.\n\nGiven that for any tree in the class, the ratio of the lengths of any two root-to-leaf paths is bounded above by \\(c\\), we can infer that the tree is not a balanced tree. In a balanced tree, the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes, i.e., \\(h \\leq \\log_2(N)\\). However, in a strictly binary tree, the height can be much larger than \\(\\log_2(N)\\).\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. \\(h \\leq \\log_2(N)\\): This is true for balanced trees, but not for strictly binary trees.\n\nB. \\(h = \\frac{1}{c} \\cdot \\log_2(N)\\): This option suggests that the height of the tree is inversely proportional to \\(c\\), which is not necessarily true.\n\nC. \\(h < c \\cdot \\log_2(N)\\): This option suggests that the height of the tree is less than a constant multiple of the logarithm of the number of nodes. This is possible, but it does not necessarily characterize the height of any tree in the class.\n\nD. \\(h > c \\cdot \\log_2(N)\\): This option suggests that the height of the tree is greater than a constant multiple of the logarithm of the number of nodes. This is a more general statement that could potentially characterize the height of any tree in the class.\n\nGiven the information provided, option D is the most general and could potentially characterize the height of any tree in the class. However, without more specific information about the class of strictly binary trees, we cannot definitively say that \\(h > c \\cdot \\log_2(N)\\) is true for all trees in the class.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nD. \\(h > c \\cdot \\log_2(N)\\)",
