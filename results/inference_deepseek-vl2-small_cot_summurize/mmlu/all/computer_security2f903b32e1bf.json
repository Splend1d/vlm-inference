Message Condentiality.\n\nMessage Condentiality is a property of a communication system that ensures that the data sent by the sender is exactly the same as the data received by the receiver. This means that the data is not altered or corrupted during transmission. If the data is modified in any way, it is considered a violation of message confidentiality.\n\nMessage Integrity is a related concept that ensures that the data has not been altered or corrupted during transmission. However, message integrity does not guarantee that the data is confidential, as it does not prevent the data from being modified.\n\nMessage Splashing is a technique used to prevent message integrity attacks by adding random noise to the data before transmission. This makes it difficult for an attacker to modify the data without being detected.\n\nMessage Sending is not a property of a communication system, but rather a process of transmitting data from the sender to the receiver.",
