This can lead to a loss of purchasing power for the creditors, as the value of the money they receive in the future is reduced. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nB. **Hurts creditors who anticipate it.**\n   - If creditors anticipate inflation, they can adjust their expectations and their contracts to protect their purchasing power. For example, they might demand higher interest rates or other forms of compensation to account for the expected inflation. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. **Hurts debtors.**\n   - Debtors benefit from inflation because they repay their debts with money that is worth less in the future. This means they effectively pay back their debts with cheaper money, reducing the real value of their debt. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. **Both A and D are correct.**\n   - Since option C is incorrect, this option is also incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Hurts creditors who do not anticipate it.",
