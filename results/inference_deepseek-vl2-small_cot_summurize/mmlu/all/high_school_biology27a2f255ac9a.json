            "content": "To determine the Darwinian fitness of an individual, we need to understand the concept of fitness in the context of natural selection. Darwinian fitness refers to an individual's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. The more offspring an individual has, the more opportunities it has to pass on its genes to the next generation. Therefore, the number of offspring that survive to reproduce is a direct measure of an individual's fitness.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The number of its offspring that survive to reproduce.\n- This option directly relates to Darwinian fitness because the primary goal of an individual is to pass on its genes. The more offspring an individual has, the more likely it is to have some of them survive to reproduce, thus increasing the likelihood of passing on its genes.\n\nB. The number of \"good genes\" it possesses.\n- While having \"good genes\" can contribute to an individual's fitness, it is not a direct measure. Fitness is more about the ability to survive and reproduce, not just the genetic makeup.\n\nC. The number of mates it attracts.\n- The number of mates an individual attracts can influence its reproductive success, but it is not a direct measure of fitness. Fitness is about the survival and reproduction of offspring, not just the number of mates.\n\nD. Its physical strength.\n- Physical strength can be an advantage in certain environments, but it is not a direct measure of fitness. Fitness is about reproductive success, not just physical prowess.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the number of its offspring that survive to reproduce.",
