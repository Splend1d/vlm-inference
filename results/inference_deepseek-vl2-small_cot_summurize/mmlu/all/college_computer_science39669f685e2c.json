This allows for constant-time lookups to determine the number of distinct values.\n\nB. **Dynamic dictionary**: A hash table can efficiently support the operations of insert, delete, and search in a dictionary. Each operation can be performed in constant time by using the hash function to find the correct index for insertion, deletion, or search.\n\nC. **Range search**: A hash table is not suitable for range search because it requires a linear search to check each key in the table. This is because a hash table's primary advantage is its ability to provide constant-time lookups, which is not possible for range searches.\n\nD. **Symbol table lookup**: A hash table can efficiently solve this problem by using a hash function to map a program identifier to its type and address. This allows for constant-time lookups.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem that cannot be efficiently solved using a hash table is:\n\nC. Range search.",
