The bank is considering two options: a single line where the customer at the front waits for the next available teller, or separate lines for each teller. The bank decides to use a computer simulation of these two options to determine the average wait time for customers. Which of the following is NOT true about the bank's plan?\n\nA. The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.\nB. The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.\nC. The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.\nD.

This plan is designed to help the bank make an informed decision about which option to implement.\n\nA. The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.\n- This statement is true. The bank can indeed incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, into the simulation to get a more accurate picture of how each option would perform under different conditions.\n\nB. The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.\n- This statement is also true. The bank can use the simulation to investigate the two options without causing inconvenience to customers, as the simulation will not involve actual customers but rather a computer model.\n\nC. The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.\n- This statement is true. The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results, as the simulation can provide insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option.\n\nD. The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.\n- This statement is NOT true. The simulation does not require actual customer data to produce usable results. The simulation can use hypothetical data to model the behavior of customers and the performance of the tellers, allowing the bank to make an informed decision without needing real customer data.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true about the bank's plan is D. The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.",
