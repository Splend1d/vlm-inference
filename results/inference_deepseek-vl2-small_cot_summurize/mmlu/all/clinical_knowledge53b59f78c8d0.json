            "content": "To determine the most likely cause of acute urinary retention, we need to consider the mechanisms involved in urinary retention. Acute urinary retention occurs when a person is unable to urinate despite a full bladder. This condition can be caused by several factors, including anatomical, neurological, or external factors.\n\nA. Haematuria: This refers to the presence of blood in the urine. While haematuria can be a symptom of underlying conditions, it is not typically the primary cause of acute urinary retention.\n\nB. Bladder outflow obstruction: This is the most common cause of acute urinary retention. An obstruction in the urinary tract, such as a stricture, tumor, or bladder stones, prevents urine from flowing out of the bladder. This can be due to anatomical issues like a stricture in the urethra or bladder neck, or external factors like a tumor pressing on the bladder.\n\nC. Drinking alcohol: While alcohol consumption can affect bladder function and lead to urinary retention, it is not the most common cause. Alcohol can relax the bladder muscles, making it harder to urinate, but it is not typically the primary cause of acute retention.\n\nD. Kidney stones: Kidney stones can cause pain and discomfort, leading to retention of urine as a protective mechanism. However, they are not the most common cause of acute urinary retention.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the most likely cause of acute urinary retention is:\n\nB. Bladder outflow obstruction.",
