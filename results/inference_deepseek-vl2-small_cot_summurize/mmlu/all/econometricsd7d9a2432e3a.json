It is the variable that the model attempts to predict based on other variables.\n\n2. **The Regressand**: This term is not commonly used in the context of linear regression. It is not a standard term in statistical literature.\n\n3. **The Causal Variable**: In some contexts, the independent variable can be referred to as the \"causal variable.\" This term is used when the variable is believed to have a causal effect on the dependent variable. However, in the context of linear regression, it is more common to use the term \"regressor.\"\n\n4. **The Effect Variable**: This term is not typically used in the context of linear regression. It is more commonly used in other statistical contexts, such as in experimental design, where it refers to the variable that is being manipulated or measured.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nThe independent variable in linear regression is most commonly referred to as the \"regressor,\" and in some contexts, it is also called the \"causal variable.\" The term \"effect variable\" is not commonly used in this context.",
