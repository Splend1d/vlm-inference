            "content": "To understand the effects of contractionary fiscal policy on domestic interest rates and the international value of the dollar, we need to analyze the mechanisms involved:\n\n1. **Contractionary Fiscal Policy**: This involves reducing government spending or increasing taxes to decrease the budget deficit and control inflation. The goal is to slow down economic growth and reduce inflationary pressures.\n\n2. **Impact on Domestic Interest Rates**:\n   - **Reduction in Government Spending**: When the government reduces its spending, it decreases the demand for funds in the financial markets.\n   - **Increase in Savings**: With less government borrowing, there is an increase in savings as individuals and businesses have more funds available.\n   - **Higher Savings Rate**: The higher savings rate leads to an increase in the supply of loanable funds.\n   - **Interest Rate Increase**: With more funds available and less demand, interest rates tend to rise as lenders can charge higher rates to borrowers.\n\n3. **Impact on the International Value of the Dollar**:\n   - **Higher Interest Rates**: Higher domestic interest rates attract foreign capital as investors seek higher returns.\n   - **Increased Demand for Dollars**: The inflow of foreign capital increases the demand for dollars, leading to an appreciation of the dollar.\n   - **Currency Appreciation**: A stronger dollar makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, potentially reducing net exports.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Interest rates increase and the dollar appreciates.",
