Inside the red blood cells: While some free fatty acids can be stored in red blood cells, the majority of free fatty acids are not stored inside them. Instead, they are transported in the bloodstream.\n\nB. As lipoproteins: This is the correct answer. Lipoproteins are complexes of lipids and proteins that transport lipids, including free fatty acids, through the bloodstream. They are essential for the distribution of lipids to various tissues and organs.\n\nC. Combined with glucose: While some lipids can be combined with glucose to form triglycerides, this is not the primary method of transporting free fatty acids in the blood.\n\nD. Bound to albumin: Albumin is a protein that binds to various substances in the blood, including hormones and drugs. However, it does not primarily transport free fatty acids.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. As lipoproteins.",
