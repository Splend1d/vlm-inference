It articulates with the femur above and the tibia below.\n\n2. **Ischium**: The ischium is a part of the pelvis, specifically the lower portion. It is located posteriorly and inferiorly in the pelvic region.\n\n3. **Femur**: The femur is the thigh bone and is the longest bone in the human body. It is located above the patella and articulates with the tibia and patella below.\n\n4. **Symphysis pubis**: The symphysis pubis is a cartilaginous joint located at the front of the pelvis, connecting the two pubic bones. It is not directly superior to the patella or inferior to the ischium.\n\n5. **Tibia**: The tibia is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the lower leg, located below the patella and articulating with the femur above and the talus below.\n\nGiven this information, the bone that is superior to the patella and inferior to the ischium is the femur.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
