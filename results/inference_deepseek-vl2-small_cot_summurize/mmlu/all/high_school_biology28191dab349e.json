A species is a larger unit that includes multiple populations. Therefore, natural selection cannot directly change a species' gene frequency.\n\nB. **A population's gene frequency**: Natural selection can affect the frequency of alleles within a population. This is because natural selection can lead to changes in allele frequencies over time, influencing the genetic makeup of the population.\n\nC. **An individual's genome**: A genome is the complete set of genetic material in an individual. Natural selection cannot directly alter an individual's genome, as it acts on the genetic material within populations.\n\nD. **An individual's genotype**: A genotype refers to the specific genetic makeup of an individual, including the alleles present. Natural selection can influence an individual's genotype by favoring certain alleles over others, but it cannot change the genotype itself.\n\nBy examining each option, we see that natural selection can directly affect the gene frequency within a population. Therefore, the smallest unit that natural selection can change is:\n\nB. a population's gene frequency.",
