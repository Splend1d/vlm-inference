All of these\n\nExplanation:\n- **Internal Reflection**: This occurs when light bounces off the inner surface of a raindrop.\n- **Dispersion**: This is the bending of light as it passes through the raindrop, causing different colors to spread out.\n- **Refraction**: This is the bending of light as it passes through the raindrop, causing the light to change direction.\n\nAll these processes occur together to create a rainbow.",
