            "content": "The major difference between cartilage and bone is that cartilage lacks blood vessels and nerves.\n\nCartilage is a flexible connective tissue that provides support and flexibility to various parts of the body, such as the nose, trachea, and ends of long bones. It is composed of a matrix of collagen fibers and proteoglycans, which give it its characteristic resilience and ability to withstand compressive forces. However, cartilage does not have blood vessels or nerves, which means it does not receive nutrients or sensory information directly from the bloodstream or nervous system.\n\nIn contrast, bone is a rigid connective tissue that provides structural support and protection to the body. It is composed of a matrix of collagen fibers and minerals, such as calcium and phosphate, which give it its characteristic strength and hardness. Bones also have blood vessels and nerves, which supply nutrients and sensory information to the bone tissue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. cartilage lacks blood vessels and nerves.",
