            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of heritability and how it affects the distribution of weights in a population.\n\n1. **Understanding Heritability**: Heritability refers to the proportion of variation in a trait (in this case, weight) that can be attributed to genetic factors. If a trait is highly heritable, it means that a significant portion of the variation in the trait is due to genetic differences among individuals.\n\n2. **Binomial Distribution**: The binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes (in this case, surviving individuals) in a fixed number of trials (in this case, the number of offspring). The mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution are given by:\n   - Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = \\(n \\times p\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of trials and \\(p\\) is the probability of success on each trial.\n   - Standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = \\(\\sqrt{n \\times p \\times (1-p)}\\).\n\n3. **Predicting the Next Generation**: Since the offspring of the next generation are expected to have the same mean weight as their parents, we can use the mean of the binomial distribution to predict this.\n\n4. **Calculating the Mean**: Given that the mean weight of the original population is \\(m\\), and the probability of survival for each individual is \\(p\\), the mean weight of the next generation is:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_{\\text{next}} = m \\times p\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the mean weight of the next generation is the same as the mean weight of the original population, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the same mean weight as members of the original population.",
