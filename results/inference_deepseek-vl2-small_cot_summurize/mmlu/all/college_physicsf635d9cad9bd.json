            "content": "The observed wavelength of the hydrogen lines in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 is three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. This means that the wavelength of the light from the quasar is three times the wavelength of the light from hydrogen atoms at rest.\n\nThe wavelength of light is given by the equation:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light, and f is the frequency of the light.\n\nSince the wavelength of the light from the quasar is three times the wavelength of the light from hydrogen atoms at rest, we can write:\n\n\u03bb_quasar = 3 * \u03bb_rest\n\nSubstituting the equation for wavelength, we get:\n\n\u03bb_quasar = 3 * (c / f_rest)\n\nSince the frequency of the light from the quasar is the same as the frequency of the light from hydrogen atoms at rest, we can write:\n\n\u03bb_quasar = 3 * (c / f_rest) = 3 * (\u03bb_rest / \u03bb_rest) = 3\n\nThis means that the wavelength of the light from the quasar is three times the wavelength of the light from hydrogen atoms at rest.\n\nNow, we can use the equation for the Doppler shift to find the relative speed of the quasar:\n\n\u03bb_quasar = \u03bb_rest + (v / c) * \u03bb_rest\n\nwhere v is the relative speed of the quasar and c is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n3 = \u03bb_rest + (v / c) * \u03bb_rest\n\nSince \u03bb_rest is the wavelength of the light from hydrogen atoms at rest, we can write:\n\n3 = \u03bb_rest + (v / c) * \u03bb_rest\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3 = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v / c)\n\nSince \u03bb_rest is the wavelength of the light from hydrogen atoms at rest, we can write:\n\n3 = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v / c)\n\nSubstituting the value of \u03bb_rest, we get:\n\n3 = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v / c)\n\nSince \u03bb_quasar is three times the wavelength of the light from hydrogen atoms at rest, we can write:\n\n3 = 3 * \u03bb_rest\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1 = \u03bb_rest\n\nSubstituting the value of \u03bb_rest, we get:\n\n1 = \u03bb_rest\n\nSubstituting the value of \u03bb_rest, we get:\n\n1 = 1 * (1 + v / c)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1 = 1 + v / c\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\n0 = v / c\n\nMultiplying both sides by c, we get:\n\n0 = v\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar is 0.\n\nHowever, this result is not possible, as the relative speed of the quasar cannot be 0. This means that the assumption that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is that the relative speed of the quasar is not 0, but rather a non-zero value.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c\n\nThe",
