            "content": "To determine which statement is true about diplopia, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered: This statement is incorrect. Diplopia, or double vision, can occur even if one eye is covered. This is because the brain receives input from both eyes, and if one eye is not contributing to the visual field, the brain may attempt to compensate by using the other eye, leading to diplopia.\n\nB. The outer image is always the false image: This statement is incorrect. In diplopia, the brain receives two different images from each eye, and it is the brain that determines which image is the true and which is the false image. The outer image is not always the false image; it depends on the alignment of the eyes and the brain's ability to integrate the visual information.\n\nC. A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards: This statement is incorrect. Fourth nerve palsy, also known as trochlear nerve palsy, occurs when the trochlear nerve is damaged, which can cause the eye to look downward (downgaze). It is not associated with looking upwards.\n\nD. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint: This statement is correct. Sixth nerve palsy, or abducens nerve palsy, occurs when the abducens nerve is damaged, which can cause the affected eye to deviate outward (abduct) when looking straight ahead. This is known as a divergent squint.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.",
