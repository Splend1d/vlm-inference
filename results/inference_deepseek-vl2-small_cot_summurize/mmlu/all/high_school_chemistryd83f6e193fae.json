            "content": "To determine which gas is most likely to effuse through a pinhole 5.33 times faster than an unknown gas, we need to consider the molecular weights and sizes of the gases.\n\n1. **Molecular Weight and Size**:\n   - **Helium (He)**: Helium is a noble gas with a molecular weight of approximately 4.00 g/mol. It is a small, light gas.\n   - **CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)**: CO2 has a molecular weight of approximately 44.01 g/mol. It is a larger, heavier gas.\n   - **CH4 (Methane)**: CH4 has a molecular weight of approximately 16.04 g/mol. It is a smaller, lighter gas.\n   - **C5H12 (Pentane)**: C5H12 has a molecular weight of approximately 70.16 g/mol. It is a larger, heavier gas.\n   - **C8H18 (Octane)**: C8H18 has a molecular weight of approximately 106.21 g/mol. It is a larger, heavier gas.\n\n2. **Effusion Rate**:\n   - The rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight. This means that lighter gases effuse faster than heavier gases.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Helium effuses 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas.\n   - Since helium is the lightest gas, the unknown gas must be heavier than helium but lighter than the other gases listed.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Among the given options, CH4 (Methane) has a molecular weight of approximately 16.04 g/mol, which is lighter than the other gases listed.\n   - Therefore, CH4 is the most likely gas to effuse through a pinhole 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
