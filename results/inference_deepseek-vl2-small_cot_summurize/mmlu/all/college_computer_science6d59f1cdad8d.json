            "content": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. If A is finite, then B is finite.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A set of words can be finite, but it can also be infinite. For example, consider the set A = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z} and B = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z}. Both A and B are finite, but B is a subset of A.\n\nII. If A is regular, then B is regular.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A regular set is a set of words that can be recognized by a finite automaton. A set of words can be regular, but it can also be non-regular. For example, consider the set A = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z} and B = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z}. Both A and B are regular, but B is a subset of A.\n\nIII. If A is context-free, then B is context-free.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A context-free set is a set of words that can be generated by a context-free grammar. A set of words can be context-free, but it can also be non-context-free. For example, consider the set A = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z} and B = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z}. Both A and B are context-free, but B is a subset of A.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements must always be true of A and B. The correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{A}$",
