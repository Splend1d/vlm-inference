            "content": "To find the number of rolls of paper towels, \\( t \\), Mr. Kelly should put into each room, we can use the division method. The number sentence that shows this is:\n\n\\[ 12 \\div t = 4 \\]\n\nThis means that 12 rolls of paper towels are divided equally into 4 rooms, so each room gets:\n\n\\[ 12 \\div 4 = 3 \\]\n\nrolls of paper towels.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options:\n\nA. \\( 4 \\div 12 = t \\)\nThis is not correct because it would mean that 4 rolls of paper towels are divided equally into 12 rooms, which doesn't make sense.\n\nB. \\( 4 - t = 12 \\)\nThis is not correct because it doesn't involve division or equal distribution.\n\nC. \\( 4 + 12 = t \\)\nThis is not correct because it doesn't involve division or equal distribution.\n\nD. \\( 4 \\times t = 12 \\)\nThis is not correct because it involves multiplication, not division.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ 12 \\div t = 4 \\]",
