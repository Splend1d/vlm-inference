It occurs when there is a downturn in the economy, leading to reduced demand for goods and services, and thus, fewer jobs. Theo losing his job at the public swimming pool is not directly related to economic cycles.\n\nB. **Discouraged worker**: This term refers to individuals who have stopped looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. Theo losing his job is not about his personal belief in the lack of job opportunities.\n\nC. **Seasonal unemployment**: This occurs when there is a temporary reduction in the demand for labor due to seasonal changes. Public swimming pools typically close during the winter months, leading to a temporary loss of jobs for pool staff. Theo losing his job at the public swimming pool is directly related to the seasonal closure of the pool.\n\nD. **Frictional unemployment**: This type of unemployment occurs when people are temporarily between jobs or are entering the workforce for the first time. Theo losing his job is not due to a temporary transition in his employment status.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. **Seasonal unemployment**.",
