Evolution is a gradual process that occurs over a long period of time.\n- This principle is indeed part of Darwin's theory. He proposed that evolution is a slow and continuous process that occurs over many generations.\n\nB. Every population has tremendous variation.\n- This is another key principle of Darwin's theory. He observed that populations are not uniform and contain a wide range of traits, which is essential for natural selection to act upon.\n\nC. Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population.\n- This statement is incorrect. While mutations do contribute to variation, they are not the sole source. Natural selection acts on existing variations, and mutations are just one of the mechanisms that introduce new variations.\n\nD. Organisms will overpopulate area, giving rise to competition.\n- This principle is also part of Darwin's theory. He noted that populations tend to grow and compete for limited resources, which can lead to the survival of the fittest.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, it is clear that the principle that is NOT part of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is:\n\nC. Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population.",
