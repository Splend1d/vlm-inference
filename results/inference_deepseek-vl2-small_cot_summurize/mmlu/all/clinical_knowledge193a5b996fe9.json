            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Does not influence exercise performance in events lasting less than 10 minutes.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Carbohydrate intake is crucial for short-duration, high-intensity activities lasting less than 10 minutes. During these events, the body relies heavily on glycogen stores, and a low carbohydrate intake can lead to decreased performance due to insufficient energy supply.\n\nB. **Affects the resting muscle pH.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The resting muscle pH is primarily influenced by the body's buffering system and the production of lactic acid during anaerobic metabolism. Carbohydrate intake does not directly affect resting muscle pH.\n\nC. **May impair high intensity exercise performance.**\n   - This statement is correct. High-intensity exercise, especially those lasting longer than 10 minutes, requires a continuous supply of energy. Carbohydrate intake is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels, which are necessary for sustained energy production. A low carbohydrate intake can lead to decreased performance as the body may not have enough energy to support prolonged high-intensity activity.\n\nD. **Results in greater reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. A low carbohydrate intake actually leads to a greater reliance on muscle glycogen, as there is less glycogen available to be used for energy. This can result in quicker depletion of glycogen stores, leading to decreased performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. may impair high intensity exercise performance.**",
