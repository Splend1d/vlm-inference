            "content": "To determine the two major branches of Islam, we need to understand the historical and theological differences between the two main sects.\n\n1. **Understanding the Basics**: Islam is a religion founded by the Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century. It is divided into two main branches: Sunni and Shia.\n\n2. **Sunni Islam**:\n   - **Definition**: Sunni Islam is the largest branch of Islam, comprising about 85-90% of Muslims.\n   - **Beliefs**: Sunnis believe that the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali) were the rightful successors of the Prophet Muhammad. They follow the Quran and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet) as their primary sources of guidance.\n   - **Practices**: Sunnis perform their prayers in a specific direction (qibla), which is towards the Kaaba in Mecca. They also have a more inclusive approach to religious practices and traditions.\n\n3. **Shia Islam**:\n   - **Definition**: Shia Islam constitutes about 10-15% of Muslims.\n   - **Beliefs**: Shias believe that Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, was the rightful successor to the Prophet. They follow a different set of Hadiths and interpret the Quran differently.\n   - **Practices**: Shias also perform their prayers in the same direction as Sunnis but have distinct rituals and traditions, such as mourning the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet, during the month of Muharram.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, the two major branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Sunni and Shiite",
