During this phase, the cell grows and synthesizes proteins necessary for DNA replication. However, the DNA content does not double at this stage.\n\n2. **G_2 Phase**: This is the second gap phase. The cell continues to grow and prepares for mitosis. The DNA content remains the same as in the G_1 phase.\n\n3. **M Phase (Mitosis)**: This phase is divided into several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During mitosis, the cell's DNA is replicated in the S phase, and then it is divided equally between two daughter cells. Therefore, the quantity of DNA in a eukaryotic cell doubles during the M phase.\n\n4. **S Phase**: This is the synthesis phase where DNA replication occurs. The DNA content doubles, but this is not the phase where the cell cycle is completed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. M\n\nThe M phase is the phase where the cell completes DNA replication, and the quantity of DNA in a eukaryotic cell doubles.",
