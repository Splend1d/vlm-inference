It provides encryption and authentication but does not encapsulate security payloads.\n\nB. **Secure IP Protocol**: This protocol is not a standard protocol used in the context of security. It is not related to the encapsulation of security payloads.\n\nC. **Secure Http Protocol**: This protocol is a part of HTTPS, which uses SSL/TLS for encryption. It does not encapsulate security payloads.\n\nD. **Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS)**: TLS is the successor to SSL and is used to provide secure communication over a network. It encapsulates security payloads, such as IPsec packets, within its own packets. This encapsulation is what makes ESP a part of TLS.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Transport Layer Security Protocol\n\nThe Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is a component of the Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS), which is used to provide secure communication over a network by encapsulating security payloads.",
