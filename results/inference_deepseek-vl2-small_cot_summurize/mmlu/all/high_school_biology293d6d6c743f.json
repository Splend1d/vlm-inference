            "content": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Eukaryotic organelles helped create separate environments for metabolic reactions, thus increasing their metabolic efficiency.\n- This statement is correct. Eukaryotic cells contain various organelles, each with specific functions. These organelles create separate environments for different metabolic reactions, allowing for more efficient processing of nutrients and energy production. This compartmentalization is a key feature of eukaryotic cells that distinguishes them from prokaryotic cells.\n\nB. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have no structural similarities.\n- This statement is incorrect. While eukaryotic cells are more complex, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells share some structural similarities, such as a cell membrane and genetic material. However, the complexity and organization of their internal structures differ significantly.\n\nC. The organelles in larger eukaryotic cells took care of the problems of having a larger surface area\u2013to\u2013volume ratio.\n- This statement is incorrect. The larger surface area\u2013to\u2013volume ratio in eukaryotic cells is not a problem that organelles solve. Instead, organelles help manage the complexity and efficiency of cellular processes.\n\nD. Eukaryotic cells are able to multiply faster based on their more complex structure.\n- This statement is incorrect. While eukaryotic cells are more complex, they do not necessarily multiply faster than prokaryotic cells. The complexity of eukaryotic cells does not directly correlate with their rate of replication.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct statement is:\n\nA. Eukaryotic organelles helped create separate environments for metabolic reactions, thus increasing their metabolic efficiency.",
