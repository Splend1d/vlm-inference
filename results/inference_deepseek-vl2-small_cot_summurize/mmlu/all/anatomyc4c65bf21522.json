            "content": "To understand how food is prevented from entering the larynx during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, we need to consider the anatomy and function of the swallowing process.\n\n1. **Pharyngeal Phase Overview**: The pharyngeal phase is the second stage of the swallowing process, following the oral phase. During this phase, the bolus (food) is moved from the pharynx to the esophagus.\n\n2. **Role of the Epiglottis**: The epiglottis is a flap-like structure located at the top of the larynx. Its primary function is to cover the larynx during swallowing to prevent food and liquid from entering the airway.\n\n3. **Mechanism of Action**:\n   - As the bolus is pushed from the pharynx into the esophagus, the epiglottis moves upward.\n   - This upward movement is crucial because it covers the opening of the larynx, effectively blocking the passage of food into the airway.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **A. Constriction of the laryngeal entrance**: This describes the action of the epiglottis, not the larynx itself.\n   - **B. Upward movement of the epiglottis**: This is the correct mechanism that prevents food from entering the larynx.\n   - **C. Downward movement of the larynx**: This would not prevent food from entering the larynx; rather, it would allow it to pass.\n   - **D. Increase in respiratory rate**: This is unrelated to preventing food from entering the larynx.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Upward movement of the epiglottis**. This action is essential for ensuring that food and liquids are directed towards the esophagus and not the airway.",
