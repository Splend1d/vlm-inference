They are a balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments, which adds value to sustainability thinking. In industrial ecosystems, companies and industries are considered to be bound together and interdependent due to all kinds of resources and wastes. This concept is similar to ecological ecosystems, where organisms and their environments are interdependent. However, industrial ecosystems specifically focus on the interdependence of companies and industries, rather than just organisms and their environments.",
