This was set to varying levels of power. At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever. At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever. At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever. Which of the following power levels corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell?\n\nA. 80%\nB. 70%\nC. 60%\nD. Not enough information given.\n",

            "content": "The absolute threshold for hearing is the lowest level of sound intensity that can be detected by the human ear. It is the point at which the response of the ear is just above the threshold of hearing. In this case, the scientist is testing the response of genetically modified mice to different levels of sound power.\n\nThe absolute threshold is typically measured in decibels (dB) and is a logarithmic unit of measurement. The threshold is the point at which the response of the ear is just above the threshold of hearing, which is usually around 0 dB.\n\nFrom the given data, we can see that at 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever, at 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever, and at 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever. This suggests that the mice are responding to the sound at these power levels, but we don't have enough information to determine the absolute threshold.\n\nThe absolute threshold is the point at which the response of the ear is just above the threshold of hearing, which is usually around 0 dB. However, the data provided does not give us enough information to determine the exact power level at which the mice are just above the threshold of hearing. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not enough information given.",
