            "content": "To determine the correct structural unit of the principal allotropes of elemental boron, we need to understand the different allotropes of boron and their corresponding structures.\n\n1. **B12 icosahedra**: This structure is characteristic of the B12 icosahedron, which is a complex three-dimensional structure composed of 12 boron atoms arranged in an icosahedral geometry. This structure is not the simplest form of boron allotropes.\n\n2. **B8 cubes**: The B8 cube is a simple cubic structure where each boron atom is bonded to eight neighboring boron atoms, forming a cube. This is a well-known structure for boron, particularly in the form of boron nitride (BN).\n\n3. **B6 octahedra**: This structure involves boron atoms forming octahedral units, where each boron atom is bonded to six neighboring boron atoms. This is not a common structure for elemental boron.\n\n4. **B4 tetrahedra**: This structure involves boron atoms forming tetrahedral units, where each boron atom is bonded to four neighboring boron atoms. This is not a common structure for elemental boron.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most common and well-known structure for elemental boron is the B8 cube. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
