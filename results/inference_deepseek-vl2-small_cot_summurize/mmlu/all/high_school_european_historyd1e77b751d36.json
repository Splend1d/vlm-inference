While enjoying these land allotments, the peasants are obliged, in return, to fulfill obligations to the noblemen fixed by the same arrangements. In this status, which is temporary, the peasants are temporarily bound. . . .\n[T]hey are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such acquisition of full ownership of land, the peasants will be freed from their obligations to the nobles for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant landowners.\nWE have deemed it advisable:\n3. To organize Peace Offices on the estates of the nobles, leaving the village communes as they are, and to open cantonal offices in the large villages and unite small village communes.\n4. To formulate, verify, and confirm in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the peasants for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land.\n6. Until that time, peasants and household serfs must be obedient towards their nobles, and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations.\n7. The nobles will continue to keep order on their estates, with the right of jurisdiction and of police, until the organization of cantons and of cantonal courts.\n\u2014Alexander II, \"The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia,\" Manifesto of February 19, 1861\nWhich of the following best articulates the new conditions for the recently emancipated serfs of Russia as stated in the above passage?\n\nA. The tsar's manifesto allowed for a heterogeneous class of farmers to emerge, with many former serfs becoming quite prosperous while others struggled.\nB. The manifesto was mostly ineffective in improving the economic condition of former serfs, but paved the way for local self-rule and, soon after, a national legislature.\nC. The tsar's insistence on cooperation between the nobility and recently emancipated people limited the financial potential of all impacted by the manifesto.\nD. The manifesto, although emancipating the serfs, saddled them with financial responsibilities and other restrictions, while the aristocracy retained too many of their former rights.\n",

They are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. This means that the serfs are not completely free, as they still have to fulfill obligations to the nobles and can only acquire full ownership of the land with the consent of the nobles.\n\nOption A is not correct because the passage does not mention anything about the emergence of a heterogeneous class of farmers.\n\nOption B is not correct because the passage does not mention anything about the manifesto paving the way for local self-rule or a national legislature.\n\nOption C is not correct because the passage does not mention anything about the tsar's insistence on cooperation between the nobility and recently emancipated people limiting the financial potential of all impacted by the manifesto.\n\nOption D is correct because it accurately reflects the new conditions for the recently emancipated serfs of Russia as stated in the passage. The serfs are not completely free, as they still have to fulfill obligations to the nobles and can only acquire full ownership of the land with the consent of the nobles.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
