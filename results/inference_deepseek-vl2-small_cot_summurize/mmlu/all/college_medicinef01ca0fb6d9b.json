The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?\nI. The amount the subjects were compensated.\nII. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.\nIII. The number of facts the subjects can recall.\nIV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.\n\nA. II only\nB. III only\nC. I and IV only\nD. I and III and IV only\n",

            "content": "The dependent variables in an experiment are the variables that are measured or observed in response to the independent variable. In this experiment, the independent variable is the amount the subjects were compensated and the time the subjects were given to learn the facts. The dependent variables are the variables that are measured in response to these independent variables.\n\nOption I, the amount the subjects were compensated, is a dependent variable because it is measured in response to the independent variable of the amount of compensation.\n\nOption II, the room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts, is a dependent variable because it is measured in response to the independent variable of the time given to learn the facts.\n\nOption III, the number of facts the subjects can recall, is a dependent variable because it is measured in response to the independent variable of the time given to learn the facts.\n\nOption IV, the time the subjects were given to learn the facts, is an independent variable in this experiment, not a dependent variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
