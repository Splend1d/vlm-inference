Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination.\n\nThis statement is true. In IPv4, the source must ensure that the datagram is the smallest MTU that can be used for the entire path to the destination. If the MTU of a link is smaller than the MTU of the datagram, the datagram must be fragmented.\n\nII. Datagrams may be fragmented during routing.\n\nThis statement is true. In IPv4, if the MTU of a link is smaller than the MTU of the datagram, the datagram must be fragmented. This fragmentation can occur during routing, as the router may need to break the datagram into smaller fragments to fit within the MTU of the next link.\n\nIII. Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination.\n\nThis statement is false. In IPv4, datagrams are reassembled at the intermediate routers along the path to the destination. The routers may reassemble the fragments of the datagram if they receive them in order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. II only.",
