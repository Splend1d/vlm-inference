The ring of complex numbers\nIn the ring of complex numbers, the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. For example, \\(i \\cdot i = -1\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nB. The ring of integers modulo 11\nIn this ring, the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. For example, \\(3 \\cdot 4 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\).\n\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]\nIn this ring, the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. For example, \\(f(0) \\cdot f(1) = 0\\) for any continuous function \\(f\\) on [0, 1].\n\nD. The ring \\(\\{a + b \\sqrt{2} : a \\text{ and b are rational numbers}\\}\\)\nIn this ring, the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. For example, \\(1 + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 1 + \\sqrt{2} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the ring where it is possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero. All the options except for the ring of complex numbers have this property.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\\[ \\text{A} \\]",
