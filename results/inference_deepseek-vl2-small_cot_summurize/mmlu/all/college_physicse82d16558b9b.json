            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the expansion of the universe affects the distances between objects. The expansion of the universe is driven by the cosmological principle, which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. This means that the universe looks the same in all directions and at all points in space.\n\nThe temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is a direct measure of the age of the universe. The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and its temperature is a snapshot of the universe when it was about 380,000 years old. Since the universe has been expanding ever since, the temperature of the CMB has been decreasing over time.\n\nWhen the temperature of the universe was 12 K, the universe was much younger than it is today. At that time, the universe was still in the early stages of its expansion, and the distances between objects were much smaller than they are today. This is because the expansion of the universe is not uniform; it accelerates over time due to the presence of dark energy.\n\nTo find out how much the distances between objects have increased since then, we can use the Hubble constant, which is a measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding. The Hubble constant is currently estimated to be about 70 km/s/Mpc, which means that every 1 Mpc (megaparsec) of distance, the universe is expanding by 70 km/s.\n\nSince the universe was 12 K when the temperature was 12 K, we can assume that the universe has expanded by a factor of 12/380,000 = 1/31,666.67 since then. This means that the distances between objects have increased by a factor of 1/31,666.67.\n\nTherefore, when the temperature of the universe was 12 K, typical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were about 1/31,666.67 as distant as they are today. This corresponds to option B.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
