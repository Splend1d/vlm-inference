In a group, the inverse of an element is unique, but it does not have to be equal to the element itself. For example, in the group of integers under addition, the inverse of 2 is -2, but -2 is not equal to 2.\n\nB. g = g^2 for every g in G\nThis is not necessarily true for an abelian group. In a group, the square of an element is not necessarily equal to the element itself. For example, in the group of integers under addition, the square of 2 is 4, but 4 is not equal to 2.\n\nC. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G\nThis is true for an abelian group. Since the group operation is commutative, we have g * h = h * g. Therefore, (g o h)^2 = (g * h)^2 = g^2 * h^2 = g^2 o h^2.\n\nD. G is of finite order\nThis is not necessarily true for an abelian group. An abelian group can be of infinite order. For example, the group of integers under addition is an abelian group of infinite order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G.",
