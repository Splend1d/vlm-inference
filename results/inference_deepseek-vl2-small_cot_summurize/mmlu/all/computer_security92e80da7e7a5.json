            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. You should not use a grammar-based fuzzer, because its adherence to the grammar means it will not find memory errors.\n- Grammar-based fuzzers are designed to generate valid inputs that adhere to the program's syntax and semantics. They are effective at finding memory errors because they can generate inputs that trigger undefined behavior, which can lead to memory corruption. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. Compiling the program with address sanitizer (ASAN) will make errors harder to reproduce.\n- Address Sanitizer (ASAN) is a tool that helps detect memory errors by analyzing the program's memory access patterns. It does not make errors harder to reproduce; rather, it makes it easier to identify the source of memory errors by providing detailed information about the memory access patterns that led to the error. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nC. Compiling the program with address sanitizer (ASAN) will make the source of a memory error easier to find.\n- ASAN provides detailed information about the memory access patterns that led to a memory error, making it easier to identify the source of the error. This is a key feature of ASAN, as it helps developers understand how the program was accessing memory and where the error occurred. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nD. Fuzzing doesn't find memory errors, it finds crashes and hangs.\n- Fuzzing is a technique used to find memory errors by generating a large number of inputs and observing the program's behavior. While it can find crashes and hangs, it is also effective at finding memory errors, as it can generate inputs that trigger undefined behavior and lead to memory corruption. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C. Compiling the program with address sanitizer (ASAN) will make the source of a memory error easier to find.",
