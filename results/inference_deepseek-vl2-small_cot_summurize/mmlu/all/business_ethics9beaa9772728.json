Proximity, Temporal immediacy, Social dissensus\n\nThese factors are all considered to impact the moral intensity of an action or decision. \n\n- **Proximity**: This refers to the closeness of the action to the individual or group affected. Actions that are closer to the individual or group are often perceived as more morally intense because they have a more direct impact on them.\n\n- **Temporal Immediacy**: This refers to the immediacy of the action. Actions that occur in the present are often considered more morally intense than those that occur in the future or in the past. This is because the consequences of the action are more immediate and can be felt more strongly.\n\n- **Social Dissensus**: This refers to the level of disagreement or conflict within a society about the action. Actions that are widely opposed by society are often considered more morally intense because they challenge the norms and values of the community.\n\nThese factors can all contribute to the perceived moral intensity of an action, making it more or less acceptable to different individuals and groups.",
