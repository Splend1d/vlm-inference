This means that for all \\( a, b \\in G \\) and \\( \\phi(a) = \\phi(b) \\), we have \\( \\phi(ab) = \\phi(a)\\phi(b) \\).\n\nTo show that there exists a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to \\( G' \\), consider the trivial homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\to G' \\) defined by \\( \\phi(g) = g' \\) for all \\( g \\in G \\). This function is clearly a homomorphism because it preserves the group operation:\n\n\\[\n\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a)\\phi(b) = (ab) = ab' = \\phi(a)\\phi(b) = \\phi(ab)\n\\]\n\nThus, there exists a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to \\( G' \\). Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.**\n\nA homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\to G' \\) is one-to-one if and only if it is injective, meaning that for any \\( g, g' \\in G \\), if \\( \\phi(g) = \\phi(g') \\), then \\( g = g' \\).\n\nTo show that every homomorphism is one-to-one, consider a homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\to G' \\). Suppose \\( \\phi(g) = \\phi(g') \\). We need to show that \\( g = g' \\).\n\nAssume \\( g \\neq g' \\). Then, there exist elements \\( g_1, g_2 \\in G \\) such that \\( g = g_1 \\) and \\( g' = g_2 \\). Since \\( \\phi \\) is a homomorphism, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\phi(g) = \\phi(g_1) = \\phi(g_2) = \\phi(g') = \\phi(g_1) = \\phi(g_2)\n\\]\n\nThis implies \\( g_1 = g_2 \\), which contradicts the assumption that \\( g \\neq g' \\). Therefore, \\( g = g' \\), and \\( \\phi \\) is injective.\n\nThus, every homomorphism is one-to-one. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
