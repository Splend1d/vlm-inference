Specifically, a field must satisfy the following:\n1. It is closed under addition and multiplication.\n2. It has additive inverses.\n3. It has multiplicative inverses.\n4. Multiplication is distributive over addition.\n\nA ring is a set equipped with two operations: addition and multiplication, satisfying the following properties:\n1. It is closed under addition and multiplication.\n2. It has additive inverses.\n3. It has multiplicative inverses.\n4. Multiplication is associative.\n\nA field is a special type of ring where the multiplication operation is commutative and the multiplicative identity exists. Therefore, every field satisfies all the properties of a ring. Thus, every field is also a ring.\n\n**Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.**\n\nA multiplicative identity in a ring is an element \\( e \\) such that for any element \\( a \\) in the ring, \\( a \\cdot e = e \\cdot a = a \\). This means that the multiplicative identity is the identity element for the ring's multiplication operation.\n\nFor example, in the ring of integers \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), the multiplicative identity is 1 because for any integer \\( a \\), \\( a \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot a = a \\).\n\nTherefore, every ring has a multiplicative identity.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA.
