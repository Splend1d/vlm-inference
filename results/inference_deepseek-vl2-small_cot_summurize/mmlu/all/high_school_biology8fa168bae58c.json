            "content": "To determine why viruses are considered an exception to the cell theory, let's first understand the cell theory itself. The cell theory states that:\n\n1. All living organisms are composed of cells.\n2. The cell is the basic unit of life.\n3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Are not independent organisms**: This statement is incorrect. Viruses are indeed independent organisms. They can replicate independently of a host cell, meaning they can reproduce without the need for a host.\n\nB. **Have only a few genes**: This is true for some viruses, but it is not the defining characteristic that makes them an exception to the cell theory. The number of genes is not a primary factor in determining whether an organism is a cell.\n\nC. **Move about via their tails**: This is incorrect. Viruses do not have tails like some other types of organisms. Instead, they use their protein coats to attach to host cells and inject their genetic material.\n\nD. **Have evolved from ancestral protists**: This is true. Viruses are believed to have evolved from ancient genetic material that was once part of a protist, a type of single-celled organism. This evolutionary origin is what makes them distinct from cells, which are considered the basic unit of life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Viruses are considered an exception to the cell theory because they have evolved from ancestral protists. This evolutionary origin is what sets them apart from other living organisms that are considered cells.",
