            "content": "To determine the minimum thickness of the oil film that results in the strongest reflection of blue light at normal incidence, we need to use the concept of thin film interference. The condition for maximum reflection is when the path difference between the two reflected waves is an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n\n1. **Identify the Wavelength and Refractive Indices**:\n   - Wavelength of blue light, \\( \\lambda = 480 \\, \\text{nm} = 480 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m} \\).\n   - Index of refraction of oil, \\( n_{\\text{oil}} = 1.2 \\).\n   - Index of refraction of glass, \\( n_{\\text{glass}} = 1.6 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Optical Path Difference**:\n   - The optical path difference \\( \\Delta d \\) between the two layers is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta d = 2 \\times n_{\\text{glass}} \\times \\text{thickness of oil} - 2 \\times n_{\\text{oil}} \\times \\text{thickness of oil}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta d = 2 \\times 1.6 \\times \\text{thickness of oil} - 2 \\times 1.2 \\times \\text{thickness of oil}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\Delta d = 3.2 \\times \\text{thickness of oil} - 2.4 \\times \\text{thickness of oil}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\Delta d = 0.8 \\times \\text{thickness of oil}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set the Optical Path Difference to an Integer Multiple of the Wavelength**:\n   - For maximum reflection, \\( \\Delta d \\) must be an integer multiple of the wavelength:\n     \\[\n     0.8 \\times \\text{thickness of oil} = m \\times \\lambda\n     \\]\n     where \\( m \\) is an integer.\n\n4. **Solve for the Thickness of the Oil Film**:\n   - Rearrange the equation to solve for the thickness:\n     \\[\n     \\text{thickness of oil} = \\frac{m \\times \\lambda}{0.8}\n     \\]\n   - We need to find the smallest integer \\( m \\) such that the thickness is greater than zero.\n\n5. **Calculate the Minimum Thickness**:\n   - For \\( m = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{thickness of oil} = \\frac{1 \\times 480 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.8} = 600 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m} = 0.6 \\, \\text{nm}\n     \\]\n   - Since the thickness must be greater than zero, the minimum thickness is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{thickness of oil} = 0.6 \\, \\text{nm}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Select the Closest Option**:\n   - The closest option to 0.6 nm is 150 nm.\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film is **150 nm**.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 150 nm**.",
