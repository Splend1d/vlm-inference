            "content": "To determine the percentage of people from Brazil who believe homosexuality should be accepted by society as of 2019, we need to consider the available data and trends in public opinion on this topic.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: In 2019, Brazil was experiencing significant social and political changes. The country had recently elected a new president, Jair Bolsonaro, who had a controversial stance on LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n2. **Analyzing Public Opinion**: Surveys and studies conducted in Brazil around this time often showed a divide in public opinion regarding LGBTQ+ rights. While there was a growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals, there was also a notable portion of the population that held more conservative views.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A (37%)**: This percentage is relatively low and might not reflect the majority opinion at the time.\n   - **Option B (47%)**: This is a plausible figure, considering the ongoing debates and the polarization of opinions.\n   - **Option C (57%)**: This is higher than the average and might indicate a more progressive view, which is not typical for the time.\n   - **Option D (67%)**: This is significantly higher than the average and might reflect a more progressive stance, which is not typical for the time.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of Brazil's political climate and the polarization of opinions, the most likely percentage of people who believed homosexuality should be accepted by society in 2019 is around 47%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 47%**.",
