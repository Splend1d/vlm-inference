They often emphasize their distinct cultural, linguistic, or historical identity and may advocate for self-determination or greater control over their own affairs.\n\n- **Basques**: The Basque people are an ethnic group living in the Basque Country, which spans parts of northern Spain and southwestern France. They have a distinct language, culture, and history that they wish to preserve and promote.\n\n- **Bretons**: The Bretons are an ethnic group from the Brittany region of France. They have a unique language, culture, and history that they wish to maintain and promote.\n\n- **Kashmiris**: The Kashmiris are an ethnic group from the Kashmir region, which is divided between India, Pakistan, and China. They have a distinct culture, language, and history that they wish to preserve and promote.\n\n- **Tamils**: The Tamils are an ethnic group from the Tamil Nadu region in southern India and the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka. They have a distinct language, culture, and history that they wish to preserve and promote.\n\nThese groups are not typically considered separatist, terrorist, or interventionist. Separatist groups seek to create a new nation or state, terrorist groups engage in violence, and interventionist groups are involved in foreign military or political actions. Regionalist groups, on the other hand, focus on self-determination and cultural preservation.",
