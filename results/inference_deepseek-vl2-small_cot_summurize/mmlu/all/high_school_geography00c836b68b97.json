An industrial society with abundant natural resources and large imports of food: This society would likely have a stable and sustainable population due to the availability of resources and advanced technology. Population pressure is typically associated with scarcity of resources, not abundance.\n\nB. A society with a highly mechanized agricultural sector: Mechanization in agriculture can increase productivity, allowing for more food to be produced with fewer resources. This can lead to a stable or even declining population, as the society can support a larger population without experiencing significant pressure.\n\nC. A non-ecumene: A non-ecumene is a society that does not have a defined territory or is not organized into a state. In such societies, population pressure is less likely to be a significant issue, as there is no established infrastructure or resources to support a large population.\n\nD. A slash-and-burn agricultural society: This type of society relies on slash-and-burn agriculture, which can lead to soil degradation and reduced fertility. This can result in a decrease in agricultural productivity over time, potentially leading to population pressure as the society struggles to sustain its population.\n\nBased on this analysis, the society most likely to experience population pressure is:\n\nD. A slash-and-burn agricultural society.",
