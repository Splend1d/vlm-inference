            "content": "To determine the regional lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue, we need to understand the lymphatic drainage pathways in the head and neck region.\n\n1. **Understanding Lymphatic Drainage**: The lymphatic system in the head and neck region is complex, with multiple pathways. The primary lymph nodes involved in this area include the submental, submandibular, and cervical lymph nodes.\n\n2. **Submental Lymph Nodes**: These are located in the submental triangle, which is the area under the chin. They receive lymph from the lower part of the face, including the lower lip, chin, and the tip of the tongue.\n\n3. **Submandibular Lymph Nodes**: These are located in the submandibular triangle, which is the area under the jaw. They receive lymph from the lower lip, chin, and the lower part of the tongue.\n\n4. **Cervical Lymph Nodes**: These are located in the neck and receive lymph from the head and neck.\n\n5. **Drainage Pathways**:\n   - The left side of the tip of the tongue drains into the left submental lymph node.\n   - The right side of the tip of the tongue drains into the right submental lymph node.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, the left side of the tip of the tongue drains into the left submental lymph node.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. left submental lymph node.",
