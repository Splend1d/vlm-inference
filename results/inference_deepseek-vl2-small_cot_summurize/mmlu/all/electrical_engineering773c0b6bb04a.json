            "content": "To determine the short circuit level at the busbar when four identical alternators are working in parallel, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Individual Rating of Each Alternator**: Each alternator is rated for 20 MVA at 11 KV.\n\n2. **Subtransient Reactance**: The subtransient reactance of each alternator is 16%.\n\n3. **Parallel Configuration**: When alternators are connected in parallel, the total apparent power rating is the sum of the individual ratings.\n\nLet's calculate the total apparent power rating:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total apparent power rating} = 4 \\times 20 \\, \\text{MVA} = 80 \\, \\text{MVA}\n\\]\n\n4. **Short Circuit Level Calculation**: The short circuit level is determined by the total apparent power rating of the system. This is because the short circuit level is the maximum power that can be supplied to the system without causing the voltage to drop to zero.\n\nGiven that the total apparent power rating is 80 MVA, the short circuit level at the busbar is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Short circuit level} = 80 \\, \\text{MVA}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 500 MVA\n\nThis is incorrect based on the given options. The correct answer should be:\n\nB. 400 MVA\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 400 MVA",
