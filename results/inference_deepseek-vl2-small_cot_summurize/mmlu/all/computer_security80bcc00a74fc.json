            "content": "To determine which attacks TLS protects against, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. **An attacker replacing bytes sent by a client with bytes of the attacker\u2019s own choosing.**\n\n   This is a type of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where an attacker intercepts and alters the communication between the client and the server. TLS provides protection against this by using cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures and message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure that the data has not been tampered with. Therefore, TLS protects against this type of attack.\n\n2. **An attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client.**\n\n   This is a type of interception attack where an attacker intercepts the communication between the client and the server. TLS protects against this by using encryption to ensure that the data is unreadable to any unauthorized parties. The encryption ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the proper decryption key. Therefore, TLS protects against this type of attack.\n\nGiven this analysis, both options are correct. The correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
