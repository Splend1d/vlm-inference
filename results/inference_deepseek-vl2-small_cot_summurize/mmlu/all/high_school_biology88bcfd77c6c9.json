            "content": "To determine which statement correctly characterizes an autoimmune disease, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. T cells attack healthy body cells.\n- Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells. T cells, a type of white blood cell, are part of the immune system and can mistakenly target healthy cells. This is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. Therefore, this statement accurately describes an autoimmune disease.\n\nB. An aneurysm is a weakness in the wall of a blood vessel that causes it to balloon out. The vessel can rupture and cause a hemorrhage.\n- An aneurysm is indeed a condition where a blood vessel weakens and balloons out, potentially leading to rupture and hemorrhage. However, this description does not pertain to autoimmune diseases. It is a vascular condition, not related to the immune system attacking the body's own cells.\n\nC. Several factors cause hypertension: smoking, being overweight, lack of physical activity, and too much salt in the diet.\n- Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a cardiovascular condition influenced by lifestyle factors such as smoking, diet, and physical activity. It is not related to autoimmune diseases, which involve the immune system attacking the body's own cells.\n\nD. Alzheimer's disease is caused by the buildup of plaque within the brain, causing brain cells to die.\n- Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to cell death. This is a neurological condition, not related to autoimmune diseases.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that correctly characterizes an autoimmune disease is:\n\nA. T cells attack healthy body cells.",
