Campaign extensively in states that heavily favor one party over the other.\n\nThe electoral college system is designed to ensure that smaller states have a voice in the election process. This means that presidential candidates tend to focus their campaigns on states that are likely to vote for their party. These states are often referred to as \"safe\" states, where the outcome of the election is already decided.\n\nBy focusing on these states, candidates can maximize their chances of winning the election without having to campaign in every state. This is because the electoral college system awards all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the most votes in that state, regardless of the national popular vote.\n\nIn contrast, candidates tend to avoid battleground states, which are states that are closely contested and could potentially go either way. These states are often more expensive to campaign in, and candidates may not see a significant return on their investment.\n\nCandidates also tend to campaign more heavily in states with large populations, as these states are more likely to have a significant impact on the national popular vote. However, the electoral college system takes into account the number of electoral votes a state has, not its population.\n\nFinally, candidates do not tend to spend more television advertising money in the Plains States, as these states are not typically considered battleground states. The Plains States are generally considered to be more conservative and less likely to go for a Democratic candidate.",
