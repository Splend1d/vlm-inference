The sensitivity of a latch to its input depends on whether the input is a level or an edge.\n\n- **Level-sensitive latch**: This type of latch changes state when the input signal is at a specific voltage level. It is not sensitive to the edges of the input signal.\n- **Edge-sensitive latch**: This type of latch changes state when the input signal transitions from one level to another. It is sensitive to the edges of the input signal.\n\nIn the context of the question, the correct answer is **B. edge**.",
