Similarly, we can represent \u22128 as a point 8 units to the left of 0.\n\nTo find the sum, we need to move 9 units to the left and 8 units to the left, and then add the two points together.\n\n9 units to the left is \u22129, and 8 units to the left is \u22128.\n\nSo, the sum is \u22129 + (\u22128) = \u221217.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n-17\n\\]",
