The set \\( R[x] \\) of all polynomials with coefficients in \\( R \\) forms a ring. To determine if \\( R[x] \\) is an integral domain, we need to check if it has no zero divisors.\n\nConsider the polynomial \\( f(x) = x \\) in \\( R[x] \\). If \\( R \\) is an integral domain, then \\( x \\neq 0 \\) because \\( R \\) has no zero divisors. However, \\( f(x) = x \\) is not zero, so \\( R[x] \\) does not have zero divisors. Therefore, \\( R[x] \\) is an integral domain.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: If \\( R \\) is a ring and \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are in \\( R[x] \\), then \\( \\deg(f(x)g(x)) = \\deg f(x) + \\deg g(x) \\).**\n\nThe degree of a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) in \\( R[x] \\) is the highest power of \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) \\). The degree of the product of two polynomials \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) is the sum of their degrees.\n\nTo see this, consider the polynomial \\( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \\) and \\( g(x) = b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \\cdots + b_1 x + b_0 \\). The degree of \\( f(x)g(x) \\) is \\( n + m \\).\n\nThus, the degree of \\( f(x)g(x) \\) is indeed \\( \\deg f(x) + \\deg g(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
