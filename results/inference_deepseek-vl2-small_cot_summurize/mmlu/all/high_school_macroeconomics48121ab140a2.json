Stagflation is a combination of stagnation and inflation, where the economy experiences high inflation along with high unemployment and stagnant economic growth.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Unemployment decreases: This is not a typical result of stagflation. Stagflation is characterized by high unemployment, not a decrease in it.\n\nB. The price level decreases: This is incorrect. Stagflation involves rising prices, not falling prices.\n\nC. The aggregate supply curve shifts to the right: This is not a typical result of stagflation. The aggregate supply curve typically shifts to the left due to increased production costs or supply chain disruptions, leading to higher prices and inflation.\n\nD. The Phillips curve shifts to the right: This is correct. The Phillips curve represents the inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. In stagflation, the Phillips curve shifts to the right, indicating that as unemployment remains high, inflation rises.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The Phillips curve shifts to the right.",
