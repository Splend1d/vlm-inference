            "content": "To determine which adaptation would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination, we need to consider the preferences and behaviors of these two types of pollinators.\n\n- **Bees** are attracted to flowers that have bright colors, such as red, yellow, and blue, and they are also drawn to flowers with patterns of ultraviolet color. Bees use their sense of smell and taste to locate nectar, and they are less likely to visit flowers that do not provide a landing platform.\n\n- **Hummingbirds**, on the other hand, are attracted to flowers with tubular shapes and bright colors, particularly red. They are also drawn to flowers that provide a landing platform, such as those with modified petals. Hummingbirds have a high metabolic rate and require a high sugar concentration in nectar to sustain their rapid wing movement.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Patterns of ultraviolet color on the petals** - Bees are attracted to ultraviolet patterns, which would not limit bee pollination.\n\nB. **Modified petals to provide a landing space** - This would not limit bee pollination but would be beneficial for hummingbirds.\n\nC. **Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers** - These flowers are specifically adapted to attract hummingbirds, as they provide a landing platform and are red, which is a color that hummingbirds are attracted to. This would limit bee pollination.\n\nD. **Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts** - This would not limit bee pollination but would be beneficial for hummingbirds, who require high sugar concentrations.\n\nTherefore, the adaptation that would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination is:\n\nC. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers.",
