            "content": "To determine which harmonics will survive when the pipe is closed at one end, we need to understand the concept of standing waves and the conditions for resonance.\n\n1. **Standing Waves and Resonance**: When a pipe is open at both ends, it can support standing waves. The harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, which is the frequency of the first harmonic (50 Hz in this case).\n\n2. **Closed Pipe Resonance**: When a pipe is closed at one end, it can only support odd harmonics. This is because the fundamental frequency and the first harmonic are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency, and the second harmonic is an even multiple.\n\n3. **Harmonic Survival**: For a closed pipe, the harmonics that will survive are those that are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. These are the harmonics 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only. This is correct because these are the odd harmonics that can survive in a closed pipe.\n   - **Option B**: 100 Hz and 200 Hz only. These are even harmonics and cannot survive in a closed pipe.\n   - **Option C**: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only. This is incorrect because 150 Hz is an odd harmonic, but 250 Hz is an even harmonic.\n   - **Option D**: None. This is incorrect because 150 Hz and 250 Hz will survive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only**.",
