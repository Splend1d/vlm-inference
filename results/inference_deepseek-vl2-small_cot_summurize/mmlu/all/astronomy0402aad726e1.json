In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\nB. In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\nC. Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\nD. When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.\n",

In our particular solar system, the denser materials settled nearer the Sun, while lighter materials are found in the outer part. This process is known as the \"metallic core hypothesis\" and explains why the inner planets are made of denser materials than the outer planets.",
