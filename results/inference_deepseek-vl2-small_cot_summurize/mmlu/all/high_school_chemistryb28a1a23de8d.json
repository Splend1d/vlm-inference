            "content": "To determine which solution a solid sample of MgCl2 would be most soluble in, we need to consider the solubility rules for ionic compounds. The solubility rules state that most chlorides are soluble in water, but some are not.\n\n1. **LiOH(aq)**: Lithium hydroxide is a strong base and does not dissolve in water. Therefore, MgCl2 would not dissolve in LiOH.\n\n2. **CBr4(aq)**: Carbon tetrachloride is a nonpolar solvent. Most chlorides are soluble in nonpolar solvents, but MgCl2 is not one of them. Therefore, MgCl2 would not dissolve in CBr4.\n\n3. **Mg(NO3)2(aq)**: Magnesium nitrate is a salt that dissolves in water. However, MgCl2 is not a salt of Mg(NO3)2, so it would not dissolve in Mg(NO3)2.\n\n4. **AlCl3(aq)**: Aluminum chloride is a salt that dissolves in water. MgCl2 is also a salt that dissolves in water. Therefore, MgCl2 would be most soluble in AlCl3.\n\nBased on the solubility rules and the properties of the solvents, the most soluble solution for a solid sample of MgCl2 is:\n\nD. AlCl3(aq)",
