            "content": "To determine which substance can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes during high rates of glycolysis, we need to understand the role of buffers in maintaining pH balance within cells.\n\n1. **Glutamine (A)**: Glutamine is an amino acid that can be converted into glutamate, which can then be converted back into glutamine. It is not primarily known for its buffering capacity in the context of glycolysis.\n\n2. **Glucose (B)**: Glucose is a simple sugar and does not have buffering properties. It is a primary energy source for cells but does not contribute to pH regulation.\n\n3. **Carnosine (C)**: Carnosine is a dipeptide composed of beta-alanine and histidine. It is known for its buffering capacity, particularly in muscle tissues. Carnosine can help maintain pH by neutralizing excess hydrogen ions, which is crucial during high rates of glycolysis when lactic acid is produced.\n\n4. **Amylase (D)**: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars. It does not have buffering properties and is not involved in maintaining pH balance.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **C. Carnosine**. Carnosine acts as an intracellular buffer by neutralizing excess hydrogen ions, thus helping to maintain a stable pH level during high rates of glycolysis.",
