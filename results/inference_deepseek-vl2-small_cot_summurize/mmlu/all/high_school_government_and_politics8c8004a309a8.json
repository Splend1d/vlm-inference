This can be done by manipulating the boundaries of districts to either concentrate the opposing party's voters in a few districts or spread them out over many districts, thus diluting their voting power. The term \"gerrymander\" comes from the name of a Massachusetts politician, Elbridge Gerry, who signed a bill in 1812 that created a district shaped like a salamander, which was intended to protect his party's interests.",
