This statistic is based on data collected from various countries and regions.\n\n4. **Impact of Open Defecation**: The practice of open defecation has significant health implications, including increased risk of infections and diseases. It also affects the quality of life and contributes to environmental degradation.\n\n5. **Efforts to Combat Open Defecation**: Many countries have implemented policies and programs to improve sanitation infrastructure, such as building toilets and promoting hygiene education.\n\nConsidering these points, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 9%\n\nThis percentage reflects the ongoing challenges in achieving universal access to safe sanitation, highlighting the need for continued efforts to improve global health and hygiene practices.",
