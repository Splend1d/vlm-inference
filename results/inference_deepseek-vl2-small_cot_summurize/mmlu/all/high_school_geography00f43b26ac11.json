While the Spratly Islands are a point of contention, the core issue is not merely about their location but about sovereignty and control.\n\nB. **Territorial Dispute**: This involves disagreements over the ownership or control of a territory. The Spratly Islands are a significant area of territorial dispute because both China and Vietnam claim sovereignty over parts of the islands. This is a classic example of a territorial dispute, where the main issue is who has the right to control the land.\n\nC. **Resource Dispute**: This type of dispute involves disagreements over the exploitation of natural resources within a territory. While the Spratly Islands are rich in resources, the primary issue is not resource extraction but rather who has the right to control the islands.\n\nD. **Functional Dispute**: This involves disagreements over the use or function of a territory. While the Spratly Islands are used for various purposes, the dispute is not about their function but about who has the right to control them.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. **Territorial Dispute**.\n\nThe Spratly Islands are a significant area of territorial dispute between China and Vietnam, with both countries claiming sovereignty over parts of the islands.",
