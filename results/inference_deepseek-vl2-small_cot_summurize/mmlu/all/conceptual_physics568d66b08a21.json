            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the pressure exerted by the mercury in a barometer is related to its height. The pressure exerted by a column of mercury in a barometer is given by the hydrostatic pressure formula:\n\n\\[ P = \\rho g h \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure,\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of mercury,\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the mercury column.\n\nSince the density of mercury is approximately constant, we can ignore it in this context. The pressure difference between two points in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid column between them. Therefore, the pressure difference between the two mercury columns is equal to the weight of the mercury in the narrower tube.\n\nLet's denote the height of the mercury in the narrower tube as \\( h_1 \\) and the height of the mercury in the wider tube as \\( h_2 \\). The pressure difference between the two tubes is:\n\n\\[ P_1 - P_2 = \\rho g h_1 - \\rho g h_2 \\]\n\nSince the density \\( \\rho \\) and the acceleration due to gravity \\( g \\) are the same for both tubes, the pressure difference is directly proportional to the height difference:\n\n\\[ P_1 - P_2 = \\rho g (h_1 - h_2) \\]\n\nGiven that the cross-sectional area of the narrower tube is 1 cm\u00b2 and the wider tube is 2 cm\u00b2, the pressure difference is:\n\n\\[ P_1 - P_2 = \\rho g (h_1 - h_2) = \\rho g (h_1 - 2h_1) = \\rho g (-h_1) \\]\n\nSince the pressure difference is the same for both tubes, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\rho g (-h_1) = \\rho g (h_1 - 2h_1) \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ -h_1 = h_1 - 2h_1 \\]\n\n\\[ -h_1 = -h_1 \\]\n\nThis equation is true for any value of \\( h_1 \\), which means that the height of the mercury in the narrower tube is not affected by the cross-sectional area of the tube. Therefore, the height of mercury in the narrower tube is the same as in the wider tube.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the same",
