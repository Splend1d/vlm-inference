While these are important aspects of network scanning, they are not the primary types of scanning.\n\nB. **Network, vulnerability, and port**: This option includes network, vulnerability, and port scanning. While these are relevant, they are not the primary types of scanning.\n\nC. **Passive, active, and interactive**: This option refers to the three main types of scanning:\n   - **Passive Scanning**: This involves observing network traffic without sending any requests. It is used to detect open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.\n   - **Active Scanning**: This involves sending packets to a target to gather information about the services running on the target. It is used to determine the version of services and operating systems.\n   - **Interactive Scanning**: This involves engaging with the target to gather information, often through a command-line interface. It is used to gather detailed information about the target's services and operating systems.\n\nD. **Server, client, and network**: This option suggests scanning based on server, client, and network. While these are important concepts in network scanning, they are not the primary types of scanning.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Passive, active, and interactive.",
