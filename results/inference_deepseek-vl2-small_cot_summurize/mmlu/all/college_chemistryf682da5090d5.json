            "content": "To determine the ratio of line intensities in the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical (CH3)3C\u2022, we need to understand the factors that influence the intensity of signals in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.\n\n1. **Spin Multiplicity**: The spin multiplicity of a radical is determined by the number of unpaired electrons. For the t-Bu radical (CH3)3C\u2022, the spin multiplicity is 1 (since there is one unpaired electron).\n\n2. **Hyperfine Splitting**: The hyperfine splitting in EPR is influenced by the magnetic field strength and the nuclear spin of the atoms involved. The t-Bu radical has a hyperfine coupling constant due to the interaction with the surrounding hydrogen atoms.\n\n3. **Magnetic Field Strength**: The magnetic field strength affects the energy levels of the unpaired electron. The t-Bu radical is typically observed in a magnetic field of 1000 G.\n\n4. **Nuclear Spin**: The nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms in the t-Bu radical contributes to the hyperfine splitting. The nuclear spin quantum number I is 1/2 for hydrogen.\n\n5. **Intensity Ratio**: The intensity of the EPR signal is proportional to the square of the spin multiplicity. Therefore, for a spin multiplicity of 1, the intensity ratio is 1:1.\n\n6. **Hyperfine Splitting**: The hyperfine splitting is influenced by the nuclear spin and the magnetic field strength. For a spin multiplicity of 1, the hyperfine splitting is typically 1:1.\n\n7. **Combining Intensities**: The total intensity is the sum of the intensities of all the hyperfine components. For a spin multiplicity of 1, the total intensity is 1.\n\nGiven these considerations, the ratio of line intensities in the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical (CH3)3C\u2022 is 1:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1:19:36:84:126:126:84:36:19:1",
