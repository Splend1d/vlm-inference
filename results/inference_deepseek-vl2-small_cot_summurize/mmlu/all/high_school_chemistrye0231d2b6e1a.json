Calculate moles of Ni(NO3)2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Moles of Ni(NO3)2} = \\frac{30.0 \\, \\text{g}}{148.68 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 0.202 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate molarity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Molarity} = \\frac{0.202 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.250 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.808 \\, \\text{mol/L}\n   \\]\n\nThe correct answer is not listed among the options. However, based on the calculations, the molarity is approximately 0.808 mol/L.",
