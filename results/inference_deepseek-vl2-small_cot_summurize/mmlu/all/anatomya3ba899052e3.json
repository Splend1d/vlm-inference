            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the role of noradrenaline in the autonomic nervous system. Noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.\n\n1. **Sympathetic Division Overview**: The sympathetic division is responsible for the 'fight or flight' response. It prepares the body to respond to stress or danger by increasing heart rate, dilating airways, and redirecting blood flow to muscles.\n\n2. **Neurotransmitter Role**: In the sympathetic division, noradrenaline is released by sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons. These neurons are located in the sympathetic ganglia, which are clusters of nerve cells that transmit signals to target organs.\n\n3. **Target Organs**: Once noradrenaline is released, it binds to adrenergic receptors on target organs such as the heart, lungs, and blood vessels, leading to the physiological changes necessary for the 'fight or flight' response.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Parasympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons are involved in the 'rest and digest' response, not the sympathetic division.\n   - **Option B**: Sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons are involved in the sympathetic division, but noradrenaline is released by post-ganglionic neurons, not pre ones.\n   - **Option C**: Parasympathetic post-ganglionic neurons are involved in the parasympathetic division, not the sympathetic division.\n   - **Option D**: Sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs are involved in the sympathetic division, where noradrenaline is released.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is **D. sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs**.",
