            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the frequency of the tuning fork and the frequency of the piano string.\n\nThe tuning fork is producing a sound at 1134 Hz. When two sounds are produced at the same time, they can interfere with each other in two ways:\n\n1. **Constructive interference**: When the frequencies of the two sounds are the same or very close to each other, they add up to produce a sound with a frequency that is the sum of the two frequencies.\n\n2. **Destructive interference**: When the frequencies of the two sounds are different, they can cancel each other out, resulting in a sound with a frequency that is the difference of the two frequencies.\n\nIn this case, you hear three beats per second. This means that the difference in frequency between the tuning fork and the piano string is 3 Hz.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of the piano string as \\( f \\). The difference in frequency between the tuning fork and the piano string is \\( f - 1134 \\).\n\nSince you hear three beats per second, the difference in frequency is 3 Hz. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ f - 1134 = 3 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( f \\), we get:\n\n\\[ f = 1134 + 3 \\]\n\\[ f = 1137 \\]\n\nSo, the frequency of the piano string is 1137 Hz.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 1137 Hz.",
