By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following is the best description of the plans being changed above?\n\nA.

However, by 1920, this fear was starting to go away, and people were thinking that Addison's plan was too much. This led to the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme being put on hold, and the government's Housing Board decided to cut the housing program in half.\n\nSo, the best description of the plans being changed above is that the government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
