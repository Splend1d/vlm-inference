            "content": "To determine which group of patients should be assessed using an Early Warning Score (EWS), we need to understand the purpose and application of the EWS. The EWS is a tool used to identify patients who are at risk of deteriorating in their condition. It is particularly useful in settings where patients are acutely unwell, such as in the Emergency Department (ED) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Only patients over 60 years of age.\n- While age is a significant factor in determining risk, the EWS is not limited to patients over 60. It is used for any patient who is acutely unwell, regardless of age.\n\nB. Only patients admitted to the Emergency Department.\n- Although the EWS is commonly used in the ED, it is not exclusive to this setting. It can be applied to any patient who is acutely unwell, regardless of their admission location.\n\nC. Only patients who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit.\n- The EWS is not limited to patients who have been in the ICU. It is used for any patient who is acutely unwell, regardless of their previous care setting.\n\nD. Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery.\n- This option accurately describes the population for which the EWS is most appropriate. Patients who are acutely unwell before or after surgery, as well as those who have undergone major surgery, are at a higher risk of deterioration and thus benefit from the use of an EWS.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery.",
