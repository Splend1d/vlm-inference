However, it also harbors pathogenic bacteria like Streptococcus mutans, which is associated with tooth decay and periodontal disease.\n\n2. **Fungi**: Various fungi, such as Candida species, can also be found in the mouth. While some fungi are part of the normal flora, others can cause infections, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems.\n\n3. **Viruses**: Although viruses are less common in the mouth compared to other parts of the body, they can still be present, particularly in cases of oral infections or in individuals with weakened immune systems.\n\n4. **Other Microorganisms**: In addition to bacteria and fungi, the mouth can also harbor protozoa, such as those that cause oral thrush, and other microorganisms like viruses and parasites.\n\nGiven the complexity and diversity of the microbial community in the mouth, it is reasonable to estimate that there are hundreds of different types of microorganisms that can colonize this environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 500",
