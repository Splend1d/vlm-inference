            "content": "To understand why the solar nebula heated up as it collapsed, we need to consider the processes involved in the formation of the solar system.\n\nThe solar nebula is a vast cloud of gas and dust that collapsed under its own gravity. As it collapsed, several key processes occurred:\n\n1. **Gravitational Potential Energy Conversion**: As the nebula collapsed, its gravitational potential energy was converted into kinetic energy. This means that the energy stored in the nebula due to its position and shape was transformed into motion.\n\n2. **Kinetic Energy to Thermal Energy**: As the nebula continued to collapse and the gas particles moved faster, the kinetic energy of the particles increased. This increased kinetic energy is then converted into thermal energy, or heat, due to the collisions and interactions between the particles.\n\n3. **Collisions and Friction**: As the particles collided, they transferred energy to each other, further increasing the temperature. This is similar to how friction generates heat in everyday objects.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Collisions among planetesimals generated friction and heat.**\n   - While planetesimals (the building blocks of planets) did form from the nebula, the primary heating mechanism during the nebula's collapse was not due to collisions among planetesimals.\n\nB. **Radiation from other nearby stars that had formed earlier heated the nebula.**\n   - This is incorrect because the nebula was not directly heated by radiation from other stars. The nebula's heating was due to its own collapse and internal processes.\n\nC. **The shock wave from a nearby supernova heated the gas.**\n   - A supernova would have had a significant impact on the surrounding environment, but the nebula's heating was primarily due to its own collapse and internal energy transformations.\n\nD. **As the cloud shrank its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.**\n   - This option accurately describes the process. The nebula's gravitational potential energy was converted into kinetic energy, which then increased the temperature of the gas through collisions and other interactions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. As the cloud shrank, its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.",
