Since \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, we can find the probability that neither of them is greater than 3 and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that \\(X\\) is not greater than 3 is the sum of the probabilities that \\(X = 1\\), \\(X = 2\\), and \\(X = 3\\). Since the probability that \\(X = n\\) is \\(1/2^n\\), we have:\n\n\\[ P(X \\leq 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = \\frac{1}{2^1} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{2^3} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8} \\]\n\nSince \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, the probability that \\(Y\\) is not greater than 3 is also \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\).\n\nThe probability that both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not greater than 3 is the product of the probabilities that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not greater than 3, which is:\n\n\\[ P(X \\leq 3 \\text{ and } Y \\leq 3) = P(X \\leq 3) \\cdot P(Y \\leq 3) = \\frac{7}{8} \\cdot \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{49}{64} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is greater than 3 is:\n\n\\[ 1 - P(X \\leq 3 \\text{ and } Y \\leq 3) = 1 - \\frac{49}{64} = \\frac{64}{64} - \\frac{49}{64} = \\frac{15}{64} \\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15{64}} \\]",
