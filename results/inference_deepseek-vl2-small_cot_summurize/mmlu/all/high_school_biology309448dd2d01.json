            "content": "To determine which of these is the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts, we need to understand the concept of natural selection and how it operates.\n\nNatural selection is a mechanism of evolution that acts on heritable traits, which are variations in the genetic makeup of individuals within a population. The process of natural selection involves the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in their traits.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A species' gene frequency: This refers to the proportion of a particular gene or set of genes in a population. While natural selection can affect the frequency of genes within a species, it does not directly act on the species level. Instead, it influences the genetic makeup of populations.\n\nB. A population's gene frequency: This is the proportion of a particular gene or set of genes within a population. Natural selection acts on the gene frequencies within a population, as it influences which individuals survive and reproduce. This is the correct answer because natural selection directly affects the genetic composition of a population.\n\nC. An individual's genome: This refers to the complete set of genetic material in an individual. While natural selection can influence the traits of an individual, it does not directly act on the genome level. Instead, it affects the expression of genes in an individual's phenotype.\n\nD. An individual's phenotype: This is the observable characteristics or traits of an individual, such as height, color, or behavior. Natural selection acts on the phenotype by influencing which individuals survive and reproduce based on their traits. However, it does not directly act on the phenotype itself but rather on the underlying genetic makeup that determines the phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts is a population's gene frequency.\n\nThe correct answer is B.",
