Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?\n\nA. Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\n",

            "content": "To determine which statement best explains the emergence of DDT-resistant mosquitoes, we need to consider the mechanisms of pesticide resistance.\n\nA. This option suggests that a mutation occurred in some mosquitoes after exposure to DDT, making them resistant. This is a plausible explanation because mutations can lead to resistance. However, it does not account for the rapid spread of resistance within a short period.\n\nB. This option posits that some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when it was first sprayed. If this is true, the resistant mosquitoes would have survived and reproduced, leading to a population increase. This explanation aligns with the historical context of DDT resistance, as it was first observed in India in 1959, shortly after widespread spraying began.\n\nC. This option suggests that DDT was improperly manufactured, which is unlikely given its widespread use and effectiveness. Moreover, the rapid spread of resistance does not support this explanation.\n\nD. This option is incorrect because DDT is known to be effective against a wide range of insects, including mosquitoes.\n\nConsidering the historical context and the mechanisms of resistance, the best explanation for the emergence of DDT-resistant mosquitoes is:\n\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.",
