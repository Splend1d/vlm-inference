T \u2228 U\n2. W \u00b7 T / U\n\nLet's construct the truth table:\n\n| T | U | W | T \u2228 U | W \u00b7 T / U |\n|---|---|---|-------|----------|\n| T | T | T |   T   |      T    |\n| T | T | F |   T   |      F    |\n| T | F | T |   F   |      T    |\n| T | F | F |   F   |      F    |\n| F | T | T |   T   |      T    |\n| F | T | F |   T   |      F    |\n| F | F | T |   T   |      T    |\n| F | F | F |   F   |      F    |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth values of the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. T \u2228 U:\n   - If T is true, then T \u2228 U is true.\n   - If U is true, then T \u2228 U is true.\n   - If both T and U are false, then T \u2228 U is false.\n\n2. W \u00b7 T / U:\n   - If W is true and T is true, then W \u00b7 T / U is true.\n   - If W is true and T is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n   - If W is false and T is true, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n   - If W is false and T is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n   - If U is true, then W \u00b7 T / U is true.\n   - If U is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\n- If T is true and W is true, then W \u00b7 T / U is true.\n- If T is true and W is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n- If T is false and W is true, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n- If T is false and W is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n- If U is true, then W \u00b7 T / U is true.\n- If U is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n\nThe conclusion is true if and only if the premises are true. Let's check the options:\n\nA. Valid: This option is not applicable as we have not yet determined the validity of the argument.\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when T and W are true and U is false:\n   - If T is true and W is true, then W \u00b7 T / U is true.\n   - If U is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is true.\n   - This counterexample is valid.\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when T is true and W and U are false:\n   - If T is true and W is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n   - If U is false, then W \u00b7 T / U is false.\n   - This counterexample is valid.\n\nD. Invalid.

The argument is invalid, and there are counterexamples for each option. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when T and W are true and U is false\nC. Invalid.
