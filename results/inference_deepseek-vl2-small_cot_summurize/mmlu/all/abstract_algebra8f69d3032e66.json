            "content": "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the truth of two statements about group theory and then select the correct answer from the given options.\n\n**Statement 1: Every group of order 159 is cyclic.**\n\nTo determine if this statement is true, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 159 is \\(3 \\times 53\\).\n\n- The Sylow 3-subgroups: The order of a Sylow 3-subgroup must divide 159 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible orders for a Sylow 3-subgroup are 1, 3, 9, 17, 51, and 153. The only possibility that works is 3, which means there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n- The Sylow 53-subgroups: The order of a Sylow 53-subgroup must divide 159 and be congruent to 1 modulo 53. The possible orders for a Sylow 53-subgroup are 1, 53, and 265. The only possibility that works is 53, which means there is a unique Sylow 53-subgroup of order 53.\n\nSince both Sylow subgroups are unique, their intersection is trivial, and the group is the direct product of these subgroups. The direct product of a group of order 3 and a group of order 53 is a group of order 159. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every group of order 159 is cyclic. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.**\n\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to consider the prime factorization of 102, which is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 17\\).\n\n- The Sylow 2-subgroups: The order of a Sylow 2-subgroup must divide 102 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible orders for a Sylow 2-subgroup are 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 26, and 52. The only possibility that works is 2, which means there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2.\n- The Sylow 3-subgroups: The order of a Sylow 3-subgroup must divide 102 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible orders for a Sylow 3-subgroup are 1, 3, 9, 17, 51, and 153. The only possibility that works is 3, which means there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n- The Sylow 17-subgroups: The order of a Sylow 17-subgroup must divide 102 and be congruent to 1 modulo 17. The possible orders for a Sylow 17-subgroup are 1, 17, and 172. The only possibility that works is 17, which means there is a unique Sylow 17-subgroup of order 17.\n\nSince all Sylow subgroups are unique, their intersection is trivial, and the group is the direct product of these subgroups. The direct product of a group of order 2, 3, and 17 is a group of order 102. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every group of order 102 is cyclic. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
