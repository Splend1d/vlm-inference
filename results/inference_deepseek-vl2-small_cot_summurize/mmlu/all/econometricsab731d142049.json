The acf and pacf are derived from the same data and are essentially the same function, but they are shifted by one lag. Therefore, at lag one, they will be identical.\n\nii) The pacf for an MA(q) model will in general be non-zero beyond lag q.\n\nThis statement is true. The pacf for an MA(q) model will be zero for lags greater than q, but it will be non-zero for lags less than q.\n\niii) The pacf for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p.\n\nThis statement is true. The pacf for an AR(p) model will be zero for lags greater than p, but it will be non-zero for lags less than p.\n\niv) The acf and pacf will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model.\n\nThis statement is true. The acf and pacf for an MA(1) model will be identical at lag two.\n\nTherefore, all four statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
