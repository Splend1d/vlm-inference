            "content": "There are a number of experiments for the determination of the molecular mass of a gas. One method begins by heating a solid or liquid in a flask to produce a gaseous product. The gas passes through a tube and displaces water in an inverted, water-filled bottle. The mass of the starting material is measured, along with the volume of the displaced water and the temperature of the system. The pressure in the inverted water-filled bottle is equal to the external pressure. Once the barometric pressure has been recorded, what other information is needed to finish the experiment?\n\nA. The heat of formation of the gas\nB. The density of the water\nC. The mass of the displaced water\nD. The vapor pressure of the water\n",

            "content": "To determine the molecular mass of the gas, we need to use the ideal gas law equation:\n\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure of the gas,\n- \\( V \\) is the volume of the gas,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of moles of gas,\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant,\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFrom the ideal gas law, we can rearrange to solve for the number of moles (\\( n \\)):\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{PV}{RT} \\]\n\nWe are given:\n- \\( P \\) (pressure of the gas) is equal to the external pressure in the inverted water-filled bottle,\n- \\( V \\) (volume of the gas) is the volume of the displaced water,\n- \\( T \\) (temperature) is the temperature of the system,\n- \\( R \\) (ideal gas constant) is a known constant.\n\nTo find the number of moles (\\( n \\)), we need the mass of the gas. The mass of the gas can be calculated using the density of the gas and its volume. The density (\\( \\rho \\)) of the gas is given by:\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{m}{V} \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the gas. Rearranging gives:\n\n\\[ m = \\rho V \\]\n\nThus, the mass of the gas is:\n\n\\[ m = \\rho V \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of the gas is needed to calculate the number of moles (\\( n \\)) using the ideal gas law.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The heat of formation of the gas - This is not needed for the calculation of the number of moles.\n\nB. The density of the water - This is not needed for the calculation of the number of moles.\n\nC. The mass of the displaced water - This is not needed for the calculation of the number of moles.\n\nD. The vapor pressure of the water - This is not needed for the calculation of the number of moles.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. The mass of the displaced water\n\nThe mass of the displaced water is not needed to calculate the number of moles of the gas.",
