The water is not included in the purchase of a pipe, but it is necessary for the pipe to function.\n- **Option B**: Incorrect. Electrons are not included in the wire; they are part of the material but not something you purchase.\n- **Option C**: Correct. When you buy copper wire, electrons may fall out of the wire, which is why insulation is used to prevent this from happening.\n- **Option D**: Incorrect. The statement about electrons falling out is a valid reason for using insulation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.",
