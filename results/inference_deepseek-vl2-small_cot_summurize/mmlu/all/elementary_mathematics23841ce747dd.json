            "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of stickers, \\( s \\), that Elizabeth has. We know that Elizabeth divides her stickers equally among herself and two friends, and each person gets 4 stickers.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of people**: There are 3 people in total: Elizabeth and her two friends.\n\n2. **Determine the number of stickers each person gets**: Each person gets 4 stickers.\n\n3. **Set up the equation**: Since the stickers are divided equally among the 3 people, we can express the total number of stickers \\( s \\) as:\n   \\[\n   s = 4 \\times 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of stickers**:\n   \\[\n   s = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the equation that represents this total number of stickers. Let's analyze the given options:\n\n- **Option A**: \\( s + 3 = 4 \\)\n  - This equation does not represent the total number of stickers. It suggests adding 3 to \\( s \\) to get 4, which is not correct.\n\n- **Option B**: \\( s - 3 = 4 \\)\n  - This equation does not represent the total number of stickers. It suggests subtracting 3 from \\( s \\) to get 4, which is not correct.\n\n- **Option C**: \\( \\frac{s}{3} = 4 \\)\n  - This equation suggests that \\( s \\) divided by 3 equals 4, which is not correct. It implies that \\( s \\) is 12, but the division by 3 is not appropriate.\n\n- **Option D**: \\( 3s = 4 \\)\n  - This equation suggests that \\( s \\) multiplied by 3 equals 4, which is not correct. It implies that \\( s \\) is 12, but the multiplication by 3 is not appropriate.\n\nThe correct equation that represents the total number of stickers is:\n\\[\ns = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
