            "content": "To determine which job-scheduling policy is starvation-free, we need to understand the concept of starvation in job scheduling. Starvation occurs when a job is repeatedly delayed and never gets a chance to run, even though it is ready to execute.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Round-robin**: This policy assigns a fixed time slice to each job in a cyclic order. While it ensures that each job gets a turn, it does not guarantee that a job will not be starved if it is not assigned a time slice for an extended period.\n\nB. **Priority queuing**: This policy assigns a priority level to each job, and the job with the highest priority is served first. This can lead to starvation if a high-priority job is continuously delayed by lower-priority jobs.\n\nC. **Shortest job first**: This policy selects the job with the shortest execution time for execution next. It ensures that the job with the least waiting time is executed, thus preventing starvation.\n\nD. **Youngest job first**: This policy selects the job that has been waiting the least time for execution. While it can prevent starvation, it does not guarantee that a job will not be starved if it is not chosen next.\n\nBased on this analysis, the policy that guarantees no job waits indefinitely for service is the **Shortest job first** policy. This policy ensures that the job with the shortest waiting time is executed next, thus preventing starvation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Shortest job first**.",
