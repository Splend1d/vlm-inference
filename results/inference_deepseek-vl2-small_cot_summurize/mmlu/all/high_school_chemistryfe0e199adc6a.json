The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n",

            "content": "To determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the thermal energy changes using the formula for heat transfer:\n\n\\[ q = mc\\Delta T \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( q \\) is the heat transferred,\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the substance,\n- \\( c \\) is the specific heat capacity,\n- \\( \\Delta T \\) is the change in temperature.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Calculate the heat lost by the sample:**\n   - The sample's initial temperature is 100 \u00b0C, and the final temperature is 37 \u00b0C.\n   - The change in temperature (\\( \\Delta T \\)) for the sample is \\( 100 - 37 = 63 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} \\).\n   - The mass of the sample is 25 g.\n   - The specific heat capacity of the sample is not given, but we can assume it is known or can be calculated if necessary.\n   - The heat lost by the sample is:\n     \\[ q_{\\text{sample}} = 25 \\, \\text{g} \\times c_{\\text{sample}} \\times 63 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the heat gained by the water:**\n   - The water's initial temperature is 26 \u00b0C, and the final temperature is 37 \u00b0C.\n   - The change in temperature (\\( \\Delta T \\)) for the water is \\( 37 - 26 = 11 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} \\).\n   - The mass of the water is 100 g.\n   - The specific heat capacity of water is approximately \\( 4.18 \\, \\text{J/g\u00b0C} \\).\n   - The heat gained by the water is:\n     \\[ q_{\\text{water}} = 100 \\, \\text{g} \\times 4.18 \\, \\text{J/g\u00b0C} \\times 11 \\, \\text{\u00b0C} \\]\n\n3. **Compare the heat lost by the sample and the heat gained by the water:**\n   - The heat lost by the sample is equal to the heat gained by the water because the system is insulated, meaning no heat is lost to the surroundings.\n   - Therefore, the heat lost by the sample is equal to the heat gained by the water:\n     \\[ q_{\\text{sample}} = q_{\\text{water}} \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\n   - The temperature change of the sample is greater than that of the water, but this does not affect the amount of thermal energy transferred.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is:\n\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.",
