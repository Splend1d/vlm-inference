            "content": "To determine the age of the surface of Venus, we need to consider the geological and atmospheric characteristics of the planet. Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"sister planet\" due to their similar size and composition, but it has a very different environment.\n\n1. **Atmospheric Composition**: Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), with clouds of sulfuric acid. This atmosphere traps heat, making Venus the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching up to 462\u00b0C (863\u00b0F).\n\n2. **Geological Activity**: Unlike Earth, Venus does not have tectonic plates or significant volcanic activity. Instead, it has a surface covered with volcanoes and impact craters, indicating a lack of recent geological activity.\n\n3. **Age Estimation**: The surface age of Venus is estimated to be around 2 billion years. This estimation is based on the lack of geological features that would suggest recent activity, such as tectonic movement or volcanic eruptions.\n\n4. **Comparison with Earth**: Earth's surface is about 4.5 billion years old, primarily due to its active geological processes. Venus, with its ancient surface and lack of recent geological activity, is much older than Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2 billion years.",
