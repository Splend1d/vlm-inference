            "content": "To determine which theory was used to justify US involvement in Vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. **Devolution**: This theory refers to the process by which a central authority loses control over a region, often leading to increased autonomy or independence. It is not directly related to the US involvement in Vietnam.\n\nB. **Colonialism**: This theory involves the exploitation of a less developed country by a more developed one, often for economic or political gain. While the US did have colonial interests in Asia, this theory does not specifically address the US involvement in Vietnam.\n\nC. **Heartland theory**: This theory suggests that the primary threat to the US comes from the interior of the continent, rather than from abroad. It was not used to justify US involvement in Vietnam.\n\nD. **Containment theory**: This theory was developed by George F. Kennan and was used by the US to justify its involvement in Vietnam. Containment theory posits that the US should prevent the spread of communism by containing it within its current borders. The theory was applied to Vietnam as a way to prevent the spread of communism from China to Southeast Asia.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Containment theory",
