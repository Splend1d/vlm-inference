            "content": "To determine which statement is true about the pupillary light reflex, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Its efferent limb is carried in the optic nerve\n- The efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is actually carried in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), not the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the afferent limb, which is the sensory input from the retina to the brain. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. It is mediated by the inferior colliculi in the midbrain\n- The pupillary light reflex is mediated by the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which is located in the midbrain, but it is not mediated by the inferior colliculi. The inferior colliculi are involved in auditory reflexes. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. It is a consensual reflex\n- The pupillary light reflex is indeed a consensual reflex. This means that both eyes must be exposed to light for the reflex to occur. If one eye is covered, the other eye will constrict its pupil in response to light. This is a key characteristic of the pupillary light reflex. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nD. Its afferent limb is carried in the oculomotor nerve\n- The afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is carried in the optic nerve, not the oculomotor nerve. The oculomotor nerve is responsible for motor control of most of the eye's movements, including constriction of the pupil. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. It is a consensual reflex",
