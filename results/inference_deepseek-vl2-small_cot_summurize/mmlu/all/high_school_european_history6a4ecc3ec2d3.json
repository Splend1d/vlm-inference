While enjoying these land allotments, the peasants are obliged, in return, to fulfill obligations to the noblemen fixed by the same arrangements. In this status, which is temporary, the peasants are temporarily bound. . . .\n[T]hey are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such acquisition of full ownership of land, the peasants will be freed from their obligations to the nobles for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant landowners.\nWE have deemed it advisable:\n3. To organize Peace Offices on the estates of the nobles, leaving the village communes as they are, and to open cantonal offices in the large villages and unite small village communes.\n4. To formulate, verify, and confirm in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the peasants for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land.\n6. Until that time, peasants and household serfs must be obedient towards their nobles, and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations.\n7. The nobles will continue to keep order on their estates, with the right of jurisdiction and of police, until the organization of cantons and of cantonal courts.\n\u2014Alexander II, \"The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia,\" Manifesto of February 19, 1861\nWhich of the following was a major impetus in convincing Tsar Alexander II of the necessity of freeing the serfs?\n\nA.

            "content": "The question is asking for the major impetus that convinced Tsar Alexander II of the necessity of freeing the serfs. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Recent defeat in the Crimean War convinced the tsar some domestic reforms were necessary. This option is not correct because the Crimean War was in 1853-1856, and the text is from 1861, which is after the war.\n\nB. Enlightened rulers in Prussia and Austria had recently done the same, which pressured Alexander II to act. This option is correct because the text mentions that the nobles, while retaining their property rights to all the lands belonging to them, grant the peasants perpetual use of their household plots in return for a specified obligation. This suggests that the pressure from other enlightened rulers who had already implemented similar reforms may have influenced Alexander II to act.\n\nC. The Decembrist Revolt and its aftermath had convinced the young tsar to make reforms. This option is not correct because the Decembrist Revolt was in 1825, which is before the text is from.\n\nD. A labor force to complete the Trans-Siberian Railroad was needed as well as military recruits. This option is not correct because the text does not mention anything about the need for a labor force to complete the Trans-Siberian Railroad or military recruits.\n\nTherefore, the major impetus in convincing Tsar Alexander II of the necessity of freeing the serfs was the pressure from enlightened rulers in Prussia and Austria who had recently done the same, which pressured Alexander II to act.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
