This is a well-known result in group theory, often attributed to Emmy Noether. It states that for any positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a free abelian group of rank \\( n \\). This is because the set of all integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) can be considered as a free abelian group of rank 1, and any other positive integer rank can be achieved by taking the direct sum of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) with itself \\( n \\) times.\n\nThus, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n**Statement 2: A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.**\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we need to understand the Betti numbers and the concept of free abelian groups:\n\n- The Betti numbers of a group \\( G \\) are integers that describe the structure of \\( G \\). They are defined by the homology groups \\( H_i(G) \\), where \\( H_i(G) \\) is the \\( i \\)-th homology group of \\( G \\).\n- A group is free abelian if it can be generated by a finite set of elements and is abelian.\n\nThe statement claims that a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set. This is not necessarily true. For example, consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) of integers, which is a finitely generated abelian group. The Betti numbers of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) are \\( 1, 0, 0, \\ldots \\), but the number of elements in the generating set is 1 (since \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is generated by the single element 1). However, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is not free abelian because it is not a free abelian group of rank 1.\n\nThus, **Statement 2 is false**.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",
