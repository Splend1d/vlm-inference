            "content": "To answer this question, we need to understand the context of the French Revolution and the role of Robespierre. Robespierre was a key figure in the radical phase of the French Revolution, which was characterized by a push for radical social and political change.\n\nA. The conscription of huge armies: This was a common practice during the French Revolution, and it was beneficial for the defense of France as it allowed for the creation of large, well-trained armies.\n\nB. Fixing prices and wages: This was also a common practice during the French Revolution, and it was beneficial for the defense of France as it helped to stabilize the economy and prevent inflation.\n\nC. Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization: This was a radical policy that Robespierre pursued, and it was not beneficial for the defense of France. The de-Christianization of France was a move towards secularism and away from the influence of the Catholic Church, which was seen as a threat to the revolution. This policy was not focused on the defense of France, but rather on the radical transformation of French society.\n\nD. Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field: This was a common practice during the French Revolution, and it was beneficial for the defense of France as it allowed for the creation of well-trained and motivated soldiers.\n\nTherefore, the change instituted by Robespierre that was LEAST beneficial to the defense of France was pursuing a policy of de-Christianization.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
