Both the House and the Senate have the power to issue subpoenas. The House of Representatives has the exclusive power to initiate revenue bills, but both chambers have the authority to issue subpoenas.\n\nB. Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This statement is incorrect. The power to introduce revenue bills is exclusive to the House of Representatives. The Senate can propose amendments to revenue bills, but it cannot originate them.\n\nC. States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This statement is correct. The House of Representatives is based on equal representation, with each state having at least one representative, regardless of its population. In contrast, the Senate has two senators from each state, regardless of population, ensuring equal representation for each state.\n\nD. The Senate allows unlimited debate, while the House does not.\n- This statement is incorrect. Both the Senate and the House allow for unlimited debate on most issues. The Senate is known for its tradition of extended debate, but this is not unique to it and is not a significant difference from the House.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.",
