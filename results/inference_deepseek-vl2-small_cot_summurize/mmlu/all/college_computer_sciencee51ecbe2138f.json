Key 13: \\( h(13) = 13 \\mod 5 = 3 \\)\n2. Key 8: \\( h(8) = 8 \\mod 5 = 3 \\)\n3. Key 24: \\( h(24) = 24 \\mod 5 = 4 \\)\n4. Key 10: \\( h(10) = 10 \\mod 5 = 0 \\)\n5. Key 3: \\( h(3) = 3 \\mod 5 = 3 \\)\n\nNow, let's insert the keys into the hash table:\n\n1. Insert 13: Since bucket 2 is initially empty, 13 is placed in bucket 2.\n2. Insert 8: Since bucket 2 is already occupied by 13, 8 is placed in bucket 2.\n3. Insert 24: Since bucket 2 is already occupied by 8, 24 is placed in bucket 3.\n4. Insert 10: Since bucket 2 is already occupied by 8, 10 is placed in bucket 2.\n5. Insert 3: Since bucket 2 is already occupied by 8 and 10, 3 is placed in bucket 2.\n\nThe order in which the keys are placed in bucket 2 is: 13, 8, 10, 3.\n\nTherefore, the content of the bucket numbered 2 is 13, 8, 10, 3.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ 13 \\]",
