            "content": "To determine the effect of an increase in the price of forklifts imported into the United States from Belgium on the consumer price index (CPI) and the GDP deflator, we need to understand the components of each index.\n\n1. **Consumer Price Index (CPI):** The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It includes a wide range of items such as food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. An increase in the price of imported forklifts would directly affect the cost of transportation and logistics, which are components of the CPI. Therefore, an increase in the price of forklifts would likely lead to an increase in the CPI.\n\n2. **GDP Deflator:** The GDP deflator is a measure of the level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. It is calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP. An increase in the price of imported forklifts would increase the cost of production for businesses, which would then be reflected in the prices of goods and services. This would lead to an increase in the GDP deflator, as it measures the overall price level of all goods and services produced domestically.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. increase the consumer price index and the GDP deflator.\n\nThis is because both the CPI and GDP deflator are influenced by the cost of imported goods, and an increase in the price of forklifts would lead to higher prices in both indices.",
