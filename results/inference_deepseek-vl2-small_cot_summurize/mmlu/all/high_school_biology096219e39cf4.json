            "content": "To determine which term best describes the situation involving the land snail species, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Artificial selection**: This refers to the process by which humans select and breed plants and animals for desirable traits. It is not applicable here since the selection is occurring naturally within the species.\n\nB. **Directional selection**: This type of selection occurs when a population is biased towards one extreme of a trait distribution. In the case of the land snails, if the cream color is favored over the brown color, the population would shift towards more cream-colored individuals. This is not the situation described, as the population is not biased towards one extreme.\n\nC. **Stabilizing selection**: This occurs when a population is biased towards the average or middle of a trait distribution. In the scenario of the land snails, if the cream color is favored over the brown color, the population would shift towards more cream-colored individuals, leading to a higher frequency of the cream color. This is consistent with the description provided.\n\nD. **Disruptive selection**: This type of selection occurs when a population is biased towards both extremes of a trait distribution. If the cream color and brown color were equally favored, the population would be split between the two extremes, leading to a bimodal distribution. This is not the case here, as the cream color is favored.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the term that best describes the situation is **C. stabilizing selection**. This is because the population is biased towards the cream color, leading to a higher frequency of that trait.",
