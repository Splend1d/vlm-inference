A true coelom is a body cavity that is fully lined with mesoderm tissue, providing a hydrostatic skeleton that aids in the movement and support of the organism.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Platyhelminthes**: This phylum includes flatworms, such as tapeworms and flukes. These organisms do not have a true coelom. Instead, they have a pseudocoelom, which is a body cavity lined with mesoderm but not fully lined with mesoderm tissue.\n\nB. **Porifera**: This phylum includes sponges. Sponges have a simple body structure with a central cavity (spongocoel) that is not fully lined with mesoderm tissue. They lack a true coelom.\n\nC. **Annelida**: This phylum includes segmented worms such as earthworms, leeches, and annelids. These organisms have a true coelom, which is a fully lined body cavity that provides structural support and aids in the movement of the organism.\n\nD. **Nematoda**: This phylum includes roundworms. Nematodes have a pseudocoelom, which is a body cavity lined with mesoderm but not fully lined with mesoderm tissue. They do not have a true coelom.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Annelida\n\nAnnelida is the phylum that has a true coelom.",
