It is involved in forming structures that are not directly related to the central nervous system or the circulatory system.\n\n- **Motor neurons** are derived from the neural tube, which is a part of the ectoderm. They are part of the central nervous system and are responsible for transmitting signals between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\n- **Skeletal muscles** are derived from the mesoderm, specifically from the somites, which are segments of the mesoderm that form the body's framework.\n\n- **Melanocytes** are derived from the ectoderm. They are specialized cells that produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color.\n\n- **Sweat glands** are also derived from the ectoderm. They are part of the integumentary system and are involved in thermoregulation.\n\nGiven this information, the structures derived from ectomesenchyme are:\n\n- **Melanocytes**\n- **Sweat glands**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Melanocytes** and **D. Sweat glands**.",
