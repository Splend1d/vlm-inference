The bone is bent but not displaced, and the skin remains intact. This description matches the given scenario.\n\nB. **Complex, comminuted**: A complex fracture involves multiple bone fragments, often due to a high-impact injury. A comminuted fracture specifically refers to a fracture where the bone is broken into several pieces. This does not match the scenario where the skin is intact and the bone is only bent.\n\nC. **Compound, transverse**: A compound fracture is one where the bone breaks through the skin, often requiring medical intervention. A transverse fracture involves a break across the bone, usually in a straight line. This does not fit the description of a bent but not displaced bone with intact skin.\n\nD. **Open, spiral**: An open fracture is one where the bone breaks through the skin, often leading to infection. A spiral fracture involves a helical break in the bone, which is not consistent with the scenario described.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct classification for the given fracture is:\n\nA. **Closed, greenstick**\n\nThis type of fracture is characterized by a break in the bone without a break in the skin, where the bone is bent but not displaced.",
