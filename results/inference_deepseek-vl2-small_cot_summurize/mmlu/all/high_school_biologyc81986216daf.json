The dominant allele B codes for black fur, the recessive allele b codes for brown hair. A second gene consisting of two alleles, E and e, codes for the deposition of pigment in the hair. In this case, the alleles for pigment deposition (E or e) are said to be epistatic to the gene that codes for black or brown pigment. If the dominant allele (E) is not present, regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus, the animal's fur will be yellow.\n\nA. BBEe will be brown.\nB. BbEe will be brown.\nC. Bbee will be brown.\nD. BBee will be yellow.\n",

            "content": "To determine the coat color of a Labrador retriever with the genotype BbEe, we need to consider the effects of each gene on the coat color.\n\n1. **Gene B (Black/Brown Pigment):**\n   - The alleles B and b determine the amount of melanin.\n   - The genotype Bb means the animal will have black fur because the dominant allele B is present.\n   - The genotype bb will result in brown fur because the recessive allele b is present.\n\n2. **Gene E (Pigment Deposition):**\n   - The alleles E and e determine the deposition of pigment in the hair.\n   - The genotype EE will result in yellow fur because the dominant allele E is present.\n   - The genotype ee will result in brown fur because the recessive allele e is present.\n\nNow, let's analyze the genotype BbEe:\n\n- **B (Black/Brown Pigment):** The animal has the B allele, which results in black fur.\n- **b (Black/Brown Pigment):** The animal has the b allele, which results in brown fur.\n- **E (Pigment Deposition):** The animal has the E allele, which results in yellow fur.\n\nSince the E allele is dominant, the presence of E will mask the effects of the b allele, resulting in yellow fur.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. BBee will be yellow.",
