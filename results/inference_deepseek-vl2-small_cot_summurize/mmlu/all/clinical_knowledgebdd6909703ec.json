            "content": "To determine which of the options promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Adrenaline: Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone that prepares the body for the \"fight or flight\" response. It increases heart rate, blood pressure, and energy availability by mobilizing glucose and fatty acids from storage. However, it does not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle cells.\n\nB. Insulin: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. It facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells, including muscle cells, by promoting the translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the cell membrane. Insulin also promotes amino acid uptake by stimulating the translocation of amino acid transporters (e.g., L-glutamine transporter) to the cell membrane. Therefore, insulin directly promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle cells.\n\nC. Glycogen: Glycogen is a storage form of glucose in the liver and muscle cells. While it is important for energy storage, it does not promote glucose uptake by muscle cells. Instead, it is broken down to release glucose when energy is needed.\n\nD. Cortisol: Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone that helps regulate metabolism, immune response, and stress. It promotes the breakdown of glycogen to release glucose into the bloodstream and can also promote amino acid breakdown for energy. However, it does not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle cells.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Insulin",
