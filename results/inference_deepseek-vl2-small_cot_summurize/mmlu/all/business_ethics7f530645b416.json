This is not about hiding the true cost of an item.\n\nB. **Deceptive pricing**: This involves intentionally misleading consumers about the price of an item, often by not disclosing all costs or by using misleading pricing tactics. This aligns with the scenario where a company deliberately obscures the true cost of an item.\n\nC. **Price fixing**: This is a collusion between companies to set prices artificially high or low. It does not involve hiding the true cost of an item.\n\nD. **Skimming**: This is a pricing strategy where a company sets a high initial price for a new product and gradually lowers it over time. It is not about hiding the true cost.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is **B. Deceptive pricing**, as it involves intentionally misleading consumers about the true cost of an item.",
