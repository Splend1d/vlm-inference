Folklore is not written; it is passed down orally or through other non-written means. It is a collection of stories, songs, and traditions that are shared within a community.\n\nB. It encourages changing the old values and customs.\n- This statement is also incorrect. Folklore often reflects and preserves the values and customs of a community. It serves as a way to maintain cultural identity and continuity, rather than encouraging change.\n\nC. It serves to blend all cultures into one.\n- This statement is incorrect. Folklore is specific to a particular culture or group and does not aim to blend cultures. It is a unique expression of a community's history, beliefs, and traditions.\n\nD. It expresses in words the shared values of a group by expressing their ideals.\n- This statement is correct. Folklore is a means of expressing the shared values, beliefs, and ideals of a group. It often includes stories, songs, and traditions that convey moral lessons, cultural norms, and historical events.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. It expresses in words the shared values of a group by expressing their ideals.",
