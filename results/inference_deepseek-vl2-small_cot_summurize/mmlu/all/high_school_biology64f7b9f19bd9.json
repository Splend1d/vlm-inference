            "content": "To determine which genotype set could produce offspring with silver fur, we need to understand the dominance relationship between the genes for brown fur (B) and silver fur (b).\n\n1. **Dominance and Recessiveness**: \n   - The gene for brown fur (B) is dominant, meaning that at least one B allele is required for the phenotype of brown fur to be expressed.\n   - The gene for silver fur (b) is recessive, meaning that two b alleles are required for the phenotype of silver fur to be expressed.\n\n2. **Genotype Analysis**:\n   - **BB**: Both alleles are for brown fur, so the phenotype is brown.\n   - **Bb**: One allele is for brown fur and one is for silver fur. The phenotype is brown because the dominant B allele masks the recessive b allele.\n   - **bb**: Both alleles are for silver fur, so the phenotype is silver.\n\n3. **Crossing Analysis**:\n   - To produce offspring with silver fur, the genotype must be **bb**.\n   - The possible parental genotypes that could produce a bb offspring are:\n     - **BB**: This would result in Bb offspring, which are brown.\n     - **Bb**: This would result in Bb offspring, which are brown.\n     - **bb**: This would result in bb offspring, which are silver.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The genotype set that could produce offspring with silver fur is **bb**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Bb bb**.",
