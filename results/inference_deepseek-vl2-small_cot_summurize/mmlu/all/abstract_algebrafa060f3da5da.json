This means the vectors are not scalar multiples of each other.\n\nConsider two vectors \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, 0) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1) \\). These vectors are not scalar multiples of each other because:\n- \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 \\neq \\lambda \\mathbf{v}_2 \\) for any scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nThus, the vectors \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 \\) are linearly independent.\n\n**Statement 2: If \\( V = \\text{span}(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_k) \\) and \\( \\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_k\\} \\) are linearly independent, then \\( \\dim(V) = k \\).**\n\nThe dimension of the span of a set of vectors is equal to the number of vectors in the set. If the set \\( \\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_k\\} \\) is linearly independent, then the span of these vectors is a subspace of \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), and its dimension is \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, if \\( V = \\text{span}(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_k) \\) and \\( \\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_k\\} \\) are linearly independent, then \\( \\dim(V) = k \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
