            "content": "To determine which list contains only Fed actions that will increase the money supply, we need to understand the effects of each action:\n\n1. **Raise Reserve Requirements**: This action reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thereby decreasing the money supply.\n\n2. **Lower the Discount Rate**: This action makes borrowing cheaper for banks, encouraging them to lend more, which increases the money supply.\n\n3. **Sell Bonds**: Selling bonds is a contractionary monetary policy. It reduces the money supply because it takes money out of the banking system.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A**: Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; sell bonds.\n  - **Raise reserve requirements** decreases the money supply.\n  - **Lower the discount rate** increases the money supply.\n  - **Sell bonds** decreases the money supply.\n  - This option does not contain only Fed actions that increase the money supply.\n\n- **Option B**: Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n  - **Raise reserve requirements** decreases the money supply.\n  - **Lower the discount rate** increases the money supply.\n  - **Buy bonds** increases the money supply.\n  - This option contains only Fed actions that increase the money supply.\n\n- **Option C**: Raise reserve requirements; raise the discount rate; sell bonds.\n  - **Raise reserve requirements** decreases the money supply.\n  - **Raise the discount rate** increases the money supply.\n  - **Sell bonds** decreases the money supply.\n  - This option does not contain only Fed actions that increase the money supply.\n\n- **Option D**: Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n  - **Lower reserve requirements** increases the money supply.\n  - **Lower the discount rate** increases the money supply.\n  - **Buy bonds** increases the money supply.\n  - This option contains only Fed actions that increase the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds**.",
