            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is passive.\n- Proton pumps are not passive processes. They actively transport protons across a membrane, which requires energy. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. It depends on DNA.\n- Proton pumps are not directly dependent on DNA. They are enzymes that function based on their structure and the presence of specific amino acids, not on genetic information encoded in DNA. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. It requires ATP.\n- Proton pumps are indeed energy-dependent processes. They use ATP to actively transport protons across the membrane, which is essential for the loading of sugars into the phloem. This is a key characteristic of active transport. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nD. It translocates starch.\n- Proton pumps do not translocate starch. They are involved in the transport of sugars, not starches, into the phloem. This option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is C. It requires ATP. Proton pumps are active transport mechanisms that use ATP to move protons across membranes, facilitating the loading of sugars into the phloem for transport.",
