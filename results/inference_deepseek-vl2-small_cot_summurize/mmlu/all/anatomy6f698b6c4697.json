            "content": "To determine which anatomical region of the abdomen lies just distal to the sternum, we need to understand the layout of the abdominal regions. The abdomen is divided into several regions, each with specific anatomical landmarks.\n\n1. **Epigastric Region**: This region is located just below the sternum and extends to the umbilicus. It is the uppermost part of the abdominal wall and is often associated with the liver and stomach.\n\n2. **Hypochondriac Region**: This region is located below the epigastric region and extends to the umbilicus. It is associated with the liver and gallbladder.\n\n3. **Hypogastric Region**: This region is located below the umbilicus and extends to the pubic symphysis. It is associated with the stomach, liver, and spleen.\n\n4. **Lumbar Region**: This region is located below the hypogastric region and extends to the lower back. It is associated with the kidneys and spine.\n\nGiven this information, the region that lies just distal to the sternum is the **Epigastric** region. This is because the epigastric region is the uppermost abdominal region, immediately below the sternum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Epigastric",
