            "content": "The multiplier effect is a concept in economics that describes how an initial injection of money into an economy leads to a larger overall increase in economic activity. This effect is often associated with the multiplier model, which is used to analyze the impact of government spending or investment on the economy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers.\n- This option describes a situation where the economy is growing, but it does not specifically refer to the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect is more about the impact of initial spending on the economy, not the composition of workers.\n\nB. A ratio of urban to rural workers in an economy.\n- This option describes a demographic ratio, not the economic impact of spending or investment. The multiplier effect is not about the distribution of workers between urban and rural areas.\n\nC. The ratio of city workers to farm workers in an economy.\n- Similar to option B, this describes a demographic ratio and does not relate to the economic impact of spending or investment.\n\nD. The addition of rural jobs created by the urban economy.\n- This option directly relates to the multiplier effect. When an urban economy grows, it creates jobs in rural areas. These rural jobs are a result of the initial spending in the urban economy, which then leads to further economic activity and job creation in the rural areas. This is the essence of the multiplier effect, where the initial investment leads to a chain reaction of economic activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The addition of rural jobs created by the urban economy.",
