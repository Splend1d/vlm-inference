This is because the frequency of a sound wave is directly related to the speed of the source of the sound. As the fire engine moves closer to you, the speed of the siren increases, which in turn increases the frequency of the sound wave. This is why the siren sounds higher-pitched as it gets closer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. frequency",
