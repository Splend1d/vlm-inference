They are primarily involved in the rapid response to infection, particularly bacterial infections. Neutrophils are known for their ability to phagocytose bacteria and other pathogens. They move to the site of infection, engulf and digest the pathogens, and then release enzymes to destroy them.\n\nB. **Plasma cells**: These cells are derived from B cells and are primarily responsible for producing antibodies. They do not directly participate in phagocytosis.\n\nC. **B cells**: Similar to plasma cells, B cells are involved in the production of antibodies. They do not engage in phagocytosis.\n\nD. **Memory cells**: These cells are long-lived B cells that provide long-term immunity. They do not participate in phagocytosis.\n\nGiven this analysis, the cell most closely associated with phagocytosis is the **Neutrophils**. They are the primary cells involved in the phagocytosis process, making them essential for the body's defense against infections.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. Neutrophils**.",
