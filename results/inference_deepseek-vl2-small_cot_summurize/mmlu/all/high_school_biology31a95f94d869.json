It is a thin, delicate membrane that surrounds the embryo and is responsible for the exchange of nutrients and gases between the mother and the fetus. The chorion is derived from the outer layer of the blastocyst and is involved in the formation of the placenta in mammals.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. amnion: The amnion is a thin membrane that surrounds the embryo and amniotic fluid, but it does not provide nourishment to the fetus.\n\nC. placenta: The placenta is a complex organ that develops from the chorion and is involved in the exchange of nutrients and gases between the mother and the fetus. However, it is not the extraembryonic membrane that provides nourishment to the fetus.\n\nD. egg yolk: The egg yolk is a nutrient-rich substance that is found in the egg and provides nourishment to the developing embryo. However, it is not the extraembryonic membrane that provides nourishment to the fetus.",
