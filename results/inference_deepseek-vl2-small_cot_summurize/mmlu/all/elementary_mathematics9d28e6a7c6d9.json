Each pack contains 4 batteries.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA. 22 batteries:\n\\[ 22 \\div 4 = 5 \\text{ remainder } 2 \\]\nSince 22 is not divisible by 4, 22 is not a possible total number of batteries.\n\nB. 26 batteries:\n\\[ 26 \\div 4 = 6 \\text{ remainder } 2 \\]\nSince 26 is not divisible by 4, 26 is not a possible total number of batteries.\n\nC. 28 batteries:\n\\[ 28 \\div 4 = 7 \\]\nSince 28 is divisible by 4, 28 is a possible total number of batteries.\n\nD. 30 batteries:\n\\[ 30 \\div 4 = 7 \\text{ remainder } 2 \\]\nSince 30 is not divisible by 4, 30 is not a possible total number of batteries.\n\nTherefore, the only possible total number of batteries Mrs. Kinney bought is 28.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
