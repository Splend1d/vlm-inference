Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I.

            "content": "The question asks about the result of Stalin's attempt to fix the problem mentioned in the excerpt from Lenin's speech. The problem was that the Soviet Union's industry was not highly developed technically, and the country was not able to maintain its independence without a strong industrial base for defense.\n\nThe excerpt suggests that the Soviet Union needs to develop its industry more quickly and systematically. It also mentions that the Soviet regime and socialist construction should be based on a large-scale and united socialist industry, not a small commodity economy of peasants.\n\nStalin's attempt to fix this problem was through the Five-Year Plans, which were a series of economic plans implemented by the Soviet Union from 1928 to 1941. These plans aimed to rapidly industrialize the country, increase production, and modernize agriculture.\n\nHowever, the results of these plans were not as expected. While the Soviet Union saw some growth in industry, the agricultural sector did not improve as much as expected. This was due to the collectivization of agriculture, which led to a decline in agricultural production.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The Soviet Union saw steady growth in agriculture but industrial production fell behind.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
