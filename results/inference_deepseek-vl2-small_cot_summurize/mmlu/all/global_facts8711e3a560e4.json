            "content": "To determine the median international income as of 2020, we need to understand what the median is and how it applies to income data.\n\n1. **Understanding the Median**: The median is the middle value in a data set when it is arranged in ascending order. If the data set has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle number. If it has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n2. **Data Set Analysis**: The question provides a range of possible values for international income: $300, $1,000, $10,000, and $30,000.\n\n3. **Arranging the Data**: To find the median, we need to arrange these values in ascending order:\n   - $300\n   - $1,000\n   - $10,000\n   - $30,000\n\n4. **Identifying the Middle Value**: Since there are four values, the median will be the average of the two middle values. The two middle values are $1,000 and $10,000.\n\n5. **Calculating the Median**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Median} = \\frac{1,000 + 10,000}{2} = \\frac{11,000}{2} = 5,500\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The median international income as of 2020 is $5,500.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. $30,000**.",
