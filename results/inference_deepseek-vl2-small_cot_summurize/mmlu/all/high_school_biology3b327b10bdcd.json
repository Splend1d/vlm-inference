Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\n\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\n",

            "content": "To determine which phase of cellular respiration releases the most energy, we need to understand the processes involved in each stage:\n\nA. The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, is where pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2. While this process does release energy, it is not the most energy-intensive phase of cellular respiration.\n\nB. The Krebs cycle does produce ATP, but the significant energy release comes from the production of FADH2 and NADH. Each of these molecules can transfer energy to the electron transport chain, releasing 2 ATPs from FADH2 and 3 ATPs from NADH. This makes the Krebs cycle a major energy-releasing phase.\n\nC. Oxidative phosphorylation is the final stage of cellular respiration. It involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to the electron transport chain, which ultimately leads to the production of ATP. This process releases the most energy because it directly converts the potential energy stored in the high-energy molecules into ATP.\n\nD. The breakdown of water (H2O) into H+ and O2 is part of the electron transport chain, but it does not release the most energy. The energy is primarily stored in the form of ATP, not in the water itself.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the correct answer is C. Oxidative phosphorylation releases the most energy because it directly converts the potential energy stored in NADH and FADH2 into ATP, which is the primary energy currency of the cell.",
