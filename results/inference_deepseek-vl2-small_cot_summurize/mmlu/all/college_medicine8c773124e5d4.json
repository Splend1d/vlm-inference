            "content": "To determine which statement is false, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire.\n- This statement is true. Hyperpolarization makes the neuron less likely to fire another action potential immediately, thus regulating the firing rate.\n\nB. The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential.\n- This statement is true. During the depolarization phase, sodium ions flow into the neuron, making the inside of the neuron more positive relative to the outside.\n\nC. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.\n- This statement is false. Neurotransmitters are secreted from the axon terminal, not the dendrites. The axon terminal is the site where neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft to communicate with the next neuron.\n\nD. An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential.\n- This statement is true. The axon hillock is the region where the action potential is initiated, and it reaches the threshold potential when the cumulative effect of ion channels opening and closing results in a sufficient positive charge inside the neuron.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is C. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.",
