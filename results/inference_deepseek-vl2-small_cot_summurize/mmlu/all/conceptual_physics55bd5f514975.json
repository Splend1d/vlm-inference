This is known as relativistic mass. Therefore, if you were to travel at a speed close to the speed of light, your mass would indeed change.\n\nB. **Pulse decreases**: The concept of pulse in this context refers to the frequency of your heartbeat or any other periodic process. As you approach the speed of light, time dilation occurs, which means that time appears to slow down for you relative to observers on Earth. This effect would cause your pulse to decrease because time is passing more slowly for you.\n\nC. **Both of these**: Since both options A and B are correct, this is the correct choice.\n\nD. **Neither of these**: This option is incorrect because both options A and B are valid effects of traveling at a speed close to the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both of these.",
