            "content": "The Associative Property of Multiplication states that the way in which numbers are grouped in a multiplication operation does not change the product. Therefore, 8 \u2022 (\u22127) \u2022 (\u22121) simplifies to 8 \u2022 (\u22127 \u2022 (\u22121)), which equals 8 \u2022 (\u22127) \u2022 1. Since 1 is the identity element for multiplication, it does not change the product, so the simplified expression is 8 \u2022 (\u22127) \u2022 1 = 8 \u2022 (\u22127) = \u221256.\n\nThe correct answer is: D",
