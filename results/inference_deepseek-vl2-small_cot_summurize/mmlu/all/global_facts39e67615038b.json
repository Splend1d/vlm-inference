            "content": "To determine the GDP per capita in the United States in 1950 when adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Concept of PPP (Purchasing Power Parity):** PPP is a method of measuring the value of different currencies by comparing their purchasing power. It adjusts for differences in the cost of living between countries.\n\n2. **Determine the GDP in 1950:** The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1950 for the United States was approximately $280 billion.\n\n3. **Adjust for Inflation:** To adjust for inflation, we use the GDP deflator, which measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for goods and services. The GDP deflator for 1950 was about 12.\n\n4. **Calculate the GDP in 2011 Prices:** To convert the 1950 GDP to 2011 prices, we multiply the 1950 GDP by the GDP deflator for 1950:\n   \\[\n   \\text{GDP in 2011 prices} = 280 \\text{ billion} \\times 12 = 3360 \\text{ billion}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate GDP Per Capita:** GDP per capita is the total GDP divided by the population. The U.S. population in 1950 was approximately 152 million.\n   \\[\n   \\text{GDP per capita in 2011 prices} = \\frac{3360 \\text{ billion}}{152 \\text{ million}} \\approx 22.1 \\text{ thousand}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Convert to USD:** To convert this to U.S. dollars, we use the average exchange rate for 2011, which is approximately $1.30 per 100 PPP.\n   \\[\n   \\text{GDP per capita in USD} = 22.1 \\text{ thousand} \\times 1.30 = 28.73 \\text{ thousand}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Round to the Nearest Thousand:** Rounding 28.73 to the nearest thousand gives us approximately $30k.\n\nTherefore, the GDP per capita in the United States in 1950 when adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices is about $30k.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. About $30k**.",
