England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\n2. China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.\n\nLet's match these parts with the given formulas:\n\nA. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n\nWe need to find a formula that matches both parts of the sentence. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n- This formula matches the first part of the sentence: \"England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n- However, it does not match the second part of the sentence: \"China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.\"\n\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\n- This formula does not match either part of the sentence.\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\n- This formula matches both parts of the sentence:\n  - \"England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" matches the first part.\n  - \"China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds\" matches the second part.\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n- This formula does not match either part of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is option C:\n\nC.
