            "content": "To determine the gender and orientation of the individual, we need to consider the following aspects:\n\n1. **Gender Identity**: The individual identifies as a female, which is consistent with the gender identity they have chosen. This is a key aspect of their identity.\n\n2. **Sexual Orientation**: The individual is sexually active with females only. This indicates that they are attracted to women, which is a fundamental component of their sexual orientation.\n\n3. **Gender Expression**: The individual's gender expression aligns with their gender identity, as they present as female and use She/Her pronouns.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Cis-gender, heterosexual**: This option suggests that the individual is cisgender ( aligning with their gender identity) and heterosexual (attracted to the opposite gender). This does not fit the individual's self-identification as a female and her sexual orientation.\n\nB. **Transgender, heterosexual**: This option suggests that the individual is transgender (aligning with their gender identity) but heterosexual (attracted to the opposite gender). This does not fit the individual's sexual orientation, as she is attracted to females.\n\nC. **Cis-gender, homosexual**: This option suggests that the individual is cisgender (aligning with their gender identity) but homosexual (attracted to the same gender). This does not fit the individual's gender identity, as she identifies as female.\n\nD. **Transgender, homosexual**: This option correctly identifies the individual as transgender (aligning with their gender identity) and homosexual (attracted to the same gender). This option accurately reflects the individual's gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Transgender, homosexual**.",
