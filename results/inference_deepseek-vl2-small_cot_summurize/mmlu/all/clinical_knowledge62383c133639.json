It is characterized by a round head that fits into a cup-like cavity.\n\nB. **Fused joint**: This type of joint is not found in the human body. It is a type of joint that is not present in the anatomy of the human body.\n\nC. **Synovial hinge joint**: This type of joint allows movement in one plane, similar to a door hinge. It is characterized by a rounded head that fits into a shallow socket. The elbow is a classic example of a synovial hinge joint, allowing flexion and extension movements.\n\nD. **Plain joint**: This type of joint is not a recognized anatomical term. It is not a type of joint found in the human body.\n\nGiven these explanations, the elbow is a synovial hinge joint. It allows for flexion and extension, which are the primary movements at the elbow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Synovial hinge joint.",
