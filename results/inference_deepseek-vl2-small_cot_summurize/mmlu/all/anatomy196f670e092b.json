Therefore, this option is unlikely.\n\nB. **To be palpable extraorally.**\n   - The submandibular gland is a major salivary gland located in the floor of the mouth. It is palpable as a firm, rubbery mass when the mouth is closed, and it can be felt through the skin of the floor of the mouth. This option is correct.\n\nC. **To be palpable both intra- and extraorally.**\n   - While the submandibular gland is palpable extraorally, it is not typically palpable intraorally. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Only to be detectable by radiographical examination.**\n   - While radiographs can be used to assess the size and shape of the submandibular gland, it is not the only method of detection. Palpation is a common and effective way to assess its enlargement. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. To be palpable extraorally.",
