Bubblesort: The running time of bubblesort is \u0398(n^2) in the worst case, as it requires n comparisons and n-1 swaps. However, on average, it has a running time of \u0398(n log n) due to its divide-and-conquer approach.\n\nB. Mergesort: The running time of mergesort is \u0398(n log n) in the worst case, as it requires n comparisons and n-1 swaps. On average, it also has a running time of \u0398(n log n) due to its divide-and-conquer approach.\n\nC. Heapsort: The running time of heapsort is \u0398(n log n) in the worst case, as it requires n comparisons and n-1 swaps. On average, it also has a running time of \u0398(n log n) due to its divide-and-conquer approach.\n\nD. Quicksort: The running time of quicksort is \u0398(n log n) in the worst case, as it requires n comparisons and n-1 swaps. On average, it also has a running time of \u0398(n log n) due to its divide-and-conquer approach.\n\nAll the algorithms have the same running time in the worst case, but they have different running times on average. However, the question asks for the algorithm with running time \u0398(n^2) in the worst case but \u0398(n log n) on average, which is not possible for any of the algorithms listed. Therefore, none of the options are correct.",
