Contribute money to candidates for election: This is a function of PACs, but it is not their primary function. While PACs do contribute money to candidates, this is a means to an end rather than the end itself.\n\nB. Coordinate local get-out-the-vote campaigns: This is also a function of PACs, but again, it is not their primary function. While PACs may coordinate get-out-the-vote efforts, this is a specific activity they engage in, not their main purpose.\n\nC. Promote the defeat of incumbents in the federal and state legislatures: This is the primary function of PACs. PACs are established to support candidates who are not incumbents, aiming to unseat them in elections. This is their main purpose, as they seek to influence the political landscape by promoting new candidates and challenging established ones.\n\nD. Organize protest demonstrations and other acts of civil disobedience: This is not a function of PACs. While PACs may support candidates who advocate for certain policies, they do not organize protests or civil disobedience themselves.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the primary function of PACs is to promote the defeat of incumbents in the federal and state legislatures. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Promote the defeat of incumbents in the federal and state legislatures.",
