The sequence of amino acids in hemoglobin is highly conserved across species because it is crucial for oxygen transport.\n\n2. **Sequence Similarity**: The fact that the hemoglobin sequence in humans is more similar to that in chimpanzees than in dogs suggests a closer evolutionary relationship between humans and chimpanzees.\n\n3. **Evolutionary Relationships**: Humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor and are more closely related than humans and dogs. This is because humans and chimpanzees have a more recent common ancestor compared to humans and dogs.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The similarity in hemoglobin sequences does not imply that humans and dogs are more closely related than humans and chimpanzees.\n   - **Option B**: Correct. The similarity in hemoglobin sequences suggests that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related than humans and dogs.\n   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The similarity does not imply that humans are related to chimpanzees but not to dogs.\n   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The term \"analogous\" is not used in this context. The correct term is \"similar\" or \"related.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. humans and chimpanzees are more closely related than humans and dogs**.",
