            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Meroblastic cleavage**: This type of cleavage occurs when the entire cell divides, resulting in two cells of equal size. It is not associated with oblique angles or polar axes.\n\nB. **Radial cleavage**: This cleavage pattern occurs when the cell divides perpendicular to the polar axis, resulting in cells that are more elongated. It does not involve oblique angles.\n\nC. **Spiral cleavage**: This is the correct answer. Spiral cleavage occurs when the cell divides at an oblique angle to the polar axis. This results in cells that are not equal in size and often have a spiral shape. The oblique angle is a key characteristic of this type of cleavage.\n\nD. **Superficial cleavage**: This type of cleavage involves the division of the cell surface, resulting in cells that are not equal in size. It does not involve oblique angles or polar axes.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the cleavage symmetry that arises from early cell divisions at an oblique angle to the polar axis is best described by **spiral cleavage**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. spiral cleavage**.",
