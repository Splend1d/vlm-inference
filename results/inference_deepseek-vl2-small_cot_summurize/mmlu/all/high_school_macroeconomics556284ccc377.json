            "content": "To determine which scenario would lead to a decrease in potential GDP, we need to understand what potential GDP represents. Potential GDP is the maximum output an economy can produce when it is operating at full capacity, without causing inflation. It is determined by the level of resources available, such as labor, capital, and technology.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The unemployment rate rises.**\n   - If the unemployment rate rises, it means that more people are not working than would be optimal for the economy. This could be due to a lack of jobs, people choosing not to work, or other factors. When unemployment is high, the economy is not utilizing its full capacity of labor, which reduces the potential output. Therefore, an increase in the unemployment rate would lead to a decrease in potential GDP.\n\nB. **The retirement age is lowered.**\n   - Lowering the retirement age would mean that more people are working longer, which could increase the labor force. This would likely increase the potential output of the economy, as more people are contributing to production. Thus, this option would not lead to a decrease in potential GDP.\n\nC. **Tariffs protecting domestic jobs are eliminated.**\n   - Eliminating tariffs that protect domestic jobs would likely increase competition from foreign goods, which could lead to a decrease in domestic production. This might reduce the overall output of the economy, but it would not necessarily decrease potential GDP, as potential GDP is determined by the maximum output an economy can produce, not by the level of protectionism.\n\nD. **More immigration is allowed.**\n   - Allowing more immigration would increase the labor force, as more people would be available to work. This would likely increase the potential output of the economy, as more people are contributing to production. Therefore, this option would not lead to a decrease in potential GDP.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The unemployment rate rises.",
