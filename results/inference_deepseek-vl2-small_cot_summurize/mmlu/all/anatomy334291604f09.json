Abduction: This refers to the movement of a limb away from the body's midline. For example, when you move your arm away from your body, you are abducting it.\n\nB. Eversion: This is the movement of a limb away from the body's midline. It is the opposite of adduction. For example, when you turn your foot outward, you are everting it.\n\nC. Flexion: This is the movement of a limb toward the body's midline. For example, when you bend your elbow, you are flexing it.\n\nD. Pronation: This is the movement of the forearm that turns the palm downward. It is the opposite of supination, where the palm is facing upward.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct term that describes the motion of bending the forearm toward the body is:\n\nC. Flexion",
