            "content": "To determine which instruction-set feature is NOT an obstacle to aggressive pipelining, we need to understand the concept of pipelining and how it relates to instruction-set features.\n\nPipelining is a technique used in computer architecture to improve the performance of a processor by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. This is achieved by breaking down the instruction execution process into stages, such as instruction fetch, decode, execute, and write back.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Condition codes set by every instruction**: Condition codes are used to determine the outcome of an instruction's execution, such as whether an instruction should be executed or not. If every instruction sets a condition code, it can complicate the pipeline by requiring additional logic to handle these conditions, potentially slowing down the pipeline. However, this is not inherently an obstacle to aggressive pipelining, as the pipeline can be designed to handle condition codes efficiently.\n\nB. **Variable-length encoding of instructions**: Variable-length encoding means that instructions can have different lengths. This can be a challenge for pipelining because it requires the pipeline to be flexible enough to handle instructions of varying lengths. However, this is not an inherent obstacle to aggressive pipelining, as the pipeline can be designed to handle variable-length instructions by adjusting the pipeline stages accordingly.\n\nC. **Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute**: This is a significant obstacle to aggressive pipelining. If instructions require widely varying numbers of cycles to execute, it can lead to pipeline stalls and inefficiencies. The pipeline needs to be able to handle a wide range of instruction execution times, which can be challenging.\n\nD. **Several different classes (sets) of registers**: Having multiple classes of registers can complicate pipelining because it requires the pipeline to manage different types of registers efficiently. However, this is not an inherent obstacle to aggressive pipelining, as the pipeline can be designed to handle different register classes by adjusting the pipeline stages.\n\nBased on this analysis, the instruction-set feature that is NOT generally considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining is:\n\nC. Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute.",
