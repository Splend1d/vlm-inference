According to the 2020 data, only about 10% of over 65s are providing informal care. This figure is based on the number of people who are providing care for others, not the percentage of the over 65 population.\n\nB. One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.\n- This statement is correct. The data indicates that approximately 16% of the over 65 population are providing informal care. This figure reflects the proportion of older adults who are actively involved in caregiving roles.\n\nC. Informal carers should not be included in discharge planning.\n- This statement is incorrect. Including informal carers in discharge planning is crucial. They play a significant role in the care of the patient, and their involvement can enhance the quality of care and support for the patient and family.\n\nD. The majority of informal carers are fit and active.\n- This statement is incorrect. Many informal carers are not fit and active. They often face physical, emotional, and financial challenges while providing care, which can impact their health and well-being.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is B. One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.",
