            "content": "To find the probability that exactly 2 out of 3 selected suitcases are damaged, we can use the concept of combinations and the formula for probability.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25. This is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nFor our case, \\( n = 25 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\), so the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases is:\n\n\\[ C(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25-3)!} = \\frac{25!}{3!22!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2300 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 and 1 non-damaged suitcase out of 20. This is given by the combination formula again:\n\n\\[ C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ C(20, 1) = \\frac{20!}{1!(20-1)!} = \\frac{20!}{1!19!} = 20 \\]\n\nThe number of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases and 1 non-damaged suitcase is the product of these two combinations:\n\n\\[ C(5, 2) \\times C(20, 1) = 10 \\times 20 = 200 \\]\n\nFinally, the probability that exactly 2 out of 3 selected suitcases are damaged is the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 damaged suitcases and 1 non-damaged suitcase) divided by the total number of outcomes (choosing any 3 suitcases):\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 damaged suitcases}) = \\frac{C(5, 2) \\times C(20, 1)}{C(25, 3)} = \\frac{200}{2300} = \\frac{20}{230} = \\frac{2}{23} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ C \\]",
