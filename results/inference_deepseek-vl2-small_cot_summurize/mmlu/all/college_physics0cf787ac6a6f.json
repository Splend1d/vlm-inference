            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors. We can use the relationship between the velocity, acceleration, and position of a particle moving in a circle.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( v \\) as the particle's velocity,\n- \\( a \\) as the particle's acceleration,\n- \\( r \\) as the radius of the circle,\n- \\( \\theta \\) as the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( v = 10 \\) m/s,\n- \\( a = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2,\n- \\( r = 10 \\) m.\n\nThe acceleration \\( a \\) is related to the velocity \\( v \\) and the radius \\( r \\) by the centripetal acceleration formula:\n\\[ a = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ 10 = \\frac{10^2}{10} \\]\n\\[ 10 = 10 \\]\n\nThis confirms that the given values are consistent.\n\nNext, we need to find the angle \\( \\theta \\) between the velocity and acceleration vectors. The acceleration vector \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) can be expressed in terms of the velocity vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) and the radius vector \\( \\mathbf{r} \\):\n\\[ \\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{r}}{r^2} \\]\n\nThe cross product \\( \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{r} \\) is perpendicular to both \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{r} \\). Therefore, the acceleration vector \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) is perpendicular to the velocity vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\).\n\nSince the acceleration vector \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) is perpendicular to the velocity vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\), the angle \\( \\theta \\) between the velocity and acceleration vectors is:\n\\[ \\theta = 90^\\circ \\]\n\nThus, the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90^\\circ} \\]",
