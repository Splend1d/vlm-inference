A conditional statement is typically structured as \"if P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.\n\nIn the given proposition:\n- The antecedent is \"The Bees winning their first game.\"\n- The consequent is \"either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks not winning their first game.\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Aardvarks do not win their first game.\n- This is the consequent of the conditional statement, not the antecedent.\n\nB. The Bees win their first game.\n- This is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nC. The Chipmunks do not win their first game.\n- This is the consequent of the conditional statement, not the antecedent.\n\nD. Either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first game.\n- This is the consequent of the conditional statement, not the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the conditional proposition is \"The Bees win their first game.\"\n\nThe correct answer is B.
