This is because the force exerted by the cannon on the cannonball is equal to the force exerted by the cannonball on the cannon. This is a fundamental principle of Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. amounts of force",
