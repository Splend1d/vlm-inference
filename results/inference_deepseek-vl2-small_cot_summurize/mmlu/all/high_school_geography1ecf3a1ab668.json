They can prevent or cure illnesses that were previously fatal, thereby lowering overall mortality.\n\nB. **Improved birth control methods**: Birth control methods can reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, which in turn can decrease infant mortality rates. They also help in managing population growth, which can indirectly reduce mortality by improving living conditions.\n\nC. **Pesticides**: Pesticides are chemicals used to control pests that can harm crops. While they can increase food production, they can also have negative health impacts, such as poisoning, which can increase mortality rates. Therefore, they do not have a positive impact on reducing mortality.\n\nD. **Famine relief**: Famine relief efforts can provide immediate food and medical aid, which can significantly reduce mortality rates by addressing the immediate needs of affected populations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the factor that has little or no impact on mortality rates in developing countries is:\n\nC.
