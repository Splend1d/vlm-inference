Start by dividing 77 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 77 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\n\n2. Move to the next prime number, which is 3. 77 divided by 3 is 25 with a remainder of 2. So, 77 is not divisible by 3.\n\n3. Try the next prime number, which is 5. 77 divided by 5 is 15 with a remainder of 2. So, 77 is not divisible by 5.\n\n4. Try the next prime number, which is 7. 77 divided by 7 is 11 with no remainder. So, 77 is divisible by 7.\n\n5. Now, we have 77 = 7 * 11.\n\n6. We need to check if 11 is a prime number. Since 11 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number.\n\n7. Therefore, the prime factorization of 77 is 7 * 11.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 7 * 11.",
