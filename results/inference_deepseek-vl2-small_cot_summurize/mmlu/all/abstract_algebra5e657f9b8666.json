            "content": "Let's analyze each statement step by step to determine their truth values.\n\n**Statement 1: Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.**\n\nTo understand this, we need to recall some basic properties of rings and their quotient rings.\n\n1. **Commutative Ring**: A ring \\( R \\) is commutative if for all \\( a, b \\in R \\), \\( a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a \\).\n\n2. **Quotient Ring**: Let \\( R \\) be a commutative ring and \\( I \\) be an ideal of \\( R \\). The quotient ring \\( R/I \\) is defined as the set of all cosets of \\( I \\) in \\( R \\). The addition and multiplication in \\( R/I \\) are defined component-wise:\n   - For \\( a, b \\in R \\), \\( (a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I \\).\n   - For \\( a, b \\in R \\), \\( (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I \\).\n\n3. **Commutativity in Quotient Ring**: For the quotient ring \\( R/I \\) to be commutative, it must satisfy:\n   - For all \\( a, b \\in R \\), \\( (a + I)(b + I) = (b + I)(a + I) \\).\n\nHowever, the condition \\( (a + I)(b + I) = (b + I)(a + I) \\) is not sufficient to ensure commutativity. For example, consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) with the ideal \\( 2\\mathbb{Z} \\). The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\) is not commutative because \\( (1 + 2\\mathbb{Z})(1 + 2\\mathbb{Z}) = 1 + 2\\mathbb{Z} \\neq 1 + 2\\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nTherefore, the statement that every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring is false.\n\n**Statement 2: An ideal \\( N \\) in a ring \\( R \\) with unity \\( 1 \\) is all of \\( R \\) if and only if \\( 1 \\in N \\).**\n\n1. **Definition of Ideal**: An ideal \\( N \\) in a ring \\( R \\) is a subset of \\( R \\) that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\).\n\n2. **All of \\( R \\) as Ideal**: If \\( N \\) is an ideal of \\( R \\) and \\( 1 \\in N \\), then \\( N \\) is closed under addition and multiplication by \\( 1 \\). This means that for any \\( a, b \\in R \\), \\( a + b \\in N \\) and \\( a \\cdot 1 \\in N \\). Therefore, \\( N \\) is closed under addition and multiplication by \\( 1 \\), making \\( N \\) an ideal of \\( R \\).\n\n3. **N is All of \\( R \\)**: If \\( N \\) is an ideal of \\( R \\) and \\( N = R \\), then \\( N \\) is closed under addition and multiplication by any element of \\( R \\). This means that for any \\( a, b \\in R \\), \\( a + b \\in N \\) and \\( a \\cdot b \\in N \\). Therefore, \\( N \\) is closed under addition and multiplication by any element of \\( R \\), making \\( N \\) an ideal of \\( R \\).\n\nSince both directions of the statement are true, the statement that an ideal \\( N \\) in a ring \\( R \\) with unity \\( 1 \\) is all of \\( R \\) if and only if \\( 1 \\in N \\) is true.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
