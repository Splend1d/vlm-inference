            "content": "To determine which muscles are active during quiet inspiration, we need to understand the mechanics of breathing. Quiet inspiration is a passive process where the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles work together to increase the volume of the thoracic cavity without changing the pressure inside the lungs.\n\n1. **External Intercostal Muscles**: These muscles are located between the ribs and are responsible for elevating the ribs during inspiration. They do not change the volume of the thoracic cavity but help in increasing the thoracic cavity's size.\n\n2. **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is a large, dome-shaped muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. During quiet inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. This increase in volume leads to a decrease in pressure inside the lungs, allowing air to flow in.\n\n3. **Internal Intercostal Muscles**: These muscles are located between the ribs and are responsible for compressing the ribs during inspiration. They do not change the volume of the thoracic cavity but help in increasing the thoracic cavity's size.\n\nGiven this understanding, the muscles that are active during quiet inspiration are the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. These muscles work together to increase the volume of the thoracic cavity, facilitating passive inhalation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm",
