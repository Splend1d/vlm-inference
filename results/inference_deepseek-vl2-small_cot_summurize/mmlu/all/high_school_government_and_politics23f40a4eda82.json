            "content": "To determine which of the options represents an implied power of Congress, we need to understand the concept of implied powers. Implied powers are those not explicitly stated in the Constitution but are necessary to execute the enumerated powers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Regulation of interstate commerce: This is an enumerated power of Congress, explicitly stated in the Constitution. It is one of the powers granted to Congress in Article I, Section 8, Clause 3.\n\nB. Borrowing money on the credit of the United States: This is also an enumerated power of Congress, as stated in Article I, Section 8, Clause 2. It involves the power to borrow money to pay debts and provide for the public needs.\n\nC. Oversight of executive branch agencies: This is not an enumerated power of Congress. While Congress has the power to conduct oversight, this is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. However, it is considered an implied power because it is necessary to ensure that the executive branch is acting within its authority and in the best interest of the nation.\n\nD. Declarations of war: This is an enumerated power of Congress, as stated in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11. It involves the power to declare war, which is a specific responsibility given to Congress.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Oversight of executive branch agencies. This is an implied power because it is necessary to ensure that the executive branch operates within its constitutional limits and that Congress can effectively check its actions.",
