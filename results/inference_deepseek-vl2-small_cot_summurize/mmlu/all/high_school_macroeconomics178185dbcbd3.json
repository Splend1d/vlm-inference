            "content": "To understand the domestic purchasing power of a currency, we need to consider how it is affected by various economic factors. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **varies directly with the cost of living**: This statement is incorrect. The purchasing power of a currency is not directly related to the cost of living. The cost of living refers to the average amount of money required to maintain a certain standard of living, which is influenced by factors like housing, food, and transportation costs. Purchasing power, on the other hand, is about how much goods and services a currency can buy.\n\nB. **is inversely related to the savings rate**: This statement is incorrect. The savings rate is the proportion of income that is saved rather than spent. While savings can affect the overall economic health of a country, it does not directly influence the purchasing power of a currency. Purchasing power is more about the value of money in terms of goods and services.\n\nC. **is inversely related to the price level**: This statement is correct. The purchasing power of a currency is inversely related to the price level. When the price level rises, the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services, which means the purchasing power of the currency decreases. Conversely, when the price level falls, the purchasing power increases because the same amount of money can buy more goods and services.\n\nD. **varies directly with economic growth**: This statement is incorrect. Economic growth refers to an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy over time. While economic growth can affect the overall value of a currency, it does not directly determine the purchasing power of a currency. Purchasing power is more about the relative value of money in terms of goods and services.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The purchasing power of a currency is inversely related to the price level.",
