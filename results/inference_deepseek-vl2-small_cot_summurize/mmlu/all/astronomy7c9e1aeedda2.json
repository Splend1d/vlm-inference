This type occurs in binary systems.\n- Type-Ia supernovae are not typically associated with binary systems. They are usually found in isolated environments. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. This type occurs in young galaxies.\n- Type-Ia supernovae are more commonly found in older galaxies, not young ones. They are often used as \"standard candles\" to measure cosmic distances. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. This type produces gamma-ray bursts.\n- Type-Ia supernovae are known to produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This is a significant characteristic of these supernovae, making this statement correct.\n\nD. This type produces high amounts of X-rays.\n- Type-Ia supernovae are not known for producing high amounts of X-rays. They are primarily associated with visible light and sometimes ultraviolet emissions. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. This type produces gamma-ray bursts.",
