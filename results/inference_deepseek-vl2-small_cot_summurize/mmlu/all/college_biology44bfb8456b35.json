            "content": "To determine which of the listed options is not homeostatic in mammals, we need to understand what homeostasis means. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions.\n\nA. Body temperature: Mammals are homeostatic for body temperature. They regulate their body temperature to maintain a constant range, typically around 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), through mechanisms such as sweating, shivering, and adjusting blood flow to the skin.\n\nB. Blood glucose concentration: Mammals are also homeostatic for blood glucose concentration. They maintain a stable level of glucose in the blood through processes like gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and the release of insulin and glucagon, which help regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nC. Blood pH: Mammals are homeostatic for blood pH. They maintain a narrow range of blood pH, typically around 7.4, through mechanisms such as the bicarbonate buffer system and the regulation of hydrogen ion concentration.\n\nD. Metabolic rate: Mammals are not homeostatic for metabolic rate. Metabolic rate refers to the rate at which an organism processes nutrients to produce energy. While mammals can adjust their metabolic rate in response to changes in environmental conditions (such as cold or heat), they do not maintain a constant metabolic rate. Instead, they adjust it to meet the energy demands of the body.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Mammals are not homeostatic for metabolic rate.",
