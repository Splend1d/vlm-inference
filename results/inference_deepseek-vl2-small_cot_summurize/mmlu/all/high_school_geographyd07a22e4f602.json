            "content": "To determine which option is NOT a spread effect in the core-periphery model of development, we need to understand the characteristics of this model. The core-periphery model describes the relationship between a central, developed area (the core) and a surrounding, less developed area (the periphery).\n\nA. Congestion in the core: This is a spread effect because as the core area becomes more developed, it experiences increased population density and resource consumption, leading to congestion.\n\nB. High cost of labor in the core: This is also a spread effect. As the core area becomes more developed, the demand for skilled labor increases, driving up wages and making it more expensive to hire workers.\n\nC. High density in the core: This is a spread effect as well. As the core area grows, it becomes more densely populated due to increased residential and commercial development.\n\nD. More infrastructure in the core: This is not a spread effect. Instead, it is a core effect. The core area is typically characterized by more developed infrastructure, such as roads, utilities, and public services, because it is the focal point of economic activity and development.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. More infrastructure in the core, as it is a core effect rather than a spread effect.",
