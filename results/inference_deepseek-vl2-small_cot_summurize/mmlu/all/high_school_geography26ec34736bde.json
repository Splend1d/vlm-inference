            "content": "To determine which statement is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, we need to understand the key components of this theory. Myrdal's theory posits that the core regions of the world economy, which are typically industrialized and technologically advanced, tend to dominate the periphery regions, which are less developed and often rely on the core for trade and economic opportunities.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\n- This statement contradicts Myrdal's theory, which suggests that the core and periphery have different levels of wealth and development. The core typically has more wealth and resources, while the periphery often remains underdeveloped.\n\nB. The core will always dominate the periphery.\n- This statement aligns with Myrdal's theory, which suggests that the core will continue to dominate the periphery due to its technological and economic advantages.\n\nC. Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\n- This statement is consistent with Myrdal's theory, as it highlights the idea that the core's growth and prosperity often come at the expense of the periphery, which may experience underdevelopment and exploitation.\n\nD. Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\n- This statement is also part of Myrdal's theory, as it describes how the core regions maintain and expand their advantages by attracting resources and trade from the periphery.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option A is the statement that does not align with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.",
