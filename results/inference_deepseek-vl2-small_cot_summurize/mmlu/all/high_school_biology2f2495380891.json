It is specifically associated with the X chromosome, not the Y chromosome.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect. A Barr body is not an inactivated Y chromosome. It is specifically associated with the X chromosome, not the Y chromosome.\n\nC. This statement is correct. A Barr body is indeed an inactivated X chromosome. In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in each cell, resulting in a Barr body. This inactivation is crucial for dosage compensation, ensuring that females do not have twice the amount of X-linked genes as males.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect. A Barr body is not an inactivated X chromosome. It is specifically associated with the X chromosome, not the Y chromosome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome and results in females with half their cells having one X inactivated and the other half of their cells having the other X inactivated.",
