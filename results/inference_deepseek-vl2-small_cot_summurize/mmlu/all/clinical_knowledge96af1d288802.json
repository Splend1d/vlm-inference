A hypertonic solution has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. This is incorrect because a hypertonic solution would cause water to move out of the cell, leading to cell shrinkage or crenation, not blockage of tubes.\n\nB. A hypertonic solution blocks off enteral tubes easily. This is incorrect because the primary effect of a hypertonic solution is to cause water to move out of the cell, not to block tubes.\n\nC. A hypertonic solution has a lower concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. This is correct. In a hypertonic solution, the concentration of solutes outside the cell is higher than inside the cell. This causes water to move out of the cell into the hypertonic solution, leading to cell shrinkage.\n\nD. A hypertonic solution has a high fiber content. This is incorrect because the solute concentration, not fiber content, is the determining factor in a hypertonic solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A hypertonic solution has a lower concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.",
