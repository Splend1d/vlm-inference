Recursive procedures: Recursive procedures use the call stack to store function calls. Each recursive call adds a new entry to the stack, and the stack is used to manage the return addresses and local variables. This inherently requires stack-based storage allocation.\n\nB. Arbitrary goto's: goto statements allow for unconditional jumps to any label in the program. This does not inherently require stack-based storage allocation, as the program can manage jumps without relying on the stack.\n\nC. Two-dimensional arrays: Arrays are typically allocated on the stack, but the allocation is not necessarily stack-based. The stack can be used to store the array elements, but the allocation mechanism is not inherently stack-based.\n\nD. Integer-valued functions: Integer-valued functions do not inherently require stack-based storage allocation. They can be implemented using other data structures, such as arrays or linked lists, without relying on the stack.\n\nBased on this analysis, the language feature that requires stack-based storage allocation is:\n\nA.
