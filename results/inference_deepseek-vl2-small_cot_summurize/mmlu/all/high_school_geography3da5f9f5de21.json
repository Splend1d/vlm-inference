It is more about the flexibility and adaptability of production rather than the spatial distribution of activities.\n\nB. **Dglomeration**: This term is not commonly used in economics or urban planning. It might be a misspelling or a term used in a specific context that is not widely recognized.\n\nC. **Agglomeration**: This is the correct term. Agglomeration refers to the clustering of economic activities and people in a particular area, which can lead to increased efficiency and benefits for everyone involved. This principle is often observed in urban areas where businesses and people are concentrated, leading to better access to services, infrastructure, and markets.\n\nD. **Infrastructure**: This term refers to the basic facilities and systems serving a country or region, such as transportation, communication, water supply, and waste disposal. While infrastructure is crucial for economic activities, it is not specifically about the concentration of production activities and people.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Agglomeration.",
