The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols.\nB. The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer's protocol to the other computer's protocol.\nC. The computers can communicate directly only if the messages consist of text; other formats cannot be interpreted across computers.\nD.

The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols.\n- This statement is incorrect. While different manufacturers may use different protocols, the Internet is designed to support multiple communication protocols. Protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP are examples of how different systems can communicate with each other.\n\nB. The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer's protocol to the other computer's protocol.\n- This statement is also incorrect. The Internet is designed to handle data packets in a standardized way, allowing different systems to communicate without the need for additional hardware to convert protocols.\n\nC. The computers can communicate directly only if the messages consist of text; other formats cannot be interpreted across computers.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Internet supports various data formats, including text, images, audio, and video. Protocols like HTTP and FTP are used to transfer different types of data.\n\nD. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n- This statement is correct. The Internet uses standardized communication protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, which allow different systems to communicate with each other regardless of the manufacturer. These protocols ensure that data can be transmitted and interpreted correctly across different devices and systems.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the ability of the two computers to communicate across the Internet is:\n\nD. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.",
