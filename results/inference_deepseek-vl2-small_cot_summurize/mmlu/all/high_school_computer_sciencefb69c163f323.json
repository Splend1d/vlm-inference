            "content": "To determine which option has the greatest potential for compromising a user's personal privacy, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **A group of cookies stored by the user's Web browser**: Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's device by websites they visit. They can contain information such as login credentials, preferences, and browsing history. While cookies can provide convenience and functionality, they can also be used to track a user's online activities. However, they are generally less sensitive than other personal information.\n\nB. **The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer**: The IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It can be used to trace the user's location and online activities. However, it is less specific than other personal information and can be masked or changed relatively easily.\n\nC. **The user's e-mail address**: An e-mail address is a direct identifier of a user and can be used to access their online accounts, including social media, banking, and other sensitive information. It is a more personal and specific piece of information compared to IP addresses or cookies.\n\nD. **The user's public key used for encryption**: A public key is part of a cryptographic system used for secure communication. It is used to encrypt messages and verify digital signatures. While it is important for security, it does not directly reveal personal information about the user.\n\nConsidering the potential impact on privacy, the user's e-mail address (Option C) has the greatest potential for compromising personal privacy because it is a direct identifier that can be used to access a wide range of personal and sensitive information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The user's e-mail address.",
