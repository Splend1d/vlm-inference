In Africa, which is the poorest region of the world with the lowest overall economic growth.\n- This option suggests that Africa has the greatest population growth rate and is the poorest region with the lowest economic growth. However, Africa is not the poorest region of the world.\n\nB. In Asia, which is the poorest region of the world with a steady overall economic growth.\n- This option suggests that Asia is the poorest region of the world with a steady economic growth. However, Asia is not the poorest region of the world.\n\nC. In Asia, which is the poorest region of the world with the lowest overall economic growth.\n- This option suggests that Asia is the poorest region of the world with the lowest economic growth. This is consistent with the information provided in the question.\n\nD. In Africa, which is the poorest region of the world with a steady overall economic growth.\n- This option suggests that Africa is the poorest region of the world with a steady economic growth. However, Africa is not the poorest region of the world.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
