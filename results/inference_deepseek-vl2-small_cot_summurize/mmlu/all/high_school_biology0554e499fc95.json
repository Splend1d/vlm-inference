He introduced the concept of natural selection, which is a mechanism for evolution. However, the question asks for the first person to propose a mechanism for evolution, not just the concept of evolution itself.\n\nB. A mechanism for how evolution occurs.\n- This option directly aligns with Darwin's contribution. He proposed the mechanism of natural selection, which explains how evolution can occur over time.\n\nC. That the Earth is older than a few thousand years.\n- This statement is incorrect. The concept of the Earth's age was not a part of Darwin's theory. The Earth's age was a topic of debate and was not directly addressed by Darwin.\n\nD. A mechanism for evolution that was supported by evidence.\n- While Darwin's theory of natural selection was supported by evidence, the question specifically asks for the first person to propose a mechanism for evolution. Darwin did propose a mechanism, but the question focuses on the initial proposal.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. a mechanism for how evolution occurs.",
