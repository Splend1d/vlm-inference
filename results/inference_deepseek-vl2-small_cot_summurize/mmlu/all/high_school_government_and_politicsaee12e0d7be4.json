It deals with issues related to international trade, domestic commerce, and economic development. While it may have some involvement in tax policy, it is not the primary committee for tax-related matters.\n\nB. **Ways and Means Committee**: This committee is specifically tasked with tax policy and revenue generation. It has jurisdiction over all tax legislation, including income tax, corporate tax, and other revenue-generating measures. Members of this committee have significant influence over tax policy and can shape legislation that affects the economy and citizens.\n\nC. **Education and the Workforce Committee**: This committee focuses on education, workforce development, and related issues. It does not have jurisdiction over tax policy, so it is not the appropriate committee for someone looking to influence tax policy.\n\nD. **Resources Committee**: This committee deals with natural resources, energy, and environmental issues. While it may have some indirect impact on tax policy, it is not the primary committee for tax-related matters.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the member of the House of Representatives wishing to influence tax policy would most likely serve on the **Ways and Means Committee**. This committee is directly responsible for tax policy and has the authority to draft and pass tax legislation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Ways and Means**.",
