Osteoclasts are known for resorbing bone, not depositing it.\n\nB. **Resorb bone and differentiate from periosteal mesenchymal cells.**\n   - This option correctly describes osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are specialized cells that resorb bone by secreting acids and enzymes. They originate from monocytes, which are a type of white blood cell.\n\nC. **Deposit bone and differentiate from monocytes.**\n   - This option incorrectly states that osteoclasts deposit bone. As mentioned earlier, osteoclasts resorb bone, not deposit it.\n\nD. **Resorb bone and differentiate from monocytes.**\n   - This option accurately describes osteoclasts. They resorb bone and differentiate from monocytes, which is the correct origin of osteoclasts.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Resorb bone and differentiate from periosteal mesenchymal cells.\n\nD. Resorb bone and differentiate from monocytes.",
