Autocorrelation refers to the correlation between a time series and lagged versions of itself. If the autocorrelation is negative, it means that as the lagged values increase, the correlation between the series and its lagged values decreases.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A cyclical pattern in the residuals: This would indicate positive autocorrelation, as the pattern repeats over time.\n\nB. An alternating pattern in the residuals: This would also indicate positive autocorrelation, as the pattern alternates between positive and negative values.\n\nC. A complete randomness in the residuals: This would indicate no autocorrelation, as there is no pattern in the residuals.\n\nD. Residuals that are all close to zero: This indicates no autocorrelation, as the residuals are not showing any pattern or trend.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Residuals that are all close to zero. This indicates that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals, which is consistent with negative residual autocorrelation.",
