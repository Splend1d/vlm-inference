            "content": "To determine how the mass of the Sun affects its gravitational pull on Mars, we can use Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula for gravitational force is:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{G \\cdot m_1 \\cdot m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the gravitational force between the two masses,\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of the two objects,\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nGiven that the Sun's mass is \\( M_{\\odot} \\) and Mars' mass is \\( M_{\\text{Mars}} \\), the distance between the Sun and Mars is \\( r_{\\text{Sun-Mars}} \\).\n\nIf the Sun were twice as massive, its new mass would be \\( 2M_{\\odot} \\). The gravitational force on Mars would be:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{G \\cdot (2M_{\\odot}) \\cdot M_{\\text{Mars}}}{r_{\\text{Sun-Mars}}^2} \\]\n\nSince the distance \\( r_{\\text{Sun-Mars}} \\) remains the same, the gravitational force on Mars would be:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{G \\cdot 2M_{\\odot} \\cdot M_{\\text{Mars}}}{r_{\\text{Sun-Mars}}^2} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{G \\cdot M_{\\odot} \\cdot M_{\\text{Mars}}}{r_{\\text{Sun-Mars}}^2} \\]\n\nThis shows that the gravitational force on Mars would be twice as much as it is now. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. twice as much",
