According to the data provided, 30-year-old men have spent an average of 10 years in school.\n\n1. **Understanding the Data**: The question states that 30-year-old men have spent 10 years in school. This information is crucial because it sets a baseline for comparison.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options**: We need to find the average number of years women have spent in school. The options given are:\n   - A. 12 years\n   - B. 9 years\n   - C. 6 years\n   - D. 3 years\n\n3. **Comparing with Men's Schooling Duration**: Since the question asks for the average number of years women have spent in school, we need to compare this with the men's average.\n\n4. **Reasoning**: If men have spent 10 years in school, and we are looking for the average for women, we need to consider if women have spent more or less time in school.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the question asks for the average number of years women have spent in school, and we know that men have spent 10 years, the most logical conclusion is that women have spent less time in school.\n\n6. **Selecting the Correct Option**: Among the given options, 3 years is the only one that is less than 10 years, which aligns with the understanding that women typically spend less time in school than men.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 3 years",
