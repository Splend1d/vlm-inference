Scenario 1: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. As each driver reaches the entrance of the car wash, the driver gets out of the car. An automatic pulley moves the car through the car wash as the driver walks to the exit of the car wash to pay and pick up the car. Scenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form. Scenario 3: Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening. Which of the following shows the data structures that best model the scenarios? Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3\n\nA. Dictionary/map | Queue | Stack\nB. Dictionary/map | Stack | Queue\nC. Queue | Dictionary/map | Stack\nD. Stack | Queue | Dictionary/map\n",

An automatic pulley moves the car through the car wash as the driver walks to the exit of the car wash to pay and pick up the car.\n\nThis scenario can be modeled using a dictionary/map. The dictionary/map can store the car's position and the driver's position. As the car moves through the car wash, the dictionary/map can be updated to reflect the new positions of the car and the driver.\n\nScenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form.\n\nThis scenario can be modeled using a dictionary/map. The dictionary/map can store the contestant's ID and their name. As the contestants are assigned their unique IDs, the dictionary/map can be updated to reflect the new IDs and names.\n\nScenario 3: Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening.\n\nThis scenario can be modeled using a stack. The stack can be used to keep track of the balls in the can. As the balls are placed in the can, they are added to the stack. As the balls are removed from the can, they are removed from the stack.\n\nTherefore, the data structures that best model the scenarios are:\n\nScenario 1: Dictionary/map\nScenario 2: Dictionary/map\nScenario 3: Stack\n\nThe correct answer is A.
