            "content": "To determine which statement is true about an intention tremor, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is worse at rest: Intention tremors are typically worse when the individual is actively trying to perform a task. This is because the tremor is more pronounced when the person is focusing on a specific action, such as writing or picking up an object. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. It is caused by Parkinson's Disease: While Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that can cause tremors, it is not the only cause. Intention tremors can also be caused by other conditions such as cerebellar lesions, multiple sclerosis, or certain medications. Thus, this statement is not universally true.\n\nC. It is indicative of a cerebellar lesion: Intention tremors can indeed be indicative of a cerebellar lesion, as the cerebellum is involved in motor control and coordination. However, this is not the only cause, and other conditions can also present with intention tremors. Therefore, this statement is partially true but not definitive.\n\nD. Dyscalculia is a common association: Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects the ability to understand and work with numbers. It is not commonly associated with intention tremors. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It is worse at rest.",
