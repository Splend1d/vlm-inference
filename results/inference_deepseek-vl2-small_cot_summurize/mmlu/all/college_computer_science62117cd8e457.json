This means that for a given memory word, there are three possible cache locations where it can be stored. This is a defining characteristic of a 3-way, set-associative cache.\n\nB. **effective only if 3 or fewer processes are running alternately on the processor**\n\n   - The effectiveness of a cache is not dependent on the number of processes running on the processor. Cache performance is more about the size of the cache, associativity, and the speed of the memory system. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. **possible only with write-back**\n\n   - Write-back is a technique used in caches to reduce the number of write operations to the main memory. However, it is not a requirement for a cache to be set-associative. A 3-way, set-associative cache can be implemented with or without write-back. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. **faster to access than a direct-mapped cache**\n\n   - A 3-way, set-associative cache is generally faster to access than a direct-mapped cache because it allows for more flexibility in storing data. However, the speed advantage depends on the specific implementation and the size of the cache. This statement is partially correct but not a defining characteristic of a 3-way, set-associative cache.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. one in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations.",
