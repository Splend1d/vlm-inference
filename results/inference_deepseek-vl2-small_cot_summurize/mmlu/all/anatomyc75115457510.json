The mental symphysis closes at about 1 year postnatally.\n- The mental symphysis is the joint between the two halves of the mandible. It typically closes around 1 year postnatally, which is a critical period for the development of the mandible. This statement is correct.\n\nB. The condylar growth cartilage ceases activity at puberty.\n- Condylar growth cartilage is responsible for the growth of the mandible, particularly the condyles. It continues to be active throughout life, although its activity decreases with age. This statement is incorrect.\n\nC. The ossification centre appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage.\n- The ossification center of the mandible appears around 8 weeks in utero lateral (I.U.L) and is located medial to Meckel's cartilage. This statement is correct.\n\nD. The functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible is the lateral pterygoid muscle.\n- The lateral pterygoid muscle is involved in the movement of the mandible, but it does not act as a functional matrix. The functional matrix is the periosteum, which is the outer layer of bone tissue. This statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statements are A and C.",
