Try harder to remove it.\n- Attempting to remove the catheter by applying more force or using different tools may cause further damage to the catheter or surrounding tissues. This is not advisable as it could lead to complications.\n\nB. Try harder to unblock it.\n- Similar to option A, trying harder to unblock the catheter might exacerbate the situation. It could lead to injury or further blockage, making it a risky choice.\n\nC. Leave it until next time.\n- This option suggests waiting until a future time to address the issue. However, leaving a catheter in place for an extended period can lead to infections, tissue damage, or other complications. It is not a safe or recommended solution.\n\nD. Call for assistance from a medical practitioner.\n- Consulting a medical professional is the most appropriate course of action. They have the expertise and tools to safely and effectively address the situation, ensuring the patient's safety and well-being.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Call for assistance from a medical practitioner.",
