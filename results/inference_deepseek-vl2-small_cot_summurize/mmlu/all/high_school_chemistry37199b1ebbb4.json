A buffer solution is a solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. It typically consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **NaCl and HCl**: NaCl is a salt, and HCl is a strong acid. A buffer solution requires a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid. NaCl and HCl do not fit this requirement.\n\nB. **HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2**: HC2H3O2 is acetic acid (a weak acid), and KC2H3O2 is potassium acetate (its conjugate base). This pair fits the criteria for a buffer solution, as acetic acid and potassium acetate can resist changes in pH.\n\nC. **NaBr and KBr**: NaBr is a salt, and KBr is another salt. Neither of these substances is a weak acid or base, nor do they have conjugate pairs that can form a buffer solution.\n\nD. **HIO3 and KClO3**: HIO3 is a strong acid, and KClO3 is a strong base. Neither of these substances is weak, and they do not have conjugate pairs that can form a buffer solution.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct pair of substances that can be used to make a buffer solution is:\n\nB. HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2.",
