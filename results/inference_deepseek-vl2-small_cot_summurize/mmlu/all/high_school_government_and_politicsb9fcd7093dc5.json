It has become aligned with civil libertarians.\n- The Republican Party has historically been associated with conservative values, which often include a strong stance on civil liberties. However, since the 1980s, the party has shifted towards more conservative positions, which may not align as closely with civil libertarian ideals.\n\nB. It has come to be dominated by labor unions.\n- The Republican Party is generally not dominated by labor unions. Instead, it has historically been more aligned with business interests and has taken a stance against labor unions, particularly in terms of labor rights and collective bargaining.\n\nC. It has become more antagonistic to business interests.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Republican Party has historically been more aligned with business interests, advocating for lower taxes, deregulation, and free market policies.\n\nD. It has become more influenced by evangelical Christians.\n- Since the 1980s, the Republican Party has indeed become more influenced by evangelical Christians. This influence is evident in the party's stance on social issues, such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and religious freedom.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nD. It has become more influenced by evangelical Christians.",
