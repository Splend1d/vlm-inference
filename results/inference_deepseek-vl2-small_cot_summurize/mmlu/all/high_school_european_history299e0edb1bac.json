            "content": "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, was an agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. It was a non-aggression pact that allowed both countries to focus on their respective goals without worrying about each other's actions. However, the pact was violated when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, which is known as Operation Barbarossa.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Article I: This article says that both countries should not use violence or attack each other. But Operation Barbarossa was an attack by Germany on the Soviet Union, so this article was violated.\n\nB. Article II: This article says that if one country is attacked by a third party, the other country should not support the attacker. But Operation Barbarossa was an attack by Germany on the Soviet Union, so this article was not violated.\n\nC. Article III: This article says that both countries should keep in touch and share information. But Operation Barbarossa was an attack by Germany on the Soviet Union, so this article was not violated.\n\nD. Article IV: This article says that if there are disputes between the two countries, they should participate in any grouping of powers that is aimed at the other party. But Operation Barbarossa was an attack by Germany on the Soviet Union, so this article was not violated.\n\nSo, the article that was violated by Operation Barbarossa is Article I.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
