Acid strength is influenced by the ability of a compound to donate protons (H+ ions). Generally, the more electronegative the atom bonded to the hydrogen atom, the stronger the acid.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1. **H2SeO3 (Selenic acid)**: Selenium is less electronegative than sulfur, which is less electronegative than chlorine. Therefore, H2SeO3 is the weakest acid among the given options.\n\n2. **H2SO3 (Sulfurous acid)**: Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, which is less electronegative than chlorine. Thus, H2SO3 is stronger than H2SeO3 but weaker than HClO and HBrO.\n\n3. **HClO (Chlorous acid)**: Chlorine is more electronegative than sulfur and selenium, making HClO a stronger acid than both H2SeO3 and H2SO3.\n\n4. **HBrO (Bromous acid)**: Bromine is more electronegative than chlorine, making HBrO the strongest acid among the given options.\n\nNow, let's arrange these acids in order of increasing strength:\n\n- H2SeO3 < H2SO3 < HClO < HBrO\n\nTherefore, the correct order of increasing acid strength is:\n\n**A. H2SeO3 < H2SO3 < HClO < HBrO**",
