            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles.**\n   - The primary motor cortex is responsible for voluntary motor control. It sends signals to the spinal cord, which then activates muscles. Antigravity muscles are those that help lift the body off the ground, such as the quadriceps in the legs. These muscles are typically controlled by the primary motor cortex, but the term \"bilateral\" suggests both sides of the body, which is not accurate for antigravity muscles.\n\nB. **Bilateral contraction of limb musculature.**\n   - This option suggests that the primary motor cortex causes simultaneous contraction of muscles on both sides of the body. While the primary motor cortex does control both sides of the body, the term \"bilateral\" is not specific enough to describe the precise effect of the primary motor cortex.\n\nC. **Contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.**\n   - The term \"ipsilateral\" refers to the same side of the body. The primary motor cortex controls the muscles on the same side of the body, which is why it is called \"ipsilateral.\" This is the correct description of the effect of the primary motor cortex.\n\nD. **Contraction of contralateral limb musculature.**\n   - \"Contralateral\" refers to the opposite side of the body. The primary motor cortex does not control muscles on the opposite side; that is the role of the secondary motor cortex.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.",
