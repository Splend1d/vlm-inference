            "content": "To determine the structure of the set \\( G \\) under multiplication, we need to analyze the properties of the set of all \\( n \\times n \\) non-singular matrices with rational numbers as entries.\n\n1. **Non-singular matrices**: A matrix is non-singular if its determinant is non-zero. This means that the set \\( G \\) consists of matrices that are invertible.\n\n2. **Rational entries**: The entries of the matrices are rational numbers. This means that the set \\( G \\) consists of matrices with rational entries.\n\n3. **Multiplication**: The set \\( G \\) under multiplication forms a group. This is because:\n   - **Closure**: The product of any two non-singular matrices with rational entries is another non-singular matrix with rational entries.\n   - **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative.\n   - **Identity element**: The identity matrix \\( I \\) (where all entries are 1) is in \\( G \\) and acts as the identity element.\n   - **Inverse element**: Every non-singular matrix has an inverse, which is also in \\( G \\).\n\n4. **Finite or infinite**: The set \\( G \\) is infinite because there are infinitely many non-singular matrices with rational entries.\n\n5. **Abelian or non-abelian**: Matrix multiplication is not commutative in general. For example, \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\neq \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Therefore, \\( G \\) is not an abelian group.\n\nGiven these properties, the set \\( G \\) under multiplication is an infinite, non-abelian group.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. infinite, non abelian group",
