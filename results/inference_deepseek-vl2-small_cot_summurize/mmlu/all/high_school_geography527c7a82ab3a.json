It indicates the birth rate but does not specifically address the level of fertility needed to replace parents and compensate for early deaths.\n\nB. Replacement level: This is the level of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. It accounts for both births and deaths, ensuring that the population size remains constant over time.\n\nC. Mortality rate: This is the number of deaths per 1,000 people in a year. It measures the rate of death but does not provide information about the fertility needed to maintain a stable population.\n\nD. Total fertility rate: This is the average number of children a woman would have over her lifetime. It is a measure of fertility but does not specifically address the replacement level.\n\nThe replacement level is the most appropriate statistic because it directly addresses the question of maintaining a stable population size by accounting for both births and deaths.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
