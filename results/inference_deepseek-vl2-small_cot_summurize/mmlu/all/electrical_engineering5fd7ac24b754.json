            "content": "The correct answer is D. 10 KHz to 400 KHz.\n\nEddy current heating is a method of heating materials using electromagnetic induction. The frequency of the alternating current (AC) used in this process is crucial for efficient heating. The frequency range of 10 KHz to 400 KHz is commonly used for high-frequency eddy current heating because it allows for effective heating of materials with high electrical conductivity, such as copper and aluminum.\n\n- **Option A (1 KHz)**: This frequency is too low for high-frequency eddy current heating. At 1 KHz, the wavelength of the electromagnetic field is too long, which can lead to inefficient heating.\n- **Option B (5 KHz)**: While 5 KHz is higher than 1 KHz, it is still relatively low for high-frequency eddy current heating. The heating efficiency is better at higher frequencies.\n- **Option C (10 MHz)**: This frequency is too high for high-frequency eddy current heating. At 10 MHz, the wavelength is very short, which can lead to poor penetration and heating of the material.\n- **Option D (10 KHz to 400 KHz)**: This range is optimal for high-frequency eddy current heating. It allows for efficient heating of materials with high electrical conductivity and provides a balance between heating efficiency and penetration depth.\n\nTherefore, the supply frequency usually employed for high-frequency eddy current heating is between 10 KHz and 400 KHz.",
