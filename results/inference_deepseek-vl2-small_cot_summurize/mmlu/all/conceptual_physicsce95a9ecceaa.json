            "content": "When you squeeze an air-filled party balloon, you increase its volume.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Volume (A):** When you squeeze a balloon, you are compressing the air inside it. This compression reduces the space available for the air, thereby decreasing the volume of the balloon.\n\n- **Mass (B):** The mass of the balloon does not change when you squeeze it. The mass is the amount of matter in the balloon, and it remains constant regardless of how much the balloon is compressed.\n\n- **Weight (C):** The weight of the balloon is the force exerted by gravity on the mass of the balloon. Since the mass of the balloon does not change when you squeeze it, the weight of the balloon also remains constant.\n\n- **Density (D):** Density is defined as mass per unit volume. When you squeeze the balloon, the volume decreases while the mass remains the same. Therefore, the density of the balloon increases as you squeeze it.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A. volume**.",
