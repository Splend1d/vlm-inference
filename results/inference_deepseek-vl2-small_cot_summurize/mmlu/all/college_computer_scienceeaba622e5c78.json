The root set is a set of objects that are directly accessible from the start of the program. These objects are typically used to determine which objects are still in use and should be garbage collected.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Actual parameters of the active procedures**: These are variables that are passed to functions as arguments. They are part of the call stack and are directly accessible from the start of the program, making them part of the root set.\n\nB. **Dynamically allocated objects on the heap**: These are objects that are allocated using `malloc` or similar functions. They are not part of the call stack and are not directly accessible from the start of the program, so they are not part of the root set.\n\nC. **Global variables of the program**: These are variables that are declared outside of any function and are accessible from anywhere in the program. They are part of the root set because they are directly accessible from the start of the program.\n\nD. **Local variables on the call stack**: These are variables that are declared within a function and are accessible only within that function. They are part of the root set because they are directly accessible from the start of the program.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Dynamically allocated objects on the heap are not part of the root set because they are not directly accessible from the start of the program.",
