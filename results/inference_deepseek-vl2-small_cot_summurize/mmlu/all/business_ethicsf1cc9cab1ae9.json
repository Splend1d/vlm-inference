Supermarket industry.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHealthy eating, particularly relating to sugar and salt consumption, food and packaging waste, and supply chain CO2 emissions, are all business ethics issues that the supermarket industry faces. Supermarkets play a significant role in the food supply chain, from sourcing and processing to distribution and retail. They have a responsibility to ensure that the food they sell is safe, nutritious, and environmentally sustainable.\n\nA. Supermarket industry: This is the correct answer because supermarkets are directly involved in the production, distribution, and sale of food products. They have a significant impact on the food supply chain and are responsible for ensuring that the food they sell is healthy and sustainable.\n\nB. Chemicals industry: While the chemicals industry is also involved in the production of food packaging and processing, it is not directly responsible for the health and sustainability of the food products themselves.\n\nC. Construction industry: The construction industry is not directly involved in the production, distribution, or sale of food products. It is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that supports the food supply chain, but it is not directly responsible for the health and sustainability of the food products themselves.\n\nD. Information and mobile technology industry: This industry is not directly involved in the production, distribution, or sale of food products. It is responsible for developing and maintaining the technology that supports the food supply chain, but it is not directly responsible for the health and sustainability of the food products themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the supermarket industry is the correct answer because it is directly involved in the production, distribution, and sale of food products and has a responsibility to ensure that the food they sell is healthy and sustainable.",
