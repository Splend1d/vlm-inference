            "content": "To determine the correct composition of the walls of bronchioles, we need to understand the structure and function of these airways in the respiratory system.\n\n1. **Understanding Bronchioles**: Bronchioles are the smaller branches of the bronchi, which are the main airways that lead to the lungs. They play a crucial role in the respiratory system by facilitating the passage of air to the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs.\n\n2. **Composition of Bronchioles**: The walls of bronchioles are composed of several layers:\n   - **Respiratory Epithelium**: This is the innermost layer, consisting of simple squamous epithelium. It is responsible for the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the air and the blood.\n   - **Smooth Muscle**: This layer is found beneath the respiratory epithelium. It contains smooth muscle fibers that can contract and relax, allowing the bronchioles to constrict or dilate. This regulation is essential for controlling airflow and pressure within the lungs.\n   - **Cartilage**: Although not as prominent as in larger airways like the trachea, bronchioles contain some cartilage. This cartilage provides structural support and helps maintain the patency of the airways, preventing them from collapsing.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Cartilage, smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium\" is incorrect because it suggests the presence of cartilage in the bronchioles, which is not as prominent as in larger airways.\n   - **Option B**: \"Cartilage and smooth muscle\" is incorrect because it omits the respiratory epithelium, which is essential for gas exchange.\n   - **Option C**: \"Cartilage and respiratory epithelium\" is incorrect because it lacks the smooth muscle layer, which is crucial for regulating airflow.\n   - **Option D**: \"Smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium\" is correct because it accurately describes the layers found in the walls of bronchioles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium**.",
