All of these.\n\nHeat sinks are designed to dissipate heat effectively, and all the options listed contribute to this function:\n\nA. High thermal conductivity: This means the material can transfer heat efficiently, which is crucial for effective heat dissipation.\n\nB. Large surface area: A larger surface area allows for more heat to be dissipated, as there is more area for heat to be transferred to the surrounding air or liquid.\n\nC. High melting point: While not directly related to heat dissipation, a high melting point ensures that the material can withstand high temperatures without degrading, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the heat sink.\n\nTherefore, all these properties are essential for the effective functioning of a heat sink.",
