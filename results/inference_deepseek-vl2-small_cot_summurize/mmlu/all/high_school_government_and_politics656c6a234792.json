This amendment, ratified in 1868, guarantees equal protection under the law to all citizens, including the right to vote, due process, and equal protection under the law. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to enforce these protections and combat discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It prohibited discrimination in employment, public accommodations, and other areas, and it also provided for the enforcement of these rights through the establishment of the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice.",
