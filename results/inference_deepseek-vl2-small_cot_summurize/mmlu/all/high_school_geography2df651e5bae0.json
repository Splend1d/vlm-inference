The main concern is more about health and environmental impacts rather than trade restrictions.\n\nB. **Make plants more resistant to disease.**\n   - This is a common fear among opponents of GMOs. They believe that GMOs can introduce new diseases or make plants more susceptible to existing diseases, which could have significant ecological and health implications.\n\nC. **May cause irreversible changes in humans.**\n   - This is a significant concern among opponents. They worry that GMOs could introduce new allergens or toxins into the human food supply, potentially causing long-term health issues.\n\nD. **Make plants more resistant to drought.**\n   - While GMOs can be engineered to be more drought-resistant, this is not a primary fear among opponents. The main concerns are more about health and environmental impacts.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most significant fear among opponents of GMOs is that they may cause irreversible changes in humans. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. May cause irreversible changes in humans.",
