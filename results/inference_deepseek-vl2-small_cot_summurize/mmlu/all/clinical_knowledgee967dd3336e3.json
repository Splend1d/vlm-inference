            "content": "To determine how often a cannula should be flushed, we need to consider the type of fluid being administered and the potential for clotting or other complications.\n\n1. **Understanding Cannula Flushing**: Cannulas are small tubes inserted into veins to administer fluids, medications, or nutrients. Over time, they can become blocked by blood clots or other substances. Flushing a cannula involves removing any blockages to ensure the tube remains open and functional.\n\n2. **Types of Cannulas**: There are different types of cannulas, such as peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines, central venous catheters (CVCs), and tunneled catheters. Each type may have specific flushing requirements.\n\n3. **Flushing Frequency**:\n   - **PICC Lines**: These are typically flushed every 12 hours to prevent clotting and ensure the line remains patent.\n   - **CVCs**: These are often flushed every 12 hours as well, but the frequency can vary depending on the patient's condition and the type of medication being administered.\n   - **Tunneled Catheters**: These are usually flushed every 12 hours to prevent infection and ensure the tunnel remains open.\n\n4. **Considerations**:\n   - **Patient's Condition**: Patients with certain medical conditions, such as those on anticoagulant medications, may require more frequent flushing.\n   - **Type of Fluid**: The type of fluid being administered can affect the flushing schedule. For example, if administering a hypertonic solution, flushing may be more frequent.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical guidelines and considerations, the most common flushing interval for cannulas is every 12 hours.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Every 12 hours.",
