These bands are primarily caused by the planet's rapid rotation and the varying temperatures and pressures at different latitudes. The most prominent bands are the equatorial Great Red Spot, the North and South Equatorial Belts, and the North and South Temperate Belts. These bands are characterized by their different colors and cloud formations, such as the white clouds of the North Equatorial Belt and the brownish clouds of the South Equatorial Belt.",
