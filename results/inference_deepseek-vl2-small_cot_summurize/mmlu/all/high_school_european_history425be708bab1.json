            "content": "Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, in their work \"The Communist Manifesto,\" argue that the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles. They believe that the modern bourgeois society, which has emerged from the ruins of feudal society, has not done away with class antagonisms. Instead, it has established new classes, new conditions of oppression, and new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.\n\nThey also argue that our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses a distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\n\nGiven this view, a follower of Marx and Engels's would likely argue that an all-out war between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat classes was:\n\nC. an inevitable result of fundamental economic change.\n\nThis is because Marx and Engels believe that class struggles are a result of fundamental economic changes. They argue that the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are in a constant state of conflict due to their different interests and the way they are affected by economic changes. Therefore, an all-out war between these two classes would be an inevitable result of such fundamental economic changes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Marx and Engels do not believe that an all-out war is a destructive development that can be avoided through the study of philosophy. They believe that class struggles are a natural part of history and that they cannot be avoided.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Marx and Engels do not believe that an all-out war should be encouraged in order to foster progress. They believe that class struggles are a result of fundamental economic changes and that they cannot be avoided.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Marx and Engels do not believe that history is repeating itself. They believe that each epoch is unique and that the class struggles of the past are not a direct reflection of the class struggles of the present.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.",
