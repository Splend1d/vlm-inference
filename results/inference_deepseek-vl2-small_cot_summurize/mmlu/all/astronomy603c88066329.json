            "content": "Planetary rings are a fascinating feature of our solar system, and each option provides a different aspect of this phenomenon. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **known to exist for all of the jovian planets.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. While the jovian planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) do have rings, they are not present for all of them. For example, Jupiter and Saturn have prominent ring systems, but Uranus and Neptune do not.\n\nB. **composed of a large number of individual particles that orbit their planet in accord with Kepler's third law.**\n   - This statement is correct. Planetary rings are indeed composed of numerous small particles, such as ice, rock, and dust, which orbit their respective planets. The orbits of these particles are influenced by Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This law helps explain the stable orbits of the particles in the rings.\n\nC. **nearer to their planet than any of the planet's large moons.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Planetary rings are not necessarily closer to their planets than the large moons. For example, the rings of Saturn are much farther from the planet than the moons of Saturn, such as Titan and Enceladus.\n\nD. **all of the above.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because options A and C are not true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. composed of a large number of individual particles that orbit their planet in accord with Kepler's third law.**",
