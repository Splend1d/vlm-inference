When one book is pushed off the edge of the table, the tension in the string is still equal to the gravitational force acting on the book that is being pushed.\n\nAs the book is pushed off the edge of the table, it falls under the influence of gravity, and its acceleration is equal to g (the acceleration due to gravity). The tension in the string is equal to the gravitational force acting on the book, so the tension in the string is also equal to g.\n\nThe other book is dragged horizontally across the table surface, and its acceleration is equal to zero because there is no horizontal force acting on it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. zero",
