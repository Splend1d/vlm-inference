            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Women have evolved a greater muscle mass.\n- This statement is incorrect. Muscle mass is largely determined by genetics and does not change significantly over time. While some women may naturally have more muscle mass, it is not the primary reason for the improvement in world record performances.\n\nB. Women can now run faster than men.\n- This statement is incorrect. While some women may run faster than men, this is not the primary reason for the improvement in world record performances. The improvement is more about the training and participation of women in sports.\n\nC. Women have started training at an earlier age.\n- This statement is incorrect. While early training can contribute to improved performance, it is not the main reason for the rapid improvement in world record performances.\n\nD. More women are now engaged in sport.\n- This statement is correct. The increase in the number of women participating in sports has led to more opportunities for training, competition, and the development of new techniques. This increased participation has contributed to the improvement in world record performances.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. More women are now engaged in sport.",
