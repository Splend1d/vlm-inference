I had the culprit burned, explaining that the cause was his having killed that Indian and eaten him[,] which was prohibited by Your Majesty, and by me in Your Royal name. I further made the chief understand that all the people . . . must abstain from this custom. . . . I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their property, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their idols, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . . I, likewise, had come to teach them that Your Majesty, by the will of Divine Providence, rules the universe, and that they also must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that we who are Your Majesty's ministers here might order them.\n\u2014Hernan Cortez, Fifth Letter to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, 1521\nWhich of the following motivations for exploration is most evident from the document above?\n\nA.

            "content": "The letter from Hernan Cortez to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, written in 1521, provides a clear motivation for exploration that is most evident in option D. The letter describes Cortez's actions in the New World, including burning a Spaniard who had killed and eaten an Indian, and teaching the indigenous people to worship only one God and to turn away from their idols. This suggests that the primary motivation for exploration in this context was to spread Christianity and justify the subjugation of indigenous civilizations.\n\nOption A is not the most evident motivation because the letter does not specifically mention the rise of mercantilism or the state's role in promoting commercial development and the acquisition of colonies overseas.\n\nOption B is not the most evident motivation because the letter does not specifically mention the desire for gold, spices, or luxury goods.\n\nOption C is not the most evident motivation because the letter does not specifically mention the desire for individual glory or wealth.\n\nTherefore, the most evident motivation for exploration in this context is option D: Christianity served as a stimulus for exploration as governments and religious authorities sought to spread the faith and counter Islam, and as a justification for the physical and cultural subjugation of indigenous civilizations.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
