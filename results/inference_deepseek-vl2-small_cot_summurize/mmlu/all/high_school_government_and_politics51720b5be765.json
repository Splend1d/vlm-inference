Every case appealed to the Supreme Court is ruled upon by the court.\n- This statement is false. The Supreme Court does not hear every case that is appealed to it. It has discretion over which cases it chooses to hear. The court only hears cases that meet certain criteria, such as having significant legal issues or involving parties from different states.\n\nB. The court helps set the public agenda by deciding which appeals to hear.\n- This statement is true. The Supreme Court has the power to choose which cases to hear, and its decisions can influence public policy and societal norms. By selecting cases that address important legal questions or have broad implications, the court can shape the legal landscape and public discourse.\n\nC. The court hears all cases when two or more justices agree that the case has merit.\n- This statement is false. The Supreme Court does not hear all cases that two or more justices agree should be heard. The court has a limited docket and only hears cases that meet its criteria for review.\n\nD. In deciding cases, the chief justice's vote counts as two votes.\n- This statement is false. The chief justice's vote does not count as two votes. In the Supreme Court, each justice has one vote, and the chief justice does not have any additional voting power.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The court helps set the public agenda by deciding which appeals to hear.",
