            "content": "To determine the unit in which the electronic storage required for the text in all the books of the university's libraries would best be measured, we need to calculate the total number of bytes required to store the text in all the books.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pages in all the books:\n\\[ 3,000,000 \\text{ books} \\times 400 \\text{ pages/book} = 1,200,000,000 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of lines in all the pages:\n\\[ 1,200,000,000 \\text{ pages} \\times 50 \\text{ lines/page} = 60,000,000,000 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the total number of words in all the lines:\n\\[ 60,000,000,000 \\text{ lines} \\times 10 \\text{ words/line} = 600,000,000,000 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of bytes in all the words:\n\\[ 600,000,000,000 \\text{ words} \\times 5 \\text{ letters/word} \\times 1 \\text{ byte/letter} = 3,000,000,000,000 \\text{ bytes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the electronic storage required for the text in all the books of the university's libraries would best be measured in bytes, which is approximately 3 petabytes (2^50 or 10^15 bytes).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Petabyte (2^50 or approximately 10^15 bytes)",
