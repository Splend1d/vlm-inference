When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\nA. Behaviorist\nB. Psychoanalytic\nC. Cognitive behavioral\nD. Humanistic\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is B. Psychoanalytic.\n\nThe officer's behavior is likely influenced by unconscious biases and memories from his childhood, which are rooted in his psychoanalytic framework. The officer's behavior is not necessarily a conscious choice, but rather a result of his unconscious mind processing past experiences and emotions. The officer's behavior is also influenced by his defense mechanisms, such as repression and denial, which prevent him from acknowledging the true reasons behind his behavior.\n\nBehaviorism would not be the most appropriate framework to address the unconscious bias in the officer's behavior, as it focuses on observable behaviors and their consequences, rather than the underlying psychological processes that drive them. Cognitive behavioral therapy would also not be the most appropriate framework, as it focuses on changing maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors, rather than addressing unconscious biases and past experiences.\n\nHumanistic psychology would also not be the most appropriate framework, as it focuses on the individual's subjective experience and personal growth, rather than addressing unconscious biases and past experiences.\n\nTherefore, the psychoanalytic framework is the most appropriate to address the unconscious bias in the officer's behavior.",
