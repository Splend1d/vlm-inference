            "content": "The correct answer is B. particle model.\n\nThe photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where light is absorbed by a material, causing the release of electrons. This effect is best explained by the particle model of light, which posits that light consists of particles called photons. When a photon strikes the surface of a material, it can transfer its energy to an electron, causing it to be ejected from the material. This is in contrast to the wave model, which suggests that light is a wave that can be absorbed or transmitted by a material, but does not account for the ejection of electrons.\n\nThe particle model is supported by the photoelectric effect because it can explain the energy of the emitted electrons, which is directly related to the energy of the incident photons. The energy of the emitted electrons is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ E = h\\nu - \\phi \\]\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the energy of the emitted electron, \\( h \\) is Planck's constant, \\( \\nu \\) is the frequency of the incident light, and \\( \\phi \\) is the work function of the material. This equation shows that the energy of the emitted electron is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light, and inversely proportional to the work function of the material.\n\nThe wave model, on the other hand, cannot explain this relationship between the energy of the emitted electron and the frequency of the incident light. It suggests that the energy of the incident light is distributed over a range of frequencies, and that the energy of the emitted electron is proportional to the intensity of the light, not its frequency.\n\nTherefore, the photoelectric effect is best explained by the particle model of light, which is supported by the experimental evidence of the photoelectric effect.",
