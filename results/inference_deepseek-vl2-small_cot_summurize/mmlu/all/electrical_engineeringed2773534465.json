Shunt capacitor: This method is used to improve the power factor of a generator by reducing the reactive power. It is connected in parallel with the generator and helps to compensate for the reactive power generated by the generator.\n\nB. Series capacitor: This method is used to improve the power factor of a generator by increasing the apparent power. It is connected in series with the generator and helps to compensate for the reactive power generated by the generator.\n\nC. Generation excitation control: This method is used to control the excitation of a generator to improve its power factor. It is achieved by adjusting the field current of the generator to compensate for the reactive power generated by the generator.\n\nAll of these methods are used for reactive or voltage compensation in generators.",
