This is a fundamental property of Euclidean geometry. However, when we consider four-dimensional geometry, the rules of geometry can change.\n\nIn four-dimensional space, the concept of angles and the properties of triangles can be quite different from those in three-dimensional space. The angles of a triangle in four-dimensional space do not necessarily add up to 180\u00b0. In fact, the angles of a triangle in four-dimensional space can be any value, depending on the specific configuration of the points in the four-dimensional space.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"the angles of a triangle add to 180\u00b0\" is not always true in four-dimensional geometry.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. sometimes.",
