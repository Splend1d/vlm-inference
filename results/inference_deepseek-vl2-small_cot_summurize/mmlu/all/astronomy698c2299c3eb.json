            "content": "To understand why we see the same face of the Moon at all times, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **because the Moon has a nearly circular orbit around the Earth**: This statement is incorrect. The Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular; it is slightly elliptical. The shape of the orbit does not affect the appearance of the Moon's face.\n\nB. **because the Moon does not rotate**: This is incorrect. The Moon does rotate on its axis, but it also orbits the Earth. The rotation period of the Moon is about 27.3 days, which is the same as its orbital period around the Earth. This means that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth.\n\nC. **because the other face points toward us only at new moon when we can't see the Moon**: This is incorrect. The Moon's rotation and orbit are synchronized, so the same face of the Moon always faces the Earth. The appearance of the Moon changes due to its position in the sky, not because of the Moon's rotation.\n\nD. **because the Moon's rotational and orbital periods are equal**: This is correct. The Moon's rotational period is about 27.3 days, and its orbital period around the Earth is also about 27.3 days. This synchronization means that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth, resulting in the same face of the Moon being visible from Earth at all times.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The Moon's rotational and orbital periods are equal, which is why we see the same face of the Moon at all times.",
