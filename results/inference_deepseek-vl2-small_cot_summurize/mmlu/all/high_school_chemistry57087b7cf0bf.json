However, the presence of a negative charge on the carbonate and nitrate ions can slightly affect the bond lengths due to the increased electron density.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The bond length of 1.18 \u00c5 is typical for a single bond in a molecule.\n- The presence of a negative charge on the carbonate and nitrate ions can slightly increase the bond length due to the increased electron density, but the effect is minimal.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- All the given molecules have the same bond length of approximately 1.18 \u00c5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. CO2**\n\nThe bond lengths for CO2, CO3\u00b2\u207b, NO2\u207b, and NO3\u207b are all approximately 1.18 \u00c5, making them the same in terms of bond length.",
