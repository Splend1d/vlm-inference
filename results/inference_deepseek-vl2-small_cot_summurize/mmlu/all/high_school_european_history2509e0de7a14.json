            "content": "The passage is an edict issued by Henry IV of France in 1598. The edict states that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion shall be restored and reestablished in all places and localities of his kingdom and countries subject to his sway, where the exercise of the same has been interrupted. It also mentions that those of the said religion called Reformed (Protestants) are permitted to live and abide in all the cities and places of his kingdom and countries of his sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences.\n\nFrom this passage, we can infer that prior to 1598, France had been stricken with religious conflict. This is because the edict is an attempt to restore the Catholic religion and prohibit the practice of the Reformed religion, which suggests that there was a conflict between the two religions before 1598.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. prior to 1598, France was stricken with religious conflict.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
