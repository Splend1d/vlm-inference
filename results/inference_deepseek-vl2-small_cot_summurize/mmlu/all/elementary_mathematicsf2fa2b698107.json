How is the amount of money Leslie spent written as a fraction?\n- The amount of money Leslie spent is 20 dollars and 8 cents. This can be written as 20 + 8/100 dollars. To convert this to a fraction, we can write it as 20 + 8/100 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20 + 2/25 = 20",
