            "content": "To determine which compound is the least soluble in water, we need to consider the solubility rules and the nature of the compounds involved.\n\n1. **NaBr (Sodium Bromide)**:\n   - Sodium bromide is a salt composed of a metal cation (Na\u207a) and a non-metal anion (Br\u207b).\n   - Generally, salts of alkali metals (Na\u207a) and ammonium (NH\u2084\u207a) are soluble in water.\n   - Bromide (Br\u207b) is a halide and is typically soluble in water.\n   - Therefore, NaBr is expected to be quite soluble in water.\n\n2. **NiSO3 (Nickel(II) Sulfite)**:\n   - Nickel(II) sulfite is a complex ion with Ni\u00b2\u207a and SO\u2083\u00b2\u207b.\n   - Sulfites are generally soluble in water.\n   - Nickel(II) is a metal cation and is typically soluble in water.\n   - Therefore, NiSO3 is expected to be soluble in water.\n\n3. **CrCl3 (Chromium(III) Chloride)**:\n   - Chromium(III) chloride is a complex ion with Cr\u00b3\u207a and Cl\u207b.\n   - Chlorides are generally soluble in water.\n   - Chromium(III) is a metal cation and is typically soluble in water.\n   - Therefore, CrCl3 is expected to be soluble in water.\n\n4. **Mn(NO3)2 (Manganese(II) Nitrate)**:\n   - Manganese(II) nitrate is a complex ion with Mn\u00b2\u207a and NO\u2083\u207b.\n   - Nitrates are generally soluble in water.\n   - Manganese(II) is a metal cation and is typically soluble in water.\n   - Therefore, Mn(NO3)2 is expected to be soluble in water.\n\nGiven the solubility rules and the nature of the compounds, all the options except one are expected to be soluble in water. The compound that is least likely to be soluble in water is:\n\n**D. Mn(NO3)2 (Manganese(II) Nitrate)**\n\nMn(NO3)2 is expected to be the least soluble in water due to the presence of the nitrate ion, which is generally soluble, and the manganese(II) cation, which is typically soluble.",
