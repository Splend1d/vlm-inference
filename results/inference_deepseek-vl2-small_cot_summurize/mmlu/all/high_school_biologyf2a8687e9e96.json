            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Exergonic reaction: This type of reaction releases energy, typically in the form of heat or light. It is characterized by the formation of products that are lower in energy than the reactants. Since energy is not a reactant in an exergonic reaction, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. Hydrolysis reaction: This reaction involves the breaking of a chemical bond in a molecule by the addition of water. It is not specifically related to the inclusion of energy as a reactant. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.\n\nC. Endergonic reaction: This reaction requires an input of energy to proceed, meaning it is non-spontaneous under standard conditions. The products of an endergonic reaction are higher in energy than the reactants. Since energy is indeed a reactant in an endergonic reaction, this option is correct.\n\nD. Redox reaction: This type of reaction involves the transfer of electrons between two species. It is not specifically related to the inclusion of energy as a reactant. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Endergonic reaction.",
