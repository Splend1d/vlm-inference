Noise-canceling technology works by detecting and counteracting unwanted sounds, which are essentially forms of interference. This is achieved through the use of microphones and speakers that produce sound waves that are the exact opposite of the noise they are trying to cancel. By doing so, the device effectively reduces the overall noise level in the environment.",
