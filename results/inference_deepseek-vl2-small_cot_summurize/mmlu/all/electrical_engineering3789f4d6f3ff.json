Here's why:\n\n1. **Core Less Furnace (Option A)**: These furnaces are designed for continuous operation and are not ideal for intermittent work. They require a continuous core to maintain the arc and heat distribution.\n\n2. **Indirect Arc Furnace (Option B)**: These furnaces are designed for intermittent work. They use a separate arc source to heat the workpiece, which allows for more flexible operation and easier ramp-up and ramp-down cycles.\n\n3. **Either of Above (Option C)**: This option is not correct because the Core Less Furnace is not suitable for intermittent work.\n\n4. **Neither of Above (Option D)**: This option is not correct because the Indirect Arc Furnace is suitable for intermittent work.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Indirect arc furnace**.",
