Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nIn a height-balanced binary search tree, the worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. Therefore, the worst-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree, which is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This statement is true.\n\nII. Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nIn a height-balanced binary search tree, the average-case search time is also logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. Therefore, the average-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree, which is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This statement is true.\n\nIII. Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.\n\nIn a height-balanced binary search tree, the best-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. Therefore, the best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree, which is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This statement is true.\n\nIV. The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nIn a height-balanced binary search tree, the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the height of the tree is proportional to the number of nodes. Therefore, the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This statement is true.\n\nTherefore, all four statements are true. The correct answer is D. I, II, and IV.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{D}\n\\]",
