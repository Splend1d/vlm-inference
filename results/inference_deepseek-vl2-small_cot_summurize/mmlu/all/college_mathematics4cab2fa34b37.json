This means that each course will be assigned to 2 professors.\n\nWe can choose 2 professors out of 10 for the first course in \\(\\binom{10}{2}\\) ways.\n\nAfter choosing the first course, we are left with 8 professors and 18 courses. We can choose 2 professors out of 8 for the second course in \\(\\binom{8}{2}\\) ways.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the order of choosing the courses does not matter. This means that we need to divide the total number of ways by the number of ways to arrange the 20 courses, which is \\(20!\\).\n\nSo, the total number of different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses is:\n\\[ \\frac{\\binom{10}{2} \\cdot \\binom{8}{2}}{20!} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{45 \\cdot 28}{20!} = \\frac{1260}{20!} \\]\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices.
