            "content": "To determine the sex of a child, we need to understand the inheritance of sex chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, with one pair being sex chromosomes. The sex chromosomes are designated as X and Y.\n\n1. **Understanding Sex Chromosome Inheritance**:\n   - Females have two X chromosomes (XX).\n   - Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY).\n\n2. **Role of the X Chromosome**:\n   - The X chromosome carries many genes, including those that determine sex characteristics.\n   - The presence of a Y chromosome is crucial for male development.\n\n3. **Determining Sex**:\n   - The sex of a child is determined by the combination of the mother's X chromosome and the father's Y chromosome.\n   - If the child receives the Y chromosome from the father, the child will be male.\n   - If the child receives the X chromosome from the mother and the Y chromosome from the father, the child will be male.\n   - If the child receives the X chromosome from the mother and the X chromosome from the father, the child will be female.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: The number of X chromosomes from the mother is irrelevant to determining sex.\n   - **Option B**: A recessive allele on the X chromosome does not determine sex.\n   - **Option C**: A single Y chromosome from the mother is not possible, as females have two X chromosomes.\n   - **Option D**: A single Y chromosome from the father is the correct answer, as it is the Y chromosome that determines the sex of the child.\n\nTherefore, the sex of a child is dictated by the inheritance of a single Y chromosome from the father. The correct answer is **D**.",
