The head of each rib articulates with the superior and inferior articular facets of the corresponding vertebra.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Sixth Rib**: The sixth rib is connected to the fifth thoracic vertebra (T5) and the seventh thoracic vertebra (T6).\n\n3. **Identifying the Articulation Points**:\n   - The inferior articular facet of T5 is the point where the head of the sixth rib articulates with the fifth thoracic vertebra.\n   - The superior articular facet of T6 is the point where the head of the sixth rib articulates with the seventh thoracic vertebra.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Correct. The inferior articular facet of T5 and the superior articular facet of T6 are the correct articulation points for the sixth rib.\n   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The inferior articular demifacet of T5 is not a standard term used to describe the articulation point.\n   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The inferior articular demifacet of T5 is not a standard term used to describe the articulation point.\n   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The superior and inferior demifacets of T6 are not the correct articulation points for the sixth rib.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. The inferior articular facet of T5 and superior articular facet of T6**.",
