If this fusion fails, it can lead to macrostomia, a condition characterized by an unusually large mouth opening. This is a well-documented cause of macrostomia.\n\nB. **Left and right mandibular processes**: Fusion of the left and right mandibular processes is important for the proper development of the lower jaw. However, this fusion is not typically associated with macrostomia.\n\nC. **Maxillary and frontonasal processes**: The fusion of the maxillary and frontonasal processes is important for the development of the nasal and oral cavities. While this fusion is crucial for normal facial and oral development, it is not the primary cause of macrostomia.\n\nD. **Mandibular and hyoid arches**: The fusion of the mandibular and hyoid arches is important for the development of the lower jaw and the hyoid bone. This fusion is not typically associated with macrostomia.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Maxillary and mandibular processes.",
