Let's check this property.\n\n- If (1, 2) is in ~, then 2 is not equal to 1.\n- If (1, 3) is in ~, then 3 is not equal to 1.\n- If (4, 2) is in ~, then 2 is not equal to 4.\n\nSince none of the pairs in ~ are equal, ~ is not anti-symmetric.\n\nB. **Transitive**: Transitivity means that if (a, b) is in ~ and (b, c) is in ~, then (a, c) is in ~. Let's check this property.\n\n- If (1, 2) is in ~ and (2, 3) is in ~, then (1, 3) is in ~.\n- If (1, 2) is in ~ and (2, 4) is in ~, then (1, 4) is in ~.\n- If (1, 3) is in ~ and (3, 4) is in ~, then (1, 4) is in ~.\n\nSince the relation ~ is transitive, this property holds.\n\nC. **Reflexive**: Reflexivity means that if (a, a) is in ~, then a is in ~. Let's check this property.\n\n- If (1, 1) is in ~, then 1 is in ~.\n- If (2, 2) is in ~, then 2 is in ~.\n- If (3, 3) is in ~, then 3 is in ~.\n- If (4, 4) is in ~, then 4 is in ~.\n\nSince the relation ~ is reflexive, this property holds.\n\nD. **Symmetric**: Symmetry means that if (a, b) is in ~, then (b, a) is in ~. Let's check this property.\n\n- If (1, 2) is in ~, then (2, 1) is not in ~.\n- If (1, 3) is in ~, then (3, 1) is not in ~.\n- If (4, 2) is in ~, then (2, 4) is not in ~.\n\nSince none of the pairs in ~ are equal, ~ is not symmetric.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. transitive",
