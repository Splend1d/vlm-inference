            "content": "To determine the magnetic field at which protons in the molecule have the fastest spin-lattice relaxation, we need to consider the rotational correlation time and the relationship between the magnetic field and the relaxation time.\n\n1. **Understanding the Rotational Correlation Time**: The rotational correlation time (\\(\\tau_R\\)) is given as 1 ns. This is the time it takes for the molecule to complete one full rotation.\n\n2. **Spin-Lattice Relaxation**: The spin-lattice relaxation time (\\(\\tau_{SLR}\\)) is related to the rotational correlation time by the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_{SLR} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_R}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\omega_R\\) is the rotational frequency.\n\n3. **Rotational Frequency**: The rotational frequency (\\(\\omega_R\\)) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\omega_R = \\frac{1}{\\tau_R}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given \\(\\tau_R = 1\\) ns:\n   \\[\n   \\omega_R = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-9}} = 10^9 \\text{ rad/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Magnetic Field and Relaxation Time**: The relaxation time is also related to the magnetic field (\\(B\\)) by:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_{SLR} = \\frac{1}{g \\mu_B B}\n   \\]\n   where \\(g\\) is the Land\u00e9 g-factor and \\(\\mu_B\\) is the Bohr magneton.\n\n5. **Finding the Optimal Magnetic Field**: We want to find the magnetic field \\(B\\) that minimizes \\(\\tau_{SLR}\\). This occurs when the denominator is minimized.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{g \\mu_B B} = \\frac{1}{g \\mu_B B}\n   \\]\n\n   To minimize \\(\\frac{1}{g \\mu_B B}\\), we need to maximize \\(g \\mu_B B\\).\n\n6. **Calculating the Optimal Magnetic Field**:\n   \\[\n   g \\mu_B B = \\frac{1}{10^9}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(B\\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{1}{10^9 \\times g \\mu_B}\n   \\]\n\n   Given \\(g = 2\\) and \\(\\mu_B = 9.49 \\times 10^{-24}\\) J/T, we find:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{1}{10^9 \\times 2 \\times 9.49 \\times 10^{-24}} \\approx 5.19 \\times 10^7 \\text{ T}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the magnetic field at which protons in the molecule have the fastest spin-lattice relaxation is approximately 5.19 T.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 5.19 T**.",
