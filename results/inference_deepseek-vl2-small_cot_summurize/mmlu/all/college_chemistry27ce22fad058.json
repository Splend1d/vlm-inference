It can accept a proton (H+) to form NH4+.\n\n2. **NH2\u2212 (Hydrazine Anion)**: This is a stronger base than ammonia. It can accept a proton to form NH3.\n\n3. **NH4+ (Ammonium Ion)**: This is a weak acid, not a base. It can donate a proton to form NH3.\n\n4. **N2H4 (Hydrazine)**: This is a stronger base than ammonia. It can accept a proton to form NH3.\n\nIn liquid ammonia, the strongest base is the one that can accept a proton to form NH3. Among the given options, N2H4 (Hydrazine) is the strongest base in liquid ammonia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. N2H4",
