Public-key system**.\n\nIn a public-key system, the process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Key Generation**: A pair of keys is generated, one public and one private. The public key is shared with others, while the private key is kept secret.\n\n2. **Signing**: The sender uses their private key to create a digital signature for a message. This signature is a unique code that verifies the sender's identity and ensures the message has not been tampered with.\n\n3. **Verification**: The recipient uses the sender's public key to verify the digital signature. If the signature is valid, the recipient can be confident that the message was indeed sent by the sender and has not been altered.\n\nThis system ensures that the message is authentic and secure, as only the sender has access to the private key and can create a valid signature.",
