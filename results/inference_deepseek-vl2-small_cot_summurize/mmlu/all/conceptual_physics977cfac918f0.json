            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the process of boiling water step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Water is initially at room temperature, which is typically around 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F).\n\n2. **Heating Process**: When water is heated, it absorbs heat from its surroundings. This energy is used to increase the kinetic energy of the water molecules.\n\n3. **Boiling Point**: As the temperature of the water increases, it eventually reaches its boiling point, which is 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F) at standard atmospheric pressure.\n\n4. **Phase Change**: At the boiling point, the water molecules gain enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces holding them in the liquid state. This results in a phase change from liquid to gas.\n\n5. **Vaporization**: The water molecules transition from the liquid phase to the gas phase, forming bubbles of steam.\n\n6. **Heat Release**: During this phase change, the water releases the heat it absorbed to its surroundings. This is why the water appears to cool down as it boils.\n\n7. **Final State**: The water continues to boil until the heat source is removed, and the water reaches a temperature of 100\u00b0C.\n\nGiven this analysis, the process of boiling water tends to:\n\n- **Warm the water**: Initially, the water absorbs heat and warms up.\n- **Cool the water**: During the phase change, the water releases heat, causing it to appear cooler.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both\n\nThis means that boiling water both warms and cools the water during the process.",
