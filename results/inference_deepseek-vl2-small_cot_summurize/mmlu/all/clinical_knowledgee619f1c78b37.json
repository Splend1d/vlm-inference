Infections typically result in inflammation, redness, and pus, whereas keloids are characterized by excessive scar tissue.\n\nB. A firm mass of scar tissue: This is the correct answer. A keloid is a type of raised scar that forms when the body produces more collagen than necessary to heal a wound. This results in a firm, raised mass of scar tissue that can be larger than the original wound.\n\nC. A fine, hairline scar: This describes a normal scar, not a keloid. Normal scars are typically lighter in color and less raised than keloids.\n\nD. Formed if a wound drain is removed too soon: This is incorrect. The formation of a keloid is not directly related to the timing of wound drain removal. While it is true that removing a wound drain too soon can lead to excessive scarring, keloids are more related to genetic predisposition and the body's healing process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. A firm mass of scar tissue.",
