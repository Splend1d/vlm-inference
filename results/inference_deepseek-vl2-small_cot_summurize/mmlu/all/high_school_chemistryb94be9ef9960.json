            "content": "To determine the easiest way to burn a copper penny, we need to consider the methods of heating and the energy required.\n\nA. **Hold the copper penny with crucible tongs, and heat strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner.**\n   - This method involves using a Bunsen burner, which provides a steady flame. However, it requires holding the penny with tongs, which can be cumbersome and potentially dangerous.\n\nB. **Use the method in (A), but use an oxyacetylene torch to reach a higher temperature.**\n   - An oxyacetylene torch can reach much higher temperatures than a Bunsen burner. This would make the process faster and more efficient, but it requires handling an oxyacetylene torch, which can be hazardous.\n\nC. **Grind the copper penny into very small, dust-sized particles, and spray the particles into a Bunsen burner flame.**\n   - Grinding the penny into dust allows for a larger surface area to be exposed to the flame, increasing the rate of combustion. This method is relatively safe and easy to perform.\n\nD. **Dissolve the copper penny in acid, precipitate the hydroxide, and heat in a Bunsen burner flame to make the oxide.**\n   - This method involves chemical reactions that are not straightforward and require precise handling of acids and heat. It is more complex and potentially dangerous.\n\nConsidering the ease of execution, safety, and efficiency, the best method is:\n\n**C. Grind the copper penny into very small, dust-sized particles, and spray the particles into a Bunsen burner flame.**\n\nThis method is the easiest to perform and provides a safe way to achieve the desired effect.",
