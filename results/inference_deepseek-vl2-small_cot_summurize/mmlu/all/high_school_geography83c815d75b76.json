A water divider: This term typically refers to a boundary that separates two bodies of water, such as a river or a lake. The Rio Grande is a river, but it is not primarily used to separate two bodies of water.\n\nB. A watercourse: This term refers to a river or stream, which is a natural flow of water. The Rio Grande is indeed a watercourse, but this option does not specifically describe its role as a boundary.\n\nC. An artificial boundary: This term refers to a boundary that is created by human activity, such as a wall or fence. The Rio Grande is not an artificial boundary; it is a natural river.\n\nD. A natural boundary: This term refers to a boundary that is formed by natural features, such as rivers, mountains, or forests. The Rio Grande is a natural river that forms a boundary between the United States and Mexico.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. a natural boundary. The Rio Grande is a natural river that serves as a boundary between the United States and Mexico.",
