This was during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms.\n\n2. **Constitutional Limitations**: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit a president from running for more than two terms. However, it does not explicitly allow for a third term either.\n\n3. **Political Climate**: During Roosevelt's time, the political climate was complex. There were debates and discussions about whether a president could serve more than two terms.\n\n4. **Public Opinion**: Public opinion was divided. Some people supported the idea of a third term, while others opposed it.\n\n5. ** Roosevelt's Decision**: Ultimately, Franklin D. Roosevelt decided not to run for a third term. This decision was influenced by various factors, including the political climate and the potential impact on the country.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 20%\n\nThis answer reflects the historical understanding that a significant portion of the American public was opposed to a third term for Roosevelt.",
