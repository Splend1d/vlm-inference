            "content": "To determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in potassium-40, we need to understand the composition of the isotope and its role in the compound K2SO4.\n\n1. **Protons**: Potassium-40 is an isotope of potassium, which has an atomic number of 19. The atomic number represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. Therefore, potassium-40 has 19 protons.\n\n2. **Neutrons**: The mass number of potassium-40 is 40. The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. To find the number of neutrons, we subtract the number of protons from the mass number:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of neutrons} = \\text{Mass number} - \\text{Number of protons} = 40 - 19 = 21\n   \\]\n   Thus, potassium-40 has 21 neutrons.\n\n3. **Electrons**: Potassium-40 is neutral, meaning it has an equal number of protons and electrons. Therefore, it has 19 electrons.\n\nNow, let's consider the compound K2SO4:\n\n- Potassium (K) is an element with an atomic number of 19, meaning it has 19 electrons.\n- Sulfur (S) has an atomic number of 16, meaning it has 16 electrons.\n- Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8, meaning it has 8 electrons.\n\nIn K2SO4, each potassium atom contributes 19 electrons, and there are two potassium atoms, contributing a total of 38 electrons. The sulfur atom contributes 16 electrons, and the two oxygen atoms contribute 16 electrons (8 electrons each).\n\nThe total number of electrons in K2SO4 is:\n\\[\n38 \\text{ (from K)} + 16 \\text{ (from S)} + 16 \\text{ (from O)} = 70 \\text{ electrons}\n\\]\n\nSince the compound is neutral, the total number of electrons must equal the total number of protons. Therefore, the number of electrons in K2SO4 is 70, which matches the number of electrons in the potassium-40 ion.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 19 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons",
