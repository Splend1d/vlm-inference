While important, authentication does not directly address the issue of decrypting messages that have already been sent.\n\nB. **Deniability**: This property allows the sender to deny having sent a message, which is useful for avoiding accountability. However, it does not protect the confidentiality of the messages once they have been sent.\n\nC. **Forward secrecy**: This property ensures that even if the encryption keys are compromised in the future, past messages remain secure. This is exactly what Alice and Bob need to protect their messages from being decrypted by an adversary who might compromise one of their computers.\n\nD. **Backward secrecy**: This property ensures that even if the encryption keys are compromised in the past, future messages remain secure. This is not relevant to the current concern of protecting messages from being decrypted by an adversary who might compromise one of their computers.\n\nTherefore, the security property that can address Alice and Bob's concern is:\n\nC.
