The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6\n- The biceps reflex is a stretch reflex that originates from the upper motor neurons in the C5 and C6 spinal cord segments. This statement is correct.\n\nB. If no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon it is documented as absent\n- In clinical practice, if no reflex is elicited, it is documented as absent, not present. This statement is incorrect.\n\nC. The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa\n- The triceps tendon is actually struck in the cubital fossa, not the antecubital fossa. This statement is incorrect.\n\nD. Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion\n- Brisk finger jerks are typically used to assess upper motor neuron lesions, not lower motor neuron lesions. This statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6",
