            "content": "To determine which decimal number has an exact representation in binary notation, we need to understand how binary numbers work.\n\nBinary numbers are base-2 numbers, which means they use only two digits: 0 and 1. Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2. For example, in the binary number 101, the rightmost digit (1) represents \\(2^0\\), the next digit (0) represents \\(2^1\\), and the leftmost digit (1) represents \\(2^2\\).\n\nTo convert a decimal number to binary, we repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainders. The remainders, read from bottom to top, give us the binary representation.\n\nLet's convert each decimal number to binary:\n\nA. 0.1:\n- 0.1 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 0.\n- 0 divided",
