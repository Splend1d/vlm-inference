            "content": "To determine which feature suggests a pleural friction rub, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **More prominent in expiration**: A pleural friction rub is typically more prominent during inspiration (inhaling) rather than expiration. This is because the pleural friction rub is caused by the movement of the pleurae (the thin membranes lining the lungs and chest cavity) against each other during inspiration. Therefore, this option is not indicative of a pleural friction rub.\n\nB. **Alters with coughing**: A pleural friction rub can vary in intensity with changes in breathing, such as coughing. This variability is due to the movement of the pleurae during different phases of breathing. Therefore, this option is consistent with a pleural friction rub.\n\nC. **No pain over the area**: A pleural friction rub is often associated with pain over the affected area, which is typically the chest wall. If there is no pain, this suggests a different type of crackling sound, such as a bronchial or tracheal sound, rather than a pleural friction rub.\n\nD. **Clubbing**: Clubbing is a physical sign often associated with chronic lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not directly related to the presence of a pleural friction rub.\n\nBased on this analysis, the feature that suggests a pleural friction rub is:\n\nB. Alters with coughing.",
