It is not involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\nB. Coenzyme A (CoA): Coenzyme A is a crucial molecule in the metabolism of fatty acids. It acts as a carrier for acyl groups, which are essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria. Fatty acids are converted into acyl-CoA, which can then be transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.\n\nC. Acetyl-CoA: Acetyl-CoA is a product of fatty acid beta-oxidation and is used as a substrate for the citric acid cycle. It is not involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\nD. Carnitine: Carnitine is a molecule that facilitates the transport of fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It acts as a shuttle, binding to fatty acids and transporting them into the mitochondria.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Coenzyme A (CoA).",
