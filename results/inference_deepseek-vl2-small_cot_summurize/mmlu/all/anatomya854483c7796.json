It does not produce plasma proteins or remove bilirubin from the blood.\n\nB. **Kidney**: The kidneys are responsible for filtering blood, removing waste products, and regulating fluid balance. They do not produce plasma proteins or remove bilirubin from the blood.\n\nC. **Liver**: The liver is a vital organ that performs several critical functions. It produces bile, which helps digest fats, and removes bilirubin from the blood. The liver also manufactures plasma proteins, including albumin, clotting factors (such as prothrombin and fibrinogen), and other essential proteins.\n\nD. **Spleen**: The spleen filters blood and helps fight infections. It does not produce plasma proteins or remove bilirubin from the blood.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is **C. Liver**. The liver is the organ that removes bilirubin from the blood, manufactures plasma proteins, and is involved with the production of prothrombin and fibrinogen.",
