            "content": "The east-west orientation of the Alpine mountain system and the northern plains of western and central Europe plays a significant role in the distribution of climatic conditions across the continent. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Limits the marine climate of Europe to coastal areas\n- This statement is incorrect. The Alpine mountain system does not limit the marine climate to coastal areas. Instead, it acts as a barrier that can influence the distribution of weather patterns, but it does not restrict the marine climate to coastal regions alone.\n\nB. Provides a corridor for communication between southern and northern Europe\n- This statement is incorrect. The Alpine mountain system is a barrier that separates the northern and southern parts of Europe, not a corridor. It does not facilitate communication between these regions.\n\nC. Enables marine-like climatic conditions to extend eastward into Germany and Poland\n- This statement is correct. The Alpine mountain system acts as a barrier that can cause the marine climate to be pushed eastward into Germany and Poland. The mountains can block cold air from the north and the Atlantic Ocean's moisture, leading to a more temperate climate in the eastern parts of Europe.\n\nD. Effectively prevents population movement between parts of the Mediterranean region\n- This statement is incorrect. The Alpine mountain system does not prevent population movement between the Mediterranean region and other parts of Europe. Instead, it serves as a natural boundary that influences the movement of people and goods.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The Alpine mountain system enables marine-like climatic conditions to extend eastward into Germany and Poland.",
