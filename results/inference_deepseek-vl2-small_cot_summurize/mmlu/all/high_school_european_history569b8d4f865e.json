In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress \u2026 the state is \u2026 reversing its function. \u2026 To enforce the fundamental law\u2014to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. \u2026 [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. \u2026\nThe poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong \u2026 are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. \u2026 When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.\nHerbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Spencer\n\nA. opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor\nB. challenged the government's right to tax the people\nC. believed that the government should do more than merely protect its people\nD. believed that working people should unite for a common cause\n",

            "content": "Herbert Spencer's argument in the passage is that the government's role is to protect its people, and that it should not demand contributions from citizens for the mitigation of distress. He believes that the government should not reverse its function by demanding from citizens contributions for the mitigation of distress. He also believes that the government should not interfere with the freedom of individuals, as long as they do not infringe on the equal freedom of any other man. \n\nOption A is not correct because the passage does not explicitly state that Spencer opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor. \n\nOption B is not correct because the passage does not challenge the government's right to tax the people. Instead, Spencer argues that the government should not demand from citizens contributions for the mitigation of distress.\n\nOption C is correct because the passage suggests that Spencer believes the government should do more than merely protect its people. He argues that the government should not demand from citizens contributions for the mitigation of distress, which implies that he believes the government should do more to help its people.\n\nOption D is not correct because the passage does not discuss the idea of working people uniting for a common cause.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C. \n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
