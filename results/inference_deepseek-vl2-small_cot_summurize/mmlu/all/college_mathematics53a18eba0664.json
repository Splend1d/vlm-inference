            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement based on the properties of similar matrices.\n\n**Statement I: A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices.**\n\nSimilarity is a property of matrices that is preserved under matrix multiplication. If two matrices are similar, then any matrix that is a linear combination of them is also similar to them. However, the statement that A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices is not necessarily true. The matrices A and B are similar, but subtracting 2 times the identity matrix (2I) from them does not necessarily preserve this similarity. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement II: A and B have the same trace.**\n\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements. If A and B are similar matrices, then they have the same characteristic polynomial, which means they have the same eigenvalues. Since the trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues, A and B must have the same trace. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n**Statement III: A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices.**\n\nThe inverse of a matrix is also a matrix, and if two matrices are similar, then their inverses are also similar. Therefore, if A and B are similar matrices, then A^-1 and B^-1 are also similar matrices. This statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statements that must be true are II and III. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. III only",
