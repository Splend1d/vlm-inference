The apparent brightness of an object is the brightness we see from our location, while the actual brightness is the brightness of the object as it would appear if it were at a standard distance (usually 10 parsecs, or about 32.6 light-years).\n\nThe relationship between apparent brightness (B) and actual brightness (A) is given by the inverse square law:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{A}{d^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( B \\) is the apparent brightness, \\( A \\) is the actual brightness, and \\( d \\) is the distance from the observer to the object.\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for distance \\( d \\), we get:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{B}} \\]\n\nThis equation allows you to estimate the distance to an object based on its apparent brightness and actual brightness.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
