It required the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops and to withdraw them within 60 days unless Congress approved the action.\n\nThe Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was designed to limit the president's ability to unilaterally impound funds appropriated by Congress. It required the president to submit a budget to Congress and to submit a detailed budget justification for any impoundment.\n\nBoth acts were seen as necessary to ensure that the president did not overstep his authority and to ensure that Congress had a role in the decision-making process.",
