This means that we do not reject the null hypothesis even though it is actually false. In other words, we miss detecting a real effect or difference that exists.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. This describes a Type I error, not a Type II error. A Type I error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis.\n\nB. It is equivalent to the power of the test. This statement is incorrect. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, which is the opposite of a Type II error.\n\nC. It is equivalent to the size of the test. This is not accurate. The size of a test refers to the significance level (alpha), which is the probability of making a Type I error. It does not describe a Type II error.\n\nD. It is the probability of failing to reject a null hypothesis that was wrong. This is the correct description of a Type II error. It is the probability of not detecting a real effect or difference that exists.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. It is the probability of failing to reject a null hypothesis that was wrong.",
