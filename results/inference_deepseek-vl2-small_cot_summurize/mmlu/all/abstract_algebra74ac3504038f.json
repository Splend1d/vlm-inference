Multiplication is not a binary operation.\n- This is incorrect. Multiplication is a binary operation because it involves two numbers.\n\nB. Multiplication is not associative.\n- This is incorrect. Multiplication is associative. For any real numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)\\).\n\nC. Identity element does not exist.\n- This is incorrect. The identity element for multiplication is 1. For any real number \\(a\\), \\(a \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot a = a\\).\n\nD. Zero has no inverse.\n- This is correct. In the set of real numbers under multiplication, zero does not have an inverse. For any real number \\(a\\), there is no real number \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\cdot b = 1\\). This is because the multiplicative identity is 1, and multiplying by zero does not result in 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Zero has no inverse.",
