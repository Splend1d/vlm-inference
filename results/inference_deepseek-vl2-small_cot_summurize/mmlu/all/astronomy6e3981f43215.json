            "content": "The weight of an object on the moon is determined by the gravitational force acting on it. The moon's gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's, so the weight of an object is also 1/6th of its weight on Earth.\n\n- A kilogram of feathers on Earth weighs 1 kg. On the moon, it would weigh 1/6 kg, which is approximately 0.167 kg.\n- Five pounds of bricks on Earth weigh 5 pounds. On the moon, they would weigh 5/6 pounds, which is approximately 0.833 pounds.\n- Five kilograms of feathers on Earth weigh 5 kg. On the moon, they would weigh 5/6 kg, which is approximately 0.833 kg.\n- A kilogram of bricks on Earth weighs 1 kg. On the moon, they would weigh 1/6 kg, which is approximately 0.167 kg.\n\nComparing these values, the five pounds of bricks as measured on Earth would weigh the most on the moon.\n\nThe answer is B.",
