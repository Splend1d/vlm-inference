(~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\nB. (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\nC. (~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 S)\nD. ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n\nThe correct formula should match the logical structure of the sentence. The sentence has two parts:\n1. \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" (represented by (~F \u2283 E))\n2. \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds\" (represented by (C \u2261 S))\n\nThe correct formula should combine these two parts in a way that reflects the logical structure of the sentence. \n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. (~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n   - This formula combines the two parts of the sentence but does not match the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nB. (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\n   - This formula does not match the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nC. (~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 S)\n   - This formula matches the logical structure of the sentence. It combines the two parts of the sentence in a way that reflects the logical structure.\n\nD. ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n   - This formula does not match the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\n\nC.
