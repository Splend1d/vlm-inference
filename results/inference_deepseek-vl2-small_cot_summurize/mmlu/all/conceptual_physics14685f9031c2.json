Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\rho = \\frac{m}{V}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume and Mass Relationship**: The mass of an object is constant if there is no change in the amount of matter. Therefore, if the volume of an object doubles, the mass remains the same.\n\n3. **Effect on Density**: Since density is the ratio of mass to volume, and the mass does not change, the density will also remain the same.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A: Halve**: This would imply that the density is reduced, which is incorrect because the mass remains constant.\n   - **Option B: Double**: This would imply that the density is increased, which is incorrect because the mass remains constant.\n   - **Option C: Be the same**: This is correct because the density is determined by the ratio of mass to volume, and since the mass does not change, the density remains unchanged.\n   - **Option D: None of these**: This is incorrect because Option C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. be the same**.",
