            "content": "The question states that there are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in Mr. Clark's class. This means that the total number of students in the fourth grade is 5 times the number of students in Mr. Clark's class.\n\nLet's denote the number of students in Mr. Clark's class as \\( n \\). According to the question, the total number of students in the fourth grade is \\( 5n \\).\n\nThe question also states that there are 20 students in Mr. Clark's class. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ n = 20 \\]\n\nThis means that the number of students in the entire fourth grade is also 20.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. \\( 5xn = 20 \\) - This equation is not correct because it suggests that the number of students in the entire fourth grade is 5 times the number of students in Mr. Clark's class, which is not what the question states.\n\nB. \\( 5 + 20 = n \\) - This equation is not correct because it suggests that the number of students in the entire fourth grade is the sum of 5 and 20, which is not what the question states.\n\nC. \\( 20 \\times 5 = n \\) - This equation is correct because it suggests that the number of students in the entire fourth grade is 5 times the number of students in Mr. Clark's class, which is what the question states.\n\nD. \\( 20 / n = 5 \\) - This equation is not correct because it suggests that the number of students in the entire fourth grade is 5 times the number of students in Mr. Clark's class, which is not what the question states.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\( 20 \\times 5 = n \\).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ 100 \\]",
