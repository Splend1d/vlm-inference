It has bristles that can effectively remove plaque and food particles from the teeth and gums. Its size and shape make it ideal for reaching all areas of the mouth, including between teeth and along the gum line.\n\nB. Gloved finger wrapped in gauze: While a gloved finger can be used to clean the mouth, it is not as effective as a toothbrush. The gauze can help protect the finger from bacteria, but it does not have the necessary bristles to remove plaque and food particles efficiently.\n\nC. Forceps wrapped in gauze: Forceps are not designed for oral use. They are typically used for medical procedures and are not suitable for cleaning the mouth.\n\nD. Foam stick: A foam stick is not a standard tool for oral hygiene. It is not designed to clean the mouth and is not effective in removing plaque and food particles.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best tool for cleaning the mouth is:\n\nA. Small, soft toothbrush.",
