            "content": "To determine which of the given compounds is incorrectly named, we need to analyze each compound's name and compare it to the correct chemical formula.\n\nA. **CaCl2** - This is calcium chloride. The formula is correct because calcium (Ca) has a +2 charge, and chloride (Cl) has a -1 charge. The compound is formed by one calcium ion and two chloride ions, resulting in a neutral compound.\n\nB. **Fe(NO3)3** - This is iron(III) nitrate. The formula is correct because iron (Fe) has a +3 charge, and nitrate (NO3) has a -1 charge. The compound is formed by one iron ion and three nitrate ions, resulting in a neutral compound.\n\nC. **AlBr3** - This is aluminum tribromide. The formula is incorrect because aluminum (Al) has a +3 charge, and bromide (Br) has a -1 charge. The correct formula should be AlBr3, not AlBr3. The compound is formed by one aluminum ion and three bromide ions, resulting in a neutral compound.\n\nD. **K2Cr2O7** - This is potassium dichromate. The formula is correct because potassium (K) has a +1 charge, and dichromate (Cr2O7) has a -2 charge. The compound is formed by two potassium ions and seven dichromate ions, resulting in a neutral compound.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we find that the incorrect name is:\n\nC. AlBr3",
