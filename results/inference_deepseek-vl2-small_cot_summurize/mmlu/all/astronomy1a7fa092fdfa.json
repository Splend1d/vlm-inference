Neptune and Pluto won't collide because of their orbital resonance.\n\nThe reason for this is that Neptune and Pluto are not in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:4 orbital resonance, meaning for every 3 Neptune orbits, there are 4 Pluto orbits. This resonance is a result of the gravitational interactions between the two planets and the other objects in the solar system, but it does not prevent them from colliding.\n\nThe other statements are true:\n\nA. The Earth and Venus are indeed in a 1:1 orbital resonance, which is a common feature of the inner planets in our solar system.\n\nB. Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:4 orbital resonance, which is a result of the gravitational interactions between the two planets and the other objects in the solar system.\n\nC. The Kirkwood Gaps in the asteroid belt are due to resonances with Jupiter, which is a result of the gravitational interactions between Jupiter and the other objects in the solar system. These resonances cause the orbits of the asteroids to be unstable and lead to the formation of gaps in the asteroid belt.",
