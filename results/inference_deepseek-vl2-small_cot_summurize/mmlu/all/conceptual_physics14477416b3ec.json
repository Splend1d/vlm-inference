            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the sum of vector forces acting on an object and its motion.\n\n1. **Understanding Vector Forces**: A vector force is a force that has both magnitude and direction. When we say the sum of all vector forces on an object is zero, it means that the forces acting on the object are balanced.\n\n2. **Newton's First Law of Motion**: According to Newton's first law, an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This law implies that if the net force on an object is zero, the object will not change its state of motion.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: \"move at a constant speed in a straight line\" - This is consistent with Newton's first law. If the net force is zero, the object will continue to move at a constant speed in a straight line.\n   - **Option B**: \"accelerate at a constant rate in a straight line\" - This would require a net force, as acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity.\n   - **Option C**: \"come to rest\" - This would require a net force in the opposite direction, which is not the case here.\n   - **Option D**: \"increase its amount of inertia\" - Inertia is a property of an object and does not change with the net force acting on it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the sum of all vector forces on the object is zero, the object will continue to move at a constant speed in a straight line.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. move at a constant speed in a straight line**.",
