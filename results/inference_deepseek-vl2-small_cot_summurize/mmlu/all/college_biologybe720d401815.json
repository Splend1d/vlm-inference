Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.\n- This statement is incorrect. While it is true that plants have chloroplasts, they also have mitochondria. Animals, on the other hand, have mitochondria but do not have chloroplasts.\n\nB. Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.\n- This statement is incorrect. Plants do have both chloroplasts and mitochondria. Fungi, like plants, have both chloroplasts and mitochondria.\n\nC. Plants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have only mitochondria.\n- This statement is incorrect. Both plants and fungi have chloroplasts and mitochondria. Animals have mitochondria but do not have chloroplasts.\n\nD. Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.\n- This statement is correct. Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria, which are essential for photosynthesis and cellular respiration, respectively. Animals and fungi have mitochondria but do not have chloroplasts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.",
