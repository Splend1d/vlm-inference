For example, the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}^n\\) is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n- A subgroup \\( K \\) of a group \\( G \\) is free abelian if and only if it is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of finite order.\n\nGiven that \\( K \\) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, it must be a subgroup of a direct sum of cyclic groups of finite order. Therefore, \\( K \\) is free abelian.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( K \\) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \\( G / K \\) is free abelian.\n\nTo determine the truth of this statement, we need to understand the properties of quotient groups and free abelian groups.\n\n- The quotient group \\( G / K \\) is the group of cosets of \\( K \\) in \\( G \\).\n- If \\( K \\) is a subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \\( G / K \\) is a subgroup of the finitely generated free abelian group \\( G \\).\n\nHowever, the quotient group \\( G / K \\) is not necessarily free abelian. For example, consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) (the integers under addition) and the subgroup \\( 2\\mathbb{Z} \\) (the even integers). The quotient group \\( \\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z} \\) is isomorphic to the cyclic group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), which is not free abelian.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",
