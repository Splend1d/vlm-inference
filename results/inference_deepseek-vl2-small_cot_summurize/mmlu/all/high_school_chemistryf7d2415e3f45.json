CH4(g) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(l)\n- This is a combustion reaction, which is exothermic and typically proceeds to completion under standard conditions.\n- Combustion reactions are generally considered irreversible because they release a significant amount of energy and are driven by the formation of products.\n\nB. HCN(aq) + H2O(l) \u2192 CN-(aq) + H3O+(aq)\n- This is an acid-base reaction where HCN acts as a weak acid and H2O as a base.\n- Such reactions are often reversible, especially in aqueous solutions, due to the equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base.\n\nC. Al(NO3)3(s) \u2192 Al3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq)\n- This is a dissolution reaction where solid aluminum nitrate dissolves in water to form aluminum ions and nitrate ions.\n- Dissolution reactions are generally reversible, as the solute can precipitate out of solution if conditions change.\n\nD. 2Ag+(aq) + Ti(s) \u2192 2Ag(s) + Ti2+(aq)\n- This is a redox reaction where silver ions are reduced to silver metal, and titanium is oxidized to titanium ions.\n- Redox reactions can be reversible, depending on the conditions, such as the presence of a catalyst or changes in concentration.\n\nBased on the analysis, the process that is irreversible is:\n\nA. CH4(g) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(l)\n\nThis is because combustion reactions are typically irreversible due to the significant energy release and the tendency to proceed to completion.",
