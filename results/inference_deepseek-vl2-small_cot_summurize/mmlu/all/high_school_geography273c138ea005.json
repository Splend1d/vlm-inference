Manufacturing goods where production costs are the highest.\n- This option suggests that transnational corporations choose locations based on high production costs. This is not a typical strategy for transnational corporations, as they generally aim to minimize costs and maximize efficiency.\n\nB. Conducting accounting and research services where economical.\n- This option implies that transnational corporations select locations for their accounting and research services based on cost-effectiveness. While cost is a factor, these services are often located in areas with a skilled workforce and access to information, which may not necessarily be the cheapest locations.\n\nC. Based on comparative advantage.\n- This option aligns with the principles of comparative advantage, which suggest that transnational corporations choose locations where they can leverage their strengths, such as skilled labor, access to markets, or favorable business environments, to maximize efficiency and profitability. This is a common strategy for transnational corporations.\n\nD. With headquarters located in LDCs.\n- This option suggests that transnational corporations base their headquarters in low-cost countries (LDCs). While some corporations may have headquarters in LDCs, this is not a universal strategy for all transnational corporations.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate answer is:\n\nC. Based on comparative advantage.",
