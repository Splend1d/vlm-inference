            "content": "To determine the power dissipation in an ideal inductor, we need to understand the nature of inductors and how they interact with current.\n\n1. **Definition of an Ideal Inductor**: An ideal inductor is a theoretical component that has no resistance and no energy losses. It is purely reactive, meaning it stores energy in a magnetic field when current flows through it.\n\n2. **Inductive Reactance**: The inductive reactance (\\(X_L\\)) of an inductor is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   X_L = 2\\pi fL\n   \\]\n   where \\(f\\) is the frequency of the AC current, and \\(L\\) is the inductance.\n\n3. **Power Dissipation in an Ideal Inductor**: In an ideal inductor, the current is purely reactive, meaning it oscillates between zero and a maximum value. The power dissipated in an inductor is given by:\n   \\[\n   P = I^2 X_L\n   \\]\n   Since the current \\(I\\) is zero at the peaks of the AC cycle, the power \\(P\\) is also zero.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Because the current in an ideal inductor is zero at the peaks of the AC cycle, the power dissipation is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
