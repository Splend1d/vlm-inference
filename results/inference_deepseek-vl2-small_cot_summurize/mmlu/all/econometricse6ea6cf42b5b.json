            "content": "To determine which statement is true about OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) estimation, we need to understand the purpose and properties of OLS.\n\n1. **Understanding OLS**: OLS is a method used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. The goal is to find the line that best fits the data by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.\n\n2. **Objective of OLS**: The primary objective of OLS is to minimize the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the data points to the fitted line. This is because the vertical distances represent the residuals, and minimizing these distances ensures that the line is as close as possible to all the data points.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: This statement suggests minimizing the sum of the vertical distances. While this is true, it is not the primary objective of OLS.\n   - **Option B**: This statement correctly identifies that OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line. This is the correct objective of OLS.\n   - **Option C**: This statement suggests minimizing the sum of the horizontal distances. This is not relevant to OLS, as OLS focuses on vertical distances.\n   - **Option D**: This statement suggests minimizing the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances. This is not relevant to OLS, as OLS focuses on vertical distances.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct statement is that OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**.",
