This means it does not do work on the particle, and therefore, it cannot change the particle's speed. The work done by the magnetic force is zero, as the force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion.\n\nB. **Direction**: The magnetic force can change the direction of a charged particle. This is because the force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, which means it can cause the particle to change its direction of motion.\n\nC. **Both of these**: Since the magnetic force does not change the speed of the particle, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Neither of these**: This option is incorrect because the magnetic force can indeed change the direction of the particle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. direction**. The magnetic force can change the direction of a moving charged particle, but it cannot change its speed.",
