They are international organizations that have a broad mandate and membership that extends beyond national borders.\n\nASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is also a supranational organization, as it is a regional organization that aims to promote economic growth, cultural exchange, and political stability in Southeast Asia.\n\nOn the other hand, the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) is a national liberation organization that was established in 1964 to represent the Palestinian people and advocate for their rights. It is not a supranational organization, as it is focused on the interests of a specific nation or people, rather than a broader international community.",
