Pendleton Act of 1883.\n\nThe Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883 was a landmark piece of legislation in the United States that established the merit-based system of hiring for civil service jobs. Prior to this act, the spoils system was in place, where jobs were often awarded based on political connections and loyalty rather than merit or qualifications. The Pendleton Act aimed to eliminate corruption and nepotism in the civil service by requiring that all positions be filled based on a competitive examination, regardless of political affiliation. This act laid the foundation for the modern civil service system in the United States.",
