            "content": "To determine the best method for measuring trace amounts of CFCs in an air sample, we need to consider the sensitivity, selectivity, and detection limits of each method.\n\nA. **Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by electron capture detection**: This method is highly sensitive and selective for CFCs. The capillary column allows for high resolution and separation of complex mixtures, while the electron capture detector is very sensitive to halogenated compounds like CFCs. This method is capable of detecting CFCs at sub-ppb levels, making it suitable for trace analysis.\n\nB. **Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a packed column followed by thermal conductivity detection**: This method is less sensitive than the capillary column method. Thermal conductivity detection is not as sensitive to halogenated compounds, and the packed column may not provide the same level of separation as a capillary column.\n\nC. **Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by flame ionization detection**: While this method is sensitive, it is not as selective for CFCs as the electron capture detector. Flame ionization detection is more commonly used for non-halogenated compounds, making it less ideal for CFCs.\n\nD. **Conversion of the sample of the chlorinated compounds to chloride ions, followed by titration with Ag+**: This method is not suitable for measuring CFCs directly. It involves chemical conversion and titration, which are not appropriate for direct detection of CFCs.\n\nConsidering the sensitivity, selectivity, and detection limits, the best method for measuring trace amounts of CFCs in an air sample is:\n\n**A.
