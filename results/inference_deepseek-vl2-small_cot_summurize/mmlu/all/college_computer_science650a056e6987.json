Availability is defined as the ratio of the mean time the product is available to the mean time between failures.\n\n1. **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** Given as 10,000 hours.\n\n2. **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):** Given as 20 hours.\n\n3. **Availability Formula:** Availability (A) is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute the Values:**\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{10,000}{10,000 + 20} = \\frac{10,000}{10,020}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Value:**\n   \\[\n   A \\approx \\frac{10,000}{10,020} \\approx 0.99798\n   \\]\n\n6. **Convert to Percentage:**\n   \\[\n   A \\approx 0.99798 \\times 100\\% \\approx 99.798\\%\n   \\]\n\n7. **Round to Desired Precision:**\n   \\[\n   A \\approx 99.80\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the availability of the software product is approximately 99.80%.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 99.80%**.",
