The threat is often permanent until the entire disk is wiped clean.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a malicious process is granted temporary administrator-level access to a system, it can cause significant damage. Even if the process is killed, the damage can persist. This is because the process can create or modify files, registry entries, or other system components that can be difficult to remove. Additionally, the process can leave behind traces of its activity, such as logs or hidden files, that can be used to recover the system.\n\nRebooting the machine and replacing files that show a virus infection (Option C) is not a complete solution, as the malicious process can still be present in memory or other parts of the system. Wiping the entire disk clean (Option D) is the most effective way to remove the threat, as it ensures that all traces of the malicious process are removed.\n\nWhile killing the process (Option A) may temporarily stop the threat, it does not guarantee that the system is completely free of the malicious process. The threat can still be present in memory or other parts of the system, and it may be difficult to detect and remove. Therefore, the threat is often permanent until the entire disk is wiped clean (Option D).",
