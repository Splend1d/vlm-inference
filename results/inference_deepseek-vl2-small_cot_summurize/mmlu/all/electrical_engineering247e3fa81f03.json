            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for illuminance, which is the product of the candle power of the light source and the cosine of the angle between the light source and the surface. The formula is:\n\n\\[ I = C \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( I \\) is the illuminance,\n- \\( C \\) is the candle power of the light source,\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between the light source and the surface.\n\nGiven:\n- The illuminance \\( I \\) is 6 lux,\n- The distance from the lamp to the point is 5 meters,\n- The angle \\( \\theta \\) is 90 degrees (since the light is directly above the point).\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the candle power \\( C \\):\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{I}{\\cos(\\theta)} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{6 \\text{ lux}}{1} \\]\n\n\\[ C = 6 \\text{ lux} \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the options provided. The candle power of the lamp should be 6 lux, not one of the options listed.\n\nIf we assume the problem is asking for the candle power in lux, then the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the candle power in watts, we can convert lux to watts using the formula:\n\n\\[ 1 \\text{ lux} = \\frac{1}{929.03} \\text{ watts} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ lux} = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{929.03} \\text{ watts} \\approx 0.00648 \\text{ watts} \\]\n\nThis is not one of the options, so it seems there is a discrepancy in the problem or the options provided.",
