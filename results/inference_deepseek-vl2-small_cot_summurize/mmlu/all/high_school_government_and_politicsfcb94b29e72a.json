Voter turnout is often influenced by several factors, including:\n\n1. **Socioeconomic Status**: Voters from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have less time or resources to vote, and may also feel less connected to the political process.\n\n2. **Age**: Younger voters (18-29) are often less engaged in politics and may have less experience with the voting process.\n\n3. **Political Party Affiliation**: Voters who are active in their political parties may be more likely to vote because they are more invested in the party's platform and candidates.\n\n4. **Occupation**: Blue-collar workers who belong to a union may have more time off work to vote, and may also be more likely to vote due to their union's efforts to encourage voter participation.\n\n5. **Professional Status**: Professionals may have more time off work and may be more likely to vote due to their higher level of education and awareness of political issues.\n\nGiven these factors, the category of voters who would be least likely to vote is:\n\nD. Voters aged 18-29\n\nThis is because younger voters are often less engaged in politics and may have less experience with the voting process, making them the least likely to vote.",
