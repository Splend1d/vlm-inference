            "content": "To determine which estimation techniques are available for the estimation of over-identified systems of simultaneous equations, we need to understand the characteristics of each method:\n\ni) **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**: This method is used for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model when the system of equations is correctly specified. It assumes that the model is correctly specified and that there are no multicollinearity issues. Therefore, OLS is not suitable for over-identified systems.\n\nii) **ILS (Instrumental Variables)**: This method is used when there is a valid exogenous variable that can be used to identify the causal effect of the endogenous variable. ILS is particularly useful in cases where the system is over-identified, as it can help in identifying the correct parameters by using the instrument.\n\niii) **2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares)**: This method is used to address the problem of endogeneity in a regression model. It involves two stages: first, the endogenous variable is regressed on the exogenous variables, and then the error term is regressed on the exogenous variables. 2SLS is useful for over-identified systems because it can handle endogeneity by using the exogenous variables as instruments.\n\niv) **IV (Instrumental Variables)**: This method is similar to ILS but is more general and can be used in a broader range of situations. It involves using an exogenous variable to identify the causal effect of the endogenous variable. IV is also suitable for over-identified systems.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (iii) and (iv) only\n\nThese methods, 2SLS and IV, are specifically designed to handle over-identified systems of simultaneous equations by addressing issues related to endogeneity and multicollinearity.",
