Distillation is a process that separates components based on their boiling points. The compound with the lowest boiling point will be the easiest to separate.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **KCl(aq)**: Potassium chloride is a salt that typically has a relatively low boiling point. However, it is not the lowest among the given compounds.\n\nB. **Fe(NO3)3(aq)**: Iron(III) nitrate is a compound that generally has a higher boiling point compared to KCl. It is not the lowest among the given compounds.\n\nC. **MgSO4(aq)**: Magnesium sulfate is a compound with a moderate boiling point. It is not the lowest among the given compounds.\n\nD. **N2H4(aq)**: Hydrazine is a compound with a very low boiling point. It is known for its volatile nature and is often used in rocket propellants due to its low boiling point.\n\nGiven the analysis, the compound with the lowest boiling point is **D. N2H4(aq)**. Therefore, N2H4(aq) would be the easiest to separate via distillation.",
