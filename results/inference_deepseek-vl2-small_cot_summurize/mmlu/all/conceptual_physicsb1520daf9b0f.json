Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that can appear red, purple, or blue depending on the pH of the environment.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it is absorbed by the pigments in the petals. The wavelengths of light that are not absorbed are reflected back to the eye, which is why we perceive the color of the petals as red.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. red.",
