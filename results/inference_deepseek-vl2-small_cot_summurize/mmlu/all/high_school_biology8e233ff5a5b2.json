            "content": "To determine the expected frequency of the allele after 500 years, we need to consider the principles of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the concept of genetic drift.\n\n1. **Understanding Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a principle that describes a state in which allele and genotype frequencies in a population remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of evolutionary influences. The equilibrium is defined by the formula:\n   \\[\n   p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n   \\]\n   where \\( p \\) is the frequency of the dominant allele and \\( q \\) is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\n2. **Frequency of the Allele**: Given that the frequency of the allele is 0.3, we can express it as \\( p = 0.3 \\).\n\n3. **Genetic Drift**: Genetic drift is a mechanism of evolution that causes random changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations. Over time, the frequency of alleles can change due to random sampling effects.\n\n4. **Expected Frequency After 500 Years**: In a population of 1,000 birds, the expected frequency of the allele after 500 years can be calculated using the formula for genetic drift:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected frequency} = p + \\sqrt{pq} \\times \\sqrt{500}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( p = 0.3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected frequency} = 0.3 + \\sqrt{0.3 \\times 0.7} \\times \\sqrt{500}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected frequency} = 0.3 + \\sqrt{0.21} \\times \\sqrt{500}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected frequency} = 0.3 + 0.458 \\times 22.36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected frequency} = 0.3 + 10.02\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected frequency} = 10.32\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The expected frequency of the allele after 500 years is approximately 10.32, which is significantly higher than the initial frequency of 0.3. This indicates that the allele is likely to increase in frequency due to genetic drift.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It will increase if the allele is favorable or will decrease if it is unfavorable for individuals in that population.",
