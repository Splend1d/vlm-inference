A MAC is a type of message authentication code that provides both data integrity and authenticity. It is used to ensure that a message has not been tampered with and that it was indeed sent by the claimed sender.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. Modification detection code (MDC) - This is not a standard term for a digest created by a hash function. MDCs are typically used in the context of digital signatures and are not directly related to hash functions.\n\nB. Modify authentication connection - This term is not standard and does not accurately describe a digest created by a hash function.\n\nD. Message authentication cipher - While this term is somewhat related, it is not the most accurate. A message authentication cipher is a specific type of MAC, but the term \"cipher\" can be misleading. A more accurate term would be \"message authentication code\" or \"MAC.\"",
