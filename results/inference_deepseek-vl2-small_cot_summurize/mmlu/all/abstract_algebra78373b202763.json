Therefore, \\( g \\) is injective because it maps distinct elements of \\( B \\) to distinct elements of \\( A \\).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: The function \\( g \\) must necessarily be surjective.**\n\nTo determine if \\( g \\) is surjective, we need to check if for every element \\( b \\in B \\), there exists an element \\( a \\in A \\) such that \\( g(a) = b \\).\n\nGiven:\n\\[ g(f(a)) = a \\]\n\nThis implies that \\( g \\) maps each element of \\( A \\) to an element of \\( B \\). However, it does not guarantee that every element of \\( B \\) is mapped to by some element of \\( A \\). For example, if \\( B \\) has only one element, say \\( b \\), and \\( f(a) = b \\), then \\( g(a) = b \\) for all \\( a \\in A \\). But if \\( B \\) has more than one element, \\( g \\) might not cover all elements of \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( g \\) is not necessarily surjective.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]",
