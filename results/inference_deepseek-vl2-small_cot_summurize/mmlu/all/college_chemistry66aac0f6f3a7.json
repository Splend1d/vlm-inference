Electron affinity is the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a neutral atom in the gas phase to form an anion. A more negative electron affinity indicates a stronger tendency to accept an electron.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Fluorine (F): Fluorine is known for having the highest electron affinity among the elements. This is because it is highly electronegative and has a strong attraction for electrons.\n\nB. Silicon (Si): Silicon has a moderate electron affinity. It is less electronegative than fluorine but still has a significant attraction for electrons.\n\nC. Oxygen (O): Oxygen has a relatively high electron affinity. It is more electronegative than silicon and has a strong attraction for electrons.\n\nD. Calcium (Ca): Calcium has a low electron affinity. It is a metal and does not have a strong attraction for electrons, making it less likely to accept an additional electron.\n\nBased on this analysis, the atom with the lowest electron affinity is:\n\nD. Ca (Calcium)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Calcium.",
