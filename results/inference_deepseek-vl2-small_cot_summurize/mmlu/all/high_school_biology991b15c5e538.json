Duplication: This mutation involves the copying of a segment of DNA, resulting in two identical copies of the segment. This does not change the reading frame of the gene.\n\nB. Translocation: This mutation involves the rearrangement of parts of chromosomes, often between non-homologous chromosomes. It does not affect the reading frame of a gene.\n\nC. Inversion: This mutation involves the flipping of a segment of DNA, resulting in a mirror image. While it can change the reading frame, it does not typically involve a shift of one base pair.\n\nD. Frameshift mutation: This mutation occurs when a segment of DNA is inserted or deleted, altering the reading frame of the gene. In this case, the insertion of a retrovirus DNA into the middle of a bacterial gene shifts the reading frame by one base pair.\n\nGiven the description of the mutation, the correct answer is D.
