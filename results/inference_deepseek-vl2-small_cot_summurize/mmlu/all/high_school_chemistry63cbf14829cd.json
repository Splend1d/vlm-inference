            "content": "To determine which geometry corresponds to a substance with five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons, we need to analyze the electron pair geometry and the molecular shape.\n\n1. **Electron Pair Geometry**: The electron pair geometry is determined by the number of electron pairs around the central atom. For a molecule with five sigma bonds and one lone pair, the electron pair geometry is trigonal bipyramidal.\n\n2. **Molecular Shape**: The molecular shape is determined by the positions of the atoms. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron pair geometry, the lone pair occupies one of the equatorial positions, while the five sigma bonds occupy the equatorial and axial positions.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **A. Tetrahedron**: This geometry has four sigma bonds and no lone pairs. It is not possible for a molecule with five sigma bonds and one lone pair to have a tetrahedral shape.\n   - **B. Square Planar**: This geometry has four sigma bonds and two lone pairs. It is not possible for a molecule with five sigma bonds and one lone pair to have a square planar shape.\n   - **C. Octahedron**: This geometry has six sigma bonds and no lone pairs. It is not possible for a molecule with five sigma bonds and one lone pair to have an octahedral shape.\n   - **D. Square Pyramid**: This geometry has four sigma bonds and one lone pair. It matches the description of a molecule with five sigma bonds and one lone pair.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Square pyramid**.",
