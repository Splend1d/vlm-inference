According to Coulomb's law, the force \\( F \\) between two point charges \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) separated by a distance \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nF = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant.\n\nNow, let's analyze the scenario where the distance between the two charged particles is halved. If the original distance is \\( r \\), the new distance is \\( \\frac{r}{2} \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( r = \\frac{r}{2} \\) into the equation for the force:\n\n\\[\nF = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{\\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2} = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{\\frac{r^2}{4}} = k \\frac{4|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the force is four times stronger when the distance is halved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. four times as strong",
