            "content": "To determine the specific heat capacity of sand compared to vegetation, we need to understand what specific heat capacity means. Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius.\n\n1. **Understanding Specific Heat Capacity**:\n   - **Sand**: Sand has a specific heat capacity of about 0.84 J/g\u00b0C. This means that to raise the temperature of one gram of sand by one degree Celsius, you need 0.84 joules of heat.\n   - **Vegetation**: The specific heat capacity of vegetation is typically around 2.0 J/g\u00b0C. This means that to raise the temperature of one gram of vegetation by one degree Celsius, you need 2.0 joules of heat.\n\n2. **Comparison**:\n   - Since the specific heat capacity of sand (0.84 J/g\u00b0C) is less than that of vegetation (2.0 J/g\u00b0C), sand cools off faster than vegetation.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The specific heat capacity of sand is lower than that of vegetation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. lower",
