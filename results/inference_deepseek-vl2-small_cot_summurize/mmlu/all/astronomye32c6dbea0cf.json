            "content": "To determine the correct order of elements produced by a star, we need to consider the processes that occur during the star's life, particularly in the later stages.\n\n1. **Hydrogen (H) and Helium (He):** Stars begin their lives by fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. This is the primary process in the early stages of a star's life.\n\n2. **Helium (He) to Lithium (Li):** As the star continues to fuse helium into lithium, it begins to produce heavier elements. This process is known as the triple-alpha process.\n\n3. **Lithium (Li) to Beryllium (Be):** Lithium is then fused into beryllium. This process is known as the beryllium-8 process.\n\n4. **Beryllium (Be) to Boron (B):** Beryllium is then fused into boron. This process is known as the boron-8 process.\n\n5. **Boron (B) to Carbon (C):** Boron is then fused into carbon. This process is known as the carbon-12 process.\n\n6. **Carbon (C) to Oxygen (O):** Carbon is then fused into oxygen. This process is known as the oxygen-16 process.\n\n7. **Oxygen (O) to Neon (Ne):** Oxygen is then fused into neon. This process is known as the neon-20 process.\n\n8. **Neon (Ne) to Silicon (Si):** Neon is then fused into silicon. This process is known as the silicon-28 process.\n\n9. **Silicon (Si) to Iron (Fe):** Finally, silicon is fused into iron. This process is known as the iron-56 process.\n\nGiven this sequence, the correct order of elements produced by a star is:\n\n**A. H \u2192 He \u2192 Li \u2192 N \u2192 O \u2192 Si \u2192 Fe**\n\nThis sequence reflects the processes that occur in the later stages of a star's life, where heavier elements are produced through nuclear fusion.",
