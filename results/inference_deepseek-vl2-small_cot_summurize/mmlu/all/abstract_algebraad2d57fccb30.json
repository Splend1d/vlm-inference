Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n### Statement 2\n\nTo determine if all groups of order \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is prime are Abelian, we need to consider the properties of groups of order \\( p^2 \\).\n\n- A group of order \\( p^2 \\) has \\( p \\) elements of order \\( p \\) and \\( p \\) elements of order \\( 1 \\).\n- The group is cyclic if it has an element of order \\( p^2 \\).\n- If the group is cyclic, it is Abelian because the group operation is commutative.\n- If the group is not cyclic, it is non-Abelian.\n\nFor a group of order \\( p^2 \\) to be Abelian, it must be cyclic. However, not all groups of order \\( p^2 \\) are cyclic. For example, the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is non-Abelian.\n\nTherefore, not all groups of order \\( p^2 \\) are Abelian. Statement 2 is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",
