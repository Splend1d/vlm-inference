            "content": "To determine which statements are true concerning the standardised residuals from an estimated GARCH model, let's analyze each statement:\n\ni) **They are assumed to be normally distributed**: This is a common assumption in GARCH models. The standardised residuals are typically assumed to be normally distributed to ensure that the model's assumptions are met.\n\nii) **Their squares will be related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate**: This is a key property of GARCH models. The squared standardised residuals are related to the lagged squared residuals, which is a fundamental aspect of the GARCH process.\n\niii) **In practice, they are likely to have fat tails**: This is also a characteristic of GARCH models. The standardised residuals often exhibit fat tails, meaning they have more extreme values than a normal distribution would predict.\n\niv) **If the GARCH model is adequate, the standardised residuals and the raw residuals will be identical**: This statement is not true. In a GARCH model, the standardised residuals are derived from the raw residuals by dividing them by their respective conditional standard deviations. They are not identical.\n\nBased on the analysis, the true statements are:\n\n- (i) They are assumed to be normally distributed\n- (ii) Their squares will be related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate\n- (iii) In practice, they are likely to have fat tails\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
