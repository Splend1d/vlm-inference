These lines are **ordered** because they correspond to specific wavelengths of light, which are determined by the energy levels of the electrons in the atoms of the elements.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. **Chaotic**: Spectral lines are not chaotic; they are well-defined and predictable.\n\nC. **Positioned by amplitude**: Spectral lines are not positioned by amplitude; they are positioned by wavelength, which is related to the energy of the photons.\n\nD. **In phase**: Spectral lines are not in phase; they are discrete and separate from each other.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. ordered**.",
