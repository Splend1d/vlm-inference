            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of rounding to the nearest 10. When rounding to the nearest 10, we look at the units digit of the number. If the units digit is 5 or greater, we round up. If the units digit is less than 5, we round down.\n\nGiven that the rounded number of runners is 400, we need to find the actual number of runners that could have rounded to 400.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. 382: The units digit is 2, which is less than 5. Therefore, 382 could be the actual number of runners.\n\nB. 397: The units digit is 7, which is greater than 5. Therefore, 397 could be the actual number of runners.\n\nC. 406: The units digit is 6, which is greater than 5. Therefore, 406 could be the actual number of runners.\n\nD. 447: The units digit is 7, which is greater than 5. Therefore, 447 could be the actual number of runners.\n\nHowever, we need to find the number that could have rounded to 400. Since 382 is the only number that could have rounded to 400, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 382",
