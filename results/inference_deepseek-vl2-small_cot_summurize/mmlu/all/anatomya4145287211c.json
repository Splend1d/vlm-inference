It is a primary mechanism for the development of long bones and is also involved in the formation of the facial skeleton. The viscerocranium, including the bones of the face, develops through endochondral ossification.\n\n2. **Somatic Growth Pattern**: This refers to the growth pattern of the body where the bones grow in length. In the context of the viscerocranium, this pattern is typical as the facial bones extend and develop in length.\n\n3. **Intramembranous Ossification**: This is a process where bone forms directly from mesenchymal tissue without the need for a cartilage stage. It is primarily involved in the formation of flat bones, such as those of the skull base, and is not typically associated with the development of the facial skeleton.\n\n4. **Neural Growth Pattern**: This refers to the growth pattern of the nervous system, which is not directly related to the development of the facial skeleton.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. endochondral ossification and follow the somatic growth pattern.\n\nThis choice correctly identifies the developmental process and growth pattern for the viscerocranium.",
