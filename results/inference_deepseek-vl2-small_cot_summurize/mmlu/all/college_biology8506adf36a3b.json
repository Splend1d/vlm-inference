This segmentation is a defining feature of these phyla.\n\nB. **Have a closed circulatory system**: Annelids have a simple open circulatory system, where blood is pumped directly into the body cavity. Arthropods, on the other hand, have an open circulatory system, where blood is pumped into a network of vessels that open directly into the body cavity. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **Conduct gas exchange by diffusion through a moist membrane**: Both annelids and arthropods conduct gas exchange through diffusion. In annelids, this occurs through their moist skin, while in arthropods, it occurs through their exoskeletons and respiratory systems. This option is correct.\n\nD. **Have well-developed sense organs**: While both phyla have some sense organs, arthropods generally have more developed sensory systems compared to annelids. Arthropods have compound eyes, antennae, and other sensory structures, whereas annelids have simpler sensory organs. This option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. **Conduct gas exchange by diffusion through a moist membrane**\n\nThis characteristic is a shared feature of both annelids and arthropods.",
