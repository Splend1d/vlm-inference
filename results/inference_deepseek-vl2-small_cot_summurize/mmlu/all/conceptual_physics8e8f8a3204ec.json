None is outside the family; all are electromagnetic waves.\n\nExplanation:\n\nElectromagnetic waves are a type of wave that propagates through space carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. They include a wide range of frequencies and wavelengths, from very low frequencies (long wavelengths) to very high frequencies (short wavelengths). The electromagnetic spectrum includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.\n\nA. Microwaves: These are a type of electromagnetic wave with frequencies between 10^6 and 10^9 Hz and wavelengths between 1 mm and 1 meter. They are used in microwave ovens, radar, and communication systems.\n\nB. Light waves: This is a type of electromagnetic wave with frequencies between 4 x 10^14 and 8 x 10^14 Hz and wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers. They are the visible spectrum of light that we can see with our eyes.\n\nC. X-rays: These are a type of electromagnetic wave with frequencies between 10^16 and 10^19 Hz and wavelengths between 0.01 and 10 nanometers. They are used in medical imaging and security screening.\n\nD. None is outside the family; all are electromagnetic waves: This statement is incorrect because there are electromagnetic waves that are not part of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as gravitational waves and cosmic rays. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, and cosmic rays are high-energy particles that originate from outside the Earth's atmosphere.",
