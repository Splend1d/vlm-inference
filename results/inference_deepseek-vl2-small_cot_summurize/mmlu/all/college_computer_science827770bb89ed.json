Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.\n- Horizontal architectures, such as VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) and EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing), are designed to execute instructions in parallel. This means that instructions can be executed simultaneously, reducing the number of time steps required. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nII. Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.\n- Horizontal microinstructions are typically encoded in the instruction set architecture (ISA) to allow for parallel execution. This encoding is necessary to manage the parallel execution of instructions. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nIII. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.\n- Horizontal microinstructions are designed to be simple and efficient, often having a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers to allow for parallel execution. This design is a key feature of horizontal architectures. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. III only",
