            "content": "To determine the genotypes of the parents, we need to analyze the information given about the offspring's coat color.\n\n1. **Dominant and Recessive Traits**: The black coat is dominant over the white coat. This means that the genotype for black hair is either BB or Bb.\n\n2. **Genotype of the Offspring**:\n   - Three quarters of the offspring have black coats.\n   - One quarter of the offspring have white coats.\n\n3. **Genotype Distribution**:\n   - If the black coat is dominant (BB or Bb), then the possible genotypes for the offspring are:\n     - BB (black coat)\n     - Bb (black coat)\n     - Bb (black coat)\n     - Bb (black coat)\n\n   - If the white coat is recessive (bb), then the possible genotypes for the offspring are:\n     - bb (white coat)\n\n4. **Calculating the Proportions**:\n   - Three quarters of the offspring have black coats, which means 75% of the offspring have black coats.\n   - One quarter of the offspring have white coats, which means 25% of the offspring have white coats.\n\n5. **Genotype Ratios**:\n   - Since the black coat is dominant, the genotype ratio for black coats is 3:1.\n   - The genotype ratio for white coats is 1:1.\n\n6. **Possible Parental Genotypes**:\n   - The parental genotypes must produce a 3:1 ratio of black to white offspring.\n   - The only way to achieve this with a dominant trait (black coat) is if one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The genotypes of the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb to produce the observed 3:1 ratio of black to white offspring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Bb \u00d7 Bb**.",
