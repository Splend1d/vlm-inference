            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth of the number of neutrons in the reactor. The number of neutrons doubles every minute.\n\nLet's denote the initial number of neutrons as \\( N_0 \\).\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: \n   - The problem states that the number of neutrons doubles each minute.\n   - After 10 minutes, the number of neutrons is 1 billion.\n\n2. **Exponential Growth Formula**:\n   - The formula for exponential growth is \\( N(t) = N_0 \\times 2^t \\), where \\( N(t) \\) is the number of neutrons at time \\( t \\).\n\n3. **Given Information**:\n   - After 10 minutes, \\( N(10) = 1,000,000,000 \\).\n   - We need to find when the number of neutrons is half a billion, i.e., \\( N(t) = 500,000,000 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( t \\)**:\n   - Substitute \\( N(t) = 500,000,000 \\) into the exponential growth formula:\n     \\[\n     500,000,000 = N_0 \\times 2^t\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( t \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{500,000,000}{N_0} = 2^t\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     t = \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{500,000,000}{N_0} \\right)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine \\( t \\)**:\n   - Since \\( N_0 \\) is the initial number of neutrons, we need to find \\( t \\) when the number of neutrons is half a billion.\n   - We know that \\( N(10) = 1,000,000,000 \\), so \\( N_0 = 1,000,000,000 \\).\n   - Substitute \\( N_0 = 1,000,000,000 \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     t = \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{500,000,000}{1,000,000,000} \\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     t = \\log_2 \\left( 0.5 \\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     t = 1\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The number of neutrons doubles every minute.\n   - Therefore, it takes 1 minute for the number of neutrons to double from 1 billion to 2 billion.\n   - Thus, the number of neutrons reaches half a billion in 1 minute.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 1 minute**.",
