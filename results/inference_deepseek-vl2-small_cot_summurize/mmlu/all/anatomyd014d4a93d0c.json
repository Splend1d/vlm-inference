            "content": "To determine the correct statement about the postnatal growth of the maxilla, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty.\n- Pneumatisation refers to the enlargement of the maxillary sinus during development. This process typically continues until the sinus reaches its adult size, which is usually around the age of 12-14 years. Therefore, this statement is incorrect because pneumatisation does not cease at puberty.\n\nB. Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity.\n- The eruption of permanent molars is facilitated by the resorption of the maxillary tuberosity, which is a bony process that forms the floor of the maxillary sinus. This process is crucial for the eruption of the permanent molars, making this statement correct.\n\nC. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla.\n- The zygomaticomaxillary sutures are the joints that connect the maxilla to the zygomatic bone. These sutures do not contribute to the increase in height and length of the maxilla; instead, they allow for the growth of the maxilla in the vertical direction. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally.\n- The intermaxillary suture is the joint between the maxillary bones. It typically closes around the age of 12-14 years, not eight years postnatally. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statement is:\n\nB. Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity.",
