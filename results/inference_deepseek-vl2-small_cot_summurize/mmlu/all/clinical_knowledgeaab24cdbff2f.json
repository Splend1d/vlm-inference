The gastric parietal cells are located in the stomach and are responsible for secreting hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, which are essential for digestion and vitamin B12 absorption, respectively. They do not secrete insulin.\n\nB. The pancreas is a vital gland in the human body that plays a crucial role in digestion and regulation of blood sugar levels. It contains two main types of cells: exocrine cells and endocrine cells. The endocrine cells, specifically the beta cells, are responsible for secreting insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.\n\nC. The walls of the large intestine are composed of epithelial cells and are involved in the absorption of water and electrolytes, as well as the formation of feces. They do not secrete hormones like insulin.\n\nD. The autonomic nervous system is a part of the peripheral nervous system that controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiratory rate. It does not secrete hormones like insulin.\n\nConsidering the functions and locations of these options, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The pancreas.",
