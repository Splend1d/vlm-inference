            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the global distribution of deaths by suicide as of 2017. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global suicide rate in 2017 was approximately 13.2 deaths per 100,000 people.\n\nTo find the percentage of global deaths by suicide, we need to convert this rate into a percentage. The formula to convert a rate to a percentage is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Rate}}{\\text{Total Population}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nHowever, the WHO does not provide a specific global population figure for 2017. Instead, we can use the global population in 2017, which was approximately 7.6 billion people.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{13.2}{7,600,000,000} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{13.2}{7,600,000,000} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 0.0001737\\% \\]\n\nThis result is approximately 0.0001737%, which is equivalent to 0.0001737%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.70%\n\nThis option is closest to the calculated percentage, although it is slightly lower. The other options (1.40%, 2.80%, and 5.60%) are significantly higher than the calculated percentage.",
