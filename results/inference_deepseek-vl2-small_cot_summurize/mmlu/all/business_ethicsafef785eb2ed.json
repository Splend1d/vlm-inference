Descriptive, Normative: Descriptive theory refers to theories that describe what is, while normative theory refers to theories that prescribe what ought to be. This option does not fit the context of the question, which is about moral codes.\n\nB. Normative, Instrumental: Normative morality is concerned with what ought to be, while instrumental morality is concerned with how to achieve a particular goal. This option does not fit the context of the question, which is about moral codes.\n\nC. Normative, Descriptive: Normative theory is concerned with what ought to be, and descriptive theory is concerned with what is. This option fits the context of the question, as it describes the difference between a moral code that all rational beings should follow (normative) and a moral code adopted by a particular group or society (descriptive).\n\nD. Ethical, Descriptive: Ethical theory is concerned with moral principles and values, while descriptive theory is concerned with what is. This option does not fit the context of the question, which is about moral codes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Normative, Descriptive.",
