It involves considering the broader consequences of a company's actions.\n\n3. **Stakeholder**: A stakeholder is any individual or group that has an interest in the corporation's activities. This includes employees, customers, suppliers, investors, and the community.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A**: Corporate rights, Corporate effect, Stakeholder\n  - This option correctly identifies the principles and the stakeholder concept.\n\n- **Option B**: Corporate deniability, Corporate effect, Stakeholder\n  - \"Corporate deniability\" is not a recognized principle in the context of corporate responsibility.\n\n- **Option C**: Corporate rights, Corporate responsibility, Stakeholder\n  - \"Corporate responsibility\" is not a principle mentioned by Evan and Freeman.\n\n- **Option D**: Corporate rights, Corporate effect, Shareholder\n  - While \"Corporate effect\" is correct, \"Shareholder\" is not the primary stakeholder group in this context.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is **Option A**: Corporate rights, Corporate effect, Stakeholder.",
