            "content": "To determine why filibusters are less likely to occur in the House of Representatives than in the Senate, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Senate decorum forbids one senator from attempting to stop another's speech**: This statement is incorrect. In the Senate, filibusters are allowed and are a common tool used by senators to delay or block legislation. The Senate's rules permit a senator to speak as long as they wish, and other senators cannot force them to stop.\n\nB. **The House meets for substantially fewer hours per day than does the Senate**: This is incorrect. The House and Senate both meet for about 180 days per year, with each session lasting about 120 days. The number of hours they meet per day is not a significant factor in the likelihood of filibusters.\n\nC. **Senate sessions, unlike House sessions, are open to the public**: This is incorrect. Both the House and Senate sessions are open to the public. The public can attend and observe both chambers.\n\nD. **Debate in the House is in most instances strictly regulated by the rules**: This is correct. The House has strict rules that regulate debate, including time limits for speeches and the use of \"time cards\" to control the duration of speeches. These rules make it more difficult for a single senator to filibuster the House, as they can be easily enforced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Debate in the House is in most instances strictly regulated by the rules.",
