[786, 2.23].\n\nHere's the detailed explanation:\n\nIn Python, the syntax for slicing a list is list[start:stop], where start is the index of the first element you want to include in the slice, and stop is the index of the last element you want to include in the slice. If you omit the stop index, it defaults to the end of the list.\n\nIn your case, list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ], and you want to print the elements at indices 1 and 2. \n\nSo, list[1:3] will print the elements at indices 1 and 2, which are 786 and 2.23 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. [786, 2.23].",
