Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **Negative phototropism**: This is the growth of a plant away from light, which is the opposite of what is described in the question. Thus, this option is also incorrect.\n\nC. **Positive phototropism**: This is the growth of a plant towards light, which is the opposite of what is described in the question. Hence, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Negative gravitropism**: This is the growth of a plant away from gravity, which matches the description given in the question. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Negative gravitropism",
