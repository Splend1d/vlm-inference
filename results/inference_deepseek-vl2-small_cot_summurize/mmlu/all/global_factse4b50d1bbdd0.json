This figure is a significant indicator of the country's digital engagement and highlights the widespread use of the internet among its citizens.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. 18% - This is too low, as it does not reflect the substantial internet usage in Brazil.\nB. 38% - This is also too low, as it does not match the actual percentage of internet users.\nC. 58% - This is the correct answer, as it aligns with the data provided by IBGE.\nD. 78% - This is higher than the actual percentage, indicating overestimation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 58%.",
