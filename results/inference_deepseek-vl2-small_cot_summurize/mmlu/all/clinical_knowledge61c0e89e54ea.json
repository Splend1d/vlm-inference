            "content": "Addisons Disease is a rare disorder that affects the adrenal glands, which are responsible for producing hormones like cortisol and aldosterone. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It is due to a deficiency of prolactin hormone: Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates milk production in breastfeeding women. Addisons Disease is not related to prolactin deficiency.\n\nB.

It is a recognized cause of hypertension: Addisons Disease can cause high blood pressure due to the imbalance of hormones affecting blood pressure regulation.\n\nD. Diabetes is a complication: Addisons Disease can lead to diabetes as a complication because the body's inability to produce cortisol can affect glucose metabolism.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is C. It is a recognized cause of hypertension.",
