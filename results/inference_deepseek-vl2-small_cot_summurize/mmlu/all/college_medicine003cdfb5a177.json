            "content": "To understand how multiple proteins can be produced from the same gene, we need to explore the process of alternative RNA splicing. This is a crucial mechanism in eukaryotic cells that allows a single gene to produce multiple protein variants.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. By selective transcription of different parts of the DNA in the gene.\n- This option suggests that different parts of the gene are transcribed, but it does not explain how these parts are combined to produce different proteins. Selective transcription alone does not account for the diversity of proteins.\n\nB. By doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule produced from the primary transcript.\n- This option implies that the mRNA is physically lengthened, which is not how alternative splicing works. The mRNA length remains the same; it is the sequence of exons that changes.\n\nC. The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing.\n- This option correctly describes the process of alternative RNA splicing. During splicing, the primary transcript undergoes a series of cuts and joins, resulting in different combinations of exons. These different combinations lead to the production of various mRNA variants, each of which can be translated into a distinct protein.\n\nD. By splicing of the mRNA molecule after it has been formed from the primary transcript.\n- This option is incorrect because splicing occurs before the mRNA is formed from the primary transcript. The splicing process is part of the transcription process itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing. This mechanism allows for the production of multiple proteins from a single gene, providing a significant level of protein diversity without the need for additional genes.",
