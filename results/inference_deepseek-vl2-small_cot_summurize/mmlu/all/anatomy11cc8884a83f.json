            "content": "To determine which substance is found in greater quantity in exhaled air, we need to consider the composition of the air we exhale.\n\n1. **Carbon Dioxide (CO\u2082)**: This is a byproduct of cellular respiration. When we breathe in, oxygen is taken into the lungs, and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. The body needs to expel carbon dioxide to maintain homeostasis.\n\n2. **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: This is a colorless, odorless gas that is toxic in high concentrations. It is produced during the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels. However, it is not a significant component of exhaled air.\n\n3. **Nitrogen (N\u2082)**: This is the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, making up about 78% of the air. However, nitrogen is not exhaled; it is inhaled and remains in the lungs.\n\n4. **Oxygen (O\u2082)**: This is the second most abundant gas in the atmosphere, making up about 21% of the air. Like nitrogen, oxygen is inhaled and does not contribute to the composition of exhaled air.\n\nGiven this information, the primary component of exhaled air is carbon dioxide, which is produced as a waste product of cellular respiration. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Carbon dioxide",
