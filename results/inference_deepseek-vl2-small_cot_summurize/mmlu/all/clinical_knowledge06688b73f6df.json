Weight loss: Hypothyroidism is characterized by a decrease in metabolic rate, which can lead to weight gain rather than weight loss. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. Pre-tibial myxoedema: This is a condition associated with hypothyroidism, specifically in the context of cretinism, which is a severe form of hypothyroidism. It is characterized by swelling of the lower extremities due to fluid retention. This statement is correct.\n\nC. A raised TSH level: In hypothyroidism, the pituitary gland releases more thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones. Therefore, a raised TSH level is not characteristic of hypothyroidism; it is a compensatory response to low thyroid hormone levels. This statement is incorrect.\n\nD. An aversion to warm places: Hypothyroidism can cause a decrease in body temperature regulation, leading to an aversion to warm places. This is due to the body's reduced ability to generate heat. This statement is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the true statements about hypothyroidism are:\n\nB. Pre-tibial myxoedema\nD. An aversion to warm places",
