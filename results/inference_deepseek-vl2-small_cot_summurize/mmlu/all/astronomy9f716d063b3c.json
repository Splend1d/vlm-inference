            "content": "To determine how Eratosthenes estimated the size of the Earth, we need to understand the method he used, which is based on geometry and trigonometry.\n\nEratosthenes was a Greek mathematician and geographer who lived in the 3rd century B.C. He was interested in measuring the Earth's circumference. His method involved using the angles of shadows cast by the Sun at different latitudes.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. By measuring the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n- This option is incorrect. Eratosthenes did not measure the Sun's altitude directly. Instead, he used the angle of the Sun's shadow.\n\nB. By measuring the size of Earth's shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse.\n- This option is incorrect. Eratosthenes did not measure the shadow of the Earth on the Moon. He used the shadow of the Sun.\n\nC. By finding a place on Earth where the Sun passes directly overhead.\n- This option is correct. Eratosthenes found a location on Earth where the Sun was directly overhead. This location was in the city of Syene (modern-day Aswan in Egypt), which is located near the equator.\n\nD. By sending fleets of ships around the Earth.\n- This option is incorrect. Eratosthenes did not use ships to measure the Earth's circumference.\n\nEratosthenes' method involved using the angle of the Sun's shadow at Syene and the angle at Alexandria, which is 5,000 stadia (a stadion is about 185 meters) away. He knew the distance between the two cities and the angle of the Sun's shadow at Alexandria was 5 degrees less than at Syene.\n\nUsing the formula for the angle of elevation, he calculated the distance between the two cities as 5,000 stadia. Since the angle of the Sun's shadow at Alexandria was 5 degrees less than at Syene, the distance between the two cities was 5,000 stadia.\n\nTo find the circumference of the Earth, he used the formula for the circumference of a circle, \\( C = 2\\pi r \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius. He knew the distance between the two cities was 5,000 stadia, which is approximately 1,500 kilometers.\n\nThus, the circumference of the Earth is \\( 2\\pi \\times 1,500 \\approx 9,420 \\) kilometers, which is a remarkable estimate for the time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. By finding a place on Earth where the Sun passes directly overhead.",
