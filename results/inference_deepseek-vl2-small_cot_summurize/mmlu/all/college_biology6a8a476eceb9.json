This means that nektonic organisms are not restricted to a particular location and can move freely in the water column.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Whale**: Whales are large marine mammals that are capable of moving through the water column. They are classified as nekton because they actively swim and can travel long distances in the ocean.\n\nB. **Barnacle**: Barnacles are small crustaceans that attach themselves to surfaces in the water. They are not capable of active movement and are therefore considered benthic organisms, not nekton.\n\nC. **Cyanobacterium**: Cyanobacteria are a type of bacteria that perform photosynthesis. They are not mobile and are typically found attached to surfaces or in sediment. Therefore, they are not nekton.\n\nD. **Protist**: Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that can be either unicellular or multicellular. While some protists are capable of movement, not all of them are nekton. For example, many protists are sessile and attached to surfaces.\n\nBased on this analysis, the organism that belongs to the nekton is:\n\nA. Whale\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. Whale.",
