            "content": "To determine the percentage of US adults who believe computer programs will always reflect human bias, we need to consider the context and the data available.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks about the perception of human bias in computer programs among US adults as of 2018. This involves understanding public opinion on the issue of bias in technology.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A: 43%**\n   - **Option B: 58%**\n   - **Option C: 73%**\n   - **Option D: 88%**\n\n3. **Research and Data**: According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2018, 88% of US adults believed that computer programs would always reflect human bias. This indicates a strong perception that technology is inherently biased due to the human factors involved in its development and use.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - Option A (43%) is significantly lower than the actual percentage.\n   - Option B (58%) is also lower than the actual percentage.\n   - Option C (73%) is higher than the actual percentage.\n   - Option D (88%) matches the actual percentage from the survey.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the data from the Pew Research Center, the correct answer is **Option D: 88%**. This reflects the widespread belief among US adults that computer programs will always reflect human bias.",
