We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of 3 over 8 by the same number.\n\nLet's try multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 2}{8 \\times 2} = \\frac{6}{16} \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify 6 over 16:\n\\[ \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{6 \\div 2}{16 \\div 2} = \\frac{3}{8} \\]\n\nWe can see that 6 over 16 is equivalent to 3 over 8.\n\nNow, let's check the other options:\n\nA. 18 over 40:\n\\[ \\frac{18}{40} = \\frac{18 \\div 2}{40 \\div 2} = \\frac{9}{20} \\]\n\nB. 18 over 56:\n\\[ \\frac{18}{56} = \\frac{18 \\div 2}{56 \\div 2} = \\frac{9}{28} \\]\n\nC. 24 over 64:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{64} = \\frac{24 \\div 8}{64 \\div 8} = \\frac{3}{8} \\]\n\nD. 15 over 48:\n\\[ \\frac{15}{48} = \\frac{15 \\div 3}{48 \\div 3} = \\frac{5}{16} \\]\n\nWe can see that 24 over 64 is equivalent to 3 over 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\text{C} \\]",
