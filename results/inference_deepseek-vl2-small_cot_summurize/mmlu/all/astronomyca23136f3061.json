            "content": "To determine how Eratosthenes estimated the size of Earth, we need to understand the method he used. Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician and geographer who lived in the 3rd century B.C. He was interested in measuring the Earth's circumference.\n\nEratosthenes' method involved observing a solar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth. Eratosthenes noticed that the shadow of the Moon was not uniform across the Earth's surface. This was because the shadow was longer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere.\n\nTo understand why this happened, Eratosthenes realized that the Earth is a sphere. The Sun, Moon, and Earth align in a straight line during a solar eclipse. The length of the shadow depends on the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Since the Earth is a sphere, the distance from the center of the Earth to the point where the shadow is longest is greater in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere.\n\nEratosthenes used this observation to calculate the Earth's circumference. He knew the distance between two cities, Alexandria and Syene (modern-day Aswan), which were located at different latitudes. He measured the angle of the Sun's rays at both locations and knew the time difference between the two cities.\n\nBy using the angle of the Sun's rays and the time difference, Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference. He found that the angle of the Sun's rays at Alexandria was 7 degrees less than at Syene. Since the Earth is a sphere, the difference in latitude corresponds to a difference in the angle of the Sun's rays.\n\nEratosthenes used the formula for the circumference of a circle, \\( C = 2\\pi r \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. He knew the distance between Alexandria and Syene, which was approximately 5,000 stadia (a stadion was about 185 meters). By using the angle difference and the distance, he calculated the Earth's circumference to be about 40,000 stadia, which is approximately 25,000 kilometers.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.",
