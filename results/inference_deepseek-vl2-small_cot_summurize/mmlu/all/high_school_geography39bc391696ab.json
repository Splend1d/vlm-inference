            "content": "To determine which statement does not correctly describe the Green Revolution, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It changed centuries-old methods of farming.\n- The Green Revolution introduced new agricultural technologies and practices, such as high-yield crop varieties, synthetic fertilizers, and improved irrigation systems. These innovations significantly altered traditional farming methods, which were often labor-intensive and less efficient. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nB. It was an attempt to feed a growing world population.\n- The Green Revolution was indeed driven by the goal of increasing food production to meet the growing demands of a rapidly increasing global population. This was a primary motivation behind the adoption of new agricultural technologies. Thus, this statement is correct.\n\nC. It centered on increased rice, wheat, and maize yields.\n- The Green Revolution focused on increasing the yields of several key cereal crops, including rice, wheat, and maize. These crops were chosen because they are staple foods in many parts of the world and were critical to addressing food security. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nD. It greatly improved crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa.\n- While the Green Revolution did lead to increased crop yields in many parts of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, it did not universally improve yields in this region. Some areas experienced mixed results, and the benefits were not evenly distributed. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the statement that does NOT correctly describe the Green Revolution is:\n\nD. It greatly improved crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa.",
