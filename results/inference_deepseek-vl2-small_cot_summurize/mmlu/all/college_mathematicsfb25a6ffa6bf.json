The dimension of the intersection of two subspaces is the maximum of the dimensions of the subspaces.\n\nSince \\( V \\) and \\( W \\) are 2-dimensional subspaces of \\( \\mathbb{R}^4 \\), the maximum dimension of the intersection of \\( V \\) and \\( W \\) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the possible dimensions of the subspace \\( V \\) intersect \\( W \\) are 0, 1, and 2 only.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\text{D} \\]",
