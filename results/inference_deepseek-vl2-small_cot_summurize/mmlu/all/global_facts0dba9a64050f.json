Both countries are NATO allies and have a long history of cooperation in various fields, including trade, security, and technology.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A (60%)**: This option suggests a moderate level of positive sentiment. While it is possible that some Americans hold this view, it is not the most common perception.\n   - **Option B (75%)**: This option indicates a high level of positive sentiment. Given the strong bilateral relationship, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of Americans would view the relationship as good.\n   - **Option C (90%)**: This option suggests an extremely high level of positive sentiment, which might be overly optimistic given the complexity of international relations.\n   - **Option D (45%)**: This option indicates a relatively low level of positive sentiment, which is unlikely given the historical and ongoing strong ties between the U.S. and Germany.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Correct Option**:\n   - **Option B (75%)** is the most plausible choice. It reflects a high level of positive sentiment that aligns with the historical and current nature of the U.S.-Germany relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 75%**.",
