            "content": "The passage states that \"Perestroika [Restructuring] is an urgent necessity arising from the profound processes of development in our socialist society. This society is ripe for change. It has long been yearning for it.\" This suggests that Gorbachev believed that restructuring was necessary due to the deep processes of development in the socialist society.\n\nHowever, the passage also states that \"Any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future, which, to put it bluntly, would have been fraught with serious social, economic, and political crises.\" This suggests that Gorbachev believed that not starting restructuring could lead to a more severe crisis.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate inference from the passage is that Gorbachev argued that a restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was necessary in order to avoid a crisis.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
