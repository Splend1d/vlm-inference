            "content": "Electricity and magnetism are fundamental forces of nature that are interconnected. When electricity and magnetism are combined, they form a phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation. This radiation includes a wide range of frequencies, from very low to ultrahigh frequencies.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Mass - Electricity and magnetism do not directly form mass. Mass is a property of matter and is not created by the interaction of electricity and magnetism.\n\nB. Energy - While electricity and magnetism can be converted into various forms of energy, they do not directly form energy. Energy is a form of power or capacity to do work, and it can be derived from electricity and magnetism, but it is not the direct result of their combination.\n\nC. Ultrahigh-frequency sound - Ultrahigh-frequency sound is a type of electromagnetic radiation, but it is not the direct result of the combination of electricity and magnetism. Ultrahigh-frequency sound is a specific type of electromagnetic wave that falls within a certain frequency range.\n\nD. Light - Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is produced when electricity and magnetism are combined. When an electric current passes through a conductor, it creates a magnetic field, and when this magnetic field interacts with an electric field, it produces light. This is the principle behind many light sources, including incandescent bulbs, fluorescent lights, and LEDs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Light",
