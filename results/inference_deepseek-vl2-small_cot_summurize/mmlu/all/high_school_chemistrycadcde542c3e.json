The double bond in ethylene makes it susceptible to addition reactions, where chlorine can add across the double bond, forming dichloroethane (C2H4Cl2).\n\nThe other options do not react as readily with chlorine gas:\n\nA. Toluene (C6H5CH3) is a benzene derivative and does not have a double bond, so it does not react with chlorine gas.\n\nC. Ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) is a carboxylic acid and does not have a double bond, so it does not react with chlorine gas.\n\nD. Ethane (C2H6) is an alkane and does not have a double bond, so it does not react with chlorine gas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. ethylene.",
