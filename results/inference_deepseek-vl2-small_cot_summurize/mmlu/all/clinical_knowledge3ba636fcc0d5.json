            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The absence of plaques of psoriasis excludes the diagnosis.\n- Psoriatic arthropathy is a form of arthritis associated with psoriasis. While the presence of psoriasis plaques is a common feature, their absence does not exclude the diagnosis. Psoriatic arthropathy can occur in individuals without psoriasis plaques, making this statement incorrect.\n\nB. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood marker.\n- Blood markers are not typically used to confirm the diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy. Instead, clinical examination, joint symptoms, and sometimes imaging studies are used. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. Tophi can sometimes be seen over affected joints.\n- Tophi are calcium deposits that can form over joints, especially in conditions like psoriatic arthropathy. They are often seen in the fingers and toes, which are common sites for joint involvement in psoriatic arthritis. This statement is correct.\n\nD. Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis.\n- Nail pitting is a common feature of psoriatic arthritis and can be a clue in diagnosing the condition. However, it is not a definitive diagnostic criterion. The presence of psoriasis and joint symptoms are more critical in confirming the diagnosis. Thus, while nail pitting can be a clue, it is not the sole diagnostic criterion.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Tophi can sometimes be seen over affected joints.",
