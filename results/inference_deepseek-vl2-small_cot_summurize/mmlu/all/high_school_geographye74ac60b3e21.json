In this case, the individual is not presented with a new opportunity but rather decides to stay in Columbus after visiting.\n\nB. **Distance Decay**: This is a concept in marketing that suggests the likelihood of a purchase decreases as the distance between the consumer and the product increases. In this context, it does not apply as the individual is not moving away from a product or service.\n\nC. **Involuntary Migration**: This refers to the movement of people from one place to another due to circumstances beyond their control, such as war, natural disasters, or economic hardship. The individual in this scenario is not being forced to move but is choosing to stay in Columbus.\n\nD. **Push-Pull Factors**: These are the reasons that cause a person to leave their current location (push factors) and the reasons that attract them to a new location (pull factors). In this scenario, the individual is initially moving from their hometown to Pittsburgh but then decides to stay in Columbus, which is a pull factor.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **D. Push-Pull Factors**. The individual initially moves from their hometown to Pittsburgh due to push factors, but upon visiting Columbus, they are attracted to it as a pull factor, leading them to decide to stay.",
