            "content": "To determine the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball, we need to consider the uncertainties in both the speed and the mass of the ball.\n\n1. **Uncertainty in Speed**: The students estimate the uncertainty in the speed of the ball to be 10%. This means that the measured speed could be anywhere from 90% to 110% of the true speed.\n\n2. **Uncertainty in Mass**: The problem states that the uncertainty in the mass of the ball is negligibly small. This implies that the mass is assumed to be known with very high precision, and thus, its uncertainty is zero.\n\n3. **Kinetic Energy Formula**: The kinetic energy (\\( KE \\)) of an object is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass of the object and \\( v \\) is its speed.\n\n4. **Uncertainty in Kinetic Energy**: The uncertainty in kinetic energy is the square of the uncertainty in speed. This is because kinetic energy is a quadratic function of speed. Therefore, the uncertainty in kinetic energy is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta KE = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta v}{v}\\right)^2 \\Delta v^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given uncertainty in speed:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta KE = \\left(\\frac{10\\%}{100\\%}\\right)^2 \\times 10\\%^2 = (0.1)^2 \\times (0.1)^2 = 0.001 \\times 0.01 = 0.00001\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert to Percentage**: To express this uncertainty as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta KE = 0.00001 \\times 100 = 0.001\\%\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is approximately 0.1%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 5%",
