These relationships are often seen as a way to ensure checks and balances and prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.\n\nA. House committees: These are legislative committees that are part of the House of Representatives. They play a role in the legislative process by conducting hearings, holding investigations, and drafting legislation.\n\nB. Senate committees: These are legislative committees that are part of the Senate. They also play a role in the legislative process by conducting hearings, holding investigations, and drafting legislation.\n\nC. The courts: The courts are part of the judicial branch of government. They interpret the law and make decisions on legal cases. While the courts do not directly influence policy-making in the same way that the legislative and executive branches do, they can affect policy by interpreting laws and making rulings that impact how laws are applied.\n\nD. Bureaucratic agencies: These are government agencies that are part of the executive branch. They are responsible for implementing and enforcing laws and policies. While bureaucratic agencies do play a role in policy-making, they are not part of the \"iron triangles\" that influence policy-making.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Bureaucratic agencies.",
