            "content": "To determine the energy expenditure of the male athlete, we need to calculate the total energy consumed during the training session. The mean rate of oxygen consumption is given as 2 liters per minute (l/min).\n\n1. **Convert Oxygen Consumption to Oxygen Volume**:\n   - The athlete consumes 2 l/min of oxygen.\n   - The oxygen concentration in the air is approximately 21% by volume.\n   - Therefore, the volume of oxygen consumed per minute is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume of oxygen} = 2 \\, \\text{l/min} \\times 0.21 = 0.42 \\, \\text{l/min}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Energy Expenditure**:\n   - The energy content of oxygen is approximately 20.94 kJ/l.\n   - To find the energy expenditure, multiply the volume of oxygen consumed by the energy content:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Energy expenditure} = 0.42 \\, \\text{l/min} \\times 20.94 \\, \\text{kJ/l} = 8.71 \\, \\text{kJ/min}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Round to Nearest Whole Number**:\n   - The calculated energy expenditure is approximately 8.71 kJ/min.\n   - Rounding to the nearest whole number gives 9 kJ/min.\n\n4. **Select the Closest Option**:\n   - The closest option to 9 kJ/min is 80 kJ/min.\n\nTherefore, the rate of energy expenditure of the male athlete is approximately 80 kJ/min.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 80 kJ/min**.",
