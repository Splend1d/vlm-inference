It is common in fungi, algae, and some plants.\n\nB. **Fission**: This is a type of asexual reproduction where a single organism divides into two or more identical offspring. It is common in bacteria and some protists.\n\nC. **Budding**: This is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows out of the body of the parent organism. It is common in yeast, hydra, and some plants.\n\nD. **Meiosis**: This is a type of cell division that results in the production of gametes (sperm and eggs) and is essential for sexual reproduction. It is not a mode of asexual reproduction.\n\nBy examining each option, we can conclude that meiosis is the only process that is not a mode of asexual reproduction. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. meiosis",
