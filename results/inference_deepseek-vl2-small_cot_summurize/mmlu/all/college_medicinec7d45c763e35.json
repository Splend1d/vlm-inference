            "content": "When sound travels from one medium to another, the following changes can occur:\n\nA. Velocity: The speed of sound in a medium is affected by the density of the medium. In a denser medium, the speed of sound is generally higher.\n\nB. Intensity: The intensity of sound is related to the energy per unit area of the sound wave. In a denser medium, the intensity of the sound wave can increase due to the higher energy density.\n\nC. Frequency: The frequency of a sound wave is determined by the source and the medium. It is not affected by the medium through which the sound is traveling.\n\nD. Wavelength: The wavelength of a sound wave is inversely proportional to the frequency. In a denser medium, the frequency of the sound wave can increase, which would result in a shorter wavelength.\n\nTherefore, the change that does not occur when sound travels from one medium to another is the frequency. The correct answer is C.",
