Positive feedback can boost her confidence and reinforce her belief in her abilities.\n\nB. **Put in daily practice on the tasks she wishes to improve on.** This is a practical approach. By consistently practicing tasks, Karen can develop her skills and competence, which directly contributes to building self-efficacy.\n\nC. **Find others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in.** This strategy is effective as it provides a role model and inspiration. Observing others who excel can motivate Karen to strive for similar achievements, thereby enhancing her self-efficacy.\n\nD. **Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.** This approach is counterproductive. Avoiding tasks due to lack of proficiency can prevent Karen from gaining experience and building confidence. Instead, it is more beneficial to engage in tasks she is not proficient in and learn from them.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the strategy that would NOT be a method that Karen's therapist would ask her to employ is:\n\nD.
