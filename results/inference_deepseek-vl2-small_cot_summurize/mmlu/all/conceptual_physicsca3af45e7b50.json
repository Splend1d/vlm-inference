            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Middle of the 1900s**: This option suggests that radioactivity became prominent in the 1900s. While radioactivity was discovered in the late 19th century, it was not until the early 20th century that it became widely recognized and understood. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nB. **Industrial Revolution**: The Industrial Revolution, which took place from the late 18th to the mid-19th century, was a period of significant technological advancement. However, radioactivity is a natural phenomenon that predates the Industrial Revolution. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nC. **Advent of medical technology**: The advent of medical technology in the 20th century did lead to increased awareness and use of radioactivity in medical applications, such as X-rays and cancer treatment. However, radioactivity itself has been present on Earth since the planet's formation. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nD. **Earth formed**: Radioactivity is a natural process that occurs in the Earth's core and mantle due to the decay of radioactive isotopes. It has been present on Earth since the planet formed, as the Earth itself is a radioactive body. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Earth formed",
