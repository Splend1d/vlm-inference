            "content": "The question asks for the number of boxes the baker will need, which is represented by the variable b. The total number of muffins the baker made is 232, and he sent 190 to a local hotel. To find the number of muffins left, we subtract the number of muffins sent from the total number of muffins:\n\n232 - 190 = 42\n\nThis means there are 42 muffins left. Each box can hold 6 muffins, so to find the number of boxes needed, we divide the number of muffins left by the number of muffins each box can hold:\n\n42 / 6 = b\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n7 = b\n\nSo, the baker will need 7 boxes. The correct equation is:\n\n(232 - 190) / 6 = b\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. (232 - 190)/6=b",
