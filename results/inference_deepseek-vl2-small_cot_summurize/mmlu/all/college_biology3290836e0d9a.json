Chicks from cliff nests must tumble down the cliff to get to the ocean, and many are killed by the fall. Which of the following is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species?\n\nA. Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.\nB. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\nC. Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.\nD. More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.\n",

            "content": "To determine which option is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive, we need to analyze each option in the context of the hypothesis.\n\nA. Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.\n- This option suggests that cliff nesting is less common. If cliff nesting were adaptive, we would expect more geese to nest on cliffs, not fewer. Therefore, this option does not support the hypothesis.\n\nB. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\n- This option implies that cliff nesting provides a survival advantage, making it more favorable for the species. If cliff nesting were adaptive, it would be expected to offer a higher survival rate for the chicks, which aligns with the hypothesis.\n\nC. Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.\n- This option suggests that the chicks have an innate ability to navigate the fall, which could be seen as a survival mechanism. However, it does not directly address the fitness advantage of cliff nesting.\n\nD. More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.\n- This option directly supports the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive. If cliff nesting were not adaptive, we would expect more chicks to be killed by the fall. The fact that more survive suggests a survival advantage, making cliff nesting adaptive.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive is:\n\nD. More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.",
