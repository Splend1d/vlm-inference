The winning candidate receives less than 50 percent of the popular vote.\n- This describes a plurality victory, not a plurality victory. A plurality victory occurs when a candidate receives more than 50% of the popular vote, not less.\n\nB. Candidates receive an equal number of electoral votes and the popular vote determines the winner.\n- This describes a tie, not a plurality victory. A plurality victory is determined by the popular vote, not the electoral vote.\n\nC. The Senate declares the formal winner.\n- This describes the process of determining the winner after the election, not the occurrence of a plurality victory.\n\nD. The winning candidate receives more than 50% of the popular vote.\n- This is the definition of a plurality victory. A plurality victory occurs when a candidate receives more than 50% of the popular vote, making them the winner without needing a majority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The winning candidate receives more than 50% of the popular vote.",
