            "content": "To determine how the current in the power source changes as more lamps are connected in parallel, we need to understand the behavior of parallel circuits.\n\nIn a parallel circuit, each component is connected across the same two points, and the voltage across each component is the same. The total current in the circuit is the sum of the currents through each component.\n\nWhen more lamps are added in parallel, the total resistance of the circuit decreases because the equivalent resistance of parallel resistors is less than the smallest individual resistance. According to Ohm's Law (\\(I = \\frac{V}{R}\\)), where \\(I\\) is the current, \\(V\\) is the voltage, and \\(R\\) is the resistance, if the resistance decreases and the voltage remains constant, the current must increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. increases.",
