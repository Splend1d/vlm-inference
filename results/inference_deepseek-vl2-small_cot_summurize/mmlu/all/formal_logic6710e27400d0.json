(\u2203x)(Wx \u2228 Sx)\n\nThis translation uses the logical OR (\u2228) operator to represent the statement \"Some students work hard\" (\u2203x)(Wx), and the logical AND (\u2022) operator to represent \"Some students study\" (\u2203x)(Sx). The OR operator is used because it is possible that some students work hard and some students study, but it is not necessary that all students work hard or study. The AND operator is used because it is necessary that some students work hard and some students study.",
