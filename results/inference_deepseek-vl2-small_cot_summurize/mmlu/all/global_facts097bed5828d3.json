The question asks for the share of people in the United States who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013.\n\n1. **Understanding the Options**:\n   - A. 36%\n   - B. 56%\n   - C. 76%\n   - D. 96%\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - Option A (36%) is relatively low and seems unlikely given the context of political corruption.\n   - Option B (56%) is a moderate percentage, which could be plausible but not the highest.\n   - Option C (76%) is a high percentage, suggesting a significant portion of the population believes political parties are corrupt.\n   - Option D (96%) is extremely high and seems implausible given the context.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**:\n   - The question mentions \"As of 2013,\" which provides a specific time frame for the data.\n   - The context of political corruption is a common topic in public opinion surveys.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - Given the context and the time frame, it is reasonable to infer that a significant portion of the population would believe political parties are corrupt.\n   - The highest percentage among the options is 76%, which aligns with the context of a substantial portion of the population holding this belief.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis and context, the most plausible answer is C. 76%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 76%**.",
