            "content": "To understand the concept of a \"pocket veto,\" we need to explore the process of how a bill becomes law in the United States. When a bill is passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, it is sent to the President for signature. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If the President does not sign it within ten days, the bill is sent back to Congress without the President's signature.\n\nA \"pocket veto\" occurs when the President does not sign the bill within this ten-day period, but Congress adjourns during this time. When Congress adjourns, the bill is essentially \"pocketed\" by the President, meaning it is not sent back to Congress for a potential override. This effectively means the bill is not enacted, as there is no opportunity for Congress to override the President's action.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Publicly expressing rejection of a bill - This is not a pocket veto. Publicly expressing rejection would involve the President making a statement against the bill, but it does not prevent the bill from becoming law.\n\nB. Issuing an executive order invalidating a recently passed bill - This is not a pocket veto. An executive order is a directive issued by the President to federal agencies, and it does not affect the status of a bill.\n\nC. Failing to sign a bill after Congress has adjourned - This is the correct answer. When Congress adjourns, the President does not sign the bill, and it is not sent back to Congress. This effectively results in a pocket veto.\n\nD. Recalling ambassadors from a peace negotiation - This is not related to a pocket veto. This action is a diplomatic decision and does not affect the legislative process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Failing to sign a bill after Congress has adjourned.",
