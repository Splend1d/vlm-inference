The submucosa provides support and contains blood vessels and nerves, while minor salivary glands are located on the sides of the hard palate.\n\nB. **Non-keratinised and has submucosa and minor salivary glands posteromedially.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the hard palate is keratinised, not non-keratinised.\n\nC. **Keratinised and lacks submucosa and minor salivary glands.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the hard palate does have submucosa and minor salivary glands, which are located posterolaterally.\n\nD. **Non-keratinised and lacks submucosa and minor salivary glands.**\n   - This option is incorrect for both reasons: the hard palate is keratinised, and it does have submucosa and minor salivary glands.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Keratinised and has submucosa and minor salivary glands posterolaterally.",
