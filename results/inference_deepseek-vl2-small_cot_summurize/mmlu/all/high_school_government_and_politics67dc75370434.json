            "content": "To determine which option best describes \"ticket splitting,\" let's analyze each choice:\n\nA. A presidential nominee selects a running mate who can appeal to voter groups whose support of the nominee is weak.\n- This option describes a strategy where a presidential candidate selects a running mate to attract voters who might not fully support the nominee. This is not ticket splitting, as it focuses on the vice-presidential candidate rather than the entire ticket.\n\nB. A voter chooses the presidential nominee of one major party, but chooses congressional nominees of the other major party.\n- This option accurately describes ticket splitting. Ticket splitting occurs when a voter supports the presidential candidate of one major party but chooses congressional candidates from the opposing party. This strategy is often used to express dissatisfaction with the presidential candidate while still supporting their party's congressional candidates.\n\nC. A mayor orders the local police force to hand out fewer parking violations in the weeks leading up to the general election.\n- This option describes a political strategy to influence voter behavior, but it does not specifically relate to ticket splitting. It is more about voter manipulation rather than the strategic choice of voting for different parties in different races.\n\nD. A delegate to a national party convention supports the front-runner but remains uncommitted on the party platform.\n- This option describes a delegate's decision at a national convention, which is not directly related to ticket splitting. It involves a delegate's personal stance rather than a voter's choice in different races.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A voter chooses the presidential nominee of one major party, but chooses congressional nominees of the other major party.",
