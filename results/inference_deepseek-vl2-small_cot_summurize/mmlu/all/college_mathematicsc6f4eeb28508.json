Therefore, every solution is a scalar multiple of \\( (1, -2, -4, 1) \\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\nA. The system is consistent.\n- The system is consistent because we have found a solution \\( (w, x, y, z) = (72z, -14z, -16z, z) \\).\n\nB. The system has infinitely many solutions.\n- The system has infinitely many solutions because the solutions are scalar multiples of \\( (1, -2, -4, 1) \\).\n\nC. The sum of any two solutions is a solution.\n- This is true because the solutions are scalar multiples of each other.\n\nD. Every solution is a scalar multiple of \\( (-5, 1, 1, 0) \\).\n- This is false because the solutions are scalar multiples of \\( (1, -2, -4, 1) \\), not \\( (-5, 1, 1, 0) \\).\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
