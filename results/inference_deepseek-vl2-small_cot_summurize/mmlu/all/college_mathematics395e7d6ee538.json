Every compact space is complete.\n- A compact space is a space where every open cover has a finite subcover. However, a space can be compact without being complete. For example, the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is compact but not complete because it does not contain all its limit points.\n\nB. Every complete space is compact.\n- A complete space is a space where every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in the space. A complete space can be compact, but it is not necessary. For example, the space of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is complete but not compact.\n\nC. Neither (a) nor (b).\n- This option suggests that neither statement is true. However, we have already established that neither statement is universally true.\n\nD. Both (a) and (b).\n- This option suggests that both statements are true. However, as we have shown, neither statement is universally true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Neither (a) nor (b).",
