            "content": "Let's analyze each option to determine why male patients are advised to bring their own electric razor to the hospital.\n\nA. **For patient comfort.** While patient comfort is important, bringing a personal electric razor to the hospital is not primarily for comfort. Hospital environments are typically sterile and may not be conducive to personal grooming.\n\nB. **To make hospital as familiar as possible.** This option suggests that having a familiar object from home can make the hospital environment feel more comfortable. However, the hospital is not a home environment, and familiarity with personal items does not significantly impact the hospital experience.\n\nC. **To minimize risk of cross-infection.** This is the correct answer. Hospitals have strict hygiene protocols to prevent the spread of infections. Bringing a personal electric razor can help minimize the risk of cross-contamination, as it reduces the need for shared equipment and minimizes contact with potentially contaminated surfaces.\n\nD. **To allow shaving at a time convenient to the patient.** While convenience is a factor, the primary reason for bringing a personal razor is to maintain hygiene and reduce infection risk, not for convenience.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate reason for male patients to bring their own electric razor to the hospital is to minimize the risk of cross-infection.",
