            "content": "Thermal convection involves mainly fluids.\n\nThermal convection is a process where heat transfer occurs within a fluid (such as air or water) due to differences in temperature. This process is driven by buoyancy forces, which cause the fluid to move and create convection currents. The fluid's density changes with temperature, leading to the movement of the fluid.\n\nA. Radiant energy: While radiant energy can contribute to temperature differences, it is not the main component of thermal convection.\n\nB. Fluids: This is the correct answer. Thermal convection is primarily driven by the movement of fluids due to temperature differences.\n\nC. Insulators: Insulators are materials that do not conduct heat well. They are not directly involved in the process of thermal convection.\n\nD. All of these: This option is incorrect because radiant energy and insulators are not the main components of thermal convection.",
