            "content": "To determine the effect on the entropy of the helium gas, we need to consider the relationship between entropy and the number of gas molecules. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. In the context of gases, it is directly related to the number of gas molecules.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.**\n\n   - Entropy is a state function, meaning it depends only on the current state of the system, not on the path taken to reach that state. Since the number of helium molecules does not change, the entropy remains constant.\n\nB. **It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.**\n\n   - Entropy is not related to the order of the gas. The larger flask simply provides more space for the gas molecules to move around, which increases the disorder, not the order.\n\nC. **It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.**\n\n   - Collisions with the walls of the flask do not affect the entropy. Entropy is determined by the number of gas molecules, not their interactions with the container walls.\n\nD. **It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.**\n\n   - While the larger flask allows more space for the gas molecules to spread out, the increase in the number of gas molecules (due to the expansion) is what primarily increases the entropy. The dispersion is a result of the increased number of molecules, not the cause of the increase in entropy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.",
