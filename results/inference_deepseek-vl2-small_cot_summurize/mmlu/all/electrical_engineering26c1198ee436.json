            "content": "To determine how the length of a cable affects its capacitance, we need to understand the relationship between capacitance and the physical dimensions of the cable.\n\nThe capacitance \\( C \\) of a cylindrical capacitor is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\ln \\left( \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\right)}{L}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\epsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space,\n- \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) are the diameters of the inner and outer conductors, respectively,\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the cable.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the capacitance \\( C \\) is inversely proportional to the length \\( L \\) of the cable. This means that if the length of the cable is doubled, the capacitance will be halved.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. One-fourth: This would imply that the capacitance is reduced to one-fourth of its original value, which is not consistent with the inverse relationship between length and capacitance.\n\nB. One-half: This is consistent with the inverse relationship. If the length is doubled, the capacitance will be halved.\n\nC. Doubled: This would imply that the capacitance is increased, which is not consistent with the inverse relationship.\n\nD. Unchanged: This would imply that the length does not affect the capacitance, which is not true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. one-half.",
