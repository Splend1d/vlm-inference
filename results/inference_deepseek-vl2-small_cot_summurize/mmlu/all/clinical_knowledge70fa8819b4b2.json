Aseptic conditions refer to a sterile environment that minimizes the risk of infection.\n\nC. is a specialist skill. - This is incorrect because while it may require some skill, it is not necessarily a specialist skill. However, it is important to note that the person performing the removal should have some level of training or experience in this area.\n\nD. should not be undertaken until at least seven days after application. - This is incorrect because the timing of removal depends on the type of adhesive strip and the individual's skin. Some strips may need to be removed sooner, while others may be safe to leave in place for a longer period. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific product being used.",
