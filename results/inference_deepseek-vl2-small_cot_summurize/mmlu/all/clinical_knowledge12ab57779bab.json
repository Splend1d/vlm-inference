            "content": "To determine which statement is true about calcium metabolism, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium.\n- Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It is known to lower blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting calcium excretion in the kidneys. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic.\n- Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where the parathyroid glands produce excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to elevated calcium levels in the blood. This condition often presents with symptoms such as bone pain, kidney stones, and fatigue. Thus, this statement is false.\n\nC. Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands.\n- Vitamin D is produced by the kidneys, not the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands secrete PTH, which regulates calcium levels in the blood. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n- Hypercalcaemia, or elevated calcium levels in the blood, can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and in severe cases, oliguria (reduced urine output). This is because high calcium levels can cause dehydration and affect kidney function. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is D. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.",
