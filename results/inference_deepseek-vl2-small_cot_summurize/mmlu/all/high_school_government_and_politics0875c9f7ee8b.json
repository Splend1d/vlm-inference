The executive and legislative branches working on legislation together: This describes a collaborative process within the federal government, but it does not specifically involve state cooperation.\n\nB. The federal government granting power over a policy area to the states: This describes a form of federalism where power is decentralized to the states, but it does not necessarily involve cooperation between state and federal governments.\n\nC. Governments working with businesses to address an issue: This describes a form of public-private partnership, which is different from cooperative federalism.\n\nD. State and federal governments working on the same issue: Cooperative federalism involves collaboration between state and federal governments to address issues that require joint action. This approach is characterized by shared responsibility and decision-making processes.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the statement that best characterizes cooperative federalism is:\n\nD. State and federal governments working on the same issue.",
