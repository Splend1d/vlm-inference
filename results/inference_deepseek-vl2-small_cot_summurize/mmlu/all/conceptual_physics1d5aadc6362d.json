The nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of electrons.\n\n2. **Nucleus**: The nucleus is positively charged due to the presence of protons. Neutrons, which have no charge, are found within this nucleus.\n\n3. **Electrons**: Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in various energy levels or shells. They do not reside in the nucleus.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that neutrons are located inside the nucleus of an atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. inside the nucleus",
