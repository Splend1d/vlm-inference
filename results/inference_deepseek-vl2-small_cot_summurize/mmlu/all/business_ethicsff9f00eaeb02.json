Proactive, Groups, Under-represented, Increase**\n\n   - This option correctly fills in the blanks with \"proactive,\" \"groups,\" \"under-represented,\" and \"increase,\" matching the definition of affirmative action.\n\n3. **B. Passive, Groups, Under-represented, Retain**\n\n   - This option incorrectly uses \"passive\" instead of \"proactive\" and \"retain\" instead of \"increase.\"\n\n4. **C. Proactive, Individuals, Represented, Increase**\n\n   - This option incorrectly uses \"individuals\" instead of \"groups\" and \"represented\" instead of \"under-represented.\"\n\n5. **D. Passive, Individuals, Represented, Retain**\n\n   - This option incorrectly uses \"passive\" instead of \"proactive\" and \"retain\" instead of \"increase.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. Proactive, Groups, Under-represented, Increase**.",
