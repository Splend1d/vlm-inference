Afferent arteriole: This is a blood vessel that carries blood into the glomerulus. It is not a cluster of capillaries but rather a single vessel.\n\nB. Glomerulus: This is the correct answer. The glomerulus is a network of capillaries located at the beginning of the nephron. It is responsible for filtering blood to form the initial filtrate that enters the nephron.\n\nC. Loop of Henle: This is a part of the nephron that extends into the medulla of the kidney. It is not a cluster of capillaries but rather a long, coiled tube.\n\nD. Renal pelvis: This is a funnel-shaped structure that collects urine from the nephrons and channels it into the ureter. It is not a cluster of capillaries.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Glomerulus. The glomerulus is the cluster of capillaries found in each nephron, playing a crucial role in filtering blood to form urine.",
