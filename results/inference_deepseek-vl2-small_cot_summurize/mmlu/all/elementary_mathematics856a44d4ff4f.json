Since 9 is the denominator, we can rewrite this as 4/9.\n\nSo, the number of students who take tap lessons is 4/9 of the total number of students.\n\nTo find this number, we multiply the total number of students by 4/9:\n\n\\[\n72 \\times \\frac{4}{9} = 72 \\times 0.4444444444444444 = 32\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of students who take tap lessons is 32.\n\nThe answer is \\(32\\).",
