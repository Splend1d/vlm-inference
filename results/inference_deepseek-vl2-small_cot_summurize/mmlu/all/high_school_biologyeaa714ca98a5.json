            "content": "To determine which organelles in a cell can catalyze reactions involving hydrogen peroxide, provide cellular energy, and make proteins, we need to analyze the functions of each organelle:\n\n1. **Peroxisomes**: These organelles are involved in the breakdown of fatty acids and the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide. They contain enzymes that convert hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, thus protecting the cell from oxidative damage.\n\n2. **Mitochondria**: Known as the powerhouses of the cell, mitochondria are responsible for producing ATP, the energy currency of the cell, through cellular respiration. They do not directly catalyze reactions involving hydrogen peroxide but are crucial for energy production.\n\n3. **Ribosomes**: These organelles are the sites of protein synthesis. They translate mRNA into polypeptide chains, which are then folded into functional proteins.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and ribosomes. This option correctly identifies the organelles and their functions. Peroxisomes handle hydrogen peroxide, mitochondria provide energy, and ribosomes synthesize proteins.\n\n- **Option B**: Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and lysosomes. While peroxisomes and mitochondria are correct, lysosomes are involved in breaking down waste materials and cellular debris, not directly in hydrogen peroxide detoxification or protein synthesis.\n\n- **Option C**: Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. While peroxisomes and mitochondria are correct, the Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell, not in protein synthesis.\n\n- **Option D**: Lysosomes, chloroplasts, and ribosomes. Lysosomes are involved in waste breakdown, chloroplasts are found in plant cells and are involved in photosynthesis, and ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis. This option is incorrect as it includes chloroplasts, which are not present in animal cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and ribosomes**.",
