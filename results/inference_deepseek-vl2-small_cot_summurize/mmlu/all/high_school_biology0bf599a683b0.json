            "content": "To determine which option best explains how legumes can thrive in nitrogen-poor soils, we need to consider the biological processes involved in nitrogen fixation and the role of legumes.\n\nLegumes are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use, such as nitrates. This process is facilitated by symbiotic bacteria, often called rhizobia, which live in the root nodules of legumes. These bacteria have the ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N\u2082) into ammonia (NH\u2083), which is then converted into nitrates (NO\u2083\u207b) by the plant. This process is known as nitrogen fixation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. These plants make their own proteins.\n- While legumes do produce proteins, this option does not address the nitrogen fixation process. Protein synthesis is not directly related to the ability to fix nitrogen.\n\nB. These plants have a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\n- This option accurately describes the symbiotic relationship between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria provide the plant with the nitrogen it needs, and in return, the plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates. This mutualistic relationship is crucial for the plant's growth in nitrogen-poor soils.\n\nC. These plants are capable of directly converting nitrogen gas into nitrates.\n- While some plants can fix nitrogen, legumes are not capable of directly converting nitrogen gas into nitrates. This process is carried out by the bacteria in their root nodules.\n\nD. These plants do not require nitrogen to make plant proteins.\n- This statement is incorrect. Legumes do require nitrogen to synthesize proteins, and they obtain this nitrogen through the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the best explanation for the ability of legumes to grow well in nitrogen-poor soils is:\n\nB. These plants have a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.",
