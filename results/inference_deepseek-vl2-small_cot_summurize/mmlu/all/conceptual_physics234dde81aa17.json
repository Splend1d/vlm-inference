Radiation.\n\nExplanation:\nHeat transfer occurs through three main mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation.\n\n- **Conduction** is the transfer of heat through direct contact between particles. It is most effective in solids where particles are closely packed.\n- **Convection** is the transfer of heat through the movement of fluids (liquids or gases). It is more effective in liquids and gases where particles are not closely packed.\n- **Radiation** is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves. It is the most effective way for heat to travel through a vacuum, such as space, and is the primary mechanism by which heat travels from the Sun to Earth.\n\nWhile conduction and convection are important processes, radiation is the most significant in the context of heat transfer from the Sun to Earth.",
