Water supports objects by its weight and buoyancy, whereas air does not have the same density or mass to support objects. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. Air has a higher O2 concentration.\n- Air is composed of approximately 21% oxygen (O2), while water does not contain oxygen. This makes air have a higher concentration of oxygen compared to water. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nC. Air offers more resistance to motion.\n- Air offers less resistance to motion compared to water. Water is denser and provides more resistance to movement, which is why objects float on water. Air, being less dense, offers less resistance. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. Air has more thermal inertia.\n- Thermal inertia refers to the ability of a substance to resist changes in temperature. Water has a higher thermal inertia than air because it can absorb and store more heat energy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is B. Air has a higher O2 concentration.",
