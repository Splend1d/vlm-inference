It is divided into two main parts: the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle, which together form the lithosphere. The lithosphere is the solid part of the Earth and is divided into tectonic plates that move relative to each other.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The softer rocky material of the mantle.\n- This describes the asthenosphere, which is the semi-fluid layer beneath the lithosphere. It is not part of the lithosphere.\n\nB. The lava that comes out of volcanoes.\n- This describes the magma, which is the molten rock beneath the Earth's surface. It is not part of the lithosphere.\n\nC. Material between the crust and the mantle.\n- This describes the asthenosphere, which is the layer beneath the lithosphere. It is not part of the lithosphere.\n\nD. The rigid rocky material of the crust and uppermost portion of the mantle.\n- This accurately describes the lithosphere, which is the rigid outer layer of the Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The lithosphere of a planet is the layer that consists of the rigid rocky material of the crust and uppermost portion of the mantle.",
