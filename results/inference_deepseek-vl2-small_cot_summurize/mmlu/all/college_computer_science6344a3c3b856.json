At least three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\nThis condition can be expressed as (p_1 \u2228 p_2 \u2228 p_3 \u2228 p_4) \u2260 0. This is because the disjunction (\u2228) of four variables is true if at least one of the variables is true. The negation (\u00ac) of this disjunction is true if none of the variables are true, which is equivalent to the statement that at least three of the variables are true.\n\nII. Exactly three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\nThis condition can be expressed as (p_1 \u2227 p_2 \u2227 p_3 \u2227 p_4) = 1. This is because the conjunction (\u2227) of four variables is true if all of the variables are true. The negation (\u00ac) of this conjunction is true if none of the variables are true, which is equivalent to the statement that exactly three of the variables are true.\n\nIII. An even number of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\nThis condition can be expressed as (p_1 \u2228 p_2 \u2228 p_3 \u2228 p_4) = 1. This is because the disjunction (\u2228) of four variables is true if at least one of the variables is true. The negation (\u00ac) of this disjunction is true if none of the variables are true, which is equivalent to the statement that an even number of the variables are true.\n\nTherefore, all three conditions can be expressed by a Boolean formula in the Boolean variables p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 and the connectives \u2227,\u2228 (without \u00ac).\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
