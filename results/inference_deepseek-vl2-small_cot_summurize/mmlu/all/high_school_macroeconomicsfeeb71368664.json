            "content": "To determine the likely result of lowering household taxes when equilibrium real GDP is far below full employment, we need to consider the economic principles involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: \n   - **Equilibrium Real GDP**: This is the level of economic output where the quantity of goods and services demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers.\n   - **Full Employment**: This is the level of employment where all available labor resources are being used efficiently, and there are no cyclical unemployment.\n\n2. **Effect of Lowering Household Taxes**:\n   - Lowering household taxes increases the disposable income of households.\n   - With more disposable income, households are likely to spend more, which can boost aggregate demand.\n\n3. **Impact on Aggregate Demand**:\n   - An increase in aggregate demand can lead to higher production levels as businesses respond to increased demand.\n   - However, if the economy is already operating below full employment, the increase in demand may not lead to a significant rise in output.\n\n4. **Potential Outcomes**:\n   - **Unemployment**: If the economy is below full employment, increasing demand may lead to higher production, but it may not be sufficient to absorb all available labor, potentially leading to higher unemployment.\n   - **Inflation**: If the economy is already near or at full employment, increased demand could lead to higher prices (inflation) as businesses raise prices to maintain profit margins.\n\n5. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Unemployment falls with little inflation. This is unlikely because the economy is below full employment, and increased demand may not lead to higher output.\n   - **Option B**: Unemployment rises with little inflation. This is a plausible outcome because the economy is below full employment, and increased demand may not significantly boost output.\n   - **Option C**: Unemployment falls with rampant inflation. This is unlikely because the economy is below full employment, and increased demand may not lead to higher output.\n   - **Option D**: Unemployment rises with rampant inflation. This is a plausible outcome because the economy is below full employment, and increased demand may not significantly boost output, leading to higher unemployment and inflation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is **D. Unemployment rises with rampant inflation**.",
