This is because more resources are being utilized to meet the higher demand.\n\n3. **Intermediate Range of Aggregate Supply**:\n   - The intermediate range of the aggregate supply curve is where the economy is producing at or near its full capacity.\n   - In this range, any increase in aggregate demand can lead to an increase in both the price level and real GDP.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. price level and real GDP\n\nThis is because, in the intermediate range of the aggregate supply curve, an increase in aggregate demand results in both an increase in the price level and an increase in real GDP.",
