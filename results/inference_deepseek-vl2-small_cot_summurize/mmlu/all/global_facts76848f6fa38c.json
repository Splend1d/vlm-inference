At the time, the act was highly controversial, and public opinion was divided. However, by the end of 1935, public support for the act had increased significantly.\n\nAccording to historical records, by the end of 1935, about 70% of Americans were in favor of the Social Security Act. This shift in public opinion was largely due to the economic hardships faced during the Great Depression, which made many Americans more receptive to government intervention in the form of social welfare programs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 70%",
