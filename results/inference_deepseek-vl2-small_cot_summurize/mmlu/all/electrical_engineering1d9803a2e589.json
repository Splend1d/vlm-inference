This is achieved by reversing the direction of the current at each commutator segment as the rotor rotates. The commutator ensures that the current flows in the same direction through the external circuit, allowing the generator to produce a continuous DC output.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. convert AC armature current in to DC",
