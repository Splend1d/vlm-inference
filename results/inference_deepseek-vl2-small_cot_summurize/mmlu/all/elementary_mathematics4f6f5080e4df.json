To find the rate, we divide the number of bounces by the number of seconds:\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{25 \\text{ bounces}}{30 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ bounces per second} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of bounces in 150 seconds by multiplying the rate by the number of seconds:\n\\[ \\text{Number of bounces in 150 seconds} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 150 = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{150}{1} = \\frac{5 \\times 150}{6} = \\frac{750}{6} = 125 \\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ 125 \\]",
