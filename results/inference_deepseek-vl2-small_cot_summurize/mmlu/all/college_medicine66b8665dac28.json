            "content": "To determine which factor activates glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Insulin**: Insulin is a hormone that primarily functions to lower blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells, particularly in the liver and muscle. It does not directly stimulate glycogen breakdown.\n\nB. **Cortisol**: Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone that plays a role in metabolism and stress response. It can increase blood glucose levels by promoting the breakdown of glycogen in the liver, but it is not directly involved in the breakdown of glycogen in exercising muscle.\n\nC. **Increased pH**: During intense exercise, lactic acid is produced as a byproduct, which can lower the pH of the muscle environment. This decrease in pH is known as acidosis. Acidosis can activate enzymes that break down glycogen into glucose, providing an immediate energy source for the muscle.\n\nD. **None of the above**: This option is incorrect because increased pH does play a role in glycogen breakdown.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Increased pH.",
