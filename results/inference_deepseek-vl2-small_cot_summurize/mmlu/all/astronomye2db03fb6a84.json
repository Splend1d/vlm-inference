            "content": "To determine the length of a solar day on Planet X, we need to consider both its orbital period and its rotational period.\n\n1. **Orbital Period**: Planet X orbits its sun once every 100 Earth days. This means that the time it takes for Planet X to complete one full orbit around its sun is 100 Earth days.\n\n2. **Rotational Period**: Planet X rotates in the prograde direction around its axis with a sidereal day of 100 Earth days. This means that the time it takes for Planet X to complete one full rotation on its axis is also 100 Earth days.\n\n3. **Solar Day**: A solar day is the time it takes for a planet to complete one full rotation on its axis relative to the Sun. Since Planet X's rotational period is the same as its orbital period, it means that Planet X is tidally locked. This means that one side of Planet X always faces the Sun, and the other side always faces away from the Sun.\n\n4. **Tidal Locking**: Tidal locking occurs when a planet's rotational period is synchronized with its orbital period. This means that the planet's rotation is tied to its orbit around the Sun, and one side of the planet always faces the Sun.\n\nGiven that Planet X is tidally locked, the length of a solar day on Planet X is the same as its rotational period, which is 100 Earth days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. About 100 earth days",
