            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the performance characteristics of both processors, M-5 and M-7, based on their pipeline stages and clock cycles.\n\n### Processor M-5\n- **Pipeline Stages**: 5 stages\n- **Clock Cycle**: 10 nanoseconds\n\n### Processor M-7\n- **Pipeline Stages**: 7 stages\n- **Clock Cycle**: 7.5 nanoseconds\n\n#### I. M-7\u2019s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\n**Throughput** is the number of instructions that can be processed per second. It is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Throughput} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Clock Cycle Time}} \\]\n\nFor M-5:\n\\[ \\text{Throughput} = \\frac{1}{10 \\, \\text{ns}} = 0.1 \\, \\text{instructions per nanosecond} \\]\n\nFor M-7:\n\\[ \\text{Throughput} = \\frac{1}{7.5 \\, \\text{ns}} = 0.133 \\, \\text{instructions per nanosecond} \\]\n\nSince 0.133 is greater than 0.1, M-7 has better maximum throughput than M-5.\n\n#### II. The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\n**Latency** is the time it takes to process a single instruction. It is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Latency} = \\text{Pipeline Stages} \\times \\text{Clock Cycle Time} \\]\n\nFor M-5:\n\\[ \\text{Latency} = 5 \\times 10 \\, \\text{ns} = 50 \\, \\text{ns} \\]\n\nFor M-7:\n\\[ \\text{Latency} = 7 \\times 7.5 \\, \\text{ns} = 52.5 \\, \\text{ns} \\]\n\nSince 50 is less than 52.5, the latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-5\u2019s pipeline than on M-7\u2019s pipeline.\n\n#### III. Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While M-7 has better throughput and shorter latency, the actual performance of a program executing on a processor depends on various factors, including the efficiency of the compiler, the nature of the instructions, and the specific workload. Programs that are well-optimized for M-5 or M-7 may perform similarly or even better on M-5.\n\n### Conclusion\n- I is true.\n- II is false.\n- III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
