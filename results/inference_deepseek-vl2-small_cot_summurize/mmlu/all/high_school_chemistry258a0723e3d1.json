            "content": "To determine which statement is supported by data obtained from mass spectrometry, we need to understand the role of mass spectrometry in analyzing atomic and molecular structures.\n\nMass spectrometry is a technique used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It is particularly useful for identifying the isotopes of an element and measuring the mass of ions. This technique provides information about the isotopes present in a sample, which is crucial for understanding the existence of isotopes.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The common oxidation states of elements: Mass spectrometry does not directly provide information about the oxidation states of elements. Oxidation states are determined by the electron configuration and the chemical environment of an element, which is not directly measurable by mass spectrometry.\n\nB. Atomic size trends within the periodic table: Mass spectrometry does not provide direct information about atomic size. Atomic size is determined by the distance between the nucleus and the outermost electron, which is not directly measurable by mass spectrometry.\n\nC. Ionization energy trends within the periodic table: Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom or ion. While mass spectrometry can provide information about the mass of ions, it does not directly measure ionization energy.\n\nD. The existence of isotopes: Mass spectrometry is specifically designed to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, which directly relates to the presence of isotopes. By analyzing the mass spectrum, one can determine the isotopic composition of a sample, confirming the existence of isotopes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The existence of isotopes. Mass spectrometry provides direct evidence for the presence of isotopes by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, which is a key characteristic of isotopes.",
