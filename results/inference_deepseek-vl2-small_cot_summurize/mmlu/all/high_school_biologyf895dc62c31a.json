            "content": "To determine which statement is true about mules, we need to understand the genetic processes involved in their reproduction.\n\nMules are hybrids between a horse and a donkey. They are born from the fusion of gametes from each parent, which means they inherit genetic material from both species. This genetic combination results in mules having a unique set of alleles that are not found in either parent species.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. They have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero.\n- This statement is incorrect. Mules are not evolutionarily fitless. They can survive and reproduce, which indicates some level of fitness. Their ability to reproduce and survive suggests that they have some level of genetic compatibility and adaptability.\n\nB. Their offspring have less genetic variation than the parents.\n- This statement is incorrect. Mules have more genetic variation than their parents because they inherit a combination of alleles from both species. This genetic diversity can be beneficial for adaptation and survival.\n\nC. Mutations cannot occur in their genomes.\n- This statement is incorrect. Mutations can occur in the genomes of mules. In fact, hybrid vigor, which is the increased fitness of hybrids compared to their parents, is partly due to the genetic diversity and potential for new mutations.\n\nD. If crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis.\n- This statement is correct. Mules are diploid organisms, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes. During meiosis, crossing-over, which is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, typically occurs during prophase I of meiosis. Since mules are hybrids, crossing-over can occur in their genome, but it is limited to the prophase of mitosis due to their diploid nature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. If crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis.",
