            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between weight and mass. Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and it is directly proportional to the mass of the object. The formula for weight is:\n\n\\[ W = m \\cdot g \\]\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the weight, \\( m \\) is the mass, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nGiven that the mass \\( m \\) remains constant, the weight \\( W \\) is directly proportional to the acceleration due to gravity \\( g \\). If the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, the distance from the center of the planet to the surface increases by a factor of 10. This means the acceleration due to gravity \\( g \\) decreases by a factor of 10.\n\nSince the mass \\( m \\) does not change, the weight \\( W \\) will also decrease by a factor of 10. Therefore, if the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, you would weigh:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{original}}}{10} = \\frac{m \\cdot g_{\\text{original}}}{10} \\]\n\nThus, the weight would be 1/100 as much as it was originally.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1/100 as much",
