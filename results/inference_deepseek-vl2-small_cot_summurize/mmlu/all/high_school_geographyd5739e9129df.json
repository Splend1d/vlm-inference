These boundaries were often based on natural features, such as rivers, mountains, or coastlines, and were not always precise. As geographic understanding and technology advanced, these boundaries were often revised or replaced by more accurate ones.\n\nB. **A geometric boundary**: This term is not commonly used in the context of geographic boundaries. It might refer to a boundary defined by precise geometric calculations, but it does not specifically describe a boundary formed before modern mapping.\n\nC. **A relict boundary**: This term is not typically used in the context of geographic boundaries. It might refer to a boundary that has been preserved from a past era, but it does not specifically describe a boundary formed before modern mapping.\n\nD. **A subsequent boundary**: This term refers to a boundary that was established after the development of modern geographic knowledge and mapping. These boundaries are generally more accurate and precise than antecedent boundaries.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. an antecedent boundary.",
