            "content": "To create a 3.0 M solution of H2SO4 from a 18.0 M stock solution, we need to dilute the stock solution to achieve the desired concentration. The dilution formula is:\n\n\\[ C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C_1 \\) is the concentration of the stock solution (18.0 M),\n- \\( V_1 \\) is the volume of the stock solution needed,\n- \\( C_2 \\) is the concentration of the desired solution (3.0 M),\n- \\( V_2 \\) is the volume of the desired solution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the stock solution needed to make 1.00 L of a 3.0 M solution:\n\n\\[ V_1 = \\frac{C_2 \\times V_2}{C_1} = \\frac{3.0 \\, \\text{M} \\times 1.00 \\, \\text{L}}{18.0 \\, \\text{M}} = 0.167 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nSince 1.00 L is equivalent to 1000 mL, we have:\n\n\\[ V_1 = 0.167 \\, \\text{L} = 167 \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the correct procedure to add the stock solution to the flask. The flask should be filled partway with water, then the stock solution should be added, swirled to mix, and finally, the rest of the flask should be filled with distilled water. This ensures that the solution is well-mixed and the concentration is uniform throughout.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure is:\n\nC. Fill the flask partway with water, then add 167 mL of the stock solution, swirling to mix it. Last, fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water.",
