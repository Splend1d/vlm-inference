The given sequence is:\n\n1, 5, 9, 13\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between 5 and 1 is \\(5 - 1 = 4\\).\n- The difference between 9 and 5 is \\(9 - 5 = 4\\).\n- The difference between 13 and 9 is \\(13 - 9 = 4\\).\n\nWe observe that each term increases by 4 from the previous term. This suggests that the pattern is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 4.\n\nTo find the next two terms, we add 4 to the last term in the sequence:\n\n- The last term is 13.\n- Adding 4 to 13 gives \\(13 + 4 = 17\\).\n\nThus, the next term is 17.\n\nNext, we add 4 to the term we just found:\n\n- The next term is \\(17 + 4 = 21\\).\n\nTherefore, the next two terms in Gwen's pattern are 17 and 21.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 17, 21",
