The ability to provide data transmission even when some connections have failed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Internet is designed to be fault-tolerant, which means it can continue to function even if some parts of the network are not working properly. This is achieved through redundancy and the use of multiple paths for data transmission. When one connection fails, the data can be rerouted through another available path, ensuring that data continues to be transmitted. This is a key characteristic of the Internet's design, allowing it to maintain connectivity and functionality even in the face of network failures.\n\nA. The ability to use a hierarchical naming system to avoid naming conflicts is a feature of the Domain Name System (DNS), not a characteristic of the fault-tolerant nature of routing on the Internet.\n\nC. The ability to resolve errors in domain name system (DNS) lookups is also a feature of the DNS, not a characteristic of the fault-tolerant nature of routing on the Internet.\n\nD. The ability to use multiple protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), Internet protocol (IP), and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) to transfer data is a feature of the Internet's architecture, not a characteristic of its fault-tolerant nature.",
