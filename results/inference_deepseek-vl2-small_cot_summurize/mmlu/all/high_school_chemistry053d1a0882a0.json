Neutrons have a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu), which is slightly more than the mass of a proton (approximately 1 amu). Protons and neutrons are both subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom, but neutrons have no electric charge, while protons have a positive charge. Alpha particles, beta particles, and other subatomic particles have much smaller masses.",
