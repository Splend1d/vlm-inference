            "content": "To determine the unrestricted residual sum of squares (RSS) for the given regression model, we need to understand what the RSS represents. The RSS is a measure of the total variation in the dependent variable that is not explained by the independent variables in the model. It is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.\n\nGiven the regression model:\n\n\\[ y_t = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 x_{2t} + \\beta_3 x_{3t} + u_t \\]\n\nThe RSS is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{RSS} = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} (y_t - \\hat{y}_t)^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{y}_t \\) is the predicted value of \\( y_t \\) based on the model.\n\nSince the sample is split exactly in half for the sub-sample regressions, we have two sub-samples, each containing 100 observations. The RSS for each sub-sample is calculated separately.\n\nLet's denote the RSS for the first sub-sample as \\( \\text{RSS}_1 \\) and the RSS for the second sub-sample as \\( \\text{RSS}_2 \\).\n\nThe total RSS is the sum of the RSS for both sub-samples:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total RSS} = \\text{RSS}_1 + \\text{RSS}_2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the unrestricted residual sum of squares for the entire sample is the sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples",
