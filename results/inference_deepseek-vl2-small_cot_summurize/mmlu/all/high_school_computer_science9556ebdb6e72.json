If the number is positive, the rightmost bit is discarded, and the rest of the bits are shifted to the right. If the number is negative, the rightmost bit is treated as a 1, and the rest of the bits are shifted to the right.\n\nIn this case, x = 8. When we perform a right shift operation on 8, the result is 4.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 4.",
