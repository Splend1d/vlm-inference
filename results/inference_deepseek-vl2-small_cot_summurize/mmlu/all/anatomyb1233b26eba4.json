            "content": "To determine which sequence describes the systemic circulation, we need to understand the path blood takes through the body.\n\n1. **Heart Function**: The systemic circulation begins in the right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary trunk, which then leads to the pulmonary arteries.\n\n2. **Pulmonary Circulation**: The pulmonary arteries carry blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. This is known as pulmonary circulation.\n\n3. **Systemic Circulation**: After the lungs, the blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood. The left atrium receives this blood, and it is then pumped into the left ventricle.\n\n4. **Aorta and Arteries**: The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta, the largest artery in the body. From the aorta, blood is distributed to the rest of the body through a network of arteries.\n\n5. **Capillaries and Veins**: The arteries branch into smaller arterioles, which then connect to capillaries. Here, the exchange of oxygen and nutrients occurs with the body's tissues. Finally, the deoxygenated blood returns to the heart through veins, completing the systemic circulation.\n\nGiven this detailed explanation, the correct sequence is:\n\n- **Right ventricle \u2192 pulmonary trunk \u2192 arteries \u2192 capillaries \u2192 veins**\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. Right ventricle \u2192 pulmonary trunk \u2192 arteries \u2192 capillaries \u2192 veins**.",
