            "content": "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the truth of two statements and then determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n**Statement 1:** R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.\n\nA splitting field of a polynomial over a field \\( F \\) is the smallest field extension of \\( F \\) in which the polynomial splits into linear factors. The polynomial \\( x^n - 1 \\) over the rational numbers \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) has roots that are the \\( n \\)-th roots of unity. The splitting field of \\( x^n - 1 \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is the field of \\( n \\)-th roots of unity, which is \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta) \\), where \\( \\zeta \\) is a primitive \\( n \\)-th root of unity. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta) \\) is a splitting field of \\( x^n - 1 \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** There is a field with 60 elements.\n\nThe number of elements in a field is determined by the number of elements in its ground field. The ground field here is \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), which has 6 elements (the 6th roots of unity). Therefore, the field with 60 elements must have a ground field of 6 elements.\n\nThe field with 6 elements is \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta) \\), where \\( \\zeta \\) is a primitive 6th root of unity. This field has 6 elements: 1, \\( \\zeta \\), \\( \\zeta^2 \\), \\( \\zeta^3 \\), \\( \\zeta^4 \\), and \\( \\zeta^5 \\).\n\nThus, there is a field with 60 elements, and Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
