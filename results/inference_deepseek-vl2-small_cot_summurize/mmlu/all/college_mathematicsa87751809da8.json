The graph of \\(\\cos(97x)\\) is a smooth curve that oscillates between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nThe graph of \\(x\\) is a straight line that passes through the origin and has a slope of \\(1\\).\n\nSince the graph of \\(\\cos(97x)\\) oscillates between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), and the graph of \\(x\\) is a straight line, there are no points of intersection between the two graphs.\n\nTherefore, there are no positive solutions for \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation \\(\\cos(97x) = x\\).\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ 1 \\]",
