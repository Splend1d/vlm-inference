This means they can produce a large number of offspring in a short period, which is crucial for their survival in unstable environments where conditions can change rapidly.\n\nB. **Small body size**: R-selected species often have small body sizes. This is because smaller individuals can be more easily transported by wind or water, which is advantageous for colonizing new areas.\n\nC. **Occupancy of unstable environments**: R-selected species are typically found in unstable environments. These environments can change rapidly, and the species must be able to adapt quickly to survive.\n\nD. **High competitive ability**: This is not a typical characteristic of r-selected species. R-selected species are often less competitive because they focus on quantity over quality. They produce many offspring, but each offspring has a lower chance of survival compared to fewer offspring with higher survival rates.\n\nBased on this analysis, the characteristic that is not typical of r-selected species is:\n\nD. High competitive ability.",
