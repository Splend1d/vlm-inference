It is widely used in electronic devices due to its precision and stability. However, fabricating a crystal oscillator in a monolithic IC is challenging because it requires precise alignment and control of the crystal's dimensions and orientation. The crystal must be cut and mounted with high accuracy, which is difficult to achieve in a monolithic IC.\n\nB. **Hartley Oscillator**: This oscillator uses a pair of capacitors and a inductor to generate a sinusoidal wave. It is relatively simple to design and can be implemented using basic components. However, the components must be carefully selected and arranged to ensure proper operation. While it is possible to fabricate a Hartley oscillator in a monolithic IC, it requires careful design and component selection to ensure stability and performance.\n\nC. **Wien Bridge Oscillator**: This oscillator uses a combination of capacitors and inductors to generate a sinusoidal wave. It is known for its stability and low noise. Fabricating a Wien Bridge oscillator in a monolithic IC is challenging because it requires precise control over the component values and their arrangement. The components must be carefully selected and mounted to ensure proper operation, making it difficult to achieve in a monolithic IC.\n\nD. **Relaxation Oscillator**: This oscillator uses a feedback loop to generate a periodic signal. It is relatively simple to design and can be implemented using basic components. The components can be easily fabricated and arranged in a monolithic IC, making it a good candidate for monolithic implementation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the oscillator that is easy to fabricate in a monolithic IC is:\n\nD.
