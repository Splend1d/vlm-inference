This can help the wrestler maintain a caloric deficit while still providing essential nutrients.\n\nB. **Reward himself with a savory meal every Saturday for meeting his calorie goals.**\n   - Rewarding oneself with a meal can be a motivating strategy to maintain calorie restrictions. However, it's important to ensure that the reward is not too high in calories to offset the caloric deficit.\n\nC. **Snap himself with a rubber band when he eats a high calorie snack.**\n   - This method is not a good way to restrict caloric intake. Instead of using physical punishment, it's more effective to focus on healthy eating habits and portion control.\n\nD. **Hide snack food out of sight within his house.**\n   - Hiding snacks can help reduce the temptation to overeat. This is a practical strategy to maintain a caloric deficit.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the method that is NOT a good way to restrict caloric intake is:\n\nC. Snap himself with a rubber band when he eats a high calorie snack.",
