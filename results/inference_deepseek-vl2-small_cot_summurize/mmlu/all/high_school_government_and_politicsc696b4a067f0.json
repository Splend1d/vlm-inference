            "content": "To determine which option is a direct result of an electoral system with single-member districts, we need to understand the characteristics of this system.\n\nSingle-member districts, also known as first-past-the-post (FPTP) systems, are used in many countries. In this system, voters cast a single vote for a candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins the seat. This system is designed to produce a simple majority winner, meaning the candidate with the most votes wins the election.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Only two major parties can successfully be supported.\n- This statement is incorrect. In a single-member district system, voters have the freedom to choose any candidate they prefer, not just the two major parties. This system allows for a diverse range of candidates, including third parties, to gain representation.\n\nB. National campaigns can be conducted without incurring great expense.\n- This statement is incorrect. In a single-member district system, candidates often need to campaign across the entire country to win a seat. This requires significant resources, including time, money, and personnel, making national campaigns quite costly.\n\nC. Third parties can be as successful as the two major political parties can.\n- This statement is incorrect. While third parties can gain representation in single-member district systems, they are generally less successful than the two major parties. The system tends to favor the two major parties because they have more resources and can effectively mobilize voters.\n\nD. Each political party tends to focus its campaign on a single issue.\n- This statement is correct. In a single-member district system, candidates often focus their campaigns on a single issue that resonates with their constituents. This is because voters have a single vote, and candidates need to appeal to a broad base of support to win.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Each political party tends to focus its campaign on a single issue.",
