            "content": "To determine which option describes a symbiotic relationship, we need to understand the characteristics of symbiosis. Symbiosis is a close and long-term interaction between two different species, where at least one benefits from the relationship.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A tapeworm feeds off of its host's nutrients causing the host to lose large amounts of weight.\n- This describes a parasitic relationship, where the tapeworm benefits at the expense of the host. The host loses nutrients and weight, which is not beneficial to the host.\n\nB. Certain plants grow on trees in order to gain access to sunlight, not affecting the tree.\n- This describes a commensal relationship, where one species benefits without affecting the other. The plant gains sunlight, but the tree is not affected.\n\nC. Remora fish eat parasites off of sharks; the sharks stay free of parasites, and the remora fish are protected from predators.\n- This describes a mutualistic relationship, where both species benefit. The sharks are free of parasites, and the remora fish are protected from predators.\n\nD. Meerkats sound alarm calls to warn other meerkats of predators.\n- This describes a mutualistic relationship, where both species benefit. The meerkats are warned of predators, and the group is protected.\n\nBased on the analysis, options C and D describe mutualistic relationships, where both species benefit. However, the question asks for a single answer, and typically, the first correct answer is chosen. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Remora fish eat parasites off of sharks; the sharks stay free of parasites, and the remora fish are protected from predators.",
