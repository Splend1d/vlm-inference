This means that if the permittivity is increased, the capacitance will also increase, assuming the other variables remain constant.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Low permittivity**: If the permittivity is low, the capacitance will be low as well, because the capacitance is directly proportional to the permittivity.\n\nB. **Zero permittivity**: If the permittivity is zero, the capacitance will also be zero, as there is no ability for the capacitor to store charge.\n\nC. **High permittivity**: If the permittivity is high, the capacitance will be high, as the capacitance is directly proportional to the permittivity.\n\nD. **Unity permittivity**: If the permittivity is unity, the capacitance will be equal to the capacitance of a capacitor with zero permittivity, which is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. high**, as a high permittivity results in a high capacitance.",
