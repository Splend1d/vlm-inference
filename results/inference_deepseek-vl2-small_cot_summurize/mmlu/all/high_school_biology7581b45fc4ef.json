Selection for drab coloration of the algae-eaters: Drab coloration can help algae-eaters blend into their surroundings, making them less visible to predators. This would be a beneficial adaptation in the presence of visual predators like pike-cichlids.\n\nB. Selection for nocturnal algae-eaters (active only at night): If pike-cichlids are active during the day, nocturnal behavior would be advantageous for avoiding predation. This would be a beneficial adaptation.\n\nC. Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young: Larger females might be able to produce more offspring, which could increase the population size. However, this option does not directly address the issue of predation by pike-cichlids.\n\nD. Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes: If smaller body sizes are advantageous for avoiding predation, this would be a beneficial adaptation.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the least likely adaptation to be observed in the algae-eater population would be:\n\nC. Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young.\n\nThis option does not directly address the issue of predation by pike-cichlids and is therefore the least likely to be observed in the algae-eater population.",
