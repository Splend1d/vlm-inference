A cycle is a permutation where each element is mapped to the next element in the sequence, and the sequence eventually returns to the starting element. For example, consider the permutation \\( (1, 2, 3) \\). This is a cycle because:\n- 1 maps to 2.\n- 2 maps to 3.\n- 3 maps to 1.\n\nThus, every permutation can be represented as a cycle. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every cycle is a permutation.**\n\nA cycle is a permutation where each element is mapped to the next element in the sequence, and the sequence eventually returns to the starting element. For example, consider the cycle \\( (1, 2, 3) \\). This is a permutation because:\n- 1 maps to 2.\n- 2 maps to 3.\n- 3 maps to 1.\n\nThus, every cycle is indeed a permutation. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
