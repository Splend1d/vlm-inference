            "content": "To understand the process of invasion and succession, we need to consider the dynamics of migration and how it affects the social and physical landscape of an area.\n\n- **Option A: New residents tear down and rebuild housing units.** This describes a process of physical change, often associated with urban renewal or gentrification, where new structures replace old ones. While this is a part of invasion and succession, it focuses more on physical transformation rather than the social integration aspect.\n\n- **Option B: New residents live peacefully with old residents.** This scenario suggests a harmonious coexistence without significant changes to the social structure. This is not typically the case in invasion and succession, where there is often a clash or competition between new and old groups.\n\n- **Option C: New residents assimilate with old residents completely.** This implies a complete cultural and social integration, which is not usually the case in invasion and succession. These processes often involve a clash of cultures and identities.\n\n- **Option D: New residents move into areas occupied by older resident groups.** This option accurately describes invasion and succession. It involves the migration of new groups into areas that are already inhabited by older groups. This can lead to competition for resources, cultural clashes, and changes in the social and physical landscape.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the process of invasion and succession is best described by **Option D: new residents move into areas occupied by older resident groups.** This option captures the essence of invasion and succession, which involves migration and the subsequent changes in the social and physical environment.",
