The university raised tuition.\n2. The president approved of it.\n3. The board didn't prevent it.\n\nLogical components:\n1. P: The university raised tuition.\n2. B: The president approved of it.\n3. ~B: The board didn't prevent it.\n\nNow, let's match these components with the given formulas:\n\nA. (P \u2022 ~B) \u2283 U\nB. (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B\nC. U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B)\nD. U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B)\n\nThe correct formula should represent the logical structure of the sentence. The sentence is structured as follows:\n- The university raised tuition (P).\n- The president approved of it (B).\n- The board didn't prevent it (~B).\n\nThe logical structure of the sentence is:\n- If the university raised tuition (P), then the president approved of it (B) and the board didn't prevent it (~B).\n\nThis matches with formula C: U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B).\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\nC.
