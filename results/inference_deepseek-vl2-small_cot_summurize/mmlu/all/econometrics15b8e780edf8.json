            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the properties of an ARMA(p,q) model.\n\nAn ARMA(p,q) model is a combination of an autoregressive (AR) model and a moving average (MA) model. The AR part of the model is represented by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\phi_1 \\phi_2 \\cdots \\phi_p \\epsilon_t = \\theta_1 \\theta_2 \\cdots \\theta_q \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\phi_i\\) are the autoregressive coefficients, \\(\\theta_j\\) are the moving average coefficients, and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the error term.\n\n### Autocorrelation Function (ACF)\n\nThe ACF of an ARMA(p,q) model will have a geometric decline because the AR part of the model has a geometric decay in its coefficients. Specifically, the coefficients \\(\\phi_i\\) decay exponentially as \\(i\\) increases. This means that the ACF will decline geometrically.\n\n### Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)\n\nThe PACF of an ARMA(p,q) model will have a zero value after \\(p\\) lags because the MA part of the model has a zero at lag \\(p\\). This is because the moving average coefficients \\(\\theta_j\\) are zero for lags greater than \\(q\\). Therefore, the PACF will be zero after \\(p\\) lags.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n- **Option A**: An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that declines geometrically. This is incorrect because the PACF will be zero after \\(p\\) lags, not decline geometrically.\n- **Option B**: An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after p lags. This is correct because the ACF declines geometrically, and the PACF is zero after \\(p\\) lags.\n- **Option C**: An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags. This is incorrect because the PACF will be zero after \\(p\\) lags, not \\(q\\) lags.\n- **Option D**: An acf that is zero after p lags and a pacf that is zero after q lags. This is incorrect because the ACF will decline geometrically, not be zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is **Option B**: An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after \\(p\\) lags.",
