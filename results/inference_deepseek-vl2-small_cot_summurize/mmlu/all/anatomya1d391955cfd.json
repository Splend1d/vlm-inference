It is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter.\n\nB. **Cecum**: The cecum is also part of the large intestine. It is the first section of the large intestine and is located at the junction of the small and large intestines. It serves as a reservoir for chyme from the small intestine and plays a role in the fermentation of indigestible material.\n\nC. **Ileum**: The ileum is indeed a part of the small intestine. It is the final section of the small intestine and is located between the jejunum and the cecum. The ileum is responsible for the absorption of nutrients, including vitamins and minerals, and plays a crucial role in the digestive process.\n\nD. **Sigmoid colon**: The sigmoid colon is another part of the large intestine. It is located in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen and is responsible for storing fecal matter before it is expelled from the body.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\nC. **Ileum**",
