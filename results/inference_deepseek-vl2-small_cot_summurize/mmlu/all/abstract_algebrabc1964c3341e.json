The structure of the factor group is determined by the quotient group \\( G/N \\).\n\n- If \\( G \\) is non-Abelian, it means that the group operation is not commutative.\n- The quotient group \\( G/N \\) is abelian if and only if \\( N \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\).\n- If \\( N \\) is not a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), then \\( G/N \\) is not abelian.\n\nTherefore, a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\n**Statement 2: If \\( K \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( H \\) and \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), then \\( K \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\).**\n\n- A subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\) is normal if and only if the conjugate of \\( K \\) in \\( G \\) is also in \\( K \\).\n- If \\( K \\) is normal in \\( H \\) and \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\), then for any \\( g \\in G \\), the conjugate \\( gKg^{-1} \\) is in \\( K \\).\n- This implies that \\( K \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\nThus, if \\( K \\) is normal in \\( H \\) and \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\), then \\( K \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\nBoth statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
