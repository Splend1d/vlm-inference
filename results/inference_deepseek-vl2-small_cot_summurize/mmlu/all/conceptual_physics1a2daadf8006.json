Mass distorts spacetime.\n- This is a fundamental concept in general relativity. According to Einstein's theory, massive objects cause spacetime to curve, and this curvature affects the motion of other objects. The more massive the object, the greater the curvature of spacetime around it.\n\nB. Gravity affects clocks.\n- General relativity predicts that gravity can affect the passage of time. Clocks placed in stronger gravitational fields (such as near a massive object) will run slower compared to clocks in weaker gravitational fields. This effect, known as gravitational time dilation, is a direct consequence of the curvature of spacetime.\n\nC. Light can\u2019t escape from a black hole.\n- This statement is also true. According to general relativity, a black hole is a region in spacetime where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The event horizon of a black hole marks the boundary beyond which nothing can return to the outside universe.\n\nD. All of these.\n- Since all the statements (A, B, and C) are true according to general relativity, the correct answer is indeed D.",
