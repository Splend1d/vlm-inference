It operates based on a predetermined set of instructions or a fixed input. Since it lacks feedback, it cannot adjust to changes in the system's environment, making it less flexible and less suitable for dynamic environments.\n\nB. **Closed loop control system**: This system uses feedback to adjust the output. It continuously monitors the system's performance and makes adjustments to maintain the desired output. This feedback mechanism allows the system to adapt to changes and maintain stability, making it ideal for automatic control.\n\nC. **Either A or B**: This option suggests that either the open loop or closed loop system can be considered an automatic control system. However, since open loop systems do not use feedback, they are not considered automatic control systems.\n\nD. **Neither A nor B**: This option suggests that neither system is an automatic control system. However, closed loop systems are indeed automatic control systems due to their feedback mechanism.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Closed loop control system\n\nClosed loop control systems are known as automatic control systems because they use feedback to adjust the output, making them highly adaptable and effective in maintaining desired performance.",
