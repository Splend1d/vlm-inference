            "content": "The correct answer is D. The voltage induced in an inductor is given by the formula V = L * (dI/dt), where V is the voltage, L is the inductance, and dI/dt is the rate of change of current through the inductor. This formula is derived from Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that a change in magnetic flux through an inductor induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the inductor. The rate of change of current through the inductor is directly proportional to the change in magnetic flux, hence the product of inductance and the rate of change of current gives the induced voltage.",
