            "content": "To determine whether the titration results are accurate and precise, we need to analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Mean Result**: The mean concentration of the five titrations is 0.110 M. This indicates the average concentration calculated from the data.\n\n2. **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation is 0.001 M. This measures the amount of variation or dispersion in the data. A small standard deviation suggests that the data points are close to the mean, indicating precision.\n\n3. **Actual Concentration**: The actual concentration of the titrated solution is 0.100 M. This is the true value we are trying to estimate.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A: Accurate but not precise**\n  - **Accurate**: The mean result (0.110 M) is not close to the actual concentration (0.100 M), indicating that the results are not accurate.\n  - **Precise**: The small standard deviation (0.001 M) suggests that the results are precise.\n  - **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because the results are not accurate.\n\n- **Option B: Precise but not accurate**\n  - **Precise**: The small standard deviation (0.001 M) indicates precision.\n  - **Accurate**: The mean result (0.110 M) is not close to the actual concentration (0.100 M), indicating that the results are not accurate.\n  - **Conclusion**: This option is correct because the results are precise but not accurate.\n\n- **Option C: Both accurate and precise**\n  - **Accurate**: The mean result (0.110 M) is not close to the actual concentration (0.100 M), indicating that the results are not accurate.\n  - **Precise**: The small standard deviation (0.001 M) suggests that the results are precise.\n  - **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because the results are not accurate.\n\n- **Option D: Neither accurate nor precise**\n  - **Accurate**: The mean result (0.110 M) is not close to the actual concentration (0.100 M), indicating that the results are not accurate.\n  - **Precise**: The small standard deviation (0.001 M) suggests that the results are precise.\n  - **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because the results are precise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Precise but not accurate**.",
