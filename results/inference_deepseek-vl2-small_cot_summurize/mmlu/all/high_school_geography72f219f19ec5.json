These activities are directly dependent on the physical environment because they rely on the availability of natural resources. For example, mining operations are conducted in specific locations where minerals are found, and the extraction process is influenced by geological conditions.\n\nB. **Secondary Economic Activity**: This includes manufacturing and construction. While these activities do require resources and energy, they are not as directly dependent on the physical environment as primary activities. Manufacturing can occur in various locations, and construction can be adapted to different environments.\n\nC. **Tertiary Economic Activity**: This involves services such as retail, finance, and tourism. These activities are less dependent on the physical environment and can be conducted in urban or remote areas. For example, a retail store can be located in a shopping mall or on a high street, and tourism can be promoted in various locations.\n\nD. **Quaternary Economic Activity**: This includes information technology, research, and development. These activities are highly dependent on human capital and technological infrastructure rather than the physical environment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the economic activity that is most closely tied to the physical environment is **A. Primary**. This is because primary activities rely heavily on the availability of natural resources, which are directly influenced by the physical environment.",
