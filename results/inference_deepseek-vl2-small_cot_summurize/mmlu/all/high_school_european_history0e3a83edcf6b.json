We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the main interest of Wallis's group was\n\nA. undermining of the traditional worldview\nB. creating of a secular science to challenge the Church\nC. ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad\nD. the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values\n",

            "content": "The passage describes a group of people who met weekly to discuss philosophical inquiries and various scientific topics. They did not discuss matters of theology, state affairs, or news other than what concerned their business of philosophy. This suggests that their main interest was in the scientific and philosophical inquiries of the time, rather than in challenging the Church or regulating new knowledge.\n\nOption A, undermining the traditional worldview, is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While they did discuss topics that could potentially challenge traditional beliefs, such as the Copernican hypothesis and the nature of comets and new stars, this is not the main focus of their discussions.\n\nOption B, creating of a secular science to challenge the Church, is also not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While they did discuss topics that could potentially challenge traditional beliefs, such as the Copernican hypothesis and the nature of comets and new stars, this is not the main focus of their discussions.\n\nOption D, the regulation of new knowledge so as not to undermine traditional values, is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While they did discuss topics that could potentially challenge traditional beliefs, such as the Copernican hypothesis and the nature of comets and new stars, this is not the main focus of their discussions.\n\nOption C, ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad, is explicitly mentioned in the passage. They discussed various scientific topics, such as physics, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments, and they did so in the context of the New Philosophy or Experimental Philosophy. This suggests that their main interest was in understanding and discussing the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad.\n\nTherefore, the main interest of Wallis's group was to ascertain the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
