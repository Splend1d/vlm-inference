            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the dissolution and precipitation of Mg(OH)2 in the presence of HCl.\n\n1. **Initial Dissolution**: Mg(OH)2 is a sparingly soluble salt. It dissolves in water to form Mg\u00b2\u207a and OH\u207b ions. The solubility product constant (Ksp) for Mg(OH)2 is given by:\n   \\[\n   K_{sp} = [Mg^{2+}][OH^-]^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Addition of HCl**: When 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added, the H\u207a ions react with the OH\u207b ions to form water:\n   \\[\n   H^+ + OH^- \\rightarrow H_2O\n   \\]\n   This reaction reduces the concentration of OH\u207b ions in the solution.\n\n3. **Effect on Ksp**: As the concentration of OH\u207b ions decreases, the Ksp value for Mg(OH)2 decreases because the product of the concentrations of Mg\u00b2\u207a and OH\u207b is now lower.\n\n4. **Precipitation of Mg(OH)2**: Since the Ksp value decreases, the solubility of Mg(OH)2 is reduced. If the concentration of Mg\u00b2\u207a ions becomes too low, Mg(OH)2 will precipitate out of the solution.\n\n5. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **A. MgCl2 precipitates**: This is incorrect because MgCl2 is soluble in water, and the addition of HCl does not affect the solubility of MgCl2.\n   - **B. Mg(OH)2 precipitates**: This is correct because the decrease in Ksp leads to a reduction in solubility, causing Mg(OH)2 to precipitate.\n   - **C. Ksp for Mg(OH)2 increases**: This is incorrect because the Ksp decreases as the concentration of OH\u207b ions decreases.\n   - **D. [H2O] increases**: This is incorrect because the addition of HCl does not increase the concentration of water; it only reacts with OH\u207b ions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Mg(OH)2 precipitates**.",
