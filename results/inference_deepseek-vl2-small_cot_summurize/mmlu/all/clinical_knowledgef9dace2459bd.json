            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The finding of a palpable median groove in the prostate is an adverse finding.\n- The median groove is a normal anatomical feature of the prostate gland. It is a slight indentation in the midline of the prostate. Its presence is not considered an adverse finding. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour.\n- Impacted faeces, or fecal impaction, occurs when there is a blockage in the rectum, preventing the passage of stool. This can cause discomfort and may be mistaken for a rectal tumor due to similar symptoms. Thus, this statement is true.\n\nC. A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless.\n- A thrombosed haemorrhoid is a painful condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a haemorrhoid, causing it to become swollen and tender. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. Peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy.\n- Peri-anal warts are growths that can occur around the anus and are often visible during a physical examination. They can be seen during a proctoscopy, but they can also be observed during a visual examination without the need for proctoscopy. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour.",
