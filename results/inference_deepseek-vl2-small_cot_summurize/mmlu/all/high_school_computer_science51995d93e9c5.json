The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second operand. In this case, 3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 1. So, 3 % 2 = 1.\n\n2. The expression 4 + 1 is then evaluated. The addition operator (+) adds the two operands together. In this case, 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression 4 + 3 % 2 is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 5.",
