Since the base field Q is a field, it has only two elements: 0 and 1. The extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is a field extension of Q, and the degree of the extension is the number of elements in the extension that are not in the base field Q.\n\nIn this case, the degree of the extension is 5, which means that there are 5 elements in the extension that are not in the base field Q.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 2",
