Innovation is a primary driver of cultural change, as it often leads to new practices and technologies that can alter societal norms and behaviors.\n\nB. **Diffusion**: This process involves the spread of innovations, ideas, or practices from one place to another. Diffusion is a key mechanism through which cultural change occurs, as it allows new practices to be adopted and integrated into existing cultures.\n\nC. **Acculturation**: This is the process by which one culture is replaced by another. It involves the assimilation of one culture into another, often leading to significant changes in the cultural practices and values of the society.\n\nD. **Gravity**: Gravity is a physical force that affects the motion of objects on Earth. It is not related to cultural change or the introduction of new ideas or practices. Gravity does not play a role in cultural diffusion or the spread of innovations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the process that is not involved in the introduction of change in any culture is **D. gravity**.",
