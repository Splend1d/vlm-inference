It facilitates communication, access to information, and the sharing of ideas, making it a facilitator rather than a barrier to innovation diffusion.\n\nB. **Distance**: Distance can indeed be a barrier to innovation diffusion. Physical distance can limit the reach of innovations, as it may be difficult for people to travel to learn about or adopt new technologies.\n\nC. **Cultural obstacles**: Cultural factors can significantly impact the adoption of innovations. Different cultures may have varying values, beliefs, and practices that can either support or hinder the acceptance of new ideas.\n\nD. **Government interference**: Government policies and regulations can either promote or restrict the diffusion of innovations. For example, restrictive regulations might slow down the adoption of new technologies, while supportive policies can accelerate it.\n\nBy examining each option, we can conclude that the internet is not a barrier to innovation diffusion. It is more of a facilitator, enabling faster and wider dissemination of innovations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Internet",
