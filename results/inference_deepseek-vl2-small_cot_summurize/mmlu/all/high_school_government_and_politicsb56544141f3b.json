            "content": "The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution is a provision that grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the states, and with Indian tribes. This clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to expand the power of the national government in various ways. Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. Release detainees from prison following unlawful arrest\n- This is not a power granted by the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause does not address issues of law enforcement or the release of detainees.\n\nB. Maintain the navy\n- While the Commerce Clause does give Congress the power to regulate commerce, it does not specifically grant the power to maintain a navy. The power to maintain a navy is more directly related to the power to declare war and raise and support armies, which is granted to Congress by the Constitution.\n\nC. Increase the power of the national government\n- This is a correct answer. The Commerce Clause has been used by the Supreme Court to expand the power of the national government. For example, the Court has interpreted the clause to include the power to regulate economic activities that have a significant impact on interstate commerce, even if they do not directly involve interstate trade. This has led to the regulation of a wide range of activities, from banking and finance to environmental protection and labor laws.\n\nD. Veto legislative bills of attainder\n- This is not a power granted by the Commerce Clause. The power to veto legislative bills of attainder is a power granted to the President by the Constitution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The Commerce Clause has been used to increase the power of the national government.",
