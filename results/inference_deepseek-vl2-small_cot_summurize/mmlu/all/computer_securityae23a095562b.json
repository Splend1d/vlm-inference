It uses a cryptographic hash function to create a message authentication code (MAC) that can be verified by the receiving end to ensure the data's integrity.\n\n- **Privacy (B):** Privacy is not a primary function of the AH Protocol. It does not provide confidentiality, which means it does not protect the data from being read by unauthorized parties.\n\n- **Nonrepudiation (C):** The AH Protocol does not provide nonrepudiation, which means it does not guarantee that the sender cannot deny having sent the data. This is typically provided by other protocols like digital signatures.\n\n- **Both A & C (D):** As explained, the AH Protocol does not provide privacy or nonrepudiation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Privacy**.",
