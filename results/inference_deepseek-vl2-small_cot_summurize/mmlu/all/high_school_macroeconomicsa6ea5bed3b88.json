Debtors with fixed interest rates: When the price level rises, the real value of the money they repay decreases. This means that the real burden of their debt increases, as they are repaying with money that has less purchasing power. Therefore, debtors with fixed interest rates will suffer the most from inflation.\n\nB. People with fixed money incomes: While their purchasing power decreases as prices rise, they are not directly affected by the interest rate on their debt. Their income is not tied to interest rates, so they are not directly impacted by changes in the interest rate.\n\nC. Investors in gems, coins, and stamps: These investors are not directly affected by the interest rate on their debt. Their investment is not tied to interest rates, so they are not directly impacted by changes in the interest rate.\n\nD. Property owners: While the real value of their property decreases as prices rise, they are not directly affected by the interest rate on their debt. Their income is not tied to interest rates, so they are not directly impacted by changes in the interest rate.\n\nTherefore, the group that will suffer the most from a rising price level is debtors with fixed interest rates.\n\nThe correct answer is A. debtors with fixed interest rates.",
