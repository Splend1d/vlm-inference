            "content": "To understand the purpose of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), let's first consider the role of IP addresses and how they are used in networking. IP addresses are unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other. However, these addresses are typically in the form of numbers, which can be difficult to remember and manage.\n\nTo address this, ARP is used to translate these human-readable host names into IP addresses. This is crucial for devices that need to communicate with each other, as they must know the IP address of the device they are trying to connect to.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. To translate Web addresses to host names - This is not the purpose of ARP. Web addresses are typically in the form of URLs, which are not directly related to ARP's function.\n\nB. To determine the IP address of a given host name - This is the correct description of ARP. ARP works by sending a request to a network to find the IP address associated with a given host name.\n\nC. To determine the hardware address of a given host name - This is not the purpose of ARP. ARP is concerned with IP addresses, not hardware addresses.\n\nD. To determine the hardware address of a given IP address - This is not the purpose of ARP. ARP is concerned with IP addresses, not hardware addresses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. ARP is used to determine the IP address of a given host name.",
