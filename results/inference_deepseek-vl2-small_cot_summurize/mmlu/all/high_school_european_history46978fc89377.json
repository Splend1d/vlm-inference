            "content": "The poem \"The White Man's Burden\" by Rudyard Kipling describes a condescending and paternalistic attitude toward the native peoples who were under the rule or influence of the British Empire. The poem suggests that the British should take responsibility for the \"savage wars of peace\" and \"fill full the mouth of Famine\" to help these people, implying that they are in a state of need and are not capable of helping themselves. The poem also describes the native peoples as \"new-caught, sullen peoples, half-devil and half-child,\" which further emphasizes the view that they are less civilized and less developed than the British.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. They are the product of a less-civilized and less-developed civilization.",
