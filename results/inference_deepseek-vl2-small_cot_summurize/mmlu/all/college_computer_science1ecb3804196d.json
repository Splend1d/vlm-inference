            "content": "A. Finding a longest simple cycle in G\n\nFinding a longest simple cycle in an undirected graph G is a well-known problem that can be solved in polynomial time. This problem is known as the Longest Simple Cycle Problem (LSCP). It can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which explores all possible cycles in the graph and keeps track of the longest cycle found. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.\n\nB. Finding a shortest cycle in G\n\nFinding a shortest cycle in an undirected graph G is also a well-known problem that can be solved in polynomial time. This problem is known as the Shortest Cycle Problem (SCP). It can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, which explores all possible cycles in the graph and keeps track of the shortest cycle found. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.\n\nC. Finding ALL spanning trees of G\n\nFinding all spanning trees of an undirected graph G is a well-known problem that can be solved in polynomial time. This problem is known as the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. It can be solved using Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm, both of which have a time complexity of O(V + E log V) or O(V + E log V log V), respectively.\n\nD. Finding a largest clique in G\n\nFinding a largest clique in an undirected graph G is a well-known problem that can be solved in polynomial time. This problem is known as the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). It can be solved using a backtracking algorithm, which explores all possible cliques in the graph and keeps track of the largest clique found. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIn summary, all of the problems listed can be solved in polynomial time, but the time complexity of the algorithms used to solve them may vary.",
