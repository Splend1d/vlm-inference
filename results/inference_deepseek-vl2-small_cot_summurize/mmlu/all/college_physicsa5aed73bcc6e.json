            "content": "To determine the resolving power of the grating spectrometer, we need to understand the concept of resolving power in the context of spectroscopy. Resolving power is a measure of the ability of a spectrometer to distinguish between two closely spaced wavelengths. It is defined as the ratio of the difference in wavelength to the width of the central peak in the spectrum.\n\nGiven:\n- The grating spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths: 500 nm and 502 nm.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Calculate the Wavelength Difference**:\n   - The difference in wavelengths is \\( 502 \\, \\text{nm} - 500 \\, \\text{nm} = 2 \\, \\text{nm} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Central Peak Width**:\n   - The central peak width is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the central peak in the spectrum. This width is typically given in terms of the number of lines per millimeter (lpm) or lines per nanometer (lpm/nm).\n\n3. **Calculate the Resolving Power**:\n   - Resolving power \\( R \\) is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\text{Central Peak Width}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2 \\, \\text{nm}}{\\text{Central Peak Width (lpm/nm)}}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert Central Peak Width to lpm/nm**:\n   - Assume the central peak width is 1 lpm/nm for simplicity.\n\n5. **Calculate the Resolving Power**:\n   - \\[\n     R = \\frac{2 \\, \\text{nm}}{1 \\, \\text{lpm/nm}} = 2 \\, \\text{lpm/nm}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Convert to Lines per Millimeter**:\n   - Since 1 lpm/nm is equivalent to 1000 lpm/mm, the resolving power is:\n     \\[\n     R = 2 \\times 1000 = 2000 \\, \\text{lpm/mm}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Select the Closest Option**:\n   - The closest option to 2000 lpm/mm is 5000 lpm/mm.\n\nTherefore, the resolving power of the grating spectrometer is approximately 5000 lpm/mm.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 5,000**.",
