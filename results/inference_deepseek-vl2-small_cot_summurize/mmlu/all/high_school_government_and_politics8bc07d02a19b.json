Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle.\n- Stare decisis is a fundamental principle in appellate courts, which means \"to stand by things decided.\" It requires appellate courts to follow the precedents set by previous decisions in similar cases. This principle ensures consistency and predictability in the law. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. Appellate trials are usually jury trials.\n- Appellate courts do not conduct trials; they review decisions made by lower courts. They do not conduct new trials or hear evidence. Instead, they focus on legal issues and the application of the law. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nC. Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case.\n- Appellate judges do not decide facts; they review the legal issues and the application of the law. The facts are typically determined by the trial court. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\n- This statement is true. Appellate judges are responsible for reviewing the decisions of lower courts to ensure that the law was applied correctly and that there were no errors in the application of the law. They do not conduct new trials or hear evidence.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.",
