            "content": "A. are appointed by presidents of the same political party\n\nThe majority of Supreme Court justices are appointed by presidents of the same political party as the president who appointed them. This is because the president has the power to nominate federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, and the Senate must confirm these nominations. This process is designed to ensure that the justices appointed by a president are likely to share the president's judicial philosophy and political views.\n\nB. have no prior judicial experience\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Supreme Court justices typically have significant prior judicial experience. Many have served as federal judges on lower courts, such as district courts or circuit courts, before being appointed to the Supreme Court. This experience is important for understanding the legal and judicial context in which they will serve on the highest court in the land.\n\nC. switch party affiliation during their term\n\nThis statement is also incorrect. Supreme Court justices are lifetime appointments, meaning they serve until they retire or are removed from the court. They do not switch party affiliations during their term. This lifetime appointment is intended to insulate the justices from political pressures and ensure that they can make decisions based on the law and the Constitution rather than political considerations.\n\nD. stay on the court for only a decade\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Supreme Court justices serve for life, not for a decade. They are appointed to the court for life, which is designed to protect their independence and ensure that they can make decisions without fear of political retribution. This lifetime appointment is a key feature of the U.S. Supreme Court system.",
