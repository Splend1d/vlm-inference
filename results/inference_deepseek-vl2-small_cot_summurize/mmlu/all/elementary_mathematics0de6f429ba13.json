If the last digit is 5 or greater, the next digit is rounded up. If the last digit is less than 5, the next digit is rounded down.\n\nGiven that the rounded number is 500, we can infer that the original number must have been between 450 and 549.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 458: This number is less than 450, so it could not be the original number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\nB. 463: This number is between 450 and 459, so it could be the original number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\nC. 547: This number is between 540 and 549, so it could be the original number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\nD. 559: This number is between 550 and 559, so it could be the original number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\nTherefore, the number that could not be the original number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred is:\n\\[ 458 \\]",
