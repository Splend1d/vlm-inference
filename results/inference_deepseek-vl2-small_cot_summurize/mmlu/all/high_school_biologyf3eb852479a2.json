            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Enhancer**: Enhancers are DNA sequences that can increase the transcription of a gene. They do not directly interact with transcription factors but can influence the activity of promoters by bringing transcription factors to the promoter region.\n\nB. **Repressor**: Repressors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences, usually located upstream of a gene, to inhibit transcription. They do not assist transcription but rather prevent it.\n\nC. **Operator**: Operators are DNA sequences that interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression. They are typically located between a promoter and an enhancer and can either enhance or repress transcription depending on the presence of specific transcription factors.\n\nD. **Promoter**: The promoter is the DNA sequence where transcription begins. It is the binding site for RNA polymerase and other transcription factors, but it does not assist transcription by interacting with regulatory proteins.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **C. Operator**. Operators are short sequences that interact with transcription factors, thereby assisting transcription by either enhancing or repressing the process.",
