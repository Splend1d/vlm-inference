This is because if \\( f \\) is injective, then for any \\( s \\in S \\), \\( f(r) = s \\) implies \\( r = 0 \\).\n- Conversely, if the kernel is the trivial ideal \\({0}\\), then for any \\( s \\in S \\), \\( f(r) = s \\) implies \\( r = 0 \\), which means \\( f \\) is injective.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: \\( Q \\) is an ideal in \\( R \\).**\n\n- An ideal \\( I \\) in a ring \\( R \\) is a subset of \\( R \\) that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\).\n- The statement does not provide any information about the properties of \\( Q \\) in \\( R \\). It simply states that \\( Q \\) is an ideal, but it does not specify whether \\( Q \\) satisfies the properties of an ideal.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",
