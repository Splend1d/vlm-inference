            "content": "To determine the products of the electrolysis of molten magnesium bromide, we need to consider the chemical reactions that occur at the anode and cathode during electrolysis.\n\n1. **Understanding the Electrolysis Process**:\n   - Electrolysis is a process where an electric current passes through a solution, causing a chemical reaction.\n   - In molten magnesium bromide, magnesium ions (\\( \\text{Mg}^{2+} \\)) and bromide ions (\\( \\text{Br}^- \\)) are present.\n\n2. **Anode Reaction**:\n   - At the anode, oxidation occurs. This means that electrons are lost, and ions gain electrons.\n   - For magnesium bromide, the reaction at the anode is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mg}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^- \\rightarrow \\text{Mg}\n     \\]\n   - This reaction results in the formation of solid magnesium.\n\n3. **Cathode Reaction**:\n   - At the cathode, reduction occurs. This means that ions gain electrons, and the process results in the formation of a new substance.\n   - For magnesium bromide, the reaction at the cathode is:\n     \\[\n     2\\text{Br}^- + 2\\text{e}^- \\rightarrow \\text{Br}_2\n     \\]\n   - This reaction results in the formation of bromine gas.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The anode produces magnesium, and the cathode produces bromine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. magnesium at the cathode and bromine at the anode",
