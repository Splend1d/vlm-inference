It is located between the skull bones and the arachnoid mater. Therefore, this option is incorrect because the dura mater is not located between the skull bones and the dura mater.\n\nB. **Dura mater and arachnoid**: The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges, which are protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The arachnoid mater is the middle layer, and the pia mater is the innermost layer. The dura mater is indeed located between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater. This option is correct.\n\nC. **Arachnoid and pia mater**: The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges, and the pia mater is the innermost layer. The dura mater is not located between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. This option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Pia mater and brain surface**: The pia mater is the innermost layer of the meninges, closely adhering to the surface of the brain and spinal cord. It is not located between the pia mater and the brain surface. This option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is **B. dura mater and arachnoid**. The dura mater is located between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater, which is where the extradural haemorrhage is detected.",
