            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the forces acting on the ball as it rolls on the inside surface of a cone.\n\n1. **Identify the Forces:**\n   - **Gravitational Force (mg):** Acts downward, where \\( m \\) is the mass of the ball and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n   - **Normal Force (N):** Acts perpendicular to the surface of the cone.\n   - **Centripetal Force (F_c):** Acts toward the center of the circular path, keeping the ball moving in a circular motion.\n\n2. **Analyze the Forces on the Ball:**\n   - The ball is in a state of uniform circular motion, which means the net force acting on it is the centripetal force.\n   - The centripetal force is provided by the normal force and the gravitational force.\n\n3. **Component of Gravitational Force:**\n   - The gravitational force can be resolved into two components: one perpendicular to the surface of the cone and one parallel to the surface.\n   - The component of gravitational force perpendicular to the surface is \\( mg \\cos(\\theta) \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between the gravitational force and the normal force.\n\n4. **Equilibrium of Forces:**\n   - For the ball to maintain circular motion, the normal force must provide the necessary centripetal force.\n   - The normal force \\( N \\) must be greater than the component of the gravitational force perpendicular to the surface, \\( mg \\cos(\\theta) \\), to provide the additional centripetal force required.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The normal force \\( N \\) is greater than \\( mg \\) because it must provide the additional centripetal force needed to keep the ball moving in a circular path.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. is greater than mg always",
