            "content": "To determine the correct term for the point where natality (birth rate) and mortality (death rate) are equal, we need to understand the concept of zero population growth.\n\n- **Population Crash**: This term refers to a sudden and drastic decline in population size, often due to environmental disasters, wars, or other catastrophic events. It is not the point where birth and death rates are equal.\n\n- **Population Explosion**: This term describes a rapid increase in population size, often due to high birth rates and low death rates. It is not the point where birth and death rates are equal.\n\n- **Zero Population Growth**: This is the point where the number of births equals the number of deaths in a population. At this stage, the population size remains constant over time because the number of individuals being added by births is exactly equal to the number of individuals leaving due to deaths.\n\n- **Exponential Growth**: This term describes a situation where the population size increases at a rate proportional to its current size, leading to a rapid increase in population. It is not the point where birth and death rates are equal.\n\nBy analyzing these definitions, we can conclude that the correct term for the point where natality and mortality rates are equal is **zero population growth**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. zero population growth",
