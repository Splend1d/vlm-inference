For instance, companies that adopt sustainable practices may attract environmentally conscious consumers, leading to higher sales. Additionally, companies that develop and sell pollution-control technology can tap into a growing market for environmental solutions. These factors can contribute to increased revenue.\n\nB. **Increase Costs**: While some environmental initiatives may require initial investments, the long-term benefits often outweigh the costs. For example, energy-efficient technologies can reduce operational costs over time. Therefore, this option is not typically accurate.\n\nC. **Decrease Revenue**: This option is unlikely because the benefits of better environmental performance, such as increased consumer demand and market differentiation, are generally positive for revenue.\n\nD. **Decrease Costs**: While some environmental initiatives may reduce costs, the overall impact is often positive. For example, energy-efficient practices can lower utility bills. Thus, this option is not typically accurate.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate choice is:\n\nA. **Increase Revenue**.",
