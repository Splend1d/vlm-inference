            "content": "The correct answer is C. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve, which runs through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. This compression can lead to pain, tingling, and numbness in the medial three and a half digits of the hand, as well as in the thumb, index, and middle fingers.\n\nA. Carpal tunnel syndrome is not caused by rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that affects the joints, not the carpal tunnel.\n\nB. The ulna nerve is not involved in carpal tunnel syndrome. The ulna nerve is a nerve that runs down the arm and is not affected by carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nD. Paraesthesia (tingling or numbness) is not necessarily worse during the day. Carpal tunnel syndrome can cause paraesthesia at any time, but it is often worse at night when the median nerve is compressed during sleep.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Carpal tunnel syndrome causes pain and tingling in the medial three and a half digits.",
