An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\nB. Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\nC. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\nD. Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\n",

            "content": "To determine which statement is true, we need to understand the concept of water potential and how it is influenced by different factors.\n\nWater potential (\\(\\Psi\\)) is a measure of the potential energy of water in a solution. It is the sum of three components:\n\n1. **Pressure Potential (\\(\\Pi\\))**: This is the potential energy due to the pressure of the water molecules. It is directly related to the concentration of solute particles in the solution.\n\n2. **Solute Potential (\\(\\Pi_s\\))**: This is the potential energy due to the solute particles in the solution. It is directly related to the concentration of solute particles.\n\n3. **Viscous Potential (\\(\\Pi_v\\))**: This is the potential energy due to the viscosity of the solution. It is related to the viscosity of the solution.\n\nThe equation for water potential is:\n\n\\[\n\\Psi = \\Pi + \\Pi_s + \\Pi_v\n\\]\n\nWhen a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution is placed into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution, the following occurs:\n\n- **Pressure Potential (\\(\\Pi\\))**: The pressure potential is higher in the beaker (0.6 M) compared to the dialysis bag (0.5 M). This is because the concentration of solute particles is higher in the beaker.\n\n- **Solute Potential (\\(\\Pi_s\\))**: The solute potential is higher in the beaker (0.6 M) compared to the dialysis bag (0.5 M). This is because the concentration of solute particles is higher in the beaker.\n\n- **Viscous Potential (\\(\\Pi_v\\))**: The viscosity of the solution in the beaker is higher than in the dialysis bag, which affects the viscous potential.\n\nSince the pressure potential and solute potential are both higher in the beaker, the water potential in the beaker is higher than in the dialysis bag. Therefore, water will move from the beaker (higher water potential) to the dialysis bag (lower water potential) to equalize the water potential.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.",
