Wade (1973) are landmark Supreme Court cases that addressed the right to privacy for all American citizens.\n\n- **Griswold v. Connecticut** (1965): This case involved a challenge to a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of contraceptives. The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution protects a married couple's right to privacy, including the right to use contraceptives. This decision established the right to privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution.\n\n- **Roe v. Wade** (1973): This case involved a challenge to a Texas law that prohibited abortion. The Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to privacy includes the right to choose whether to have an abortion. This decision established the right to privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution and effectively legalized abortion in the United States.\n\nThese cases have had a significant impact on American law and society, particularly in the areas of reproductive rights and privacy.",
