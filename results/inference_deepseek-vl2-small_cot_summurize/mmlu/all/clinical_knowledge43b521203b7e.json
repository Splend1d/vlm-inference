Actin and troponin: Actin is a protein that forms the backbone of the muscle fiber, while troponin is a regulatory protein that controls the interaction between actin and myosin. Although troponin is involved in muscle contraction, it is not a contractile protein itself.\n\nB. Actin and myosin: Actin and myosin are indeed the two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle. Actin forms the thin filaments, and myosin forms the thick filaments. The interaction between these two proteins is crucial for muscle contraction. Myosin heads bind to actin filaments and use energy from ATP hydrolysis to pull the actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere, shortening the muscle fiber.\n\nC. Troponin and tropomyosin: Troponin is a regulatory protein, and tropomyosin is a protein that covers the active sites on actin filaments. While they play important roles in muscle contraction, they are not the principal contractile proteins.\n\nD. Myosin and tropomyosin: Myosin is a contractile protein, but tropomyosin is not. Tropomyosin covers the active sites on actin filaments and prevents myosin from binding to actin, thus inhibiting muscle contraction.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Actin and myosin.",
