            "content": "The correct answer is B. Casparian strip.\n\nThe Casparian strip is a layer of cells located in the root cap of monocot plants. It is a specialized structure that plays a crucial role in regulating the movement of water and nutrients into the root. The strip is composed of cells that are tightly packed together and have a thick, impermeable cell wall. This wall acts as a barrier to prevent the free flow of water and nutrients, forcing them to pass through the cells of the Casparian strip.\n\nThe Casparian strip is located just below the root cap and is responsible for the formation of the Casparian strip, which is a layer of cells that lines the inside of the root cap. This strip is composed of cells that are tightly packed together and have a thick, impermeable cell wall. The Casparian strip is responsible for the formation of the Casparian strip, which is a layer of cells that lines the inside of the root cap.\n\nThe Casparian strip is responsible for the formation of the Casparian strip, which is a layer of cells that lines the inside of the root cap.
