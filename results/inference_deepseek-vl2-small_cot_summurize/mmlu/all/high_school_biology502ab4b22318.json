            "content": "To understand why RNA viral replication is more susceptible to mutation, we need to consider the differences in the replication processes of DNA and RNA viruses.\n\n- **Option A**: This statement is incorrect. While DNA replication occurs in the nucleus, RNA replication occurs in the cytoplasm. This difference in location does not directly affect mutation susceptibility.\n\n- **Option B**: This statement is incorrect. RNA viruses do not necessarily replicate faster than DNA viruses. The speed of replication can vary depending on the virus and its host.\n\n- **Option C**: This statement is incorrect. RNA viruses do not use uracil; they use uridine. Uracil is a base found in DNA, not RNA.\n\n- **Option D**: This statement is correct. RNA viruses lack the proofreading functions that are characteristic of DNA replication. DNA polymerases have a 3' to 5' exonuclease activity that allows them to remove incorrectly paired nucleotides, thus reducing the mutation rate. RNA polymerases do not have this activity, leading to a higher mutation rate during replication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.** This lack of proofreading results in a higher mutation rate in RNA viruses compared to DNA viruses.",
