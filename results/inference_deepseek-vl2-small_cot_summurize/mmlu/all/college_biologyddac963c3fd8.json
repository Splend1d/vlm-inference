            "content": "To understand the alternation of generations in ferns, we need to explore the life cycle of ferns and the roles of the sporophyte and gametophyte.\n\n1. **Sporophyte Dominance**: In ferns, the sporophyte is the dominant phase of the life cycle. It is the larger, more visible stage that produces spores through meiosis. These spores are haploid and are dispersed into the environment.\n\n2. **Gametophyte Development**: The gametophyte is the smaller, less visible stage that develops from the spores. It is dependent on the sporophyte for nutrients and is haploid. The gametophyte produces gametes (sperm and eggs) through mitosis.\n\n3. **Alternation of Generations**: The alternation of generations refers to the cycle between these two distinct forms. The sporophyte produces spores, which develop into gametophytes. The gametophyte then produces gametes, which fuse to form a new sporophyte.\n\n4. **Life Cycle Process**:\n   - **Sporophyte Stage**: The sporophyte grows and produces spores.\n   - **Gametophyte Stage**: The spores germinate to form gametophytes.\n   - **Gametophyte Stage**: The gametophyte produces gametes.\n   - **Sporophyte Stage**: The gametes fuse to form a new sporophyte.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A**: \"A dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte\" is incorrect. The sporophyte is dominant, but the gametophyte is not independent; it is dependent on the sporophyte for nutrients.\n\n- **Option B**: \"A dominant gametophyte alternates with a dependent sporophyte\" is incorrect. The gametophyte is not dominant; it is dependent on the sporophyte.\n\n- **Option C**: \"Sporophyte and a gametophyte have equal life spans\" is incorrect. The sporophyte is dominant and has a longer life span compared to the gametophyte.\n\n- **Option D**: \"Gametophyte produces gametes by meiosis\" is incorrect. The gametophyte produces gametes by mitosis, not meiosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**: \"A dominant gametophyte alternates with a dependent sporophyte.\" This accurately describes the alternation of generations in ferns, where the sporophyte is dominant and the gametophyte is dependent.",
