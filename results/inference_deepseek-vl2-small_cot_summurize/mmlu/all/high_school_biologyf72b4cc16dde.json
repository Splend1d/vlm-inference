            "content": "To determine the critical factor responsible for the transition from forest to grassland ecosystems, we need to consider the environmental conditions that influence the types of vegetation present in these ecosystems.\n\n1. **Amount of Sunlight**: While sunlight is crucial for photosynthesis, the amount of sunlight does not vary significantly from east to west in the U.S. Therefore, it is not the primary factor in this transition.\n\n2. **Availability of Oxygen**: Oxygen availability is essential for all living organisms, but it does not directly determine the type of vegetation. Forests and grasslands both require oxygen for their growth, so this is not the critical factor.\n\n3. **Availability of Water**: Water is a vital resource for plant growth. In the eastern part of the U.S., forests are typically found in areas with higher rainfall and more water availability. As you move west, the climate becomes drier, and water becomes scarcer. This scarcity of water is the primary reason why forests give way to grasslands.\n\n4. **Length of Growing Season**: The length of the growing season can affect the types of plants that can survive in a given area. However, the transition from forest to grassland is more directly related to water availability than the length of the growing season.\n\nConsidering these factors, the critical factor responsible for the transition from forest to grassland ecosystems in the U.S. from east to west is the **availability of water**. As you move west, the decrease in precipitation leads to drier conditions, which favor the growth of grasses over trees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Availability of water",
