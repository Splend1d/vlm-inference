The order of the group is 45, which is \\(3^2 \\times 5\\). The divisors of 45 are:\n\\[ 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45 \\]\n\nAmong these, the divisors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. The subgroup of order 10 must be one of these divisors. Since 10 is not a divisor of 45, there is no subgroup of order 10 in any abelian group of order 45. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** A subgroup \\(H\\) of a group \\(G\\) is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of \\(H\\) is equal to the number of right cosets of \\(H\\).\n\nTo determine the truth of this statement, we need to understand the definition of a normal subgroup. A subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\) is normal if for every \\(g \\in G\\), the left coset \\(gH\\) is equal to the right coset \\(Hg\\). This is equivalent to saying that the number of left cosets of \\(H\\) is equal to the number of right cosets of \\(H\\). Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nGiven the evaluations:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).",
