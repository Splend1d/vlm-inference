            "content": "To determine which peak has the lowest energy in the photoelectron spectrum of carbon, we need to understand the energy levels of the carbon atom and how they relate to the photoelectron spectrum.\n\n1. **Energy Levels of Carbon**: The carbon atom has an electronic configuration of 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u00b2. This means that the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals are filled with electrons.\n\n2. **Photoelectron Spectrum**: When a photon is absorbed by an atom, it can eject an electron from a higher energy level to a lower one. The energy of the ejected electron is determined by the difference in energy between the initial and final states.\n\n3. **Order of Energy Levels**: In the carbon atom, the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals are at different energy levels. The 1s orbital is the lowest in energy, followed by the 2s orbital, and then the 2p orbitals.\n\n4. **Electron Ejection**: When a photon is absorbed, the most likely electron to be ejected is the one from the highest energy level. In the case of carbon, the 2p orbitals are at a higher energy level than the 1s and 2s orbitals.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the photoelectron spectrum of carbon will show peaks corresponding to the 2p orbitals, with the 2p peak having the lowest energy.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The 2p peak has the lowest energy.",
