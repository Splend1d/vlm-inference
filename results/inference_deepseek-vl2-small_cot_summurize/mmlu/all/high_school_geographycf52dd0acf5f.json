Rand-McNally Road Atlas: This is a detailed map of roads and highways, which can be useful for navigating long distances or unfamiliar areas. However, it is not typically used for short, everyday trips like getting to school.\n\nB. World Globe: A world globe is a three-dimensional representation of the Earth, which can be used to understand the relative positions of countries and continents. It is not practical for navigating local routes or directions.\n\nC. Road Map: A road map is a detailed map of roads and highways, similar to a Rand-McNally Road Atlas. It is designed to help drivers navigate local routes and directions. This is the most appropriate guide for getting to school in the morning, as it provides the necessary information for navigating local roads and directions.\n\nD. Mental Map: A mental map is a mental representation of the layout of an area, including the location of streets, landmarks, and other features. While it can be useful for remembering the layout of an area, it is not a practical guide for navigating local routes or directions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Road Map.",
