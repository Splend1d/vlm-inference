According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in 2017, China's military expenditure was approximately 1.9% of its GDP.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. 0.50% - This is significantly lower than the actual percentage.\nB. 2% - This is also lower than the actual percentage.\nC. 6% - This is much higher than the actual percentage.\nD. 12% - This is even higher than the actual percentage.\n\nGiven the options, none of them match the actual percentage of 1.9%. However, the closest option to this value is not listed. Therefore, none of the provided options are correct based on the given data.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 12%",
