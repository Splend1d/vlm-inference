That is, for all \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\phi(a + b) = \\phi(a) + \\phi(b)\\).\n   - The kernel of \\(\\phi\\) is the set of elements in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) that map to the identity element in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\). The kernel is a subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n3. **Kernel of \\(\\phi\\):**\n   - The kernel of \\(\\phi\\) must be a subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n   - Since \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) has only two elements, the only subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) that can be the kernel is \\(\\{0\\}\\), because any non-zero element in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) will map to one of the two elements in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n\n4. **Homomorphisms from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\):**\n   - The only homomorphism that maps all elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to the identity element in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) is the trivial homomorphism, which maps every element to 0.\n\nTherefore, there is only one homomorphism from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), which is the trivial homomorphism.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1",
