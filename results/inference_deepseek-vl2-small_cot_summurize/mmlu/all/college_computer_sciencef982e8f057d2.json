            "content": "To determine which of the given conditions must be true for a program to be shared by several users in a multiprogrammed system, let's analyze each option:\n\nI. The program is a macro.\n- A macro is a sequence of instructions that is treated as a single unit. While macros can be useful for code reuse, they do not inherently support sharing by multiple users in a multiprogrammed system. Therefore, this condition does not necessarily ensure that a single copy of the program can be shared by several users.\n\nII. The program is recursive.\n- Recursive programs can be shared by multiple users because they can be executed concurrently. Each user can have their own instance of the program, and the recursion can be managed in a way that allows multiple users to access different parts of the program simultaneously. This makes recursive programs suitable for multiprogrammed systems.\n\nIII. The program is reentrant.\n- A reentrant program is one that can be executed by multiple threads or processes simultaneously without causing conflicts. This property is crucial for multiprogrammed systems, as it allows multiple users to access the program at the same time without interference. Therefore, reentrant programs are well-suited for sharing in multiprogrammed environments.\n\nBased on the analysis, the conditions that must be true for a program to be shared by several users in a multiprogrammed system are:\n\n- The program must be recursive (II).\n- The program must be reentrant (III).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. II and III only",
