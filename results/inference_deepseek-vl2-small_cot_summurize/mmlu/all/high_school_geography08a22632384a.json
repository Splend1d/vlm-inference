            "content": "To determine the type of activities that the majority of workers in periphery countries are probably employed in, we need to consider the economic structure of these countries.\n\n1. **Primary Activities**: These involve the extraction of natural resources such as agriculture, mining, and fishing. While some periphery countries may have significant natural resources, they are not typically the primary source of employment for the majority of their workforce.\n\n2. **Secondary Activities**: These include manufacturing and construction. Many periphery countries have developed manufacturing sectors, but they often serve as a source of employment for a smaller segment of the population compared to tertiary activities.\n\n3. **Tertiary Activities**: These involve services such as retail, finance, and tourism. Many periphery countries rely heavily on these sectors to drive economic growth and employment. Services are often more labor-intensive and can provide a larger number of jobs compared to primary and secondary activities.\n\n4. **Quaternary Activities**: These involve high-tech and knowledge-based services such as information technology, research, and development. While some periphery countries may have developed these sectors, they are not as widespread or dominant as tertiary activities.\n\nGiven the economic structure of periphery countries, which often rely on manufacturing and service sectors to drive economic growth, the majority of workers are likely employed in tertiary activities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
