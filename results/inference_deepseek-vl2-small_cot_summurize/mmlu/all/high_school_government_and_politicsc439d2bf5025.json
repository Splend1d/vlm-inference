Automatic spending is spending that occurs without the need for annual appropriations by Congress. This typically includes spending on entitlement programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as well as interest payments on the national debt.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Salaries to employees of the U.S. Post Office: This is not an automatic spending category. Salaries are typically part of discretionary spending, which requires annual appropriations by Congress.\n\nB. Interest payments made to U.S. bondholders: This is an example of automatic spending. Interest payments on the national debt are required by law and do not require annual appropriations.\n\nC. Entitlement programs: These are indeed automatic spending. Entitlements, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, are funded through mandatory spending, which means they are automatically funded without the need for annual appropriations.\n\nD. National defense: This is a discretionary spending category. National defense is funded through the annual appropriations process, meaning it requires annual appropriations by Congress.\n\nGiven this analysis, the largest source of automatic spending for the federal government is:\n\nC. Entitlement programs.",
