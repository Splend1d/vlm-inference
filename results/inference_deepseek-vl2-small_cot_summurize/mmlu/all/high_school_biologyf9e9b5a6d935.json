            "content": "To determine which statement does not support the endosymbiotic theory, we need to understand the theory itself. The endosymbiotic theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from free-living prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by a host cell. Over time, these prokaryotes evolved into organelles within the host cell, retaining some of their original characteristics.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently of the eukaryotic host cell by a process similar to binary fission.\n- This statement supports the endosymbiotic theory because it suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts have a mechanism for reproduction that is similar to that of bacteria, which aligns with the idea that they originated from prokaryotic cells.\n\nB. Mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that more closely resemble those of bacteria than of eukaryotic cells.\n- This statement also supports the endosymbiotic theory. The presence of bacterial-like ribosomes indicates that mitochondria and chloroplasts retain some characteristics of their prokaryotic ancestors.\n\nC. Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.\n- This statement does not support the endosymbiotic theory. If mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently, it suggests that they are not derived from prokaryotic cells but rather are fully integrated organelles within the host cell.\n\nD. Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins.\n- This statement supports the endosymbiotic theory because it indicates that these organelles have a genetic structure similar to that of bacteria, which is consistent with their prokaryotic origins.\n\nTherefore, the statement that does not support the endosymbiotic theory is:\n\nC. Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.",
