The product of 5 x 2 is even because both of the factors are even.\n- 5 is an odd number, and 2 is an even number. The product of an odd number and an even number is always even. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. The product of 4 x 4 is odd because both of the factors are even.\n- 4 is an even number, and 4 is an even number. The product of two even numbers is always even. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nC. The product of 2 x 7 is even because both of the factors are odd.\n- 2 is an even number, and 7 is an odd number. The product of an even number and an odd number is always even. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nD. The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both of the factors are odd.\n- 5 is an odd number, and 3 is an odd number. The product of two odd numbers is always odd. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nThe correct answers are A, C, and D.",
