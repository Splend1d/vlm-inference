            "content": "To understand the events described, we need to analyze the sequence of reactions that occur during the fertilization process in sea urchin oocytes.\n\n1. **Intracellular Free Calcium Rise**: The initial event is the rise in intracellular free calcium levels. This increase is crucial as it triggers a series of cellular responses aimed at preventing polyspermy, which is the fertilization of the egg by more than one sperm.\n\n2. **Release of Proteolytic Enzymes**: The rise in calcium levels leads to the release of proteolytic enzymes from the acrosome, a structure at the tip of the sperm cell. These enzymes are essential for the acrosomal reaction.\n\n3. **Acrosomal Reaction**: The acrosomal reaction is a critical step in the fertilization process. It involves the sperm's acrosome releasing enzymes that break down the zona pellucida, a protective layer surrounding the egg. This breakdown allows the sperm to penetrate the egg.\n\n4. **Cortical Reaction**: Following the acrosomal reaction, the cortical reaction occurs. This involves the egg's cytoplasm reacting to the sperm's entry, leading to the formation of a cortical complex. This complex is essential for the subsequent fertilization reactions.\n\n5. **Fertilization Reaction**: The final step is the fertilization reaction, where the sperm's nucleus fuses with the egg's nucleus, resulting in the formation of a zygote.\n\nGiven this sequence, the events described are part of the **acrosomal reaction** (Option B). The acrosomal reaction is specifically triggered by the rise in intracellular calcium and involves the release of enzymes that facilitate the penetration of the sperm into the egg.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. acrosomal reaction**.",
