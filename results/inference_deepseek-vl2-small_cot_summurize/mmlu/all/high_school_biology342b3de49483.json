            "content": "To determine the correct statement about the DNA in liver cells, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your white blood cells.\n- This statement is incorrect. While both liver and white blood cells are derived from the same embryonic cells, they have different functions and therefore different gene expressions. Liver cells are specialized for functions like detoxification, metabolism, and storage, while white blood cells are involved in immune responses.\n\nB. Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed but not translated.\n- This statement is incorrect. Liver cells are highly active in protein synthesis, and most of the DNA in liver cells is transcribed and translated. The liver is responsible for producing many proteins necessary for its functions, such as enzymes, clotting factors, and transport proteins.\n\nC. Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed in the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm.\n- This statement is correct. The DNA in liver cells is located in the nucleus, where it is transcribed into RNA. The RNA is then transported to the cytoplasm, where it is translated into proteins. This process is typical for eukaryotic cells, including liver cells.\n\nD. DNA in your liver cells contains genes unique to storing glycogen, while other cells do not contain those genes.\n- This statement is incorrect. While liver cells do contain genes related to glycogen storage, these genes are not unique to liver cells. Other cells, such as muscle cells, also have genes for glycogen storage. The liver's primary function is to store glycogen, but it is not the only cell type that does so.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct statement is:\n\nC. Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed in the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm.",
