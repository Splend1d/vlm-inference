            "content": "To determine the correct safety precaution, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Putting on fire-retardant gloves to carry the chamber to a fume hood if the acetone catches fire: While fire-retardant gloves are important for handling flammable materials, they are not the primary concern here. The focus should be on preventing exposure to the vapors, not just handling them.\n\nB. Placing the chamber in a closed, darkened cabinet for the duration of the pigment separation: This option is not ideal because it does not address the issue of vapor exposure. A closed cabinet would not prevent the vapors from escaping and reaching the skin and eyes.\n\nC. Wearing leather gloves and covering the nose and mouth with a particle mask: Leather gloves are not suitable for handling acetone as they can be damaged by the solvent. Additionally, a particle mask is not effective for protecting against vapors.\n\nD. Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed: This option is the most appropriate. Goggles protect the eyes from vapors, and nitrile gloves provide a barrier against skin contact. Keeping acetone containers closed minimizes vapor exposure.\n\nTherefore, the correct safety precaution is option D: Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed.",
