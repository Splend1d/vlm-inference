This is a constant for a given isotope and is independent of the initial amount of the isotope.\n\n2. **Initial Amount**: Let's assume we start with 100% of the isotope.\n\n3. **First Half-Life**: After the first half-life, 50% of the isotope decays, leaving 50% remaining.\n\n4. **Second Half-Life**: After the second half-life, 50% of the remaining 50% decays, leaving 25% remaining.\n\n5. **Third Half-Life**: After the third half-life, 50% of the remaining 25% decays, leaving 12.5% remaining.\n\nTherefore, after three half-lives, 12.5% of the isotope is left.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 12.5% of the isotope is left",
