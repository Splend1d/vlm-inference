            "content": "Devolution refers to the transfer of power from a central authority to a lower level of government. In this context, it involves the transfer of authority from the federal government to the states.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets - This is an example of devolution because it involves states having the authority to implement policies that are set by the federal government. The federal government sets the targets, but the states have the flexibility to choose how to meet them.\n\nB. A \"race to the bottom\" in which states compete with one another to have the fewest environmental regulations - This is not an example of devolution. Instead, it is a form of competition between states, where each state tries to attract businesses by having the most lenient regulations. This is more related to economic competition rather than the transfer of power from the federal government to the states.\n\nC. A state that legalizes marijuana possession in conflict with federal law - This is not an example of devolution. It is a conflict between state and federal law, where the state is not following the federal law.\n\nD. A state being prevented from implementing a fuel efficiency standard that is more stringent than that set by the federal government - This is not an example of devolution. It is a conflict between state and federal law, where the state is not allowed to implement a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets.",
