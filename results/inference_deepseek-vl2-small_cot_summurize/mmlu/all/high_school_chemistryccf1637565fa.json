Ethylene has two carbon atoms, each bonded to two hydrogen atoms, and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n\nA. at least two pi bonds: This is correct. Ethylene has two pi bonds in its double bonds.\n\nB. at least four sigma bonds: This is incorrect. Ethylene has four sigma bonds in total (two C-H bonds and two C-C bonds).\n\nC. a tetrahedral configuration: This is incorrect. The carbon atoms in ethylene are sp\u00b2 hybridized, not tetrahedral.\n\nD. cis-trans isomers: This is incorrect. Ethylene does not have cis-trans isomers because it is a simple alkene with a double bond that allows for rotation around the bond.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. at least two pi bonds.",
