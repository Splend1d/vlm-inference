            "content": "To determine the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy, we need to analyze the motion of the disk as it rolls down the inclined plane.\n\n1. **Understanding the Motion**:\n   - The disk starts from rest and rolls down the incline without slipping.\n   - This means that the linear velocity of the center of mass of the disk is constant.\n\n2. **Kinetic Energy Components**:\n   - The total kinetic energy of the disk is the sum of its translational kinetic energy and its rotational kinetic energy.\n   - Translational kinetic energy is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the disk and \\(v\\) is its linear velocity.\n   - Rotational kinetic energy is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\\), where \\(I\\) is the moment of inertia of the disk and \\(\\omega\\) is its angular velocity.\n\n3. **Constant Linear Velocity**:\n   - Since the disk rolls without slipping, the linear velocity \\(v\\) of the center of mass remains constant.\n   - This implies that the linear velocity of any point on the disk is also constant.\n\n4. **Constant Angular Velocity**:\n   - The angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) of the disk is related to the linear velocity \\(v\\) by the relation \\(\\omega = \\frac{v}{r}\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the disk.\n   - Since \\(v\\) is constant, \\(\\omega\\) is also constant.\n\n5. **Rotational Kinetic Energy**:\n   - The rotational kinetic energy is \\(\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\\).\n   - Since \\(\\omega\\) is constant, the rotational kinetic energy is also constant.\n\n6. **Total Kinetic Energy**:\n   - The total kinetic energy is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energies.\n   - Since both components are constant, the total kinetic energy is constant.\n\n7. **Fraction of Total Kinetic Energy**:\n   - The fraction of the total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is given by \\(\\frac{\\text{Rotational Kinetic Energy}}{\\text{Total Kinetic Energy}}\\).\n   - Since the rotational kinetic energy is constant and the total kinetic energy is also constant, the fraction is \\(\\frac{\\text{Rotational Kinetic Energy}}{\\text{Total Kinetic Energy}} = \\frac{\\text{Constant}}{\\text{Constant}} = 1\\).\n\nHowever, this analysis seems to be incorrect as it suggests that the rotational kinetic energy is equal to the total kinetic energy, which is not the case. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\n8. **Correct Analysis**:\n   - The correct approach is to consider the conservation of energy.\n   - The total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic and potential energy) is conserved.\n   - The potential energy at the top of the incline is converted into kinetic energy as the disk rolls down.\n   - The kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energies.\n\n9. **Energy Conservation**:\n   - Let \\(V\\) be the potential energy at the top of the incline.\n   - The total mechanical energy at the bottom is \\(V + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\\).\n   - Since the total mechanical energy is conserved, \\(V + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 = V\\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 = 0\\).\n\n10. **Conclusion**:\n    - The fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is \\(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2}{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2}{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2}{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2}{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2}{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2}{\\frac",
