            "content": "To determine which statement is true about congressional redistricting, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The responsibility for redrawing congressional districts belongs to congressional committees.\n- This statement is incorrect. While congressional committees do play a role in the redistricting process, the primary responsibility for redrawing congressional districts lies with state legislatures. The process is governed by state laws and is not solely managed by congressional committees.\n\nB. It is a noncontroversial process because it has few political ramifications.\n- This statement is incorrect. Congressional redistricting is a highly controversial process. It can significantly impact political power dynamics, as districts are drawn to favor certain political parties or incumbents. The process often leads to legal challenges and public debate over fairness and representation.\n\nC. It occurs every 10 years to reflect changes in population according to the census.\n- This statement is correct. Congressional redistricting is required by the U.S. Constitution to occur every 10 years following the census. The purpose is to ensure that each state has an equal number of representatives in the House of Representatives, reflecting changes in population distribution.\n\nD. The Supreme Court has ruled that legislators may not consider racial demographics when redrawing districts.\n- This statement is incorrect. The Supreme Court has ruled that racial demographics can be considered in the redistricting process, as long as it is done in a way that does not violate the Voting Rights Act. The goal is to ensure that districts are not drawn in a manner that dilutes the voting power of minority groups.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is C. It occurs every 10 years to reflect changes in population according to the census.",
