            "content": "To determine which fibre types fatigue first during all-out exercise such as sprinting, we need to understand the characteristics of each fibre type:\n\nA. **Type I fibres**: These are slow-twitch fibres that are rich in myoglobin and capillaries. They are highly resistant to fatigue and are used for endurance activities. They are not typically the first to fatigue during high-intensity, short-duration activities like sprinting.\n\nB. **Type Ia fibres**: These are fast-twitch fibres that are rich in glycogen and are used for high-intensity, short-duration activities. They fatigue quickly because they rely on anaerobic metabolism, which does not produce as much ATP as aerobic metabolism.\n\nC. **Type IIa fibres**: These are fast-twitch fibres that are rich in glycogen and are used for high-intensity, short-duration activities. They fatigue quickly because they rely on anaerobic metabolism, which does not produce as much ATP as aerobic metabolism.\n\nD. **Type IIX fibres**: These are fast-twitch fibres that are rich in glycogen and are used for high-intensity, short-duration activities. They fatigue quickly because they rely on anaerobic metabolism, which does not produce as much ATP as aerobic metabolism.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Type Ia fibres.\n\nType Ia fibres fatigue first during all-out exercise such as sprinting because they rely on anaerobic metabolism, which is less efficient in producing ATP compared to aerobic metabolism. This leads to quicker depletion of energy stores, causing them to fatigue first.",
