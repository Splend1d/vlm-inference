            "content": "To determine the dimensions of \\( u \\) in the matrix notation for the classical linear regression model \\( y = X \\beta + u \\), we need to understand the structure of the model.\n\n1. **Matrix \\( X \\)**: This is the design matrix, which is a matrix of independent variables. It has dimensions \\( T \\times k \\), where \\( T \\) is the number of observations and \\( k \\) is the number of predictors.\n\n2. **Vector \\( \\beta \\)**: This is the vector of coefficients, which is a column vector. It has dimensions \\( k \\times 1 \\).\n\n3. **Vector \\( u \\)**: This represents the error term or the residuals. In the context of linear regression, \\( u \\) is assumed to be a vector of errors that are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a mean of zero.\n\nGiven these components, the equation \\( y = X \\beta + u \\) can be rewritten as:\n\\[ y = X \\beta + u \\]\n\nHere, \\( y \\) is a vector of length \\( T \\), \\( X \\) is a matrix of dimensions \\( T \\times k \\), \\( \\beta \\) is a vector of length \\( k \\), and \\( u \\) is a vector of length \\( T \\).\n\nThus, the dimensions of \\( u \\) are \\( T \\times 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB.
