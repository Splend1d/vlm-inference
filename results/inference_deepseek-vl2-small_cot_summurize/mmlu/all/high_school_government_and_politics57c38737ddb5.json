Deploying troops: The President has the authority to deploy troops, but this power is not shared with the Senate. The President can deploy troops without the need for Senate approval, as this is a military decision.\n\nB. Drafting appropriations bills: The President can propose budgetary measures, but the actual drafting of appropriations bills is a legislative function. The Senate drafts these bills, and the President can sign or veto them. Therefore, this power is shared with the Senate.\n\nC. Negotiating treaties: The President negotiates treaties with foreign nations, but these treaties must be ratified by the Senate. The President can send treaties to the Senate for ratification, but the Senate has the final say in the process. Thus, this power is shared with the Senate.\n\nD. Forcing Congress into session: The President cannot force Congress into session. The President can call special sessions, but Congress must agree to convene. Therefore, this power is not shared with the Senate.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the powers shared with the Senate are:\n\nB. Drafting appropriations bills\nC. Negotiating treaties",
