Oedema is characterized by an accumulation of fluid outside the blood vessels, not within them. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. Excessive extravascular fluid: Oedema is defined as the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces, which are the spaces between cells and tissues outside the blood vessels. This fluid is not contained within the blood vessels, making this option correct.\n\nC. Excessive intracranial fluid: Intracranial fluid refers to the fluid within the brain. Oedema is not specifically related to intracranial fluid; it is more about fluid accumulation in tissues outside the brain. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. Excessive necrotic cells: Necrotic cells refer to dead cells. Oedema is a condition related to fluid accumulation, not cell death. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is B. Excessive extravascular fluid.",
