The distance between the Earth and the Sun is approximately 1.5 x 10^11 meters.\n\nGiven that the distance between the Earth and Altair is one million times greater than the distance between the Earth and the Sun, we can calculate the distance to Altair as follows:\n\n1. Identify the distance between the Earth and the Sun: 1.5 x 10^11 meters.\n2. Calculate the distance between the Earth and Altair: 1.5 x 10^11 meters * 1,000,000 = 1.5 x 10^14 meters.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the Earth and Altair is 1.5 x 10^14 meters.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 1.5 x 10^14 meters.",
