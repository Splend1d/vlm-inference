Time dilation does not mean that time compresses with speed. Instead, it means that time appears to move slower for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\n\nB. **Stretches with speed.** This statement is correct. Time dilation is a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. According to this theory, time appears to move slower for an observer who is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to a stationary observer. This effect becomes more pronounced as the observer approaches the speed of light.\n\nC. **Is a constant at all speeds.** This statement is incorrect. Time is not a constant at all speeds. In fact, time is relative and depends on the observer's frame of reference. The constancy of time is a fundamental aspect of special relativity, but it does not mean that time is the same for all observers.\n\nD. **Is related to space.** This statement is partially correct but not entirely accurate. While time dilation is related to the concept of space (specifically, the concept of spacetime), it is not directly related to space itself. Instead, it is a consequence of the relative motion between observers in a spacetime framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. **Stretches with speed.** Time dilation is a fundamental concept in relativity that demonstrates how time is affected by relative motion, particularly at high speeds.",
