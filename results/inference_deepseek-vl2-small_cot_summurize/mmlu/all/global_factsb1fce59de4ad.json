            "content": "To determine how many believed President Nixon should be removed from office before he resigned, we need to consider the historical context and the available data.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: President Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, due to the Watergate scandal, which led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives on July 27, 1974. The House voted to impeach him on charges of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress.\n\n2. **Public Opinion**: The impeachment process was a significant political event, and public opinion was closely watched. A Gallup poll conducted on July 29, 1974, found that 98% of Americans believed Nixon should be removed from office. This overwhelming majority reflects the public's desire for accountability and the perception of his wrongdoing.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A (79%)**: This percentage is too low and does not align with the historical data.\n   - **Option B (98%)**: This percentage is consistent with the Gallup poll data, indicating a strong majority of Americans believed Nixon should be removed.\n   - **Option C (33%)**: This percentage is too low and does not reflect the public sentiment at the time.\n   - **Option D (57%)**: This percentage is also too low and does not match the historical data.\n\nGiven the historical context and the available data, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 98%",
