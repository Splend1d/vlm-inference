In climbing vines, the tendrils wrap around a trellis due to the physical contact with the structure, which is a classic example of thigmotropism.\n\nB. **Hydrotropism**: This is the growth response of a plant to water. While water is essential for plant growth, the twisting of tendrils around a trellis is not primarily driven by water availability.\n\nC. **Phototropism**: This is the growth response of a plant to light. Climbing vines do not grow towards light sources; instead, they grow towards support structures.\n\nD. **Geotropism**: This involves the growth response of a plant to gravity. While some plants exhibit geotropism, the twisting of tendrils around a trellis is not primarily due to gravitational pull.\n\nBy examining each option, we can conclude that the correct answer is **A. thigmotropism**, as the tendrils of climbing vines twist around a trellis due to physical contact, which is characteristic of thigmotropism.",
