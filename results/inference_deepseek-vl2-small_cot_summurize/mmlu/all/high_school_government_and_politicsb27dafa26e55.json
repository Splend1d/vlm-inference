Board of Education of Topeka, which was decided in 1954. This case was a pivotal moment in the history of the United States, as it declared that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The Court's decision was based on the principle that \"separate but equal\" educational facilities are inherently unequal, and therefore, the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" had no place in the field of education.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) - This case dealt with the right to counsel for indigent defendants in criminal cases, not with the issue of racial segregation in public schools.\n\nB. Marbury v. Madison (1803) - This case established the principle of judicial review, which allows the Supreme Court to declare laws and government actions unconstitutional. It did not address the issue of racial segregation in public schools.\n\nC. Engel v. Vitale (1962) - This case dealt with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from promoting or favoring one religion over another. It did not address the issue of racial segregation in public schools.",
