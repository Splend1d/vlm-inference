            "content": "To determine which normal modes of a carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) molecule are infrared-active, we need to understand what infrared activity means. Infrared activity refers to the ability of a vibrational mode to absorb infrared radiation, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than visible light.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. **Bending**: This refers to the bending mode of a molecule, where the bond angles change. In CO\u2082, the bending mode involves the change in the angle between the carbon-oxygen bonds. This mode is not infrared-active because it does not involve a change in the dipole moment of the molecule.\n\nII. **Symmetric stretching**: This mode involves the stretching of the O=C=O bond in a symmetric manner. During this mode, the dipole moment of the molecule changes, which is necessary for infrared activity. Therefore, this mode is infrared-active.\n\nIII. **Asymmetric stretching**: This mode involves the stretching of the O=C=O bond in an asymmetric manner. Similar to symmetric stretching, this mode also involves a change in the dipole moment, making it infrared-active.\n\nBased on this analysis, the normal modes of CO\u2082 that are infrared-active are the symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching modes. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. III only",
