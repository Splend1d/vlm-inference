            "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the process of nuclear fission. In fission, a heavy nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, along with the release of a significant amount of energy. This process is the opposite of fusion, where two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus.\n\n1. **Mass and Energy Relationship**: According to Einstein's famous equation, \\(E=mc^2\\), mass and energy are interchangeable. In nuclear reactions, a small amount of mass is converted into a large amount of energy.\n\n2. **Mass Loss in Fission**: During fission, the mass of the original nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the masses of the two resulting nuclei. This difference in mass is converted into energy, as described by the equation \\(E = \\Delta mc^2\\), where \\(\\Delta m\\) is the mass defect.\n\n3. **Mass per Nucleon**: The mass per nucleon is the mass of the nucleus divided by the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons). In the case of fission, the mass per nucleon of the resulting fragments is less than the original nucleus because the mass defect is distributed over the two smaller nuclei.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the mass defect is distributed over the two resulting fragments, the mass per nucleon of the fission fragments is less than that of the original nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. more mass per nucleon",
