            "content": "To determine which child is most likely to attach to a male psychologist, we need to consider the principles of attachment theory. Attachment theory suggests that infants form attachments based on the quality of caregiving and the consistency of the caregiver's presence.\n\n- **Option A**: A two-month-old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment is likely to form a secure attachment with her primary caregiver, who is usually a female. This is because infants tend to form attachments with caregivers who are present and responsive to their needs.\n\n- **Option B**: A five-month-old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment is also likely to form a secure attachment with his primary caregiver, who is usually a female. The stability and safety of the environment are crucial for attachment formation.\n\n- **Option C**: An eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child is likely to experience insecure attachment. The lack of consistent and responsive caregiving can lead to difficulties in forming secure attachments.\n\n- **Option D**: A thirteen-month-old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child is likely to experience insecure attachment. The inconsistent caregiving and occasional neglect can disrupt the child's ability to form secure attachments.\n\nConsidering these points, the child most likely to form an attachment with a male psychologist is the one who is most likely to experience insecure attachment due to inconsistent caregiving. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. An eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglect the child.",
