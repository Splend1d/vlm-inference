This means that the system continuously monitors its output and adjusts the input to maintain the desired output. This feedback mechanism allows the system to correct any deviations from the desired output, making it a closed loop system.\n\nAn open loop control system, on the other hand, does not have a feedback mechanism. The input quantity is determined by the system's design and does not change based on the output. This means that the system cannot correct any deviations from the desired output, and it is not a closed loop system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. closed loop control system.",
