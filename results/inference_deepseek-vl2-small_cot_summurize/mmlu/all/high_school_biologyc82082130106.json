            "content": "To determine which ratio remains constant in DNA, we need to understand the structure and composition of DNA. DNA is composed of nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).\n\n1. **Cytosine : Adenine (C:A)**: In DNA, the ratio of cytosine to adenine is not constant. This is because the DNA double helix is structured such that adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine. Therefore, the C:A ratio varies depending on the specific sequence of bases.\n\n2. **Pyrimidine : Purine**: This ratio is also not constant. DNA contains pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine) and purines (adenine and guanine). The ratio of pyrimidines to purines is 1:1, but this is a general rule for the entire DNA molecule, not a specific ratio within a single base pair.\n\n3. **Adenine : Guanine (A:G)**: The ratio of adenine to guanine is constant in DNA. This is because adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine. Therefore, the A:G ratio is consistent throughout the DNA molecule.\n\n4. **Guanine : Deoxyribose**: This ratio is not constant. The ratio of guanine to deoxyribose is 1:1, but this is a general property of the DNA molecule, not a specific ratio within a single base pair.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the ratio that remains constant in DNA is **Adenine : Guanine (A:G)**. This is because the pairing of adenine with thymine and guanine with cytosine is consistent throughout the DNA molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Adenine : Guanine**.",
