            "content": "To determine the correct statement, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The question describes a scenario where finches on the island of Daphne Major experienced a prolonged drought. This environmental change would likely exert selective pressure on the finches, favoring individuals with traits that are advantageous in this new condition.\n\n2. **Evolutionary Adaptation**: In evolutionary biology, natural selection acts on traits that enhance survival and reproduction. In the context of a drought, a deeper, stronger beak would be advantageous because it allows the bird to access food sources that are otherwise unavailable.\n\n3. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **Option A**: This suggests that each bird evolved a deeper, stronger beak. While this is plausible, it implies a change in the genetic makeup of the population, which is not directly supported by the information given.\n   - **Option B**: This suggests that each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted. This aligns with the concept of natural selection, where environmental pressures lead to changes in traits over generations.\n   - **Option C**: This suggests that each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak. While this is true, it does not directly address the evolutionary process.\n   - **Option D**: This suggests that birds with deeper, stronger beaks produced more offspring. This is a consequence of natural selection, but it does not describe the process itself.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The most accurate statement is **Option B**, which describes the process of natural selection where environmental pressures (prolonged drought) lead to the development of traits (deeper, stronger beaks) that enhance survival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.**",
