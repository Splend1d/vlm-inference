We can start by squaring \\( \\sqrt{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 2 \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), we need to try a larger power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Let's try \\( (\\sqrt{2})^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^3 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\) is not in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), so we need to try an even larger power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Let's try \\( (\\sqrt{2})^4 \\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^4 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 4 \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), we need to try an even larger power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Let's try \\( (\\sqrt{2})^5 \\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^5 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^4 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 4 = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( 4\\sqrt{2} \\) is not in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), so we need to try an even larger power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Let's try \\( (\\sqrt{2})^6 \\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^6 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 8 \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), we need to try an even larger power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).

Let's try \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 \\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 16\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 16 \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), we need to try an even larger power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Let's try \\( (\\sqrt{2})^9 \\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^9 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^8 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 16 = 16\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( 16\\sqrt{2} \\) is not in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), so we need to try an even larger power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Let's try \\( (\\sqrt{2})^{10} \\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^{10} = (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 32\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 32 \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), we need to try an even larger power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).
