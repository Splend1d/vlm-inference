It was a significant language in the ancient world, used in religious texts and literature. Therefore, Sanskrit records are a historical method of language spread.\n\nB. **Migration**: Language spread often occurs through migration, where people move from one region to another. This can lead to the spread of languages as people communicate and share their languages with new populations. Thus, migration is a historical method of language spread.\n\nC. **Trade**: Trade routes historically facilitated the spread of languages. Merchants, traders, and travelers moved goods and ideas, often carrying their languages with them. This is a well-documented method of language diffusion.\n\nD. **Conquest**: Conquest involves the military subjugation of one group by another, often leading to the imposition of the conqueror's language on the conquered people. While conquest can lead to language spread, it is not a natural or historical method of language diffusion. It is more of a forceful imposition rather than a natural spread.\n\nBased on this analysis, the method that was not historically used by the world's major languages to spread is:\n\nD. Conquest.",
