Heterotrophs break down complex organic compounds into simpler ones, releasing energy that is then used to fuel cellular processes.\n\nC. **Makes organic molecules from CO2**: This describes a process typical of autotrophs, such as plants and some bacteria, which use carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce organic molecules through photosynthesis.\n\nD. **Obtains its energy by consuming exclusively autotrophs**: This describes a process typical of heterotrophs, which consume other organisms to obtain energy. Heterotrophs break down the organic molecules of their prey to obtain energy.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. **Obtains its energy by oxidizing organic molecules**\n\nThis option accurately describes the energy acquisition process of heterotrophs.",
