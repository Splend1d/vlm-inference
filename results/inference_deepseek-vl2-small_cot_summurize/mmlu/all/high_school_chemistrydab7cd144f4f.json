            "content": "Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The reaction with the greatest decrease in entropy is the one that results in the most ordered product.\n\nA. HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \u2192 NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThis reaction involves the formation of a solid (NaCl) and a liquid (H2O) from a strong acid and a strong base. The entropy of the reactants is higher than that of the products, so the entropy decreases.\n\nB. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\nThis reaction involves the formation of a solid (CO2) and a liquid (H2O) from a gas. The entropy of the reactants is higher than that of the products, so the entropy decreases.\n\nC. C(s) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g)\nThis reaction involves the formation of a solid (CO2) from a solid (C) and a gas (O2). The entropy of the reactants is higher than that of the products, so the entropy decreases.\n\nD. 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) \u2192 2 SO3(g)\nThis reaction involves the formation of a solid (SO3) from a gas (SO2). The entropy of the reactants is higher than that of the products, so the entropy decreases.\n\nAll of the reactions result in a decrease in entropy, but the reaction with the greatest decrease in entropy is the one that involves the formation of a solid from a gas. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nC. C(s) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g)",
