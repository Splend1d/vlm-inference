The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothing and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen into lint; the aged shall betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic. \u2026\nThe Committee of Public Safety is charged to take all necessary measures to set up without delay an extraordinary manufacture of arms of every sort which corresponds with the ardor and energy of the French people. It is, accordingly, authorized to form all the establishments, factories, workshops, and mills which shall be deemed necessary for the carrying on of these works, as well as to put in requisition, within the entire extent of the Republic, the artists and workingmen who can contribute to their success.\nThe representatives of the people sent out for the execution of the present law shall have the same authority in their respective districts, acting in concert with the Committee of Public Safety; they are invested with the unlimited powers assigned to the representatives of the people to the armies.\nThe Lev\u00e9e en Masse, August 23, 1793\nThis passage established\n\nA. the French Republic\nB. the Committee of Public Safety\nC. war against the Coalition\nD. mass conscription\n",

This is a clear indication of mass conscription, where all able-bodied men are required to serve in the army.\n\nOption A, the French Republic, is not correct because the passage does not establish the French Republic. It only describes the actions of the French people in response to the war effort.\n\nOption B, the Committee of Public Safety, is not correct because the passage does not establish the Committee of Public Safety. It only describes the actions of the Committee of Public Safety in response to the war effort.\n\nOption C, war against the Coalition, is not correct because the passage does not describe a war against the Coalition. It only describes the actions of the French people in response to the war effort.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. mass conscription.",
