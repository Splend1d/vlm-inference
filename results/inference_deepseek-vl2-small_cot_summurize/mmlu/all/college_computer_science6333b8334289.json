Consider the product of three matrices N_1N_2N_3 that have, respectively, w rows and x columns, x rows and y columns, and y rows and z columns. Under what condition will it take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 (i.e., multiply the first two matrices first) than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3)?\n\nA. There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time.\nB. 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y\nC. x > y\nD. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\n",

This takes time proportional to \\(w \\times x\\).\n   - Then, compute N_1N_2N_3. This takes time proportional to \\(w \\times y \\times z\\).\n   - The total time is \\(w \\times x + w \\times y \\times z = w(x + yz)\\).\n\n2. **Computing N_1(N_2 N_3):**\n   - Compute N_2N_3. This takes time proportional to \\(x \\times y\\).\n   - Then, compute N_1N_2N_3. This takes time proportional to \\(w \\times y \\times z\\).\n   - The total time is \\(w \\times y + w \\times y \\times z = w(y + yz)\\).\n\nTo find the condition under which the first method is faster, we need to compare the two expressions:\n\n- \\(w(x + yz)\\)\n- \\(w(y + yz)\\)\n\nWe can factor out \\(w\\) and \\(yz\\):\n\n- \\(w(x + yz) = w(yz) + w(x)\\)\n- \\(w(y + yz) = w(yz) + w(y)\\)\n\nFor the first method to be faster, we need:\n\n\\[ w(yz) + w(x) < w(yz) + w(y) \\]\n\nSubtract \\(w(yz)\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ w(x) < w(y) \\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[ x < y \\]\n\nThus, the condition under which it will take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 is when \\(x < y\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(x > y\\)",
