Examples include poverty, lack of employment, political instability, or natural disasters. Push factors are not related to the tendency for migration to decrease with distance.\n\nB. **Pull factors**: These are conditions that attract people to move to a particular destination. Examples include better job opportunities, higher wages, improved living standards, or a more stable political environment. Pull factors are not related to the tendency for migration to decrease with distance.\n\nC. **Distance decay**: This refers to the phenomenon where the likelihood of migration decreases as the distance from the origin increases. This is due to various factors such as increased travel costs, communication barriers, and the difficulty of maintaining relationships over long distances. Distance decay is the correct answer.\n\nD. **Migration selectivity**: This term is not commonly used in the context of migration studies. It might refer to the selective nature of migration, but it does not specifically describe the tendency for migration to decrease with distance.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the tendency for migration to decrease with distance is best described by:\n\nC. Distance decay.",
