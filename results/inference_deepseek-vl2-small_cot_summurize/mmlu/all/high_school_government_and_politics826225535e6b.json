            "content": "The exclusionary rule was established to limit the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence. This rule is a fundamental principle in the United States legal system, designed to prevent the use of evidence that has been obtained in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights. By excluding such evidence from being used in court, the rule aims to uphold the integrity of the legal process and ensure that justice is served fairly.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Create \"separate but equal\" facilities to facilitate racial segregation - This option is incorrect. The exclusionary rule is not related to racial segregation. It is a legal principle that applies to the use of evidence in criminal cases, not to the separation of facilities based on race.\n\nB. Allow private organizations to restrict their memberships - This option is incorrect. The exclusionary rule is a legal principle that applies to the government, not private organizations. It is not related to membership restrictions in private organizations.\n\nC. Limit the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence - This option is correct. The exclusionary rule is designed to prevent the use of evidence that has been obtained in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights. By excluding such evidence from being used in court, the rule aims to uphold the integrity of the legal process and ensure that justice is served fairly.\n\nD. Deny control of interstate commerce to the states - This option is incorrect. The exclusionary rule is a legal principle that applies to the use of evidence in criminal cases, not to the control of interstate commerce. It is not related to the power of states to regulate commerce between states.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The exclusionary rule was established to limit the government's ability to use illegally obtained evidence.",
