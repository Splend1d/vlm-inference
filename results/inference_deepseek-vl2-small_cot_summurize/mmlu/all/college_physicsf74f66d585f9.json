            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the temperature of a blackbody and the energy it radiates. The energy radiated per second per unit area of a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature (T):\n\n\\[ P = \\sigma T^4 \\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) is the power radiated per unit area, \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\\(5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{W/m}^2\\text{K}^4\\)), and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the absolute temperature of the blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the new temperature \\( T' \\) is:\n\n\\[ T' = 3T \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we get:\n\n\\[ P' = \\sigma (3T)^4 = \\sigma (81T^4) \\]\n\n\\[ P' = 81 \\sigma T^4 \\]\n\nComparing this to the original power \\( P \\), we see that the new power \\( P' \\) is:\n\n\\[ P' = 81P \\]\n\nThis means that the energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Increases by a factor of 81.",
