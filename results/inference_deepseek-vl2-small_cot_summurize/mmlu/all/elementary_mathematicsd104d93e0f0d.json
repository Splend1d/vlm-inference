            "content": "To write 8 and 2 over 4 as an improper fraction in simplest form, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:**\n   - The mixed number is 8 and 2 over 4.\n   - To convert this to an improper fraction, multiply the whole number part by the denominator and add the numerator.\n   - Whole number part: 8\n   - Denominator: 4\n   - Multiply 8 by 4: \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n   - Add the numerator: \\( 32 + 2 = 34 \\)\n\n2. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - The fraction is 34 over 4.\n   - To simplify, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 34 and 4.\n   - The GCD of 34 and 4 is 2.\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n     - Numerator: \\( 34 \\div 2 = 17 \\)\n     - Denominator: \\( 4 \\div 2 = 2 \\)\n\n3. **Write the simplified fraction:**\n   - The simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{17}{2} \\).\n\nNow, let's match this with the given options:\n\nA. 17 over 2\nB. 34 over 4\nC. 17 over 4\nD. 19 over 2\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 17 over 2\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
