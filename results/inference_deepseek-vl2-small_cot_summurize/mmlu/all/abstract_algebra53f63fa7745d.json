This is not necessarily true because \\( aH \\) and \\( Ha \\) are not necessarily equal.\n- For example, consider the group \\( G = \\mathbb{Z} \\) (the integers under addition) and \\( H = \\{2\\} \\) (the subgroup of even integers). If \\( a = 1 \\), then \\( aH = \\{2\\} \\) and \\( Ha = \\{1\\} \\), which are not equal.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( H \\) is normal of \\( G \\) and \\( a \\) belongs to \\( G \\), then \\( ah = ha \\) for all \\( h \\in H \\).\n\n- A subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) is normal if for all \\( h \\in H \\) and \\( g \\in G \\), the equation \\( g h g^{-1} = h \\) holds.\n- The statement claims that \\( ah = ha \\) for all \\( h \\in H \\). This is not necessarily true because \\( ah = ha \\) only if \\( a \\) is in \\( H \\).\n- For example, consider the group \\( G = \\mathbb{Z} \\) (the integers under addition) and \\( H = \\{0\\} \\) (the trivial subgroup). If \\( a = 1 \\), then \\( ah = h \\) and \\( ha = h \\), but if \\( a = 2 \\), then \\( ah = 2h \\) and \\( ha = 2h \\), which are not equal.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSince both statements are false, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
