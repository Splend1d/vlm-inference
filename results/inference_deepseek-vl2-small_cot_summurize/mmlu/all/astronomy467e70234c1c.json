These ices are volatile compounds that sublimate (change directly from a solid to a gas) into an atmosphere near perihelion, the point in Pluto's orbit closest to the Sun. This process is responsible for the relatively warm conditions on Pluto's surface during perihelion, despite its overall cold temperature.",
