            "content": "To determine the effects of a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve, we need to understand the basic principles of supply and demand. The aggregate supply curve represents the total quantity of goods and services that firms in an economy are willing and able to produce at different price levels.\n\n1. **Understanding the Shift**: A leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve indicates a decrease in the total quantity of goods and services that firms are willing to produce at each price level. This could be due to factors such as increased production costs, reduced technological advancements, or decreased labor supply.\n\n2. **Impact on Equilibrium Price Level**: With a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve, the supply of goods and services decreases at every price level. According to the law of supply and demand, when supply decreases and demand remains constant, the equilibrium price level will increase. This is because the reduced supply leads to higher prices as consumers compete for the limited goods available.\n\n3. **Impact on Equilibrium Quantity of Output**: The equilibrium quantity of output is the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing to produce at the new equilibrium price level. With a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve, the quantity of output decreases because firms are producing less at each price level.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.",
