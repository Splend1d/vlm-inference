This can result in delays and conflicts, particularly when the parties have significant differences in their priorities and policies.\n\nA. reapportionment of voting districts: This is a process that occurs every 10 years after the census and is not directly related to a divided government.\n\nB. amendments to the Constitution: While a divided government can lead to political gridlock, it does not directly result in amendments to the Constitution. Amendments require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, or a national convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nC. conflict between states and the federal government: This is a more general issue that can arise in any political system, not just a divided government.\n\nD. delays in the confirmation of those nominated to be ambassadors: This is a specific issue that can arise in a divided government, as the Senate may delay or block the confirmation of nominees if they are not supported by the majority party.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nD. delays in the confirmation of those nominated to be ambassadors",
