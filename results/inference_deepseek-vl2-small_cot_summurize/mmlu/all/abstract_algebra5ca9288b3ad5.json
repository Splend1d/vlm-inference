            "content": "To find the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x 3Z, we need to determine the smallest positive integer n such that n * a = 0 for all a in the ring.\n\nThe ring Z_3 x 3Z consists of ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of Z_3 and b is an element of 3Z. The operations in this ring are addition and multiplication modulo 3.\n\nLet's consider the elements of Z_3 x 3Z:\n\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (0, 1)\n3. (0, 2)\n4. (1, 0)\n5. (1, 1)\n6. (1, 2)\n7. (2, 0)\n8. (2, 1)\n9. (2, 2)\n\nNow, let's find the product of each element with itself:\n\n1. (0, 0) * (0, 0) = (0 * 0 + 0 * 1) mod 3 = 0\n2. (0, 0) * (0, 1) = (0 * 0 + 0 * 2) mod 3 = 0\n3. (0, 0) * (0, 2) = (0 * 0 + 0 * 1) mod 3 = 0\n4. (1, 0) * (1, 0) = (1 * 1 + 0 * 2) mod 3 = 1\n5. (1, 0) * (1, 1) = (1 * 1 + 0 * 2) mod 3 = 1\n6. (1, 0) * (1, 2) = (1 * 1 + 0 * 2) mod 3 = 1\n7. (2, 0) * (2, 0) = (2 * 2 + 0 * 1) mod 3 = 4 mod 3 = 1\n8. (2, 0) * (2, 1) = (2 * 2 + 0 * 2) mod 3 = 4 mod 3 = 1\n9. (2, 0) * (2, 2) = (2 * 2 + 0 * 1) mod 3 = 4 mod 3 = 1\n\nWe can see that the product of any element with itself is 0, except for the elements (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2), which have a product of 1.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x 3Z is 12, as there are 12 elements in the ring, and 12 is the smallest positive integer n such that n * a = 0 for all a in the ring.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 12.",
