            "content": "To determine which statement is true, we need to understand the properties of bosons and fermions.\n\n1. **Bosons**: Bosons are particles that follow Bose-Einstein statistics. They have wave functions that are symmetric under the exchange of any two particles. This means that if you swap two bosons, the wave function remains unchanged. Bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and is crucial for distinguishing between fermions and bosons.\n\n2. **Fermions**: Fermions follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. Their wave functions are antisymmetric under the exchange of any two particles. This means that if you swap two fermions, the wave function changes sign. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which is why they cannot occupy the same quantum state.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Bosons have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Bosons have symmetric wave functions, but they do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nB. **Bosons have antisymmetric wave functions and do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.**\n   - This statement is correct. Bosons have antisymmetric wave functions and do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nC. **Fermions have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions, not symmetric, and they do obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nD. **Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.**\n   - This statement is correct. Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and do obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are B and D.",
