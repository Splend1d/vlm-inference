            "content": "To determine which statement about meiosis is NOT true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Meiosis produces two haploid gametes.\n- Meiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in the production of four haploid cells. Each of these cells contains one set of chromosomes, which is the definition of haploid. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. Homologous chromosomes join during synapsis.\n- During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through a process called crossing-over. This pairing and exchange occur during synapsis, which is the initial stage of prophase I in meiosis. Thus, this statement is true.\n\nC. Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I.\n- In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated, not sister chromatids. Sister chromatids are the identical copies of a single chromosome that are connected by a centromere. During meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes are separated into two different cells, each with a complete set of chromosomes. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. Crossing-over increases genetic variation in gametes.\n- Crossing-over is a process that occurs during prophase I of meiosis, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material. This exchange results in new combinations of alleles, thereby increasing genetic variation in the resulting gametes. This statement is true.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\nC. Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I.",
