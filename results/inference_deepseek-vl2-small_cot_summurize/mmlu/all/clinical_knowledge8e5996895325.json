They may have difficulty reading the screen.\n- This option suggests that older adults might struggle with reading text on a screen. While this is a valid concern, it is not the primary reason to avoid internet-based information sources for this age group. Many older adults are quite adept at using technology and can read screens well.\n\nB. Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet.\n- This option highlights a significant barrier to internet access among older adults. However, it does not directly address the need for internet-based information sources. Even if access is limited, providing internet-based information can still be beneficial if the content is accessible and relevant.\n\nC. The internet is aimed at younger people.\n- This option suggests that the internet is designed with younger users in mind, which might not be user-friendly for older adults. While it is true that the internet has evolved with younger demographics in mind, this does not mean that older adults cannot benefit from internet-based information. Many websites and platforms are designed to be accessible and user-friendly for all age groups.\n\nD. They may not be able to type.\n- This option directly addresses a common barrier to internet access for older adults. Typing can be challenging for some older individuals, especially those with physical limitations or cognitive decline. Providing internet-based information sources that do not require typing, such as voice-activated search or text-to-speech options, can help overcome this barrier.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most compelling reason to provide internet-based information sources to people aged over 65 is:\n\nD. They may not be able to type.\n\nThis option highlights a practical challenge that can be addressed through the use of technology designed to be accessible to all age groups.",
