This implies that \\(\\phi\\) is injective because it maps every element in \\(G\\) to the identity in \\(H\\).\n- Conversely, if \\(\\phi\\) is injective, then \\(\\ker(\\phi)\\) must consist of the identity element alone, because any non-identity element in \\(G\\) would map to a non-identity element in \\(H\\), contradicting injectivity.\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.**\n\n- The image of a group under a homomorphism is the set of all images of the elements of the group.\n- If a group has 6 elements, the image of this group under any homomorphism will have at most 6 elements, because each element of the group can map to at most one element in the image.\n- Therefore, it is not possible for the image to have 4 elements.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",
