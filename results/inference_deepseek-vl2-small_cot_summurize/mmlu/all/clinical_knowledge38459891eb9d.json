            "content": "To determine which substance in saliva has an antibacterial action, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Lysozyme**: Lysozyme is an enzyme found in saliva, tears, and mucus. It is known for its antibacterial properties, as it can break down the cell walls of bacteria, leading to their destruction. This makes lysozyme effective in preventing infections.\n\nB. **Amylase**: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into simpler sugars. It is not known for its antibacterial properties; rather, it is involved in digestion.\n\nC. **Sodium chloride**: Also known as table salt, sodium chloride is a neutral salt that helps maintain fluid balance and is not known for its antibacterial action.\n\nD. **Mucus**: Mucus is a thick, sticky fluid produced by the mucous membranes in the body. While it helps trap dust and microorganisms, it does not have antibacterial properties.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Lysozyme.\n\nLysozyme is the substance in saliva that has an antibacterial action, making it an important component in the body's defense against bacterial infections.",
