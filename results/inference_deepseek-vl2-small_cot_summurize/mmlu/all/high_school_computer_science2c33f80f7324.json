Copying code from the online source into the programmer's product without any other actions: This option does not comply with the CC BY license, as it does not involve any acknowledgment of the original author.\n\nB. Copying code from the online source into the programmer's product and limiting the copied code to ten code lines: This option is not compliant with the CC BY license because it restricts the use of the code, which is not allowed under the license.\n\nC. Copying code from the online source into the programmer's product and changing all variable names: This option is not compliant with the CC BY license because it involves altering the original code, which is not allowed under the license.\n\nD. Copying code from the online source into the programmer's product and crediting the original author in the manner indicated by the license: This option is compliant with the CC BY license because it involves using the code and giving appropriate credit to the original author.\n\nTherefore, the best description of an acceptable use of the code under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license is option D.",
