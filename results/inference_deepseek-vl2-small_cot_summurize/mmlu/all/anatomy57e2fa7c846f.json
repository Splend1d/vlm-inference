It stores urine produced by the kidneys until it is excreted from the body. The bladder can expand to accommodate varying amounts of urine, making it the primary storage organ for urine.\n\nB. Kidney: The kidneys are responsible for filtering blood to produce urine. They do not store urine; instead, they filter and excrete it into the ureters.\n\nC. Ureter: The ureters are two tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder. They do not collect urine; their function is to convey urine to the bladder.\n\nD. Urethra: The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. It does not collect urine; its role is to expel urine.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Bladder. The bladder is the organ that collects urine in the body.",
