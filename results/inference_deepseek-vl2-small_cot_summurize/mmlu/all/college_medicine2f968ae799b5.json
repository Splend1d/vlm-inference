In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U), which pairs with adenine.\n\n2. **Adenine (A)**: Adenine is a nucleotide base found in both DNA and RNA. It pairs with thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA.\n\n3. **Uracil (U)**: Uracil is a nucleotide base found in RNA. It pairs with adenine in RNA, replacing thymine, which is found in DNA.\n\n4. **Guanine (G)**: Guanine is a nucleotide base found in both DNA and RNA. It pairs with cytosine (C) in DNA and with uracil (U) in RNA.\n\nGiven this information, the base that is not found in RNA is:\n\nA. Thymine\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Thymine.",
