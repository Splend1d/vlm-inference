            "content": "To determine the correct term that describes the gradual increase in size of horses over geologic time, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. **Artificial selection**: This refers to the process by which humans selectively breed organisms for desired traits. It is not applicable here, as horses have evolved naturally over millions of years, not through human intervention.\n\nB. **Directional selection**: This type of selection occurs when a population is exposed to a change in the environment that favors one extreme of a trait distribution. In the case of horses, the gradual increase in size could be due to environmental pressures favoring larger individuals, such as increased availability of food or reduced predation. This is a plausible explanation for the observed trend.\n\nC. **Stabilizing selection**: This occurs when a population is exposed to a change in the environment that favors the average or middle individuals, reducing the frequency of extreme traits. This does not fit the scenario of horses gradually increasing in size.\n\nD. **Disruptive selection**: This type of selection favors individuals at both extremes of a trait distribution, leading to the creation of two distinct groups. While disruptive selection can lead to the development of new traits, it does not explain the gradual increase in size of horses.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the term that best describes the gradual increase in size of horses over geologic time is **B. directional selection**. This is because the increase in size could be a result of environmental pressures favoring larger individuals, leading to a shift in the population's trait distribution.",
