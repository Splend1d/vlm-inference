            "content": "To determine the best evidence for the age of rocks on the Moon compared to those on Earth, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. Lunar rocks are composed of fragments pulverized by many impacts.\n- This statement is true, but it does not directly provide evidence of the age of the rocks. The impact-related pulverization could be a result of the Moon's history, but it does not indicate the age of the rocks themselves.\n\nB. Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.\n- This option is correct. Radioactive dating is a method used to determine the age of rocks by measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes. By dating lunar samples, scientists have found that the Moon's rocks are older than those on Earth. This method provides a direct and reliable way to establish the age of lunar rocks.\n\nC. The Moon's surface is more heavily eroded than the Earth's surface.\n- This statement is misleading. The Moon's surface is not more heavily eroded than Earth's. In fact, the Moon has a much more heavily cratered surface compared to Earth, which is why it is often referred to as the \"lunar regolith.\" This does not provide evidence of the age of the rocks.\n\nD. The Moon's surface has more impact craters than the Earth's surface.\n- This statement is true, but it does not provide evidence of the age of the rocks. The number of craters is a result of the Moon's history and does not directly indicate the age of the rocks.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the best evidence for the age of rocks on the Moon being older than those on Earth is:\n\nB. Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.",
