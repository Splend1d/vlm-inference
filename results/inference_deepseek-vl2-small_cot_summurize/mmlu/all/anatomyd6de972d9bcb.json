Alveoli: Alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs. They are surrounded by a network of capillaries, which facilitates the diffusion of gases. This is the primary site for gas exchange in the lungs.\n\nB. Bronchi: Bronchi are the main air passages that branch off from the trachea and lead into the lungs. They are responsible for conducting air to the alveoli but do not participate in gas exchange.\n\nC. Bronchioles: Bronchioles are smaller air passages that branch off from the bronchi and lead into the alveoli. Like bronchi, they do not participate in gas exchange.\n\nD. Capillaries: Capillaries are small blood vessels that surround the alveoli. They are involved in the exchange of gases, but they themselves do not allow gas exchange.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Alveoli\n\nAlveoli are the structures in the lungs where gas exchange occurs, making them the correct choice for allowing gas exchange in the lungs.",
