The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did include enforcement provisions, such as the requirement for the Attorney General to file lawsuits against discriminatory practices. This means that the Act did have an impact on school desegregation, contrary to this statement.\n\nB. The Act did overturn the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson, which had been used to justify segregation. However, the Act did not immediately end segregation in public schools. It required further action and enforcement to achieve desegregation.\n\nC. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did indeed include provisions that allowed the federal government to cut off federal funds to school systems that did not comply with desegregation orders. This was a significant factor in accelerating school desegregation efforts in the South.\n\nD. While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized the use of federal troops to enforce desegregation in some cases, it did not send troops to every segregated public school in the South. This option is not accurate.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the most accurate statement is:\n\nC. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 hastened school desegregation by cutting off federal funds to discriminatory school systems.",
