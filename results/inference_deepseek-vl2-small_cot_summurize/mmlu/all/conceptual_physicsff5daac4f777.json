            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the force applied and the distance the crate rises. The ideal pulley system allows us to halve the force needed to lift the crate, but it does not change the distance the crate rises.\n\nGiven:\n- Force applied (F) = 25 N\n- Weight of the crate (W) = 100 N\n\nThe ideal pulley system reduces the force needed to lift the crate by half, so the force required to lift the crate is:\n\\[ F_{\\text{effective}} = \\frac{W}{2} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{N}}{2} = 50 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nHowever, the question states that the crate rises by 25 N of force, which is the weight of the crate. This is a misunderstanding of the pulley system's effect. The pulley system does not change the distance the crate rises; it only reduces the force needed to lift it.\n\nThe distance the crate rises is determined by the weight of the crate and the force applied, not by the force of the pulley system. Therefore, the crate rises by the same distance it would if no pulley system were used, which is the weight of the crate divided by the force applied:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\frac{W}{F} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{N}}{25 \\, \\text{N}} = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the distance the crate rises for every 1-m length of rope pulled down. Since the pulley system does not change the distance the crate rises, the crate rises by 4 meters for every 1 meter of rope pulled down.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nBut since the question asks for the distance the crate rises for every 1-m length of rope pulled down, and the crate rises by 4 meters for every 1 meter of rope pulled down, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nHowever, the question does not provide an option for 4 meters, so the closest option is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 50 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 50 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\text{C} \\]",
