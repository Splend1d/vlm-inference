            "content": "To determine which characteristic is predicted for an early-successional plant community, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. High niche divergence among co-occurring species: In early-successional plant communities, species often have similar ecological niches because they are competing for the same resources. This is because these communities are in the initial stages of succession, and species have not yet diversified their ecological roles. Therefore, high niche divergence is not a characteristic of early-successional communities.\n\nB. High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass: In early-successional plant communities, the primary production is typically high relative to the biomass of the standing crop. This is because the plants are in the early stages of growth, and the biomass is primarily composed of young, rapidly growing shoots. As the community matures, the standing crop biomass increases, and the ratio of primary production to standing-crop biomass decreases.\n\nC. High frequency of K-selected species: K-selected species are those that produce a large number of offspring but invest a lot of energy in each individual, resulting in a low growth rate. These species are more common in stable, mature ecosystems. Early-successional communities are characterized by rapid growth and high mortality rates, which favor r-selected species that produce fewer offspring but invest less energy in each individual, resulting in a higher growth rate.\n\nD. High detrital biomass: Detrital biomass refers to the organic matter that accumulates on the forest floor. In early-successional plant communities, detrital biomass is typically low because the plants are in the initial stages of growth, and there is not yet a significant accumulation of dead plant material.\n\nBased on this analysis, the characteristic that is predicted for an early-successional plant community is:\n\nB. High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass.",
