House members may serve on only one committee at a time\n- This statement is incorrect. House members can serve on multiple committees simultaneously. This is a common practice, allowing them to have a broader understanding of various legislative issues.\n\nB. Senate committees have relatively little power to alter legislation\n- This statement is incorrect. Senate committees do have significant power to alter legislation. They can hold hearings, mark up bills, and influence the legislative process.\n\nC. Bills in the Senate must pass through all committees before reaching the floor\n- This statement is incorrect. In the Senate, bills do not need to pass through all committees. They can be brought directly to the floor for debate and voting.\n\nD. The rules make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor\n- This statement is correct. In the House, members are assigned to committees where they can influence the legislative process. However, once a bill is on the House floor, members have limited opportunities to influence it. They can only debate and vote on the bill, whereas senators can filibuster and offer amendments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The rules make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor.",
