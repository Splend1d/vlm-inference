The proposition is:\n\n\\[\n(\u2203x)[Hx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Ay \u2283 Bxy)]\n\\]\n\nThis can be translated into English as:\n\n\"There exists an apartment \\( x \\) such that every house \\( y \\) is bigger than \\( x \\).\"\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Some houses are smaller than all apartments.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The proposition states that every house is bigger than every apartment, not that some houses are smaller than all apartments.\n\nB. Every house is bigger than every apartment.\n- This statement is true according to the proposition. It states that for every house \\( y \\), there exists an apartment \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\) is bigger than \\( y \\).\n\nC. Some apartment is smaller than every house.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The proposition states that every house is bigger than every apartment, not that some apartments are smaller than every house.\n\nD. Some houses are bigger than every apartment.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The proposition states that every house is bigger than every apartment, not that some houses are bigger than every apartment.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best English interpretation of the given proposition is:\n\nB.
