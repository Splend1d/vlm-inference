            "content": "To determine which statements are true when the value of \\( R^2 \\) is exactly zero, we need to understand what \\( R^2 \\) represents and what it means when it is zero.\n\n\\( R^2 \\) (the coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean, and 1 indicates that the model explains all of the variability.\n\nGiven that \\( R^2 = 0 \\), we can analyze each statement:\n\ni) All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero.\n- This is true. If \\( R^2 = 0 \\), it means that the model does not explain any of the variability in the response variable. This implies that the slopes of the regression lines for the explanatory variables are not contributing to the model's explanatory power, hence they are zero.\n\nii) The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables.\n- This is also true. If \\( R^2 = 0 \\), the model does not explain any variability in the response variable, which means that the fitted line (regression line) will be horizontal, indicating no relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable.\n\niii) The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value.\n- This is true. As mentioned, \\( R^2 = 0 \\) indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability in the response variable, meaning the regression line does not account for any of the variability in the response variable about its mean.\n\niv) The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero.\n- This is not necessarily true. The intercept coefficient estimate can be any value, not necessarily zero, depending on the specific model and data. It is not a requirement for \\( R^2 \\) to be zero that the intercept coefficient be zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nThis means that the statements (i), (ii), and (iii) are true when \\( R^2 = 0 \\), while statement (iv) is not necessarily true.",
