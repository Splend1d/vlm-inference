            "content": "To determine which nerve is responsible for the loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, we need to understand the anatomy and function of the cranial nerves involved.\n\n1. **Lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve (Option A)**: This branch is responsible for sensory innervation to the lower lip and chin. It does not supply the tongue, so this option is incorrect.\n\n2. **Chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (Option B)**: This branch provides taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It is part of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which is responsible for facial expressions and taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\n3. **Lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (Option C)**: This branch provides taste sensations from the posterior one-third of the tongue. It is part of the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX), which is not involved in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n4. **Hypoglossal nerve (Option D)**: This nerve is responsible for motor control of the tongue. It does not provide sensory innervation to the tongue, so this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, the correct answer is **B. chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve**. This branch is responsible for the loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.",
