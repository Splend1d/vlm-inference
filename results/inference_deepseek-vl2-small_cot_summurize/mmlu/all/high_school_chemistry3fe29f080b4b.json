            "content": "To determine which molecules have multiple resonance structures, we need to analyze the electron distribution and the stability of each molecule.\n\n1. **CO2**:\n   - CO2 is a linear molecule with a central carbon atom double-bonded to two oxygen atoms.\n   - The Lewis structure shows a double bond between carbon and each oxygen, with no lone pairs on the central carbon.\n   - This structure is stable and does not require resonance structures.\n\n2. **CO32-**:\n   - CO32- is a resonance-stabilized ion with three oxygen atoms bonded to a central carbon atom.\n   - The resonance structures show the double bond between carbon and one oxygen atom, and the double bond between carbon and another oxygen atom, with a negative charge on one oxygen.\n   - This structure is more stable than a single Lewis structure, as the negative charge is delocalized over the three oxygen atoms.\n\n3. **NO2-**:\n   - NO2- is a resonance-stabilized ion with a nitrogen atom double-bonded to two oxygen atoms and carrying a negative charge.\n   - The resonance structures show the double bond between nitrogen and one oxygen atom, and the double bond between nitrogen and another oxygen atom, with a negative charge on one oxygen.\n   - This structure is more stable than a single Lewis structure, as the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen atoms.\n\n4. **NO3-**:\n   - NO3- is a resonance-stabilized ion with a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to three oxygen atoms and carrying a negative charge.\n   - The resonance structures show the triple bond between nitrogen and one oxygen atom, and the triple bond between nitrogen and another oxygen atom, with a negative charge on one oxygen.\n   - This structure is more stable than a single Lewis structure, as the negative charge is delocalized over the three oxygen atoms.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecules that have multiple resonance structures are CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. CO32-, NO2- and NO3-",
