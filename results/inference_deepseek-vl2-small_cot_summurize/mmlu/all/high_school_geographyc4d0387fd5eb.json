A bulk-gaining industry is one where the products are sold in large quantities, often in bulk, and the cost per unit decreases as the quantity increases.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Steel**: Steel is typically sold in large quantities, often in tons or other bulk units. The cost per unit decreases as the quantity increases, making it a bulk-gaining industry.\n\nB. **Bottled orange juice**: This product is usually sold in smaller, individual bottles rather than in bulk. The cost per unit is higher when purchased in smaller quantities, so it is not a bulk-gaining industry.\n\nC. **Paper**: Paper is often sold in bulk, but the cost per unit is not necessarily lower than when purchased in smaller quantities. Therefore, it is not a bulk-gaining industry.\n\nD. **Copper**: Copper is sold in various forms, including in bulk, but the cost per unit is not necessarily lower when purchased in bulk compared to smaller quantities. Thus, it is not a bulk-gaining industry.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Steel\n\nSteel is an example of a bulk-gaining industry because it is sold in large quantities, and the cost per unit decreases as the quantity increases.",
