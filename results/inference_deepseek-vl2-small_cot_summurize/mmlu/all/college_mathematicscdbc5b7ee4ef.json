If A is open, then A = R.\n\nAn open set in the real line R is a set that contains all its limit points. Since A contains all rational numbers, it is closed and bounded. However, being closed and bounded does not necessarily mean it is open. For example, the set of rational numbers is closed and bounded, but it is not open. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nB. If A is closed, then A = R.\n\nA closed set in the real line R is a set that contains all its limit points. Since A contains all rational numbers, it is closed and bounded. However, being closed and bounded does not necessarily mean it is open. For example, the set of rational numbers is closed and bounded, but it is not open. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nC. If A is uncountable, then A = R.\n\nA set is uncountable if it is not possible to put its elements into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. The set of rational numbers is countable, as it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nD. If A is uncountable, then A is open.\n\nA set is open if it contains all its limit points. Since A is uncountable, it is not possible to put its elements into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. Therefore, it is not possible to put all its limit points into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. This means that A is not open. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nNone of the given statements must be true.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\text{None} \\]",
