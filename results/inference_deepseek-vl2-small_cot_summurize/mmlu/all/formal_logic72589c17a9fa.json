            "content": "The argument presented by Sigmund Freud in \"The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis\" revolves around the concept of the unconscious mind and its relationship with conscious knowledge. Freud argues that the unconscious mind contains complexes that are often blocked by the conscious mind's defense mechanisms. This blockage makes it difficult to convince people of the existence of the unconscious and to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\"\n- This statement is a description of the observation that people's intelligence can be weakened by emotions, which is a common observation in Freud's work. However, it does not directly address the issue of the unconscious mind or the difficulty in convincing people of its existence.\n\nB. \"The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\"\n- This statement accurately reflects Freud's argument. It states that the conscious mind's defense mechanisms, which are often seen as the strongest, block the unconscious complexes. This is a key point in Freud's theory of psychoanalysis.\n\nC. \"Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\"\n- This statement is a conclusion drawn from Freud's argument. It suggests that the blockage of the unconscious mind by the conscious mind's defense mechanisms makes it difficult to convince people of the unconscious and to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This is a direct application of Freud's theory.\n\nD. \"It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\"\n- This statement is a repetition of the conclusion in option C. While it is a valid conclusion, it does not provide any new information or analysis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion of the argument is best represented by option C: \"Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\" This conclusion directly reflects the main point of Freud's argument about the relationship between the conscious and unconscious mind and the challenges in convincing people of the unconscious.",
