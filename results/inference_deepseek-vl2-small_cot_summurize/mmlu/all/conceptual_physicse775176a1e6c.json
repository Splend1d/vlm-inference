This process is known as the compression and rarefaction cycle.\n\n- **Compressions**: These are regions where the air particles are closely packed together, resulting in higher pressure.\n- **Rarefactions**: These are regions where the air particles are spread out, resulting in lower pressure.\n\nThe combination of these compressions and rarefactions allows sound to propagate through the air. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both of these",
