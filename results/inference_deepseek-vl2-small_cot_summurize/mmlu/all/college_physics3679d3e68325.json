            "content": "To determine the total spin quantum number (S) of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen (N), we need to consider the electron configuration and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n1. **Electron Configuration of Nitrogen**: \n   - The atomic number (Z) of nitrogen is 7, which means it has 7 electrons.\n   - The electron configuration of nitrogen is \\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^3\\).\n\n2. **Ground State Configuration**:\n   - In the ground state, electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first.\n   - The \\(1s^2\\) and \\(2s^2\\) orbitals are fully filled, leaving the \\(2p^3\\) orbitals.\n\n3. **Electrons in the \\(2p\\) Orbitals**:\n   - The \\(2p\\) orbitals can hold a maximum of 6 electrons (3 pairs).\n   - According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.\n   - Therefore, the \\(2p\\) orbitals will each contain one electron.\n\n4. **Total Spin Quantum Number (S)**:\n   - Each electron in the \\(2p\\) orbitals has a spin quantum number of \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - Since there are three electrons in the \\(2p\\) orbitals, the total spin quantum number is:\n     \\[\n     S = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total spin quantum number of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. 3/2**.",
