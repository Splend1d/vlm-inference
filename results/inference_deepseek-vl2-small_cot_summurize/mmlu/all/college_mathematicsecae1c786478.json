Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the given conditions:**\n   - The group \\( G \\) contains a subgroup \\( H \\) of order 7.\n   - No element in \\( G \\) is its own inverse.\n\n2. **Properties of subgroups:**\n   - The order of a subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) is a divisor of the order of \\( G \\).\n   - The order of \\( H \\) is 7, so the divisors of 7 are 1, 7, and 49 (since \\( 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\)).\n\n3. **Possible orders of \\( G \\):**\n   - If the order of \\( G \\) is 1, then \\( G \\) is the trivial group, which is not interesting in this context.\n   - If the order of \\( G \\) is 7, then \\( G \\) is a cyclic group of order 7, which is also not interesting in this context.\n   - If the order of \\( G \\) is 49, then \\( G \\) is a cyclic group of order 49, which is also not interesting in this context.\n\n4. **Considering the given conditions:**\n   - Since no element in \\( G \\) is its own inverse, \\( G \\) cannot be a cyclic group of order 7 or 49.\n   - The only remaining possibility is that the order of \\( G \\) is 28.\n\n5. **Verifying the order 28:**\n   - The divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28.\n   - The subgroup \\( H \\) of order 7 must be a normal subgroup of \\( G \\).\n   - The order of \\( H \\) is 7, and since no element in \\( G \\) is its own inverse, \\( H \\) must be a cyclic group of order 7.\n   - The order of \\( G \\) is 28, and since \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), the order of \\( G \\) must be a multiple of the order of \\( H \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only possible order for \\( G \\) that satisfies all the given conditions is 28.\n\nTherefore, the order of \\( G \\) could be:\n\nB. 28",
