When a positronium atom transitions from a higher energy state to a lower energy state, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference between the two states.\n\nThe energy of a photon is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the energy of the photon, \\( h \\) is Planck's constant, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nThe energy of a photon can also be expressed in electron volts (eV), where 1 eV is equal to \\( 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\) Joules.\n\nTo find the energy of the photon emitted in the transition from \\( n=3 \\) to \\( n=1 \\), we need to calculate the energy difference between these two states.\n\nThe energy levels of a positronium atom are given by:\n\n\\[ E_n = -\\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{n^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor \\( n=3 \\):\n\n\\[ E_3 = -\\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{3^2} = -\\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{9} = -1.511 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nFor \\( n=1 \\):\n\n\\[ E_1 = -\\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{1^2} = -13.6 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nThe energy difference between the two states is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = E_1 - E_3 = -13.6 \\text{ eV} - (-1.511 \\text{ eV}) = -12.089 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nTo convert this energy difference to electron volts, we multiply by \\( 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\) Joules per eV:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = -12.089 \\text{ eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV} = -19.35 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = -19.35 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = -19.35 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the energy of the photon emitted in the transition, which is the absolute value of the energy difference:\n\n\\[ E = |\\Delta E| = 19.35 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the energy of the photon emitted in the transition from \\( n=3 \\) to \\( n=1 \\) is closest to:\n\n\\[ E \\approx 19.4 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include 19.4 eV.
