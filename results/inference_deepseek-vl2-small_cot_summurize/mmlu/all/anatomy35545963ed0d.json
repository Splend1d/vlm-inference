            "content": "To determine which structure is located at the neck of the bladder and surrounds the urethra in men, we need to understand the anatomy of the male reproductive system.\n\n- **A. Epididymis**: This is a coiled tube located on the back of each testicle. It stores and matures sperm cells. It is not located at the neck of the bladder.\n\n- **B. Prostate**: The prostate is a gland located below the bladder and surrounds the urethra. It produces fluid that is part of semen. The neck of the bladder is the upper part of the urethra, and the prostate surrounds this area.\n\n- **C. Scrotum**: This is a sac that holds the testicles. It is not involved in the urinary or reproductive functions of the bladder.\n\n- **D. Seminal vesicle**: This gland is located behind the bladder and contributes fluid to semen. It is not involved in the urinary or reproductive functions of the bladder.\n\nBy analyzing the functions and locations of these structures, we can conclude that the correct answer is **B. Prostate**. The prostate surrounds the neck of the bladder and the urethra, playing a crucial role in the male reproductive system.",
