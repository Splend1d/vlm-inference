These are typically associated with the extraction of natural resources or the production of raw materials. Examples include:\n\n- Mining copper (C)\n- Fishing (not listed but similar to mining)\n\nSecondary economic activities, on the other hand, involve the transformation of primary products into finished goods. These activities are crucial for adding value to raw materials and are often associated with manufacturing and processing industries. Examples include:\n\n- Assembling automotive parts (A)\n- Sewing shirts (B)\n- Binding books (D)\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Assembling automotive parts - This is a secondary economic activity because it involves the transformation of raw materials (auto parts) into a finished product (automobiles).\n\nB. Sewing shirts - This is also a secondary economic activity. It involves the transformation of raw materials (fabric) into a finished product (shirts).\n\nC. Mining copper - This is a primary economic activity because it involves the extraction of raw materials (copper ore) to produce copper.\n\nD. Binding books - This is a secondary economic activity. It involves the transformation of raw materials (paper) into a finished product (books).\n\nTherefore, the activity that is NOT a secondary economic activity is:\n\nC. Mining copper",
