            "content": "Let's analyze each statement step by step.\n\n**Statement 1:**\nSuppose \u2211|a_i| diverges and \u2211 a_i = 2. There is a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that \u2211 a_i_k = 4.\n\nTo understand this statement, we need to recall the concept of rearranging terms in a series. If \u2211|a_i| diverges, it means that the sum of the absolute values of the terms does not converge. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sum of the terms themselves diverges.\n\nConsider the series:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\]\n\nIf \u2211|a_i| diverges, it means that the sum of the absolute values of the terms does not converge. However, we can still have:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 2 \\]\n\nThis is because the series could be a sum of two series, one of which diverges and the other converges to 2. For example:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n |a_i| + \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i' \\]\n\nwhere \u2211|a_i'| converges to 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the rearrangement of the terms. If we rearrange the terms such that:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i_k} = 4 \\]\n\nwhere \\(a_{i_k}\\) is the k-th term in the rearranged sequence, we can still have:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 2 \\]\n\nThis is because the rearrangement does not change the sum of the terms. The rearrangement only changes the order of the terms, but the sum remains the same.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:**\nThere exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \u201cclosed and bounded\u201d.\n\nThis statement is a bit more complex. A metric space \\(X\\) is closed and bounded if every convergent sequence in \\(X\\) converges to a point in \\(X\\). A continuous mapping \\(f: X \\to Y\\) is continuous if for every point \\(x \\in X\\), the preimage \\(f^{-1}(f(x))\\) is open in \\(X\\).\n\nThe statement claims that there exists a continuous mapping \\(f: X \\to Y\\) such that \\(f(X)\\) is not closed and bounded. This is possible if \\(X\\) is not compact. A metric space \\(X\\) is compact if every open cover of \\(X\\) has a finite subcover. If \\(X\\) is not compact, then there exists an open cover of \\(X\\) that does not have a finite subcover.\n\nFor example, consider the metric space \\(X = \\mathbb{R}\\) with the standard metric. The open cover of \\(X\\) is \\(\\{(-1, 1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1)\\}\\). This open cover does not have a finite subcover, so \\(X\\) is not compact.\n\nNow, consider the continuous mapping \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(f(x) = x^2\\). The preimage \\(f^{-1}(f(x)) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x^2 \\leq x\\}\\) is not open in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), so \\(f(X)\\) is not closed.\n\nHowever, \\(f(X)\\) is bounded because the range of \\(f\\) is \\([0, \\infty)\\), which is bounded. Therefore, \\(f(X)\\) is not closed and bounded.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
