Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) is isomorphic to a subgroup \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), then \\( r \\) divides \\( m \\) and \\( s \\) divides \\( n \\).\n\n- The direct sum of two cyclic groups \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) is a cyclic group of order \\( rs \\).\n- If \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), then the order of the direct sum must be the same in both cases.\n- The order of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) is \\( rs \\).\n- The order of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) is \\( mn \\).\n\nFor the orders to be equal, \\( rs = mn \\). This implies that \\( r \\) divides \\( m \\) and \\( s \\) divides \\( n \\).
