            "content": "To find the total cost of the uniforms, we need to multiply the cost of each uniform by the number of uniforms and then add the cost of the additional items.\n\nThe cost of each uniform is $46, and the school will buy 12 uniforms. So, the total cost of the uniforms is \\(46 \\times 12 = 552\\).\n\nThe school also needs to buy 6 additional items, each costing $2. So, the total cost of the additional items is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\).\n\nThe total cost of the uniforms is the sum of the cost of the uniforms and the cost of the additional items: \\(552 + 12 = 564\\).\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options. Let's re-examine the options:\n\nA. \\((40 \\times 10) + (6 \\times 2) = 400 + 12\\)\nB. \\((40 \\times 6) + (10 \\times 2) = 240 + 20\\)\nC. \\((40 \\times 12) + (6 \\times 12) = 480 + 72\\)\nD. \\((40 \\times 12) + (60 \\times 12) = 480 + 720\\)\n\nThe correct option is C: \\((40 \\times 12) + (6 \\times 12) = 480 + 72\\).\n\nThe total cost of the uniforms is \\(40 \\times 12 + 6 \\times 12 = 480 + 72 = 552\\).\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\nThe final answer is: \\(552\\)",
