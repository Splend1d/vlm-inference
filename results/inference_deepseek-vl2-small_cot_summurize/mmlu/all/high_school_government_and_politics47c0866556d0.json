            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Incumbent senators are more likely to be reelected than are incumbent members of the House of Representatives.\n- This statement is true. Incumbents in the Senate have a significant advantage in reelection due to several factors. First, the Senate has a staggered election cycle, meaning that only one-third of the Senate seats are up for election every two years. This results in fewer competitive races compared to the House, where all seats are up for election every two years. Additionally, the Senate has a longer term, which allows incumbents to build a stronger reputation and establish a track record over time.\n\nB. Incumbents are prohibited by law from spending more on their reelection campaigns than their challengers spend.\n- This statement is false. There is no federal law that prohibits incumbents from spending more on their reelection campaigns than their challengers. In fact, incumbents often have access to more resources, including campaign funds, which can be used to their advantage.\n\nC. Incumbents have a great advantage over challengers because they are better known and can raise campaign funds more easily.\n- This statement is true. Incumbents benefit from their name recognition and established networks, which can help them raise campaign funds more easily. They also have the advantage of being able to leverage their existing political capital and connections to attract donors and supporters.\n\nD. Ever since the 1994 election, the majority of congressional incumbents have failed in their reelection attempts.\n- This statement is false. While there have been instances where incumbents have lost reelection, the majority of incumbents have been reelected. The 1994 election was a unique event where many incumbents lost due to a wave of Republican victories, but this is not a consistent pattern.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the true statements are A and C. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Incumbent senators are more likely to be reelected than are incumbent members of the House of Representatives.\nC. Incumbents have a great advantage over challengers because they are better known and can raise campaign funds more easily.",
