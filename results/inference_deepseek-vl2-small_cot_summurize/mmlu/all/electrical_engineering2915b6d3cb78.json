A universal gate set is a set of logic gates that can be used to construct any other logic gate using only AND, OR, and NOT gates.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. NOR, NAND.\n- NOR gates can be used to construct other gates, but NAND gates cannot. Therefore, this set is not universal.\n\nB. XOR, NOR, NAND.\n- XOR gates can be used to construct other gates, but NOR and NAND gates cannot. Therefore, this set is not universal.\n\nC. OR, NOT, AND.\n- OR, NOT, and AND gates can be used to construct any other logic gate using only AND, OR, and NOT gates. This set is universal.\n\nD. NOR, NAND, XNOR.\n- NOR, NAND, and XNOR gates can be used to construct other gates, but XNOR gates cannot. Therefore, this set is not universal.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we conclude that the correct answer is:\n\nC. OR, NOT, AND.",
