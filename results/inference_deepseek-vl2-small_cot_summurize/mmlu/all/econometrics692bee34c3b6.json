            "content": "To determine the appropriate conclusion from the Durbin Watson test, we need to understand what the test statistic represents and how it is interpreted.\n\nThe Durbin Watson test is used to assess whether the residuals of a regression model are autocorrelated. It provides a statistic that ranges from 0 to 4. If the test statistic is close to 0, it suggests that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals. If it is close to 4, it indicates strong positive autocorrelation, and if it is close to 2, it suggests weak positive autocorrelation.\n\nGiven that the test statistic is 1.53, we need to compare this value to the critical values from the Durbin Watson distribution table. The critical values depend on the sample size (n) and the number of predictors (k) in the model.\n\nFor a sample size of 50 and two predictors, the critical values are approximately:\n- For n = 50 and k = 2, the critical value is around 1.81.\n\nSince 1.53 is less than 1.81, the test statistic falls within the range that indicates no autocorrelation in the residuals.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\nC. Residuals appear not to be autocorrelated.",
