            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The lowest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth.\n- This option describes the minimum amount of air that can be expelled, which is not what a peak flow meter records. Peak flow meters measure the maximum rate of air that can be expelled, not the minimum.\n\nB. Forced expiratory volume.\n- Forced expiratory volume (FEV) is a measure of the amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in a specific time period. While it is related to lung function, it does not specifically measure the peak flow rate.\n\nC. Forced vital capacity.\n- Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after a maximum inhalation. It is a measure of lung capacity and not the peak flow rate.\n\nD. The highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth.\n- This option accurately describes what a peak flow meter records. Peak flow meters measure the maximum rate at which air can be expelled from the lungs, typically during a forced exhalation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth.",
