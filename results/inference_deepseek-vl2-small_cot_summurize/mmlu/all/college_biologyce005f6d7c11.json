It is not the process by which water enters the roots.\n\nB. **Adhesion**: This refers to the attraction between water molecules and the surface of the root cells. While adhesion is important for water uptake, it is not the process that causes water to enter the roots.\n\nC. **Osmosis**: This is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. In the context of roots, osmosis is the process by which water enters the roots from the surrounding soil.\n\nD. **Capillary action**: This is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of external forces. While capillary action helps transport water from the soil to the roots, it is not the process that causes water to enter the roots.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is **C. osmosis**. Root pressure, which is the force exerted by the roots against the soil, causes water to enter the roots through osmosis.",
