            "content": "To determine which statement is true about Paget's Disease, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Bowling of a long bone is a characteristic feature**: This statement is incorrect. Bowing of a long bone is a characteristic feature of osteoporosis, not Paget's Disease. In Paget's Disease, the bone becomes enlarged and deformed due to abnormal bone remodeling.\n\nB. **Spinal cord compression is a common complication**: This statement is correct. In Paget's Disease, the abnormal bone growth can lead to spinal cord compression, which can cause neurological symptoms such as back pain, weakness, and in severe cases, paralysis.\n\nC. **Heart failure is not a recognized complication**: This statement is incorrect. Heart failure is indeed a recognized complication of Paget's Disease. The abnormal bone growth can lead to increased blood pressure and heart workload, which may result in heart failure.\n\nD. **Pathological fractures are not a feature**: This statement is incorrect. Pathological fractures are a common feature of Paget's Disease. The weakened bone structure due to abnormal bone remodeling can lead to fractures, especially in the pelvis and vertebrae.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Spinal cord compression is a common complication.",
