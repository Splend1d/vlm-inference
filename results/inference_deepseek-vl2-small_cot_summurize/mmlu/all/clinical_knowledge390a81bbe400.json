Reduces pain intensity and increases alertness.\n- Morphine is a strong analgesic, meaning it is effective in reducing pain. However, it is also a central nervous system depressant, which typically leads to sedation rather than increased alertness. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation.\n- Morphine is well-known for its potent analgesic properties, which means it effectively reduces pain. Additionally, it acts as a central nervous system depressant, leading to sedation. This option accurately describes the effects of morphine.\n\nC. Reduces pain intensity but also causes diarrhoea.\n- While morphine can cause constipation due to its effect on the gastrointestinal tract, it is not commonly associated with causing diarrhoea. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. Reduces pain intensity but also causes insomnia.\n- Morphine can cause drowsiness and sedation, which may lead to sleepiness or difficulty staying awake. However, it is not primarily known for causing insomnia. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation.",
