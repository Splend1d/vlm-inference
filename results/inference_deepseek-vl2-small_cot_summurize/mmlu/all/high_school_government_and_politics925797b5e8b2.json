The system of checks and balances within the national government: This refers to the system where power is divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the national government to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. This is not the definition of federalism.\n\nB. The power of the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of laws: This is a function of the judicial branch, specifically the Supreme Court, which ensures that laws comply with the Constitution. This is not the definition of federalism.\n\nC. The Bill of Rights' protection of the rights of the accused: The Bill of Rights is a set of amendments to the U.S. Constitution that guarantees certain fundamental rights to individuals, such as freedom of speech and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. This is not the definition of federalism.\n\nD. The division and sharing of power between the national and state governments: Federalism is a system where power is divided between a central government and regional governments, such as states. This allows for a balance of power and ensures that both levels of government have distinct roles and responsibilities.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is D. Federalism refers to the division and sharing of power between the national and state governments.",
