            "content": "To determine which benefit mycorrhizal fungi provide to plants, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. They protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats.\n- Mycorrhizal fungi do not primarily protect plants from desiccation. While they can help plants absorb water more efficiently, their main role is not to prevent desiccation.\n\nB. They fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats.\n- Mycorrhizal fungi are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use. This process is crucial for plants in nitrogen-limited environments, as it provides them with a vital nutrient that is often scarce in the soil.\n\nC. They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\n- While mycorrhizal fungi can enhance the availability of phosphorus, their primary function is not to provide this element. They do not directly fix phosphorus into a usable form.\n\nD. They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen.\n- This option is incorrect. Mycorrhizal fungi do not exchange carbon for nitrogen. Instead, they form symbiotic relationships with plants, where they receive carbohydrates from the plant in exchange for nutrients like nitrogen.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is B. Mycorrhizal fungi fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats. This ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use is a significant advantage for many plant species, especially in environments where nitrogen is scarce.",
