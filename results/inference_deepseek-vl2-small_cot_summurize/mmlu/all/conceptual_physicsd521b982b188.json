            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the composition of neon-20 and the process of removing protons and neutrons.\n\n1. **Understanding Neon-20**: Neon-20 is a nucleus of the element neon. Neon has an atomic number of 10, meaning it has 10 protons. The mass number of neon-20 is 20, which is the sum of its protons and neutrons.\n\n2. **Composition of Neon-20**: Neon-20 consists of 10 protons and 10 neutrons. This is because the mass number (20) is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons.\n\n3. **Removing Protons and Neutrons**: If we remove two protons and two neutrons from neon-20, we are left with:\n   - 10 protons - 2 protons = 8 protons\n   - 10 neutrons - 2 neutrons = 8 neutrons\n\n4. **Resulting Element**: The element with 8 protons is oxygen. Therefore, after removing two protons and two neutrons from neon-20, the remaining nucleus is oxygen-18.\n\n5. **Verification**: Let's verify this by calculating the mass number:\n   - 8 protons + 10 neutrons = 18\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Oxygen-18\n\nThis detailed analysis confirms that the nucleus of neon-20, after removing two protons and two neutrons, is oxygen-18.",
