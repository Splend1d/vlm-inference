            "content": "To understand what 'coring' is, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A symptom of phlebitis.\n- Phlebitis refers to inflammation of a vein, often caused by a blood clot. It is not related to the process of coring.\n\nB. Titration of a drug with its desired effect.\n- Titration is a process used to determine the concentration of a solution by adding a known volume of a solution of known concentration until the desired effect is achieved. This is not related to coring.\n\nC. The delivery of medication straight into the bloodstream.\n- This describes intravenous (IV) administration, not coring. Coring involves removing a portion of a vial, not delivering medication.\n\nD. When drugs are withdrawn from a sealed vial, fragments of the rubber bung can be cut out by the needle.\n- This is the correct definition of coring. Coring involves using a needle to pierce the rubber stopper of a vial, allowing a portion of the drug to be withdrawn. This is often done to ensure that the entire contents of a vial are used, especially when the vial is nearly empty.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. When drugs are withdrawn from a sealed vial, fragments of the rubber bung can be cut out by the needle.",
