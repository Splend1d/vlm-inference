            "content": "To determine which statement correctly explains how a point mutation can have no negative impact on the protein formed from a sequence in DNA, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The first codon of a gene is always AUG, a leader sequence; a mutation in that sequence will have no effect on the protein produced.\n- This statement is incorrect. The first codon of a gene is not always AUG. While AUG is the start codon for translation, it is not the only codon that can serve as a leader sequence. Other codons can also signal the start of translation, and mutations in these sequences can affect the protein's structure and function.\n\nB. Several codons code for the same amino acid.\n- This statement is correct. In the genetic code, multiple codons can encode the same amino acid. This redundancy means that a point mutation in one codon does not necessarily change the amino acid being coded, as there are other codons that can still produce the same amino acid. This is known as the redundancy of the genetic code.\n\nC. DNA polymerase and DNA ligase carry out excision repair before transcription.\n- This statement is incorrect. Excision repair is a process that occurs after DNA replication and transcription, not before. It is involved in correcting errors that occur during DNA replication and repair of double-strand breaks.\n\nD. RNA processing will repair point mutations before mRNA leaves the nucleus.\n- This statement is incorrect. RNA processing does not repair point mutations. Instead, it involves the splicing of introns and the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the mRNA. Point mutations are typically repaired by DNA repair mechanisms, not RNA processing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Several codons code for the same amino acid. This redundancy allows for point mutations to have no negative impact on the protein formed from a sequence in DNA.",
