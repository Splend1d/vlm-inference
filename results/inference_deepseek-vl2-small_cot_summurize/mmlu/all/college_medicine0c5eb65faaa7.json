            "content": "To determine which process uses only the gradient of material to control the direction of movement across the cell membrane, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Osmosis**: This is a type of passive transport where water molecules move across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. Osmosis relies on the concentration gradient, not the gradient of material, to move water.\n\nB. **Passive Transport**: This includes processes like diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. These processes rely on the concentration gradient to move substances across the cell membrane. They do not require energy and move substances down their concentration gradient.\n\nC. **Active Transport**: This process requires energy, usually in the form of ATP, to move substances against their concentration gradient. It involves transport proteins that change shape to move substances across the membrane.\n\nD. **Endocytosis**: This is a form of active transport where the cell membrane engulfs external material to bring it into the cell. It requires energy and involves the movement of the membrane to enclose the material.\n\nGiven this analysis, the process that uses only the gradient of material to control the direction of movement across the cell membrane is **B. Passive Transport**. This is because passive transport relies solely on the concentration gradient to move substances without the need for energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Passive Transport**.",
