The wait is expected to be short.\n- Busy-waiting is often used when the event is expected to occur quickly, as it allows the program to continue executing other tasks without unnecessary overhead. This is a reasonable justification for busy-waiting.\n\nB. A busy-wait loop is easier to code than an interrupt handler.\n- Busy-waiting involves a simple loop that can be easier to implement and understand compared to interrupt handling, which requires more complex code and context switching. This is a reasonable justification for busy-waiting.\n\nC. There is no other work for the processor to do.\n- If there is no other work for the processor to do, it is logical to use busy-waiting to handle the event. This is a reasonable justification for busy-waiting.\n\nD. The program executes on a time-sharing system.\n- In a time-sharing system, multiple processes share the CPU, and busy-waiting is not typically used because it can lead to inefficient CPU utilization. Instead, interrupt handling is used to manage events. This is not a reasonable justification for busy-waiting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The program executes on a time-sharing system.",
