The strength of an acid is related to its ability to donate protons (H\u207a ions) in solution. The stronger the acid, the more it ionizes in water.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **HNO2 (Nitrous Acid)**: HNO2 is a weak acid. It partially ionizes in water, but the extent of ionization is limited.\n\nB. **HClO4 (Perchloric Acid)**: HClO4 is a strong acid. It ionizes completely in water, meaning it dissociates completely into H\u207a and ClO\u2084\u207b ions.\n\nC. **H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide)**: H2S is a weak acid. It partially ionizes in water, but the extent of ionization is limited.\n\nD. **H3PO4 (Phosphoric Acid)**: H3PO4 is a weak acid. It partially ionizes in water, but the extent of ionization is limited.\n\nGiven this analysis, the acid that will have the highest percentage ionization is the one that ionizes completely in water. Among the options, HClO4 is the only acid that ionizes completely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. HClO4**.",
