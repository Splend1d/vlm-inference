DNA migrates from positive charge to negative charge.\n- In gel electrophoresis, DNA is negatively charged due to its phosphate backbone. When an electric current is applied, DNA migrates towards the positive electrode (anode) because opposite charges attract. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. Smaller DNA travels faster.\n- Smaller DNA molecules have a higher surface-to-volume ratio, which allows them to move more easily through the gel matrix. This results in faster migration compared to larger DNA molecules. This statement is correct.\n\nC. The DNA migrates only when the current is running.\n- DNA migrates in the presence of an electric current. Without the current, DNA does not move. This statement is correct.\n\nD. The longer the current is running, the farther the DNA will travel.\n- The distance DNA travels is influenced by the current strength and the size of the DNA molecules. Longer running times can increase the distance traveled, but this is not a guaranteed outcome. This statement is not necessarily incorrect, but it depends on the specific conditions.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the incorrect statement is:\n\nA. DNA migrates from positive charge to negative charge.",
