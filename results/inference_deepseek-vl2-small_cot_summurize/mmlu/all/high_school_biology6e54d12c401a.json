They live in very different habitats.\n- While it's true that distantly related organisms might occupy different ecological niches, this is not a direct consequence of their evolutionary distance. Organisms can be distantly related and still share similar habitats if they have adapted to similar environments.\n\nB. They should share fewer homologous structures than two more closely related organisms.\n- This statement is correct. Homologous structures are anatomical features that have a common evolutionary origin. Distantly related organisms have diverged over a long period, leading to fewer homologous structures. In contrast, more closely related organisms have a more recent common ancestor, resulting in more homologous structures.\n\nC. Their chromosomes should be very similar.\n- Chromosome similarity is not a reliable indicator of evolutionary distance. While closely related organisms may have more similar chromosomes, distantly related organisms can also have similar chromosome structures if they have undergone similar evolutionary processes.\n\nD. They shared a common ancestor relatively recently.\n- This statement is incorrect. Distantly related organisms have diverged over a long period, meaning they shared a common ancestor long ago.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is B. Distantly related organisms should share fewer homologous structures than more closely related organisms due to their longer evolutionary divergence.",
