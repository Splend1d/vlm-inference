            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of quantum efficiency and how it affects the detection of photons.\n\nQuantum efficiency (\\(\\eta\\)) is the ratio of the number of photons detected to the number of photons incident on the detector. It is a measure of how effectively a detector converts incident photons into detectable signals.\n\nGiven:\n- Quantum efficiency (\\(\\eta\\)) = 0.1\n- Number of photons sent into the detector = 100\n\nThe expected number of photons detected is:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of photons} = \\eta \\times \\text{Number of photons sent} = 0.1 \\times 100 = 10 \\]\n\nThis means, on average, the detector is expected to detect 10 photons.\n\nNext, we need to consider the rms (root mean square) deviation. The rms deviation is a measure of the spread of the number of photons detected around the average. It is given by:\n\\[ \\text{RMS deviation} = \\sqrt{\\text{Expected number of photons} \\times (1 - \\text{Quantum efficiency})} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{RMS deviation} = \\sqrt{10 \\times (1 - 0.1)} = \\sqrt{10 \\times 0.9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\]\n\nThis means the rms deviation is about 3.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. An average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 4.\n   - This option is incorrect because the rms deviation is 3, not 4.\n\nB. An average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.\n   - This option is correct because it matches our calculations.\n\nC. An average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 1.\n   - This option is incorrect because the rms deviation is 3, not 1.\n\nD. An average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 0.1.\n   - This option is incorrect because the rms deviation is 3, not 0.1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. An average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
