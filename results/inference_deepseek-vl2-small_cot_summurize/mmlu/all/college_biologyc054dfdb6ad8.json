            "content": "The question is asking about the evolutionary advantage of the cuckoo's strategy of using loud begging cues to trick host birds into rearing its young. The key point here is that the host birds are not necessarily harmed by this strategy, as they still manage to rear their own offspring.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This option suggests that the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently. However, this does not explain why the genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo's young would remain in the gene pool. The host birds' response is not necessarily efficient in rearing their own young, as they are also rearing the cuckoo's young.\n\nB. This option suggests that the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species. This is the correct answer. The host birds are not harmed by rearing the cuckoo's young, as they are still rearing their own offspring. Therefore, the genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo's young would remain in the gene pool because the maximum fitness of the host birds is not compromised.\n\nC. This option suggests that on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own. This does not explain why the genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo's young would remain in the gene pool. The energy spent on rearing a fledgling bird is not necessarily less when the fledgling is an interloper.\n\nD. This option suggests that the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced. However, this does not explain why the genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo's young would remain in the gene pool. The maximum fitness of the cuckoo is not necessarily reduced by this strategy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
