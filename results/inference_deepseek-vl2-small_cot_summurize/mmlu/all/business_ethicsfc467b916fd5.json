Environmental management systems, ISO14001, EMAS.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- Environmental management systems (EMS) are processes by which organizations implement environmental goals, policies, and responsibilities. They help in regular auditing and reporting, which go beyond legal compliance.\n\n- ISO14001 is a standard for environmental management systems. It provides a framework for organizations to manage their environmental responsibilities and improve their environmental performance.\n\n- EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) is a European Union scheme that helps organizations to manage their environmental responsibilities and improve their environmental performance. It is a voluntary scheme that goes beyond legal compliance.\n\n- SA8000 is a social accountability standard that focuses on the social responsibility of organizations. It is not directly related to environmental management.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Environmental management systems, ISO14001, EMAS.",
