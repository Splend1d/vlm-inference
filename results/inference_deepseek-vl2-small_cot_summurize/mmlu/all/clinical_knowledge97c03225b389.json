            "content": "To understand what 'passive movements' are, we need to consider the mechanics of movement and the role of resistance.\n\n1. **Passive Movement Definition**: Passive movements are those that occur without active muscular effort. This means that the muscles are not contracting to move the body part. Instead, the body part moves due to external forces or gravity.\n\n2. **Resistance and Stretching**: In passive movements, the body part is often stretched at the end of the range of motion. This stretching can be due to gravity, external forces, or the elasticity of the tissues.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: This describes active movements where muscles contract to move the body part, and resistance is present.\n   - **Option B**: This describes passive movements accurately. The body part moves without active muscle contraction, and it is stretched at the end of the range.\n   - **Option C**: This describes a movement with resistance but stopping at the end of the range, which is not characteristic of passive movements.\n   - **Option D**: This describes a movement without resistance and stopping at the end of the range, which is not characteristic of passive movements.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **Option B**: Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range. This accurately describes passive movements, where the body part moves due to external forces, and it is stretched at the end of the range.",
