The total number of points if a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points.\n- This option is correct because 7 x 2 = 14, which represents the total number of points if a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points.\n\nB. The total number of basketballs if 7 basketballs were old and 2 basketballs were new.\n- This option is incorrect because 7 x 2 = 14, which does not represent the total number of basketballs. The total number of basketballs would be 7 + 2 = 9.\n\nC. The total number of points if one player had 7 points and a different player had 2 points.\n- This option is incorrect because 7 x 2 = 14, which does not represent the total number of points. The total number of points would be 7 + 2 = 9.\n\nD. The total number of basketballs used if there were 7 basketballs and 2 of the basketballs were not used.\n- This option is incorrect because 7 x 2 = 14, which does not represent the total number of basketballs.
