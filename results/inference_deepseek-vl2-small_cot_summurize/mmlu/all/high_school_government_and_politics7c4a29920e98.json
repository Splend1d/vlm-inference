            "content": "To determine the number of votes required for a presidential nominee to the Supreme Court to be confirmed, we need to understand the process of Senate confirmation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Senate's Role**: The U.S. Senate is responsible for confirming presidential nominees to the Supreme Court. This process involves a simple majority vote.\n\n2. **Understanding a Simple Majority**: A simple majority means that more than half of the total votes cast are required for approval. In the Senate, this is 51 votes.\n\n3. **Why 51 Votes?**: The requirement of 51 votes is a constitutional mandate. This ensures that the Senate has a significant majority to confirm a nominee, reflecting the importance of the role and the need for broad support.\n\n4. **Why Not 49 or 50 Votes?**: While 49 or 50 votes would technically be enough to confirm a nominee, the requirement of 51 votes is a safeguard to prevent a tie or a close vote that could be contentious.\n\n5. **Why Not 40 or 60 Votes?**: These options are not correct because they do not reflect the constitutional requirement of a simple majority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Fifty-one percent.",
