            "content": "To determine which option would lead to a decrease in the money supply, we need to understand the mechanisms by which the money supply is influenced.\n\nA. The FED lowers the discount rate: Lowering the discount rate reduces the cost of borrowing for banks, encouraging them to borrow more from the FED. This increases the money supply because banks have more funds to lend to the public.\n\nB. The FED sells government securities in the secondary market: When the FED sells government securities, it reduces the amount of money in circulation. This is because the money paid for the securities is taken out of the banking system, reducing the reserves banks have available to lend.\n\nC. The federal government spends less money: This action does not directly affect the money supply. The government's spending is a demand for goods and services, not a change in the money supply.\n\nD. The FED lowers reserve requirements: Lowering reserve requirements allows banks to hold less money in reserve and lend more. This increases the money supply because banks have more funds to lend to the public.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The FED sells government securities in the secondary market.",
