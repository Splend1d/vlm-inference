            "content": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mean squared error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It is often used in forecasting to evaluate the accuracy of predictions. However, it is not directly related to trading rule profitability. Trading profitability depends on various factors, including market conditions, trading strategies, and risk management. Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\nB. Mean absolute error (MAE) is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. It is a linear measure, not a quadratic one. A quadratic loss function would be used in a different context, such as in regression analysis where squared errors are penalized more heavily. Therefore, this statement is not true.\n\nC. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a measure of forecast accuracy that is expressed as a percentage. It is useful for evaluating the accuracy of asset return forecasts because it provides a clear and interpretable measure of the error. It is particularly useful when comparing forecasts of different magnitudes. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nD. Mean squared error (MSE) does penalize large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors. This is because the squared nature of the error means that larger errors are multiplied by a larger number, leading to a greater penalty. This property makes MSE a useful measure for evaluating the accuracy of forecasts, especially when the magnitude of errors is important. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the true statements are C and D. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we will choose the most directly relevant statement for evaluating forecast accuracy, which is C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts.",
