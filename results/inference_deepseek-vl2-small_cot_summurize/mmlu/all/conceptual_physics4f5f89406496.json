            "content": "The phenomenon of beats is the result of sound interference.\n\nWhen two sound waves of slightly different frequencies overlap, they can interfere with each other. If the frequencies are close, the resulting sound wave will have a higher or lower frequency than the original waves, creating a pattern of alternating loud and soft sounds known as beats. This is a classic example of constructive and destructive interference in sound waves.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. interference",
