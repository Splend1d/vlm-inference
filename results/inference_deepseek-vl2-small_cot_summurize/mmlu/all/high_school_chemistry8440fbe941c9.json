            "content": "To determine which statement is correct about the calcium atom, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. It contains 20 protons and neutrons: This statement is incorrect. Calcium is an element with an atomic number of 20, meaning it has 20 protons. However, the number of neutrons can vary, and the most common isotope of calcium has 20 neutrons.\n\nB. It contains 20 protons and 20 electrons: This statement is correct. Calcium is an element with an atomic number of 20, which means it has 20 protons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, so a calcium atom also has 20 electrons.\n\nC. It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons: This statement is incorrect. While a calcium atom does have 20 protons and 20 electrons, the number of neutrons can vary. The most common isotope of calcium has 20 neutrons, but there are other isotopes with different numbers of neutrons.\n\nD. All atoms of calcium have a mass of 40.078 u: This statement is incorrect. The mass of an atom is not a fixed value for all atoms of an element. The mass of an atom is determined by the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. The atomic mass of calcium is approximately 40.078 u, but this is an average value for all isotopes of calcium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. It contains 20 protons and 20 electrons.",
