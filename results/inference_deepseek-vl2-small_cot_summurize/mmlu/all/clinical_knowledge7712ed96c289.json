Both are not directly linked to fatigue.\n\nB. **Dopamine and acetyl choline**: Dopamine is involved in reward and motivation, and acetylcholine is involved in muscle contraction and memory. While dopamine can affect mood and motivation, acetylcholine is not directly linked to fatigue.\n\nC. **Glutamate and serotonin**: Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in learning and memory. Serotonin is involved in mood regulation and sleep. Both are not directly linked to fatigue.\n\nD. **Dopamine and serotonin**: Dopamine is involved in reward and motivation, and serotonin is involved in mood regulation and sleep. Both are directly linked to fatigue as they influence mood and motivation, which can impact energy levels and the perception of fatigue.\n\nConsidering the roles of these neurotransmitters, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Dopamine and serotonin.",
