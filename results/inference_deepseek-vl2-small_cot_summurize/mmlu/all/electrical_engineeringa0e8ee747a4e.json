This is because the field flux is varied to control the speed of the motor, and this variation directly affects the torque produced by the motor. The torque is a function of the field flux and the armature current, and by varying the field flux, the torque remains constant while the speed changes. This is in contrast to constant power or variable power drives, where the power output changes with speed, and to none of the above, which would imply that the speed control does not result in any of the described outcomes.",
