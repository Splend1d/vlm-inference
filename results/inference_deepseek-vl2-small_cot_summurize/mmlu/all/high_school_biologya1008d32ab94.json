            "content": "To understand the concept of natural selection, we need to consider how it affects populations over time. Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that leads to the increase in the frequency of advantageous alleles in a population.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Alleles**: Alleles are different forms of a gene that are found at the same place on a chromosome. While alleles are the units of heredity, they are not the entities that are directly affected by natural selection. Instead, it is the individuals that have these alleles that are subject to selection.\n\nB. **Loci**: Loci refer to the specific positions on a chromosome where genes are located. While loci are important for understanding genetic inheritance, they are not the entities that are selected for or against in natural selection.\n\nC. **Gene pools**: A gene pool is the total set of genetic variation within a population. Natural selection acts on the gene pool by favoring certain alleles over others, but it is not the gene pool itself that is directly selected.\n\nD. **Individuals**: Individuals are the entities that possess alleles and are subject to natural selection. When individuals with advantageous alleles survive and reproduce more successfully, these alleles become more common in the population. This is the essence of natural selection, where the survival and reproductive success of individuals determine the frequency of alleles in the population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Individuals. Natural selection changes allele frequencies in populations because some individuals survive and reproduce more successfully than others.",
