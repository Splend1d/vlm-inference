State and local governments, by means of federal funding.\n\nFederal programs are typically implemented by state and local governments, which receive funding from the federal government to carry out these programs. This is because state and local governments are closest to the people and have a better understanding of the specific needs and conditions of their communities. They are also responsible for providing many of the services and programs that are funded by the federal government, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because private businesses are not typically responsible for implementing federal programs. While they may be involved in providing goods and services to support these programs, they are not the primary implementers.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Congress, the legislative branch of the federal government, is responsible for creating and funding federal programs, but it does not directly implement them. Instead, it passes laws and appropriates funds to state and local governments to carry out these programs.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the federal courts are responsible for interpreting and enforcing the laws passed by Congress, but they do not implement federal programs. Criminal prosecutions are handled by the federal courts, but they are not a means of implementing federal programs.",
