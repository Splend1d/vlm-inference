            "content": "To determine which cranial nerve is related to the sense of smell, we need to understand the functions of each of the cranial nerves listed:\n\nA. **Abducens Nerve**: This nerve is responsible for innervating the lateral rectus muscle of the eye, which allows for the outward movement of the eyeball. It is not involved in the sense of smell.\n\nB. **Hypoglossal Nerve**: This nerve controls the movements of the tongue. It is involved in speech and swallowing but does not play a role in the sense of smell.\n\nC. **Olfactory Nerve**: This nerve is specifically responsible for the sense of smell. It is the first cranial nerve and is located in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. It transmits sensory information from olfactory receptors to the brain, allowing us to perceive different odors.\n\nD. **Trochlear Nerve**: This nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle of the eye, which helps in the downward and inward movement of the eyeball. Like the abducens nerve, it is not involved in the sense of smell.\n\nBy analyzing the functions of each nerve, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\nC. Olfactory",
