            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of momentum. The momentum of the water before and after the nozzle is equal.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( A_0 \\) as the cross-sectional area of the hose before the nozzle.\n- \\( A_1 \\) as the cross-sectional area of the nozzle.\n- \\( v_0 \\) as the initial velocity of the water.\n- \\( v_1 \\) as the final velocity of the water after the nozzle.\n\nThe initial momentum of the water is given by:\n\\[ p_0 = m \\cdot v_0 \\]\n\nThe final momentum of the water is given by:\n\\[ p_1 = m \\cdot v_1 \\]\n\nSince the pressure is constant, the mass flow rate \\( \\dot{m} \\) is also constant. Therefore, the initial and final mass flow rates are equal:\n\\[ \\dot{m} = \\frac{m \\cdot v_0}{A_0} = \\frac{m \\cdot v_1}{A_1} \\]\n\nFrom this, we can express \\( v_1 \\) in terms of \\( v_0 \\):\n\\[ v_1 = \\frac{A_0}{A_1} \\cdot v_0 \\]\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the nozzle is 1/3 of the area of the hose:\n\\[ A_1 = \\frac{1}{3} A_0 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( A_1 \\) into the equation for \\( v_1 \\):\n\\[ v_1 = \\frac{A_0}{\\frac{1}{3} A_0} \\cdot v_0 = 3 \\cdot v_0 \\]\n\nGiven that the initial velocity \\( v_0 = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), the final velocity \\( v_1 \\) is:\n\\[ v_1 = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nThus, the final velocity of the water as it exits the nozzle is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6 \\, \\text{m/s}} \\]",
