            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the equation of motion for an object under constant acceleration. The acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThe initial velocity (v\u2080) is 10 m/s, and the acceleration (a) is -9.8 m/s\u00b2 (since it's downward). We want to find the velocity (v) after 1 second.\n\nThe equation of motion is:\n\nv = v\u2080 + at\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity\nv\u2080 = initial velocity\na = acceleration\nt = time\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv = 10 m/s + (-9.8 m/s\u00b2) * 1 s\nv = 10 m/s - 9.8 m/s\nv = 0.2 m/s\n\nHowever, this result doesn't match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nThe correct equation of motion for an object under constant acceleration is:\n\nv = v\u2080 + at\n\nBut in this case, the acceleration is not constant. The acceleration due to gravity is constant, but the velocity is changing due to the horizontal component of the initial velocity.\n\nThe correct equation of motion is:\n\nv = v\u2080 + at\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity\nv\u2080 = initial velocity\na = acceleration due to gravity\nt = time\n\nSince the initial velocity has a horizontal component, we need to consider the horizontal component of the velocity. The horizontal component of the initial velocity is 10 m/s.\n\nThe horizontal component of the velocity after 1 second is:\n\nv\u2093 = v\u2080\u2093 + at\u2093\n\nwhere:\nv\u2093 = horizontal component of the velocity\nv\u2080\u2093 = initial horizontal component of the velocity\na = acceleration due to gravity\nt\u2093 = time\n\nSince the acceleration is downward, the horizontal component of the velocity will decrease. We can use the equation:\n\nv\u2093 = v\u2080\u2093 - at\u2093\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv\u2093 = 10 m/s - (-9.8 m/s\u00b2) * 1 s\nv\u2093 = 10 m/s + 9.8 m/s\nv\u2093 = 19.8 m/s\n\nHowever, this result is still not one of the given options.
