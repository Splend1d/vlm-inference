According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal diseases are the second leading cause of death among children under five, accounting for approximately 1.5 million deaths annually.\n\nB. **Diabetes**: Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is a significant global health issue, but it is not the leading cause of death. The WHO estimates that diabetes accounted for about 1.6 million deaths in 2017.\n\nC. **Dementia**: Dementia is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is a major public health concern, but it is not the leading cause of death. The WHO reported that dementia was responsible for about 1.3 million deaths in 2017.\n\nD. **Road injuries**: Road injuries, including those from motor vehicle accidents, are a significant cause of death, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. According to the WHO, road injuries were responsible for approximately 1.35 million deaths in 2017.\n\nBy comparing the numbers, we can see that:\n\n- Diarrheal diseases account for about 1.5 million deaths.\n- Diabetes accounts for about 1.6 million deaths.\n- Dementia accounts for about 1.3 million deaths.\n- Road injuries account for about 1.35 million deaths.\n\nTherefore, the cause of death that is the most prevalent globally, as of 2017, is **diarrheal diseases**.",
