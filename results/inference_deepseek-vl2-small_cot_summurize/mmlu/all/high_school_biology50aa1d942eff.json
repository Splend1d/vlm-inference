The host is harmed, while the parasite gains nutrients or other benefits. This does not fit the description of a species interaction where one benefits and the other is unaffected.\n\nB. **Mutualism**: Mutualism involves both species benefiting from the interaction. This is a type of symbiosis where both organisms gain something from the relationship. This does not match the scenario described, where one species is unaffected.\n\nC. **Commensalism**: Commensalism is a type of symbiosis where one organism benefits while the other is neither helped nor harmed. This fits the description perfectly, as one species benefits while the other remains unaffected.\n\nD. **Symbiosis**: Symbiosis is a general term for a close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms. It can be mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic. While symbiosis can include commensalism, the term is broader and does not specifically refer to the interaction described.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Commensalism.",
