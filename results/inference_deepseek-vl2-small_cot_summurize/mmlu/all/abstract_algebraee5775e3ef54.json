For example, the function \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) defined by \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) is surjective because every real number is an output, but it is not one-to-one because different inputs map to the same output.\n- Therefore, not every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
