The phlebitis scale is not applicable here.\n\n- **Stage 1 (Observe cannula):** This stage involves the presence of pain at the IV site, erythema, and swelling. These symptoms indicate early phlebitis, but the phlebitis scale does not specify a stage for these symptoms.\n\n- **Stage 2 (Re-site cannula):** This stage is characterized by the presence of pain, erythema, and swelling, but also includes the presence of a visible thrombus (blood clot) at the cannula site. The phlebitis scale specifically identifies this stage as Stage 2.\n\n- **Stage 3 (Re-site cannula and consider treatment):** This stage involves the presence of pain, erythema, swelling, and a visible thrombus. It is the most severe stage of phlebitis, and the phlebitis scale recommends re-siting the cannula and considering treatment.\n\nGiven the symptoms of pain, erythema, and swelling, and the presence of a thrombus, the correct stage is **Stage 2**. Therefore, the appropriate action is to re-site the cannula.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. Stage 2 - re-site cannula**.",
