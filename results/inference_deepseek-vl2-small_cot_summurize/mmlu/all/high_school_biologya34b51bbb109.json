            "content": "To determine which statement best explains why Mendel's principle of segregation was deemed a law, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mendel's work with pea plants and his conclusions have been described in many sources.\n- While Mendel's work is well-documented, this statement does not explain why his principle of segregation is considered a law. It merely acknowledges the historical context of his research.\n\nB. The patterns of trait inheritance observed in pea plants were repeatedly demonstrated in other eukaryotes.\n- This statement is crucial because it demonstrates the universality of Mendel's findings. By showing that the patterns of inheritance observed in pea plants were consistent across different species, Mendel's principles were validated beyond his initial experiments. This consistency across diverse organisms supports the idea that these principles are fundamental laws of inheritance.\n\nC. Chromosomes were found to contain the genetic information for traits.\n- This statement is related to the discovery of chromosomes but does not directly explain why Mendel's principle of segregation is considered a law. The discovery of chromosomes provided a biological basis for understanding inheritance but did not address the broader implications of Mendel's laws.\n\nD. The discovery of the structure of DNA supported Mendel's observations and laws.\n- While the discovery of DNA structure was significant, it was not directly related to the validation of Mendel's laws. The structure of DNA provided insights into genetic mechanisms but did not directly explain the universality of Mendel's principles.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that best explains why Mendel's principle of segregation was deemed a law is:\n\nB. The patterns of trait inheritance observed in pea plants were repeatedly demonstrated in other eukaryotes.",
