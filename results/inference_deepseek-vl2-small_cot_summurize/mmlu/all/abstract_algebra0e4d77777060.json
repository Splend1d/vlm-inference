Therefore, S is not symmetric.\n\n2. **Anti-symmetric**: A relation is anti-symmetric if for every (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is also in the relation, and if (a, b) is in the relation, (b, a) is not in the relation.\n   - In S, (1, 1) is in the relation, and (1, 1) is also in the relation. However, (1, 2) is in the relation, but (2, 1) is not in the relation. Therefore, S is not anti-symmetric.\n\n3. **Both**: A relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric if it is symmetric and anti-symmetric.\n   - Since S is not symmetric, it cannot be both symmetric and anti-symmetric.\n\n4. **Equivalence relation**: An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n   - Reflexive: Every element is related to itself, which is true for S since (1, 1) is in the relation.\n   - Symmetric: As shown earlier, S is not symmetric.\n   - Transitive: For any (a, b) and (b, c) in S, (a, c) is also in S. Since S is reflexive and symmetric, it is also transitive.\n\nTherefore, S is an equivalence relation.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
