            "content": "To determine the correct phases of the cardiac cycle, we need to understand the process of the heart's function. The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that occur in the heart during one complete heartbeat. It includes two main phases: systole and diastole.\n\n1. **Systole**: This is the phase where the heart contracts, pumping blood out of the heart chambers. During systole, the ventricles contract, and the pressure within the heart increases, forcing blood out through the aorta and into the arteries.\n\n2. **Diastole**: This is the phase where the heart relaxes and fills with blood. During diastole, the ventricles relax, and the pressure within the heart decreases, allowing blood to flow back into the heart chambers from the arteries.\n\nThe cardiac cycle is not divided into three distinct phases but rather into two main phases: systole and diastole.\n\n- **Option A** suggests three phases: systole, diastole, and rest. This is incorrect because the cardiac cycle does not include a rest phase.\n- **Option B** suggests three phases: contraction, relaxation, and rest. This is incorrect because the cardiac cycle does not include a rest phase.\n- **Option C** suggests two phases: diastole and systole. This is correct as it accurately describes the two main phases of the cardiac cycle.\n- **Option D** suggests four phases: diastole, systole, and contraction. This is incorrect because the cardiac cycle does not include a contraction phase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option C: diastole and systole**.",
