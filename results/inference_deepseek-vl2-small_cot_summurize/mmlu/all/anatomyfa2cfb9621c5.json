            "content": "To determine which orbital wall is most likely to collapse in a 'blow out' fracture, we need to understand the anatomy and mechanics of an orbital blowout fracture.\n\nAn orbital blowout fracture occurs when the orbital floor is fractured, allowing the contents of the orbit to herniate into the maxillary sinus. This typically happens due to a high-impact trauma to the face.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The roof: The roof of the orbit is the orbital wall that is least likely to collapse in a blowout fracture. The roof is composed of the ethmoid bone and the maxillary sinus, which are not as prone to collapse under the pressure of orbital contents.\n\nB. The floor: The floor of the orbit is the most likely to collapse in a blowout fracture. The floor is composed of the maxillary sinus, which is a thin, delicate structure. When the floor is fractured, the contents of the orbit, such as the eyeball, can herniate into the maxillary sinus, leading to a blowout fracture.\n\nC. The lateral wall: The lateral wall of the orbit is composed of the zygomatic bone and the maxillary sinus. While it is possible for the contents of the orbit to herniate into the maxillary sinus through a lateral wall fracture, the likelihood of collapse is less compared to the floor.\n\nD. The medial wall: The medial wall of the orbit is composed of the lacrimal bone and the ethmoid bone. Like the lateral wall, the medial wall can also allow herniation of orbital contents into the maxillary sinus, but the likelihood of collapse is less compared to the floor.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely orbital wall to collapse in a blowout fracture is the floor, as it is the most vulnerable to herniation of orbital contents into the maxillary sinus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The floor.",
