This is a crucial feature for the 8085, as it allows the processor to access memory locations using the data bus, which is a more efficient and cost-effective approach compared to using a separate address bus.\n\nWhen the ALE signal is high, the 8085 can use the data bus to address memory locations. This is particularly useful for accessing data in memory, as it allows the processor to fetch data directly from memory without the need for a separate address bus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Enable the data bus to be used as low order address bus",
