Both Varanasi (Benares) in India and Mecca in Saudi Arabia are destinations for vast numbers of pilgrims.\n\nVaranasi is one of the most sacred cities in Hinduism and is a major pilgrimage site for Hindus. It is believed that bathing in the Ganges River in Varanasi can wash away sins and lead to salvation.\n\nMecca is the holiest city in Islam and is the destination of the Hajj, an annual pilgrimage that is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Millions of Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca to perform the Hajj, which involves walking around the Kaaba, a cube-shaped building in the center of the Great Mosque of Mecca.\n\nWhile Varanasi and Mecca are both important religious sites, they are not capitals of countries formerly colonized by the English, financial centers for a large fraction of the world's economy, or examples of modern urban planning.",
