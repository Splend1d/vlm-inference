            "content": "The ion-electron method is used to balance redox reactions, where one species is oxidized and another is reduced. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **BaCl2 + Al2(SO4)3 \u2192 AlCl3 + BaSO4**\n\n- **Redox Reaction**: This is a redox reaction where aluminum (Al) is oxidized to Al\u00b3\u207a and barium (Ba) is reduced to Ba\u00b2\u207a.\n- **Balancing**: The reaction is already balanced as written. No further balancing is needed.\n\nB. **H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O**\n\n- **Redox Reaction**: This is a neutralization reaction where hydrogen ions (H\u207a) and hydroxide ions (OH\u207b) combine to form water (H\u2082O).\n- **Balancing**: The reaction is already balanced as written. No further balancing is needed.\n\nC. **NaOH + H3PO4 \u2192 Na2HPO4 + H2O**\n\n- **Redox Reaction**: This is a neutralization reaction where sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and phosphoric acid (H\u2083PO\u2084) combine to form sodium dihydrogen phosphate (Na\u2082HPO\u2084) and water (H\u2082O).\n- **Balancing**: The reaction is already balanced as written. No further balancing is needed.\n\nD. **C2H2(g) + N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + N2(g)**\n\n- **Redox Reaction**: This is a redox reaction where acetylene (C\u2082H\u2082) is oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and nitrogen dioxide (N\u2082O) is reduced to nitrogen gas (N\u2082).\n- **Balancing**: The reaction is not balanced as written. The equation needs to be balanced for both mass and charge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**. The reaction involving acetylene and nitrogen dioxide requires balancing using the ion-electron method.",
