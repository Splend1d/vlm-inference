            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how light behaves when it passes through two polarizers. The intensity of light passing through a polarizer is given by Malus's Law, which states:\n\n\\[ I = I_0 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere \\( I \\) is the intensity of the light after passing through the polarizer, \\( I_0 \\) is the initial intensity, and \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between the light's polarization direction and the polarizer's transmission axis.\n\nIn this scenario, the incident light is unpolarized, meaning it has equal intensity in all directions. When it passes through the first polarizer, the intensity is reduced to:\n\n\\[ I_1 = I_0 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between the light's polarization direction and the first polarizer's transmission axis.\n\nNext, the light passes through the second polarizer. The angle between the light's polarization direction and the second polarizer's transmission axis is \\( 45^\\circ - \\theta \\). The intensity after passing through the second polarizer is:\n\n\\[ I_2 = I_1 \\cos^2(45^\\circ - \\theta) \\]\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity \\( \\cos(45^\\circ - \\theta) = \\sin(\\theta) \\), we can simplify this expression:\n\n\\[ I_2 = I_0 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the transmitted intensity \\( I_2 \\) to the incident intensity \\( I_0 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_2}{I_0} = \\frac{I_0 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta)}{I_0} = \\cos^2(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nSince \\( \\cos^2(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta) \\) is always less than or equal to 1, the transmitted intensity is always less than the incident intensity.\n\nTo find the percentage of the incident intensity, we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{I_2}{I_0} \\times 100\\% = \\cos^2(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\cos^2(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta) \\) is less than 1, the transmitted intensity is less than the incident intensity. Therefore, the transmitted light intensity is less than 100% of the incident intensity.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 25%",
