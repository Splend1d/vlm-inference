Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle.

It also states that Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato and that they founded and continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato. \n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the Council of Ferrera played a role in accelerating the rediscovery of classical philosophy in Western Europe. This is because the debate at the Council of Ferrera led to the establishment of the Florentine Academy, which was dedicated to the study of Plato, a classical philosopher. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The Council of Ferrera accelerated the rediscovery of classical philosophy in Western Europe.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
