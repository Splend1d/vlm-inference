GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually a year or a quarter. It includes only the value of goods and services produced within the country, not those produced abroad.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. The market value of movies made in Africa by U.S. citizens: This is included in U.S. GDP because the movies are produced in the United States, and the value is attributed to the U.S. economy.\n\nII. The market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States: This is included in U.S. GDP because the olive oil is sold in the United States, and the value is attributed to the U.S. economy.\n\nIII. The market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan: This is included in U.S. GDP because the blue jeans are made in the United States, and the value is attributed to the U.S. economy.\n\nIV. The market value of wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens: This is not included in U.S. GDP because the wine is made by Canadian citizens, and the value is attributed to the Canadian economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. I and III only",
