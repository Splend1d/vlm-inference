            "content": "To determine which groups are hurt by inflation, we need to understand how inflation affects different types of individuals and businesses.\n\n1. **Borrowers at fixed interest rates (I):**\n   - When inflation rises, the real value of the money borrowed decreases. This means that the borrower effectively pays back less in real terms than they borrowed.\n   - For example, if you borrow $100 at a 5% fixed interest rate, you will pay back $105 in real terms. If inflation is 3%, the real value of the $105 is $101.50.\n   - Therefore, borrowers at fixed interest rates are hurt by inflation because the real value of the debt decreases.\n\n2. **Individuals on fixed incomes (II):**\n   - People on fixed incomes, such as retirees, live on a set amount of money each month. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of this fixed income.\n   - For example, if a retiree receives $1,000 per month and inflation is 3%, the real value of $1,000 is $970.\n   - Therefore, individuals on fixed incomes are hurt by inflation because their purchasing power decreases.\n\n3. **Those with savings earning fixed interest rates (III):**\n   - Similar to borrowers at fixed interest rates, individuals with savings earning fixed interest rates see the real value of their savings decrease.\n   - For example, if you have $1,000 in a savings account earning 2% interest, the real value of $1,000 is $1,020. If inflation is 3%, the real value is $970.\n   - Therefore, those with savings earning fixed interest rates are hurt by inflation because the real value of their savings decreases.\n\n4. **Restaurant owners (IV):**\n   - Restaurant owners may not be directly hurt by inflation in the same way as the other groups. Inflation can affect their costs and pricing strategies, but it does not directly reduce the real value of their income or savings.\n   - Therefore, restaurant owners are not typically hurt by inflation in the same way as the other groups.\n\nBased on this analysis, the groups hurt by inflation are:\n\n- I. Borrowers at fixed interest rates\n- II. Individuals on fixed incomes\n- III. Those with savings earning fixed interest rates\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. II III and IV only",
