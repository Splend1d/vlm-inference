(S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10.\n\nThe subset S is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. When we add any two elements from S, the result is also in S. For example, 2 + 4 = 6, 4 + 6 = 10 (which is equivalent to 0 modulo 10), and so on. Therefore, (S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10. This statement is true.\n\nB. (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nThe subset S is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. When we multiply any two elements from S, the result is also in S. For example, 2 * 4 = 8, 4 * 6 = 24 (which is equivalent to 4 modulo 10), and so on. Therefore, (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10. This statement is true.\n\nC. (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\n\nAn identity element under addition is an element in the ring that, when added to any element in the ring, leaves the element unchanged. In the ring of integers modulo 10, the identity element under addition is 0, because 0 + x = x for any x in the ring. Therefore, (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10. This statement is true.\n\nD. (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nIn the ring of integers modulo 10, the identity element under multiplication is 1, because 1 * x = x for any x in the ring. However, since S is a subset of the ring of integers modulo 10, it does not have an identity under multiplication modulo 10. This statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is D. (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.",
