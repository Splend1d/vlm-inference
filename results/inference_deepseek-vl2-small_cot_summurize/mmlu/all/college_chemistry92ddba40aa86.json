            "content": "To determine which solution has the lowest pH, we need to consider the dissociation of each compound in water.\n\nA. **Na2CO3 (Sodium Carbonate)**:\n   - Sodium carbonate is a strong base and dissociates completely in water to form Na\u207a and CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b ions.\n   - The reaction is: Na\u2082CO\u2083 \u2192 2Na\u207a + CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b\n   - The pH of a solution is determined by the concentration of H\u207a ions. Since Na\u2082CO\u2083 dissociates to form a strong base, the solution is basic, and the pH is greater than 7.\n\nB. **Na3PO4 (Sodium Phosphate)**:\n   - Sodium phosphate is a weak acid and dissociates in water to form Na\u207a and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b ions.\n   - The reaction is: Na\u2083PO4 \u2192 3Na\u207a + HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b\n   - The HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b ion can further dissociate to form H\u207a and PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b ions, but this is a very weak process.\n   - The solution is slightly acidic, and the pH is less than 7.\n\nC. **Na2S (Sodium Sulfide)**:\n   - Sodium sulfide is a strong base and dissociates completely in water to form Na\u207a and S\u00b2\u207b ions.\n   - The reaction is: Na\u2082S \u2192 2Na\u207a + S\u00b2\u207b\n   - The solution is basic, and the pH is greater than 7.\n\nD. **NaCl (Sodium Chloride)**:\n   - Sodium chloride is a neutral salt and dissociates in water to form Na\u207a and Cl\u207b ions.\n   - The reaction is: NaCl \u2192 Na\u207a + Cl\u207b\n   - The solution is neutral, and the pH is 7.\n\nBy comparing the pH values of each solution:\n- Na\u2082CO\u2083 and Na\u2082S are basic, with pH > 7.\n- NaCl is neutral, with pH = 7.\n- Na3PO4 is slightly acidic, with pH < 7.\n\nTherefore, the solution with the lowest pH is **Na3PO4**.",
