At any time the French capital affords rare advantages to the anthropologist. The Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the \u00e9coles de Medicine, and the hospitals give to the comparative anatomist and biologist abundant employment.\"\nOtis T.

            "content": "The passage describes the opportunities available in Paris during the Paris Exposition of 1889 for the study of the natural history of man. It mentions various institutions and facilities that provided employment for anthropologists, such as the Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the \u00e9coles de Medicine, and the hospitals. \n\nThe passage does not mention anything about scientific societies needing new ways of attracting members who were less interested in the study of the natural world, a sudden interest in expanding human rights throughout the French colonies, or a large influx of immigrants from Africa and Asia arriving in Europe. \n\nHowever, the passage does mention the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe, which could be seen as a result of scientific principles being applied to other cultures. This could be seen as a form of cultural imperialism, where European scientific principles and methods were imposed on other cultures. \n\nTherefore, the field of anthropology, which is the primary focus of the passage, could be seen as being born out of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe. \n\nSo, the answer is C. scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{C}$.",
