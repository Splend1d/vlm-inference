IP Network Browser\n\nSNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) enumeration is the process of discovering and identifying devices on a network that are configured to support SNMP. This is typically done using an IP Network Browser, which is a specialized tool designed to scan and identify devices on a network based on their IP addresses.\n\nA. DNSlookup: This tool is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses, not to enumerate SNMP-enabled devices.\n\nB. Whois: This tool is used to query databases to obtain information about domain names, such as the owner, creation date, and expiration date. It is not used for SNMP enumeration.\n\nC. Nslookup: This tool is used to query DNS servers to obtain information about domain names, such as the IP address of a domain name. It is not used for SNMP enumeration.",
