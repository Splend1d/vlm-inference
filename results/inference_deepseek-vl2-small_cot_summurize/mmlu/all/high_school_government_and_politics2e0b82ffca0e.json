            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The president signs the version he prefers.\n- This option is incorrect because the president cannot sign a bill that has not been passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The president's role is to sign the bill into law, not to choose between versions.\n\nB. The bill goes back to each house's committee and restarts the legislative process.\n- This option is incorrect because the bill does not go back to the committee. Instead, the bill is sent to a conference committee, which is a temporary committee formed to reconcile differences between the two versions.\n\nC. All amendments to the bill are invalidated, and the original version of the bill is sent to the president to sign.\n- This option is incorrect because the bill is not sent back to the original version. The conference committee works to reconcile the differences, and the final version is sent to the president.\n\nD. The two legislative bodies form a conference committee.\n- This option is correct. When the Senate and the House of Representatives pass different versions of the same bill, they form a conference committee. This committee consists of members from both the Senate and the House and is tasked with resolving the differences between the two versions. Once the conference committee reaches an agreement, it produces a final version of the bill, which is then sent to both the Senate and the House for a final vote. If both chambers approve the final version, it is sent to the president for signature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The two legislative bodies form a conference committee.",
