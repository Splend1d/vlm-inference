Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. Hubble Space Telescope images that resolved Pluto's disk: The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990, but it was not until the 2000s that it was capable of resolving the disk of Pluto. This option is incorrect.\n\nC. Brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon: This method was used to measure the diameter of Pluto. During mutual eclipses, the combined brightness of Pluto and Charon decreases, allowing astronomers to calculate the diameter of Pluto. This method was used in the 1980s, making this option correct.\n\nD. Radar observations made by the Arecibo telescope: The Arecibo telescope was used for radar observations, but it was not until the 2000s that radar observations were used to measure the diameter of Pluto. This option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is:\n\nC. brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon",
