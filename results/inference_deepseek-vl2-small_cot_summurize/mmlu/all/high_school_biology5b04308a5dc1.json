            "content": "To determine the correct characteristic of arteries, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. They are thin-walled blood vessels.\n- Arteries are not thin-walled. In fact, they have thick walls composed of three layers: the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. The thick walls are necessary to withstand the high pressure of blood pumped from the heart. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. They contain valves that prevent backflow.\n- Arteries do not contain valves. Valves are found in veins, which have thinner walls and are designed to prevent the backflow of blood. Arteries, on the other hand, have smooth walls to allow for efficient blood flow away from the heart. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. They always carry oxygenated blood.\n- Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. This is a defining characteristic of arteries, as they are responsible for distributing oxygen-rich blood to tissues and organs. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nD. They carry blood away from the heart.\n- While arteries do carry blood away from the heart, this is not a unique characteristic. Both arteries and veins carry blood away from the heart. The distinguishing feature of arteries is that they carry oxygenated blood, not just blood away from the heart. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct characteristic of arteries is:\n\nC. They always carry oxygenated blood.",
