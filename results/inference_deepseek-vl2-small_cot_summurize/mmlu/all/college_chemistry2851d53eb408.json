The resonant frequency for an X-band cavity is typically around 9.46 GHz.\n\nNext, we need to convert the bandwidth (\u0394f) from MHz to GHz:\n\n\u0394f = 1.58 MHz = 1.58 x 10^6 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the Q-factor:\n\nQ = (2\u03c0(9.46 x 10^9 Hz)) / (1.58 x 10^6 Hz)\n\nQ \u2248 3012\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Q = 3012",
