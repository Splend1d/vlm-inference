The suspensor is derived from the basal cell.\n- During plant embryogenesis, the suspensor is indeed derived from the basal cell. The basal cell is a type of meristematic cell located at the base of the embryo, and it gives rise to the suspensor, which is involved in the formation of the seed coat. This statement is correct.\n\nB. Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell.\n- In plant embryogenesis, cotyledons are formed from the apical meristem, which is located at the tip of the embryo. The apical meristem is responsible for the formation of the shoot system, including the cotyledons. This statement is correct.\n\nC. Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.\n- The shoot apical meristem (SAM) forms during the early stages of seed development. It is responsible for the growth of the shoot system, including the formation of the stem, leaves, and flowers. Therefore, the SAM forms before the seed formation, not after. This statement is incorrect.\n\nD. Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis.\n- During plant embryogenesis, the precursors for all three primary tissue systems\u2014dermal, ground, and vascular tissues\u2014are formed. The dermal tissue forms the outer layer of the embryo, the ground tissue forms the inner layer, and the vascular tissue forms the central part. This statement is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the statement that is incorrect is:\n\nC. Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.",
