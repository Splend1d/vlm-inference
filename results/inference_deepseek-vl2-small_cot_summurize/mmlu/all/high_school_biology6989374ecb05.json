            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Directional Selection**: This type of selection occurs when a population is divided into two groups, one with a higher frequency of a certain trait and the other with a lower frequency. Over time, the population shifts in the direction of the trait with the higher frequency. This does not fit the description given, as the population is not divided into two groups with differing trait frequencies.\n\nB. **Stabilizing Selection**: This type of selection occurs when individuals with extreme traits are less likely to survive and reproduce compared to those with intermediate traits. This results in a decrease in the frequency of extreme traits over time. The description provided fits this scenario, as the population shifts towards intermediate traits due to a change in resource availability.\n\nC. **Disruptive Selection**: This type of selection occurs when two or more groups of a population compete for the same resources, leading to the formation of distinct groups with different traits. This does not match the description, as there is no competition for resources leading to distinct group formation.\n\nD. **Sympatric Speciation**: This is a process where a single species splits into two or more species while inhabiting the same geographic area. This does not fit the description, as the population is not splitting into separate species.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is **B. Stabilizing Selection**. This is because the population shifts towards intermediate traits due to a change in resource availability, which is characteristic of stabilizing selection.",
