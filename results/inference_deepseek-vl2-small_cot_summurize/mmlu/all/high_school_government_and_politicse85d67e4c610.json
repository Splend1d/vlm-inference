While there is some variation within this group, many white Southerners have traditionally supported the Democratic Party due to its alignment with their values and interests, such as support for social welfare programs and civil rights.\n\nB. **Labor union members**: Labor unions have historically been a significant part of the Democratic Party's base. They often support Democrats because of the party's stance on labor rights, collective bargaining, and social welfare programs.\n\nC. **African Americans**: African Americans have been a crucial part of the Democratic Party's support base, particularly in the context of civil rights and social justice. The party has historically been aligned with the interests of African Americans, including support for policies that address racial inequality.\n\nD. **Northern ethnic minorities**: Northern ethnic minorities, such as Irish Americans, Italian Americans, and Eastern European immigrants, have traditionally been more aligned with the Republican Party. This is due to the Republican Party's historical support for immigration policies that favored their ancestors and its stance on issues like labor rights and social welfare, which were more aligned with the interests of the Democratic Party.\n\nConsidering these points, the group with the least liberal constituency among the options is:\n\nD. Northern ethnic minorities.",
