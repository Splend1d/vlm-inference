            "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the physiological changes that occur during high-intensity exercise:\n\n1. **Understanding Blood Glucose Regulation**: During exercise, the body's demand for energy increases, leading to a rise in blood glucose levels. This is because muscles require glucose as a primary energy source.\n\n2. **Role of Insulin and Glucagon**: Insulin is released by the pancreas to facilitate the uptake of glucose by cells, lowering blood glucose levels. Conversely, glucagon is released to increase blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose.\n\n3. **Intermittent High-Intensity Exercise**: During high-intensity exercise, the body experiences a rapid increase in energy demand. This can lead to a significant rise in blood glucose levels.\n\n4. **Glucose Regulation During Exercise**: During intermittent high-intensity exercise, the body frequently alternates between periods of high energy demand and periods of lower demand. This cycling can lead to fluctuations in blood glucose levels.\n\n5. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM\" is plausible because the body's response to high-intensity exercise involves frequent adjustments to maintain energy supply.\n   - **Option B**: \"Remains relatively unchanged\" is unlikely because the body's response to exercise involves significant metabolic changes.\n   - **Option C**: \"Frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM\" is less likely because the body typically works to maintain blood glucose levels during exercise.\n   - **Option D**: \"Falls to hypoglycaemic levels\" is unlikely because the body actively regulates blood glucose levels during exercise.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the physiological responses to high-intensity exercise, the most accurate description is that blood glucose levels frequently rise by 1 - 3 mM.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM**.",
