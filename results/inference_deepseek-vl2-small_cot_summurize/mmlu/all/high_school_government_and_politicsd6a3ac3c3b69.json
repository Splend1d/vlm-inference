Congress provides funds to the states, and the states decide how best to spend the money.\n- This option describes a grant-in-aid program, where the federal government provides funds to states with conditions attached. It does not describe an entitlement, which is a right to receive benefits without conditions.\n\nB. Congress is allowed to fund these programs only when the federal government has a budget surplus.\n- This option suggests a condition-based funding mechanism, which is not characteristic of entitlements. Entitlements are typically unconditional benefits provided by the government.\n\nC. Congress must pay benefits to anyone who qualifies to receive them.\n- This option describes a mandatory benefit system, where individuals are entitled to receive benefits regardless of their financial situation. This aligns with the definition of an entitlement, which is a right to receive benefits without conditions.\n\nD. Congress grants money to states, provided that certain criteria are met.\n- This option describes a conditional grant, where funds are provided with specific conditions. This is not an entitlement, as it involves conditions that must be met.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct answer is C. Congress must pay benefits to anyone who qualifies to receive them. This accurately describes an entitlement, where individuals have a right to receive benefits without conditions.",
