            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of parallel processing and how it affects the execution time of a program.\n\nThe given program takes 100 seconds to execute on a single processor. This means that the program is not inherently parallel, as it cannot be divided into smaller tasks that can be executed simultaneously.\n\nHowever, we are told that 40% of the computation is \"inherently sequential\" and will not benefit from additional processors. This means that the remaining 60% of the computation can be parallelized.\n\nLet's assume that the program can be divided into \\( n \\) tasks, where \\( n \\) is the number of processors. The time taken to execute the program with \\( n \\) processors can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total Time}}{\\text{Number of Processors}} \\]\n\nSince 60% of the computation is parallelizable, the time taken to execute the program with \\( n \\) processors is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{100}{1 + \\frac{40}{100}} = \\frac{100}{1.4} = 71.43 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the best possible elapsed times for this program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively.\n\nFor 2 processors:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{100}{1 + \\frac{40}{100}} = \\frac{100}{1.4} = 71.43 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nFor 4 processors:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{100}{1 + \\frac{40}{100}} = \\frac{100}{1.4} = 71.43 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the best possible elapsed times, which means we need to consider the case where the program is divided into tasks that can be executed simultaneously.\n\nIn this case, the program can be divided into 2 tasks, each taking 50 seconds to execute. With 2 processors, each task can be executed simultaneously, resulting in a total execution time of:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the best possible elapsed time for this program running with 2 processors is 50 seconds.\n\nSimilarly, the program can be divided into 4 tasks, each taking 25 seconds to execute. With 4 processors, each task can be executed simultaneously, resulting in a total execution time of:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the best possible elapsed time for this program running with 4 processors is 25 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 50 and 25 seconds",
