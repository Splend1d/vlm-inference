Darius has 3 times as many cookies as Sara.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cookies Sara has:\n\nSara has 2 more cookies than John, so:\nSara's cookies = John's cookies + 2\nSara's cookies = 4 + 2\nSara's cookies = 6\n\nNow, let's find out how many cookies Darius has:\n\nDarius has 3 times as many cookies as Sara, so:\nDarius's cookies = 3 * Sara's cookies\nDarius's cookies = 3 * 6\nDarius's cookies = 18\n\nTherefore, Darius has 18 cookies.
