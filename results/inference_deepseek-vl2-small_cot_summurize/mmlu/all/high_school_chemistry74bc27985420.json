            "content": "The correct answer is C. Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\n\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron equation is a mathematical relationship that describes the temperature dependence of the vapor pressure of a liquid. It is derived from the Gibbs free energy equation and is used to calculate the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature. The equation is:\n\nln(P) = -\u0394Hvap/R * (1/T) + ln(A)\n\nwhere:\n- P is the vapor pressure of the liquid\n- \u0394Hvap is the heat of vaporization of the liquid\n- R is the gas constant\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n- A is a constant that depends on the specific liquid\n\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron equation is a fundamental equation in thermodynamics and is widely used in various fields, including chemical engineering, materials science, and atmospheric science.",
