These boundaries help to delineate one region from another.\n\nB. **Common Features**: Regions often share common features, such as climate, vegetation, or economic activities. These shared characteristics help to define the region and distinguish it from others.\n\nC. **Relative Location**: Regions are also characterized by their relative location, which can be determined by their position in relation to other regions, bodies of water, or significant landmarks.\n\nD. **Easily Defined**: This option suggests that regions are clearly and simply defined. However, regions are often complex and can be difficult to define precisely. They can overlap, have ambiguous boundaries, or be influenced by multiple factors, making them not easily defined.\n\nGiven this analysis, the characteristic that is not shared by all regions is:\n\nD.
