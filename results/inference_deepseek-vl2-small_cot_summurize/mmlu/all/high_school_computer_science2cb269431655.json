O(N)\n\nFirst, let's understand the growth rates of these functions:\n\n- **O(log e^N)**: This is the growth rate of the natural logarithm function, which grows very slowly. The natural logarithm function grows at a rate of approximately 0.693N.\n- **O(log N)**: This is the growth rate of the logarithm function, which grows faster than the natural logarithm but still relatively slowly. The logarithm function grows at a rate of approximately 0.434N.\n- **O(log log N)**: This is the growth rate of the double logarithm function, which grows even slower than the logarithm function. The double logarithm function grows at a rate of approximately 0.212N.\n- **O(N)**: This is the growth rate of a linear function, which grows the fastest among the given options. The linear function grows at a rate of approximately N.\n\nComparing these growth rates, we can see that:\n\n- O(log e^N) grows the slowest.\n- O(log N) grows slower than O(log e^N) but faster than O(log log N).\n- O(log log N) grows slower than O(log N) but faster than O(N).\n- O(N) grows the fastest.\n\nTherefore, the function that grows the slowest is:\n\nA.
