A proportion is true if the product of the means is equal to the product of the extremes.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 2 over 5 and 8 over 10\n\n- The means are 2/5 and 8/10.\n- The product of the means is (2/5) * (8/10) = 16/50 = 8/25.\n- The product of the extremes is (2 * 8) / (5 * 10) = 16 / 50 = 8/25.\n- Since the product of the means equals the product of the extremes, this pair forms a proportion.\n\nB. 2 over 5 and 10 over 15\n\n- The means are 2/5 and 10/15.\n- The product of the means is (2/5) * (10/15) = 20/75 = 4/15.\n- The product of the extremes is (2 * 10) / (5 * 15) = 20 / 75 = 4/15.\n- Since the product of the means equals the product of the extremes, this pair forms a proportion.\n\nC. 2 over 5 and 4 over 25\n\n- The means are 2/5 and 4/25.\n- The product of the means is (2/5) * (4/25) = 8/125.\n- The product of the extremes is (2 * 4) / (5 * 25) = 8 / 125.\n- Since the product of the means does not equal the product of the extremes, this pair does not form a proportion.\n\nD. 2 over 5 and 6 over 15\n\n- The means are 2/5 and 6/15.\n- The product of the means is (2/5) * (6/15) = 12/75 = 4/25.\n- The product of the extremes is (2 * 6) / (5 * 15) = 12 / 75 = 4/25.\n- Since the product of the means equals the product of the extremes, this pair forms a proportion.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A, B, and D.",
