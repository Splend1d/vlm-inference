            "content": "To determine the 'normal' range of flexion at the knee joint, we need to understand the anatomy and function of the knee. The knee joint is a hinge joint that allows for flexion and extension. The normal range of motion for a healthy knee joint is typically between 0 and 135 degrees.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 0-115 degrees: This range is too low. The knee joint is capable of greater flexion than this.\n\nB. 0-135 degrees: This range is correct. The knee joint can flex from 0 degrees (straight) to 135 degrees, which is the normal range of motion for a healthy knee.\n\nC. 0-155 degrees: This range is too high. While the knee can extend beyond 135 degrees, the normal range of flexion is not this high.\n\nD. 0-175 degrees: This range is even higher than the normal range. While some individuals may have greater flexibility, the typical range is not this extensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0-135 degrees. This range reflects the typical range of motion for a healthy knee joint, allowing for a wide range of movements necessary for daily activities.",
