            "content": "To determine which characteristic is typical of financial asset return time-series, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Their distributions are thin-tailed**: Financial asset returns often exhibit heavy-tailed distributions, meaning they have a higher probability of extreme values (outliers) compared to a normal distribution. This is due to the volatility and unpredictability of financial markets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **They are not weakly stationary**: A time-series is considered weakly stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean and variance, do not change over time. However, financial asset returns are often non-stationary, meaning their statistical properties can change over time. This option is incorrect.\n\nC. **They are highly autocorrelated**: Financial asset returns are known to be highly autocorrelated, meaning that the returns at one time are correlated with the returns at previous times. This is due to the influence of past market conditions on current market behavior. This option is correct.\n\nD. **They have no trend**: Financial asset returns often exhibit trends, which can be upward, downward, or even stationary. Trends are common in financial markets due to various economic factors. This option is incorrect.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct characteristic of financial asset return time-series is that they are highly autocorrelated. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. They are highly autocorrelated.",
