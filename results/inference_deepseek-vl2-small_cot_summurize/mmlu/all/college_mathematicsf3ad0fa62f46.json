The trace of A^2 is the sum of the diagonal elements of A^2. Since A^2 is a square matrix, its diagonal elements are the squares of the diagonal elements of A. Therefore, the trace of A^2 is nonnegative. This statement is true.\n\nII. If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative.\n\nIf A^2 = A, then A is a nilpotent matrix. A nilpotent matrix has a trace of 0. Therefore, the trace of A is nonnegative. This statement is true.\n\nIII. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B.\n\nThe trace of a product of two matrices is the product of their traces. Therefore, the trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B. This statement is true.\n\nTherefore, all three statements are true. The correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
