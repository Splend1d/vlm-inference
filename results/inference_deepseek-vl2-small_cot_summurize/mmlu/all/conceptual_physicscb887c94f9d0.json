Time dilation states that time appears to move slower for an object that is moving at a high speed relative to a stationary observer. This effect becomes more pronounced as the object approaches the speed of light.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Older.\nB. Younger.\nC. Neither younger nor older.\nD. Longer.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Older: If you travel at high speed, you would experience time dilation, which means time would appear to move slower for you compared to your friends who stay at home. This would make you younger in terms of the time you experience.\n\nB. Younger: This option is consistent with the concept of time dilation. If you travel at high speed, you would experience time moving slower for you, making you younger in terms of the time you experience.\n\nC. Neither younger nor older: This option is incorrect because time dilation would cause you to experience time differently, making you younger or older depending on your speed relative to others.\n\nD. Longer: This option is incorrect because time dilation would cause you to experience time differently, making you younger or older depending on your speed relative to others.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Younger.",
