Required reserves are not used by banks to make loans or buy investments. Instead, they are a portion of deposits that banks must hold and not lend out.\n\nB. **can be held in a bank's vault or its account at the FED.**\n   - This statement is correct. Required reserves can be held in a bank's vault or in its account at the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve holds these reserves on behalf of the banks, ensuring they are available to meet withdrawal demands.\n\nC. **must be kept in a bank's vault.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. While required reserves can be held in a bank's vault, they are not exclusively kept there. They can also be held in the bank's account at the Federal Reserve.\n\nD. **must be used to make loans.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Required reserves are not used to make loans. Instead, they are a portion of deposits that banks must hold and not lend out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. can be held in a bank's vault or its account at the FED.**",
