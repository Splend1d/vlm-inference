These forces are a type of van der Waals force, which are weak intermolecular forces that arise due to the temporary fluctuations in electron distribution within molecules. The temporary dipoles create an attraction between the molecules, which is the London dispersion force.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. temporary dipoles created by the position of electrons around the nuclei in a molecule",
