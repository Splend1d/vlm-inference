            "content": "To determine the category of the new enzyme, we need to analyze the reaction it catalyzes. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a nitrogen group from one reactant to another. This type of reaction is characteristic of a transferase enzyme.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Oxidoreductase**: This category involves enzymes that transfer electrons. They are involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, where one molecule is oxidized and another is reduced. The reaction described does not involve electron transfer, so this is not the correct category.\n\nB. **Transferase**: This category includes enzymes that catalyze the transfer of functional groups, atoms, or molecules from one molecule to another. The reaction described, where a nitrogen group is transferred, fits this definition perfectly. Therefore, this is the correct category.\n\nC. **Hydrolase**: These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of bonds, typically involving water. They cleave bonds by adding water, which is not the process described in the question.\n\nD. **Lyase**: This category involves enzymes that catalyze the breaking of chemical bonds without the use of water. The reaction described does not involve bond breaking, so this is not the correct category.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the correct category for the enzyme is:\n\nB. Transferase",
