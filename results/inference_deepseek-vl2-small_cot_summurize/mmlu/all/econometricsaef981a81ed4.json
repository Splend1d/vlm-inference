            "content": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n(i) The significance level is equal to the size of the test.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The significance level is a threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, not the size of the test. The size of the test is determined by the sample size and the effect size.\n\n(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The significance level is a threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, not the power of the test. The power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n\n(iii) 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.\n\nThis statement is correct. For a 2-sided test with a significance level of 5%, the rejection regions are located in the tails of the distribution. Since the significance level is 5%, the rejection regions will contain 2.5% of the total distribution in each tail.\n\n(iv) 5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The rejection regions are located in the tails of the distribution, not the center. The rejection regions will contain 2.5% of the total distribution in each tail, not 5%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. (i) and (iii) only.",
