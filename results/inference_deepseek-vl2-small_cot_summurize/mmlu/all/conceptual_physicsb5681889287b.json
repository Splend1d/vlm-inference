This is a fundamental principle of buoyancy, which states that the weight of the fluid displaced by an object is equal to the weight of the object. This is why objects that are submerged in water will float.\n\nB. **Volume of fluid**: The volume of fluid displaced by an object is equal to the volume of the object. This is another principle of buoyancy. When an object is submerged, it pushes the water out of the way, and the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the object.\n\nC. **Density of fluid**: The density of the fluid does not directly determine the weight of the fluid displaced or the volume of the fluid displaced. Density is a measure of mass per unit volume and does not directly relate to the displacement of fluid.\n\nD. **All of these**: Since options A and B are correct, option D is also correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
