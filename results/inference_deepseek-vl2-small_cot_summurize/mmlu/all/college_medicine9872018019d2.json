MERRF results from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production. When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, which of the following best predicts the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring?\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected\nB. All males and no females will be affected\nC. Half of males and half of females will be affected\nD. One-fourth of the offspring will be affected\n",

            "content": "To determine the expected phenotypic ratio of MERRF in offspring, we need to understand the genetic basis of the disorder. MERRF is caused by mutations in the mtDNA, which affects the mitochondria's ability to produce energy. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning that the gene responsible for the mutation is located on the X chromosome.\n\n1. **Understanding X-linked Recessive Inheritance**: In X-linked recessive disorders, the gene is located on the X chromosome. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. A male will express the disorder if he inherits the mutated X chromosome from his mother. Females, having two X chromosomes, will express the disorder if she inherits two mutated X chromosomes, one from each parent.\n\n2. **Predicting the Phenotypic Ratio**:\n   - **Males**: Since males have only one X chromosome, they will express the disorder if they inherit the mutated X chromosome from their mother. Therefore, all males will be affected.\n   - **Females**: Females have two X chromosomes. They will express the disorder if they inherit two mutated X chromosomes, one from each parent. Thus, half of the females will be affected.\n\n3. **Calculating the Expected Phenotypic Ratio**:\n   - **Affected Males**: All males will be affected.\n   - **Affected Females**: Half of the females will be affected.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio of MERRF in offspring is 100% affected males and 50% affected females.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. All males and no females will be affected**.",
