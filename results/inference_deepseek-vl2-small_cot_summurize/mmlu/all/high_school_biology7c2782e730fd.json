The diseases are caused by viruses.\n- Zika fever is caused by the Zika virus, West Nile fever by the West Nile virus, and malaria by various Plasmodium species. All these diseases are indeed caused by viruses.\n\nB. The diseases occur only in individuals who visit or live in tropical countries.\n- While Zika fever and West Nile fever are more prevalent in tropical regions, malaria is found in a wide range of climates, including tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Therefore, this statement is not universally true for all three diseases.\n\nC. The pathogens that cause the diseases have developed resistance to antibiotics.\n- None of the pathogens causing Zika fever, West Nile fever, or malaria have developed resistance to antibiotics. These diseases are caused by viruses, not bacteria, and thus are not susceptible to antibiotic treatment.\n\nD. The pathogens that cause the diseases are primarily transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.\n- Zika fever, West Nile fever, and malaria are all transmitted by mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector for Zika and West Nile fever, while the Anopheles mosquito is the vector for malaria.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the property that is shared by Zika fever, West Nile fever, and malaria is:\n\nD. The pathogens that cause the diseases are primarily transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.",
