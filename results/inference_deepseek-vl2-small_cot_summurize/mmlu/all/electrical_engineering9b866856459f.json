Loop gain should be unity: This is incorrect. The loop gain should not be unity. If the loop gain is unity, the circuit would not be able to sustain oscillations because the feedback signal would cancel out the input signal.\n\nB. Loop gain should be less than unity: This is correct. The loop gain should be less than unity to ensure that the feedback signal is not strong enough to cancel out the input signal. This allows the circuit to sustain oscillations.\n\nC. The phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0: This is incorrect. The phase of the feedback signal should not be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. If the phase is 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0, the feedback signal will cancel out the input signal, and the circuit will not be able to sustain oscillations.\n\nD. Both A and C: This is incorrect. As explained above, both options A and C are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Loop gain should be less than unity.",
