            "content": "To determine which procedures minimize the influence of random errors on measured results, let's analyze each option:\n\nI. **Signal averaging**: This involves taking multiple measurements of the same signal and averaging them. By averaging, the random errors in each individual measurement are reduced, as the errors tend to cancel each other out. This method is particularly effective in reducing the impact of random errors, making it a common practice in scientific measurements.\n\nII. **Use of internal standards**: Internal standards are used to correct for systematic errors in a measurement. They are typically added in a known quantity to the sample being measured. This method helps to minimize the influence of random errors by providing a reference point that is consistent and known, allowing for the correction of any systematic deviations.\n\nIII. **Averaging the results from multiple samples**: Similar to signal averaging, averaging the results from multiple samples reduces the impact of random errors. Each sample's measurement is averaged, and the errors in each sample tend to cancel out, leading to a more accurate and reliable result.\n\nGiven this analysis, all three procedures\u2014signal averaging, use of internal standards, and averaging the results from multiple samples\u2014are effective in minimizing the influence of random errors on measured results.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
