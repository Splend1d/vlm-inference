            "content": "The correct answer is C. radioactivity.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe internal energy of the Earth is primarily generated by radioactive decay. This process involves the transformation of unstable atomic nuclei into more stable ones, releasing energy in the form of heat. This heat is then transferred to the Earth's mantle and core, contributing to the planet's internal energy.\n\nTidal friction (A) is the energy generated by the gravitational forces between the Earth and the Moon, which cause the tides. However, this is not the primary source of Earth's internal energy.\n\nGravitational pressure (B) is the force exerted by the weight of the Earth's mass on its surface. While this pressure contributes to the planet's internal energy, it is not the primary source.\n\nGeothermal heat (D) is the heat generated by the Earth's interior, which is primarily due to radioactive decay. However, geothermal heat is a result of the heat generated by radioactive decay, rather than the primary source.\n\nTherefore, the principal source of Earth's internal energy is radioactivity (C).",
