            "content": "To determine the effect of a black hole replacing the Sun, we need to consider the concept of a Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the event horizon of a black hole, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. It is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ r_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the black hole, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole is 3,000 meters, we can calculate the mass of the black hole using the formula:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{r_s^2 c^2}{2G} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{(3,000)^2 \\times (3 \\times 10^8)^2}{2 \\times 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 3 \\times 10^8} \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{9,000,000 \\times 9 \\times 10^{16}}{2 \\times 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 3 \\times 10^8} \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{81,000,000,000,000}{2 \\times 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 3 \\times 10^8} \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{81,000,000,000,000}{4.0044 \\times 10^{17}} \\]\n\n\\[ M \\approx 20,225,000,000,000 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nThis mass is significantly larger than the mass of the Sun, which is approximately \\( 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect on the orbits of the planets:\n\n- **Option A**: The planets would move directly toward the black hole. This is incorrect because the gravitational pull of the black hole would be so strong that it would not allow the planets to move directly toward it. Instead, the planets would be pulled into the black hole.\n\n- **Option B**: The planets would move in spiral orbits. This is incorrect because the strong gravitational pull of the black hole would cause the planets to spiral inward, not outward.\n\n- **Option C**: The planets would oscillate about their former elliptical orbits. This is incorrect because the strong gravitational pull of the black hole would cause the planets to spiral inward and eventually be pulled into the black hole, not oscillate about their orbits.\n\n- **Option D**: The orbits would remain unchanged. This is incorrect because the presence of a black hole would significantly alter the gravitational dynamics of the solar system, causing the planets to spiral inward and potentially be captured by the black hole.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The orbits would remain unchanged.",
