Delegates to presidential nomination conventions are typically members of the major political parties, such as the Democratic or Republican Party. They are committed to supporting their party's nominee and are less likely to switch to third-party candidates.\n\nB. The majority of the general population is more educated than the delegates.\n- This statement is incorrect.

Delegates typically have little interest in politics.\n- This statement is incorrect. Delegates are usually deeply involved in politics, representing their party at the national level.
